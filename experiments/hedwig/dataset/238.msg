Title: Very simple statistical evidence that AlphaGo has exceeded human limits
  in playing GO game
Authors: Okyu Kwon
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Deep learning technology is making great progress in solving the challenging
problems of artificial intelligence, hence machine learning based on artificial
neural networks is in the spotlight again. In some areas, artificial
intelligence based on deep learning is beyond human capabilities. It seemed
extremely difficult for a machine to beat a human in a Go game, but AlphaGo has
shown to beat a professional player in the game. By looking at the statistical
distribution of the distance in which the Go stones are laid in succession, we
find a clear trace that Alphago has surpassed human abilities. The AlphaGo than
professional players and professional players than ordinary players shows the
laying of stones in the distance becomes more frequent. In addition, AlphaGo
shows a much more pronounced difference than that of ordinary players and
professional players.

  The ability to create artificial intelligence (AI) capable of performing
complex tasks is rapidly outpacing our ability to ensure the safe and assured
operation of AI-enabled systems. Fortunately, a landscape of AI safety research
is emerging in response to this asymmetry and yet there is a long way to go. In
particular, recent simulation environments created to illustrate AI safety
risks are relatively simple or narrowly-focused on a particular issue. Hence,
we see a critical need for AI safety research environments that abstract
essential aspects of complex real-world applications. In this work, we
introduce the AI safety TanksWorld as an environment for AI safety research
with three essential aspects: competing performance objectives, human-machine
teaming, and multi-agent competition. The AI safety TanksWorld aims to
accelerate the advancement of safe multi-agent decision-making algorithms by
providing a software framework to support competitions with both system
performance and safety objectives. As a work in progress, this paper introduces
our research objectives and learning environment with reference code and
baseline performance metrics to follow in a future work.

Title: Behavior Cloning in OpenAI using Case Based Reasoning
Authors: Chad Peters, Babak Esfandiari, Mohamad Zalat and Robert West
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Learning from Observation (LfO), also known as Behavioral Cloning, is an
approach for building software agents by recording the behavior of an expert
(human or artificial) and using the recorded data to generate the required
behavior. jLOAF is a platform that uses Case-Based Reasoning to achieve LfO. In
this paper we interface jLOAF with the popular OpenAI Gym environment. Our
experimental results show how our approach can be used to provide a baseline
for comparison in this domain, as well as identify the strengths and weaknesses
when dealing with environmental complexity.

Title: A neural network model of perception and reasoning
Authors: Paul J. Blazek, Milo M. Lin
Categories: cs.AI cs.NE q-bio.NC
\\
  How perception and reasoning arise from neuronal network activity is poorly
understood. This is reflected in the fundamental limitations of connectionist
artificial intelligence, typified by deep neural networks trained via
gradient-based optimization. Despite success on many tasks, such networks
remain unexplainable black boxes incapable of symbolic reasoning and concept
generalization. Here we show that a simple set of biologically consistent
organizing principles confer these capabilities to neuronal networks. To
demonstrate, we implement these principles in a novel machine learning
algorithm, based on concept construction instead of optimization, to design
deep neural networks that reason with explainable neuron activity. On a range
of tasks including NP-hard problems, their reasoning capabilities grant
additional cognitive functions, like deliberating through self-analysis,
tolerating adversarial attacks, and learning transferable rules from simple
examples to solve problems of unencountered complexity. The networks also
naturally display properties of biological nervous systems inherently absent in
current deep neural networks, including sparsity, modularity, and both
distributed and localized firing patterns. Because they do not sacrifice
performance, compactness, or training time on standard learning tasks, these
networks provide a new black-box-free approach to artificial intelligence. They
likewise serve as a quantitative framework to understand the emergence of
cognition from neuronal networks.

  This paper will discuss the role of an artificially-intelligent computer
system as critique-based, implicit-organizational, and an inherently necessary
device, deployed in synchrony with parallel governmental policy, as a genuine
means of capturing nation-population complexity in quantitative form, public
contentment in societal-cooperative economic groups, regulatory proposition,
and governance-effectiveness domains. It will discuss a solution involving a
well-known algorithm and proffer an improved mechanism for

influence (in terms of differentiating class sectors) and operational
efficiency. It will finish with a discussion of these and other historical
implications.

Title: Wavelet-based Temporal Forecasting Models of Human Activities for
  Anomaly Detection
Authors: Manuel Fernandez-Carmona, Nicola Bellotto
Categories: cs.AI
MSC-class: 68T10
\\
  This paper presents a novel approach for temporal modelling of long-term
human activities based on wavelet transforms. The model is applied to binary
smart-home sensors to forecast their signals, which are used then as temporal
priors to infer anomalies in office and Active & Assisted Living (AAL)
scenarios. Such inference is performed by a new extension of Hybrid Markov
Logic Networks (HMLNs) that merges different anomaly indicators, including
activity levels detected by sensors, expert rules and the new temporal models.
The latter in particular allow the inference system to discover deviations from
long-term activity patterns, which cannot by detected by simpler
frequency-based models. Two new publicly available datasets were collected
using several smart-sensors to evaluate the wavelet-based temporal models and
their application to signal forecasting and anomaly detection. The experimental
results show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and their successful
application to detect unexpected activities in office and AAL settings.

Title: A Simulation Model Demonstrating the Impact of Social Aspects on Social
  Internet of Things
Authors: Kashif Zia
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA cs.SI
Comments: 22 pages, 11 figures, 1 table. Presented in The 21st International
  Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services
  (iiWAS2019), 2-4 December 2019, Munich Germany
\\
  In addition to seamless connectivity and smartness, the objects in the
Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to have the social capabilities -- these
objects are termed as ``social objects''. In this paper, an intuitive paradigm
of social interactions between these objects are argued and modeled. The impact
of social behavior on the interaction pattern of social objects is studied
taking Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resource sharing as an example application. The model
proposed in this paper studies the implications of competitive vs. cooperative
social paradigm, while peers attempt to attain the shared resources / services.
The simulation results divulge that the social capabilities of the peers impart
a significant increase in the quality of interactions between social objects.
Through an agent-based simulation study, it is proved that cooperative strategy
is more efficient than competitive strategy. Moreover, cooperation with an
underpinning on real-life networking structure and mobility does not negatively
impact the efficiency of the system at all; rather it helps.

Title: Arc-Consistency computes the minimal binarised domains of an STP. Use of
  the result in a TCSP solver, in a TCSP-based job shop scheduler, and in
  generalising Dijkstra's one-to-all algorithm
Authors: Amar Isli
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: See the footnote on the first page of the paper
\\
  TCSPs (Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problems), as defined in [Dechter et
al., 1991], get rid of unary constraints by binarising them after having added
an "origin of the world" variable. The constraints are therefore exclusively
binary; additionally, a TCSP verifies the property that it is node-consistent
and arc-consistent. Path-consistency, the next higher local consistency, solves
the consistency problem of a convex TCSP, referred to in [Dechter et al., 1991]
as an STP (Simple Temporal Problem); more than that, the output of
path-consistency applied to an n+1-variable STP is a minimal and strongly
n+1-consistent STP. Weaker versions of path-consistency, aimed at avoiding what
is referred to in [Schwalb and Dechter, 1997] as the "fragmentation problem",
are used as filtering procedures in recursive backtracking algorithms for the
consistency problem of a general TCSP. In this work, we look at the constraints
between the "origin of the world" variable and the other variables, as the
(binarised) domains of these other variables. With this in mind, we define a
notion of arc-consistency for TCSPs, which we will refer to as
binarised-domains Arc-Consistency, or bdArc-Consistency for short. We provide
an algorithm achieving bdArc-Consistency for a TCSP, which we will refer to as
bdAC3, for it is an adaptation of Mackworth's [1977] well-known arc-consistency
algorithm AC3. We show that bdArc-Consistency computes the minimal (binarised)
domains of an STP. We then show how to use the result in a general TCSP solver,
in a TCSP-based job shop scheduler, and in generalising the well-known
Dijkstra's one-to-all shortest paths algorithm.

Title: Sim2Real Transfer for Reinforcement Learning without Dynamics
  Randomization
Authors: Manuel Kaspar, Juan David Munoz Osorio, J\"urgen Bock
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  In this work we show how to use the Operational Space Control framework (OSC)
under joint and cartesian constraints for reinforcement learning in cartesian
space. Our method is therefore able to learn fast and with adjustable degrees
of freedom, while we are able to transfer policies without additional dynamics
randomizations on a KUKA LBR iiwa peg in-hole task. Before learning in
simulation starts, we perform a system identification for aligning the
simulation environment as far as possible with the dynamics of a real robot.
Adding constraints to the OSC controller allows us to learn in a safe way on
the real robot or to learn a flexible, goal conditioned policy that can be
easily transferred from simulation to the real robot.

Title: LORAX: Loss-Aware Approximations for Energy-Efficient Silicon Photonic
  Networks-on-Chip
Authors: Febin Sunny, Asif Mirza, Ishan Thakkar, Sudeep Pasricha and Nikdast
  Mahdi
Categories: cs.AR
Comments: Submitted and accepted at GLSVLSI 2020
\\
  The approximate computing paradigm advocates for relaxing accuracy goals in
applications to improve energy-efficiency and performance. Recently, this
paradigm has been explored to improve the energy efficiency of silicon photonic
networks-on-chip (PNoCs). In this paper, we propose a novel framework (LORAX)
to enable more aggressive approximation during communication over silicon
photonic links in PNoCs. Given that silicon photonic interconnects have
significant power dissipation due to the laser sources that generate the
wavelengths for photonic communication, our framework attempts to reduce laser
power overheads while intelligently approximating communication such that
application output quality is not distorted beyond an acceptable limit. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers loss-aware laser
power management and multilevel signaling to enable effective data
approximation and energy-efficiency in PNoCs. Simulation results show that our
framework can achieve up to 31.4% lower laser power consumption and up to 12.2%
better energy efficiency than the best known prior work on approximate
communication with silicon photonic interconnects, for the same application
output quality

Title: Consenus-Halving: Does it Ever Get Easier?
Authors: Aris Filos-Ratsikas, Alexandros Hollender, Katerina Sotiraki, Manolis
  Zampetakis
Categories: cs.CC cs.GT
Comments: 38 pages, 8 figures
\\
  In the $\varepsilon$-Consensus-Halving problem, a fundamental problem in fair
division, there are $n$ agents with valuations over the interval $[0,1]$, and
the goal is to divide the interval into pieces and assign a label "$+$" or
"$-$" to each piece, such that every agent values the total amount of "$+$" and
the total amount of "$-$" almost equally. The problem was recently proven by
Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [2019] to be the first "natural" complete problem
for the computational class PPA, answering a decade-old open question.
  In this paper, we examine the extent to which the problem becomes easy to
solve, if one restricts the class of valuation functions. To this end, we
provide the following contributions. First, we obtain a strengthening of the
PPA-hardness result of [Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg 2019], to the case when
agents have piecewise uniform valuations with only two blocks. We obtain this
result via a new reduction, which is in fact conceptually much simpler than the
corresponding one in [Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg 2019]. Then, we consider the
case of single-block (uniform) valuations and provide a parameterized
polynomial time algorithm for solving $\varepsilon$-Consensus-Halving for any
$\varepsilon$, as well as a polynomial-time algorithm for $\varepsilon=1/2$;
these are the first algorithmic results for the problem. Finally, an important
application of our new techniques is the first hardness result for a
generalization of Consensus-Halving, the Consensus-$1/k$-Division problem. In
particular, we prove that $\varepsilon$-Consensus-$1/3$-Division is PPAD-hard.

  Geometric complexity theory (GCT) is an approach towards separating algebraic
complexity classes through algebraic geometry and representation theory.
Originally Mulmuley and Sohoni proposed (SIAM J Comput 2001, 2008) to use
occurrence obstructions to prove Valiant's determinant vs permanent conjecture,
but recently B\"urgisser, Ikenmeyer, and Panova (Journal of the AMS 2019)
proved this impossible. However, fundamental theorems of algebraic geometry and
representation theory grant that every lower bound in GCT can be proved by the
use of so-called highest weight vectors (HWVs). In the setting of interest in
GCT (namely in the setting of polynomials) we prove the NP-hardness of the
evaluation of HWVs in general, and we give efficient algorithms if the
treewidth of the corresponding Young-diagram is small, where the point of
evaluation is concisely encoded as a noncommutative algebraic branching
program! In particular, this gives a large new class of separating functions
that can be efficiently evaluated at points with low (border) Waring rank.

  Noncentrosymmetric materials play a critical role in many important
applications such as laser technology, communication systems,quantum computing,
cybersecurity, and etc. However, the experimental discovery of new
noncentrosymmetric materials is extremely difficult. Here we present a machine
learning model that could predict whether the composition of a potential
crystalline structure would be centrosymmetric or not. By evaluating a diverse
set of composition features calculated using matminer featurizer package
coupled with different machine learning algorithms, we find that Random Forest
Classifiers give the best performance for noncentrosymmetric material
prediction, reaching an accuracy of 84.8% when evaluated with 10 fold
cross-validation on the dataset with 82,506 samples extracted from Materials
Project. A random forest model trained with materials with only 3 elements
gives even higher accuracy of 86.9%. We apply our ML model to screen potential
noncentrosymmetric materials from 2,000,000 hypothetical materials generated by
our inverse design engine and report the top 20 candidate noncentrosymmetric
materials with 2 to 4 elements and top 20 borate candidates

  Signaling pathways are responsible for the regulation of cell processes, such
as monitoring the external environment, transmitting information across
membranes, and making cell fate decisions. Given the increasing amount of
biological data available and the recent discoveries showing that many diseases
are related to the disruption of cellular signal transduction cascades, in
silico discovery of signaling pathways in cell biology has become an active
research topic in past years. However, reconstruction of signaling pathways
remains a challenge mainly because of the need for systematic approaches for
predicting causal relationships, like edge direction and activation/inhibition
among interacting proteins in the signal flow. We propose an approach for
predicting signaling pathways that integrates protein interactions, gene
expression, phenotypes, and protein complex information. Our method first finds
candidate pathways using a directed-edge-based algorithm and then defines a
graph model to include causal activation relationships among proteins, in
candidate pathways using cell cycle gene expression and phenotypes to infer
consistent pathways in yeast. Then, we incorporate protein complex coverage
information for deciding on the final predicted signaling pathways. We show
that our approach improves the predictive results of the state of the art using
different ranking metrics.

Title: Voronoi-based similarity distances between arbitrary crystal lattices
Authors: Marco Michele Mosca, Dr. Vitaliy Kurlin
Categories: cs.CG physics.comp-ph
Comments: Paper accepted in Crystal Research and Technology Journal
\\
  This paper develops a new continuous approach to a similarity between
periodic lattices of ideal crystals. Quantifying a similarity between crystal
structures is needed to substantially speed up the Crystal Structure
Prediction, because the prediction of many target properties of crystal
structures is computationally slow and is essentially repeated for many nearly
identical simulated structures. The proposed distances between arbitrary
periodic lattices of crystal structures are invariant under all rigid motions,
satisfy the metric axioms and continuity under atomic perturbations. The above
properties make these distances ideal tools for clustering and visualizing
large datasets of crystal structures. All the conclusions are rigorously proved
and justified by experiments on real and simulated crystal structures reported
in the Nature 2017 paper "Functional materials discovery using
energy-structure-function maps".

Title: End-to-End Entity Linking and Disambiguation leveraging Word and
  Knowledge Graph Embeddings
Authors: Rostislav Nedelchev, Debanjan Chaudhuri, Jens Lehmann and Asja Fischer
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Entity linking - connecting entity mentions in a natural language utterance
to knowledge graph (KG) entities is a crucial step for question answering over
KGs. It is often based on measuring the string similarity between the entity
label and its mention in the question. The relation referred to in the question
can help to disambiguate between entities with the same label. This can be
misleading if an incorrect relation has been identified in the relation linking
step. However, an incorrect relation may still be semantically similar to the
relation in which the correct entity forms a triple within the KG; which could
be captured by the similarity of their KG embeddings. Based on this idea, we
propose the first end-to-end neural network approach that employs KG as well as
word embeddings to perform joint relation and entity classification of simple
questions while implicitly performing entity disambiguation with the help of a

  Voice recognition is an area with a wide application potential. Speaker
identification is useful in several voice recognition tasks, as seen in
voice-based authentication, transcription systems and intelligent personal
assistants. Some tasks benefit from open-set models which can handle new
speakers without the need of retraining. Audio embeddings for speaker
identification is a proposal to solve this issue. However, choosing a suitable
model is a difficult task, especially when the training resources are scarce.
Besides, it is not always clear whether embeddings are as good as more
traditional methods. In this work, we propose the Speech2Phone and compare
several embedding models for open-set speaker identification, as well as
traditional closed-set models. The models were investigated in the scenario of
small datasets, which makes them more applicable to languages in which data
scarceness is an issue. The results show that embeddings generated by
artificial neural networks are competitive when compared to classical
approaches for the task. Considering a testing dataset composed of 20 speakers,
the best models reach accuracies of 100% and 76.96% for closed an open set
scenarios, respectively. Results suggest that the models can perform language
independent speaker identification. Among the tested models, a fully connected
one, here presented as Speech2Phone, led to the higher accuracy. Furthermore,
the models were tested for different languages showing that the knowledge
learned was successfully transferred for close and distant languages to
Portuguese (in terms of vocabulary). Finally, the models can scale and can
handle more speakers than they were trained for, identifying 150% more speakers
while still maintaining 55% accuracy.

  applied research work conducted at Dailyhunt
\\
  For a news content distribution platform like Dailyhunt, Named Entity
Recognition is a pivotal task for building better user recommendation and
notification algorithms. Apart from identifying names, locations, organisations
from the news for 13+ Indian languages and use them in algorithms, we also need
to identify n-grams which do not necessarily fit in the definition of
Named-Entity, yet they are important. For example, "me too movement", "beef
ban", "alwar mob lynching". In this exercise, given an English language text,
we are trying to detect case-less n-grams which convey important information
and can be used as topics and/or hashtags for a news. Model is built using
Wikipedia titles data, private English news corpus and BERT-Multilingual
pre-trained model, Bi-GRU and CRF architecture. It shows promising results when
compared with industry best Flair, Spacy and Stanford-caseless-NER in terms of
F1 and especially Recall.

  Discriminating lexical relations among distributionally similar words has
always been a challenge for natural language processing (NLP) community. In
this paper, we investigate whether the network embedding of distributional
thesaurus can be effectively utilized to detect co-hyponymy relations. By
extensive experiments over three benchmark datasets, we show that the vector
representation obtained by applying node2vec on distributional thesaurus
outperforms the state-of-the-art models for binary classification of
co-hyponymy vs. hypernymy, as well as co-hyponymy vs. meronymy, by huge
margins.

  There have been very few attempts to benchmark performances of
state-of-the-art algorithms for Neural Machine Translation task on Indian
Languages. Google, Bing, Facebook and Yandex are some of the very few companies
which have built translation systems for few of the Indian Languages. Among
them, translation results from Google are supposed to be better, based on
general inspection. Bing-Translator do not even support Marathi language which
has around 95 million speakers and ranks 15th in the world in terms of combined
primary and secondary speakers. In this exercise, we trained and compared
variety of Neural Machine Marathi to English Translators trained with
BERT-tokenizer by huggingface and various Transformer based architectures using
Facebook's Fairseq platform with limited but almost correct parallel corpus to
achieve better BLEU scores than Google on Tatoeba and Wikimedia open datasets.

  A large number of crypto accelerators are being deployed with the widespread
adoption of IoT. It is vitally important that these accelerators and other
security hardware IPs are provably secure. Security is an extra functional
requirement and hence many security verification tools are not mature. We
propose an approach/flow-PASCAL-that works on RTL designs and discovers
potential Timing Side-Channel Attack(SCA) vulnerabilities in them. Based on
information flow analysis, this is able to identify Timing Disparate Security
Paths that could lead to information leakage. This flow also (automatically)
eliminates the information leakage caused by the timing channel. The insertion
of a lightweight Compensator Block as balancing or compliance FSM removes the
timing channel with minimum modifications to the design with no impact on the
clock cycle time or combinational delay of the critical path in the circuit.

Title: Peripheral-free Device Pairing by Randomly Switching Power
Authors: Zhijian Shao, Jian Weng, Yue Zhang, Yongdong Wu, Ming Li, Jiasi Weng,

Categories: cs.CR
\\
  The popularity of Internet-of-Things (IoT) comes with security concerns.
Attacks against wireless communication venues of IoT (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle
attacks) have grown at an alarming rate over the past decade. Pairing, which
allows the establishment of the secure communicating channels for IoT devices
without a prior relationship, is thus a paramount capability. Existing secure
pairing protocols require auxiliary equipment/peripheral (e.g., displays,
speakers and sensors) to achieve authentication, which is unacceptable for
low-priced devices such as smart lamps. This paper studies how to design a
peripheral-free secure pairing protocol. Concretely, we design the protocol,
termed SwitchPairing, via out-of-box power supplying chargers and on-board
clocks, achieving security and economics at the same time. When a user wants to
pair two or more devices, he/she connects the pairing devices to the same power
source, and presses/releases the switch on/off button several times. Then, the
press and release timing can be used to derive symmetric keys. We implement a
prototype via two CC2640R2F development boards from Texas Instruments (TI) due
to its prevalence. Extensive experiments and user studies are also conducted to
benchmark our protocol in terms of efficiency and security.

Title: Improved Extension Protocols for Byzantine Broadcast and Agreement
Authors: Kartik Nayak, Ling Ren, Elaine Shi, Nitin H. Vaidya, Zhuolun Xiang
Categories: cs.CR cs.DC
\\
  Byzantine broadcast (BB) and Byzantine agreement (BA) are two most
fundamental problems and essential building blocks in distributed computing,
and improving their efficiency is of interest to both theoreticians and
practitioners. In this paper, we study extension protocols of BB and BA, i.e.,
protocols that solve BB/BA with long inputs of $l$ bits using lower costs than
$l$ single-bit instances. We present new protocols with improved communication
complexity in almost all settings: unauthenticated BA/BB with $t<n/3$,
authenticated BA/BB with $t<n/2$, authenticated BB with $t<(1-\epsilon)n$, and
asynchronous reliable broadcast and BA with $t<n/3$. The new protocols are
advantageous and significant in several aspects. First, they achieve the
best-possible communication complexity of $\Theta(nl)$ for wider ranges of
input sizes compared to prior results. Second, the authenticated extension
protocols achieve optimal communication complexity given the best available
BB/BA protocols for short messages. Third, to the best of our knowledge, our
asynchronous and authenticated protocols in the setting are the first extension
protocols in that setting.

Title: On the Effectiveness of Mitigating Data Poisoning Attacks with Gradient
  Shaping
Authors: Sanghyun Hong, Varun Chandrasekaran, Yi\u{g}itcan Kaya, Tudor
  Dumitra\c{s}, Nicolas Papernot
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Prior
taxonomies that focus on specific scenarios, e.g., indiscriminate or targeted,
have enabled defenses for the corresponding subset of known attacks. Yet, this
introduces an inevitable arms race between adversaries and defenders. In this
work, we study the feasibility of an attack-agnostic defense relying on
artifacts that are common to all poisoning attacks. Specifically, we focus on a
common element between all attacks: they modify gradients computed to train the
model. We identify two main artifacts of gradients computed in the presence of
poison: (1) their $\ell_2$ norms have significantly higher magnitudes than
those of clean gradients, and (2) their orientation differs from clean
gradients. Based on these observations, we propose the prerequisite for a
generic poisoning defense: it must bound gradient magnitudes and minimize
differences in orientation. We call this gradient shaping. As an exemplar tool
to evaluate the feasibility of gradient shaping, we use differentially private
stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), which clips and perturbs individual
gradients during training to obtain privacy guarantees. We find that DP-SGD,
even in configurations that do not result in meaningful privacy guarantees,
increases the model's robustness to indiscriminate attacks. It also mitigates
worst-case targeted attacks and increases the adversary's cost in multi-poison
scenarios. The only attack we find DP-SGD to be ineffective against is a
strong, yet unrealistic, indiscriminate attack. Our results suggest that, while
we currently lack a generic poisoning defense, gradient shaping is a promising
direction for future research.

Title: IoT Device Identification Using Deep Learning
Authors: Jaidip Kotak and Yuval Elovici
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG cs.NI eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  The growing use of IoT devices in organizations has increased the number of
attack vectors available to attackers due to the less secure nature of the
devices. The widely adopted bring your own device (BYOD) policy which allows an
employee to bring any IoT device into the workplace and attach it to an
organization's network also increases the risk of attacks. In order to address
this threat, organizations often implement security policies in which only the
connection of white-listed IoT devices is permitted. To monitor adherence to
such policies and protect their networks, organizations must be able to
identify the IoT devices connected to their networks and, more specifically, to
identify connected IoT devices that are not on the white-list (unknown
devices). In this study, we applied deep learning on network traffic to
automatically identify IoT devices connected to the network. In contrast to
previous work, our approach does not require that complex feature engineering
be applied on the network traffic, since we represent the communication
behavior of IoT devices using small images built from the IoT devices network
traffic payloads. In our experiments, we trained a multiclass classifier on a
publicly available dataset, successfully identifying 10 different IoT devices
and the traffic of smartphones and computers, with over 99% accuracy. We also
trained multiclass classifiers to detect unauthorized IoT devices connected to
the network, achieving over 99% overall average detection accuracy.

  Different transforms used in binding a secret key to correlated
physical-identifier outputs are compared. Decorrelation efficiency is the
metric used to determine transforms that give highly-uncorrelated outputs.
Scalar quantizers are applied to transform outputs to extract uniformly
distributed bit sequences to which secret keys are bound. A set of transforms
that perform well in terms of the decorrelation efficiency is applied to ring
oscillator (RO) outputs to improve the uniqueness and reliability of extracted
bit sequences, to reduce the hardware area and information leakage about the
key and RO outputs, and to maximize the secret-key length. Low-complexity
error-correction codes are proposed to illustrate two complete key-binding
systems with perfect secrecy, and better secret-key and privacy-leakage rates
than existing methods. A reference hardware implementation is also provided to
demonstrate that the transform-coding approach occupies a small hardware area.

Title: Unsupervised Semantic Attribute Discovery and Control in Generative
  Models
Authors: William Paul, I-Jeng Wang, Fady Alajaji, Philippe Burlina
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 10 figures, preprint
\\
  This work focuses on the ability to control via latent space factors semantic
image attributes in generative models, and the faculty to discover mappings
from factors to attributes in an unsupervised fashion. The discovery of
controllable semantic attributes is of special importance, as it would
facilitate higher level tasks such as unsupervised representation learning to
improve anomaly detection, or the controlled generation of novel data for
domain shift and imbalanced datasets. The ability to control semantic
attributes is related to the disentanglement of latent factors, which dictates
that latent factors be "uncorrelated" in their effects. Unfortunately, despite
past progress, the connection between control and disentanglement remains, at
best, confused and entangled, requiring clarifications we hope to provide in
this work. To this end, we study the design of algorithms for image generation
that allow unsupervised discovery and control of semantic attributes.We make
several contributions: a) We bring order to the concepts of control and
disentanglement, by providing an analytical derivation that connects mutual
information maximization, which promotes attribute control, to total
correlation minimization, which relates to disentanglement. b) We propose
hybrid generative model architectures that use mutual information maximization
with multi-scale style transfer. c) We introduce a novel metric to characterize
the performance of semantic attributes control. We report experiments that
appear to demonstrate, quantitatively and qualitatively, the ability of the
proposed model to perform satisfactory control while still preserving
competitive visual quality. We compare to other state of the art methods (e.g.,
Frechet inception distance (FID)= 9.90 on CelebA and 4.52 on EyePACS).

  We introduce geometric and topological methods to develop a new framework for

joint delay embedding, which reconstructs a high-dimensional state space in
which our sensors correspond to observation functions, and (2) a simple
orthogonalization scheme, which accounts for tangencies between such
observation functions, and produces a more diversified geometry on the
embedding space. We conclude with some synthetic and real-world experiments
demonstrating that our framework outperforms traditional metric fusion methods.

Title: Style Transfer for Light Field Photography
Authors: David Hart, Jessica Greenland, Bryan Morse
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To be presented at WACV 2020
\\
  As light field images continue to increase in use and application, it becomes
necessary to adapt existing image processing methods to this unique form of
photography. In this paper we explore methods for applying neural style
transfer to light field images. Feed-forward style transfer networks provide
fast, high-quality results for monocular images, but no such networks exist for
full light field images. Because of the size of these images, current light
field data sets are small and are insufficient for training purely feed-forward
style-transfer networks from scratch. Thus, it is necessary to adapt existing
monocular style transfer networks in a way that allows for the stylization of
each view of the light field while maintaining visual consistencies between
views. Instead, the proposed method backpropagates the loss through the
network, and the process is iterated to optimize (essentially overfit) the
resulting stylization for a single light field image alone. The network
architecture allows for the incorporation of pre-trained fast monocular
stylization networks while avoiding the need for a large light field training
set.

Title: Transfer Learning from Synthetic to Real-Noise Denoising with Adaptive
  Instance Normalization
Authors: Yoonsik Kim, Jae Woong Soh, Gu Yong Park, and Nam Ik Cho
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR accepted paper. The paper will be updated according to
  reviewers' comments
\\
  Real-noise denoising is a challenging task because the statistics of
real-noise do not follow the normal distribution, and they are also spatially
and temporally changing. In order to cope with various and complex real-noise,
we propose a well-generalized denoising architecture and a transfer learning
scheme. Specifically, we adopt an adaptive instance normalization to build a
denoiser, which can regularize the feature map and prevent the network from
overfitting to the training set. We also introduce a transfer learning scheme
that transfers knowledge learned from synthetic-noise data to the real-noise
denoiser. From the proposed transfer learning, the synthetic-noise denoiser can
learn general features from various synthetic-noise data, and the real-noise
denoiser can learn the real-noise characteristics from real data. From the
experiments, we find that the proposed denoising method has great
generalization ability, such that our network trained with synthetic-noise
achieves the best performance for Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND) among the
methods from published papers. We can also see that the proposed transfer
learning scheme robustly works for real-noise images through the learning with
a very small number of labeled data.

  In machine learning based single image super-resolution, the degradation
model is embedded in training data generation. However, most existing satellite
image super-resolution methods use a simple down-sampling model with a fixed
kernel to create training images. These methods work fine on synthetic data,
but do not perform well on real satellite images. We propose a realistic
training data generation model for commercial satellite imagery products, which
includes not only the imaging process on satellites but also the post-process
on the ground. We also propose a convolutional neural network optimized for
satellite images. Experiments show that the proposed training data generation
model is able to improve super-resolution performance on real satellite images.

Title: Multi-Attribute Guided Painting Generation
Authors: Minxuan Lin, Yingying Deng, Fan Tang, Weiming Dong, Changsheng Xu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Controllable painting generation plays a pivotal role in image stylization.
Currently, the control way of style transfer is subject to exemplar-based
reference or a random one-hot vector guidance. Few works focus on decoupling
the intrinsic properties of painting as control conditions, e.g., artist, genre
and period. Under this circumstance, we propose a novel framework adopting
multiple attributes from the painting to control the stylized results. An
asymmetrical cycle structure is equipped to preserve the fidelity, associating
with style preserving and attribute regression loss to keep the unique
distinction of colors and textures between domains. Several qualitative and
quantitative results demonstrate the effect of the combinations of multiple
attributes and achieve satisfactory performance.

Title: Learning Light Field Angular Super-Resolution via a Geometry-Aware
  Network
Authors: Jing Jin and Junhui Hou and Hui Yuan and Sam Kwong
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: This paper was accepted by AAAI 2020
\\
  The acquisition of light field images with high angular resolution is costly.
Although many methods have been proposed to improve the angular resolution of a
sparsely-sampled light field, they always focus on the light field with a small
baseline, which is captured by a consumer light field camera. By making full
use of the intrinsic \textit{geometry} information of light fields, in this
paper we propose an end-to-end learning-based approach aiming at angularly
super-resolving a sparsely-sampled light field with a large baseline. Our model
consists of two learnable modules and a physically-based module. Specifically,
it includes a depth estimation module for explicitly modeling the scene
geometry, a physically-based warping for novel views synthesis, and a light
field blending module specifically designed for light field reconstruction.
Moreover, we introduce a novel loss function to promote the preservation of the
light field parallax structure. Experimental results over various light field
datasets including large baseline light field images demonstrate the
significant superiority of our method when compared with state-of-the-art ones,
i.e., our method improves the PSNR of the second best method up to 2 dB in
average, while saves the execution time 48$\times$. In addition, our method
preserves the light field parallax structure better.

label information is sufficient. To resolve this issue, we propose the first
quantization-based semi-supervised hashing scheme: Generalized Product
Quantization (\textbf{GPQ}) network. We design a novel metric learning strategy
that preserves semantic similarity between labeled data, and employ entropy
regularization term to fully exploit inherent potentials of unlabeled data. Our
solution increases the generalization capacity of the hash function, which
allows overcoming previous limitations in the retrieval community. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that GPQ yields state-of-the-art performance
on large-scale real image benchmark datasets.

Title: Adversarial Ranking Attack and Defense
Authors: Mo Zhou, Zhenxing Niu, Le Wang, Qilin Zhang, Gang Hua
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attack,
where an imperceptible perturbation could result in misclassification. However,
the vulnerability of DNN-based image ranking systems remains under-explored. In
this paper, we propose two attacks against deep ranking systems, i.e.,
Candidate Attack and Query Attack, that can raise or lower the rank of chosen
candidates by adversarial perturbations. Specifically, the expected ranking
order is first represented as a set of inequalities, and then a triplet-like
objective function is designed to obtain the optimal perturbation. Conversely,
a defense method is also proposed to improve the ranking system robustness,
which can mitigate all the proposed attacks simultaneously. Our adversarial
ranking attacks and defense are evaluated on datasets including MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, and Stanford-Online-Products. Experimental results demonstrate
that a typical deep ranking system can be effectively compromised by our
attacks. Meanwhile, the system robustness can be moderately improved with our
defense. Furthermore, the transferable and universal properties of our
adversary illustrate the possibility of realistic black-box attack.

Title: Generalized ODIN: Detecting Out-of-distribution Image without Learning
  from Out-of-distribution Data
Authors: Yen-Chang Hsu, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Zsolt Kira
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: CVPR 2020
\\
  Deep neural networks have attained remarkable performance when applied to
data that comes from the same distribution as that of the training set, but can
significantly degrade otherwise. Therefore, detecting whether an example is
out-of-distribution (OoD) is crucial to enable a system that can reject such
samples or alert users. Recent works have made significant progress on OoD
benchmarks consisting of small image datasets. However, many recent methods
based on neural networks rely on training or tuning with both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution data. The latter is generally hard to define a-priori,
and its selection can easily bias the learning. We base our work on a popular
method ODIN, proposing two strategies for freeing it from the needs of tuning
with OoD data, while improving its OoD detection performance. We specifically
propose to decompose confidence scoring as well as a modified input
pre-processing method. We show that both of these significantly help in
detection performance. Our further analysis on a larger scale image dataset
shows that the two types of distribution shifts, specifically semantic shift
and non-semantic shift, present a significant difference in the difficulty of
the problem, providing an analysis of when ODIN-like strategies do or do not
work.

Title: Self-supervised Image Enhancement Network: Training with Low Light
  Images Only

\\
  This paper proposes a self-supervised low light image enhancement method
based on deep learning. Inspired by information entropy theory and Retinex
model, we proposed a maximum entropy based Retinex model. With this model, a
very simple network can separate the illumination and reflectance, and the
network can be trained with low light images only. We introduce a constraint
that the maximum channel of the reflectance conforms to the maximum channel of
the low light image and its entropy should be largest in our model to achieve
self-supervised learning. Our model is very simple and does not rely on any
well-designed data set (even one low light image can complete the training).
The network only needs minute-level training to achieve image enhancement. It
can be proved through experiments that the proposed method has reached the
state-of-the-art in terms of processing speed and effect.

Title: Refined Gate: A Simple and Effective Gating Mechanism for Recurrent
  Units
Authors: Zhanzhan Cheng, Yunlu Xu, Mingjian Cheng, Yu Qiao, Shiliang Pu, Yi Niu
  and Fei Wu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recurrent neural network (RNN) has been widely studied in sequence learning
tasks, while the mainstream models (e.g., LSTM and GRU) rely on the gating
mechanism (in control of how information flows between hidden states). However,
the vanilla gates in RNN (e.g. the input gate in LSTM) suffer from the problem
of gate undertraining mainly due to the saturating activation functions, which
may result in failures of learning gating roles and thus the weak performance.
In this paper, we propose a new gating mechanism within general gated recurrent
neural networks to handle this issue. Specifically, the proposed gates directly
short connect the extracted input features to the outputs of vanilla gates,
denoted as refined gates. The refining mechanism allows enhancing gradient
back-propagation as well as extending the gating activation scope, which,
although simple, can guide RNN to reach possibly deeper minima. We verify the
proposed gating mechanism on three popular types of gated RNNs including LSTM,
GRU and MGU. Extensive experiments on 3 synthetic tasks, 3 language modeling
tasks and 5 scene text recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

Title: Rethinking the Route Towards Weakly Supervised Object Localization
Authors: Chen-Lin Zhang, Yun-Hao Cao, Jianxin Wu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020
\\
  Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to localize objects with
only image-level labels. Previous methods often try to utilize feature maps and
classification weights to localize objects using image level annotations
indirectly. In this paper, we demonstrate that weakly supervised object
localization should be divided into two parts: class-agnostic object
localization and object classification. For class-agnostic object localization,
we should use class-agnostic methods to generate noisy pseudo annotations and
then perform bounding box regression on them without class labels. We propose
the pseudo supervised object localization (PSOL) method as a new way to solve
WSOL. Our PSOL models have good transferability across different datasets
without fine-tuning. With generated pseudo bounding boxes, we achieve 58.00%
localization accuracy on ImageNet and 74.74% localization accuracy on CUB-200,
which have a large edge over previous models.

\\
  Estimating the remaining surgery duration (RSD) during surgical procedures
can be useful for OR planning and anesthesia dose estimation. With the recent
success of deep learning-based methods in computer vision, several neural
network approaches have been proposed for fully automatic RSD prediction based
solely on visual data from the endoscopic camera. We investigate whether RSD
prediction can be improved using unsupervised temporal video segmentation as an
auxiliary learning task. As opposed to previous work, which presented
supervised surgical phase recognition as auxiliary task, we avoid the need for
manual annotations by proposing a similar but unsupervised learning objective
which clusters video sequences into temporally coherent segments. In multiple
experimental setups, results obtained by learning the auxiliary task are
incorporated into a deep RSD model through feature extraction, pretraining or
regularization. Further, we propose a novel loss function for RSD training
which attempts to counteract unfavorable characteristics of the RSD ground
truth. Using our unsupervised method as an auxiliary task for RSD training, we
outperform other self-supervised methods and are comparable to the supervised
state-of-the-art. Combined with the novel RSD loss, we slightly outperform the
supervised approach.

Title: PuzzleNet: Scene Text Detection by Segment Context Graph Learning
Authors: Hao Liu, Antai Guo, Deqiang Jiang, Yiqing Hu, Bo Ren
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recently, a series of decomposition-based scene text detection methods has
achieved impressive progress by decomposing challenging text regions into
pieces and linking them in a bottom-up manner. However, most of them merely
focus on linking independent text pieces while the context information is
underestimated. In the puzzle game, the solver often put pieces together in a
logical way according to the contextual information of each piece, in order to
arrive at the correct solution. Inspired by it, we propose a novel
decomposition-based method, termed Puzzle Networks (PuzzleNet), to address the
challenging scene text detection task in this work. PuzzleNet consists of the
Segment Proposal Network (SPN) that predicts the candidate text segments
fitting arbitrary shape of text region, and the two-branch Multiple-Similarity
Graph Convolutional Network (MSGCN) that models both appearance and geometry
correlations between each segment to its contextual ones. By building segments
as context graphs, MSGCN effectively employs segment context to predict
combinations of segments. Final detections of polygon shape are produced by
merging segments according to the predicted combinations. Evaluations on three
benchmark datasets, ICDAR15, MSRA-TD500 and SCUT-CTW1500, have demonstrated
that our method can achieve better or comparable performance than current
state-of-the-arts, which is beneficial from the exploitation of segment context
graph.

Title: Adversarial Attack on Deep Product Quantization Network for Image
  Retrieval
Authors: Yan Feng, Bin Chen, Tao Dai, Shutao Xia
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at AAAI20
\\
  Deep product quantization network (DPQN) has recently received much attention
in fast image retrieval tasks due to its efficiency of encoding
high-dimensional visual features especially when dealing with large-scale
datasets. Recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable
to input with small and maliciously designed perturbations (a.k.a., adversarial
examples). This phenomenon raises the concern of security issues for DPQN in
the testing/deploying stage as well. However, little effort has been devoted to
investigating how adversarial examples affect DPQN. To this end, we propose
product quantization adversarial generation (PQ-AG), a simple yet effective
method to generate adversarial examples for product quantization based
retrieval systems. PQ-AG aims to generate imperceptible adversarial
perturbations for query images to form adversarial queries, whose nearest
neighbors from a targeted product quantizaiton model are not semantically
related to those from the original queries. Extensive experiments show that our
PQ-AQ successfully creates adversarial examples to mislead targeted product
quantization retrieval models. Besides, we found that our PQ-AG significantly
degrades retrieval performance in both white-box and black-box settings.

Title: Controllable Descendant Face Synthesis
Authors: Yong Zhang, Le Li, Zhilei Liu, Baoyuan Wu, Yanbo Fan, Zhifeng Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Kinship face synthesis is an interesting topic raised to answer questions
like "what will your future children look like?". Published approaches to this
topic are limited. Most of the existing methods train models for one-versus-one
kin relation, which only consider one parent face and one child face by
directly using an auto-encoder without any explicit control over the
resemblance of the synthesized face to the parent face. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for controllable descendant face synthesis, which models
two-versus-one kin relation between two parent faces and one child face. Our
model consists of an inheritance module and an attribute enhancement module,
where the former is designed for accurate control over the resemblance between
the synthesized face and parent faces, and the latter is designed for control
over age and gender. As there is no large scale database with
father-mother-child kinship annotation, we propose an effective strategy to
train the model without using the ground truth descendant faces. No carefully
designed image pairs are required for learning except only age and gender
labels of training faces. We conduct comprehensive experimental evaluations on
three public benchmark databases, which demonstrates encouraging results.

\\
  Spine injections are commonly performed in several clinical procedures. The
localization of the target vertebral level (i.e. the position of a vertebra in
a spine) is typically done by back palpation or under X-ray guidance, yielding
either higher chances of procedure failure or exposure to ionizing radiation.
Preliminary studies have been conducted in the literature, suggesting that
ultrasound imaging may be a precise and safe alternative to X-ray for spine
level detection. However, ultrasound data are noisy and complicated to
interpret. In this study, a robotic-ultrasound approach for automatic vertebral
level detection is introduced. The method relies on the fusion of ultrasound
and force data, thus providing both "tactile" and visual feedback during the
procedure, which results in higher performances in presence of data corruption.
A robotic arm automatically scans the volunteer's back along the spine by using
force-ultrasound data to locate vertebral levels. The occurrences of vertebral
levels are visible on the force trace as peaks, which are enhanced by properly
controlling the force applied by the robot on the patient back. Ultrasound data
are processed with a Deep Learning method to extract a 1D signal modelling the
probabilities of having a vertebra at each location along the spine. Processed
force and ultrasound data are fused using a 1D Convolutional Network to compute
the location of the vertebral levels. The method is compared to pure image and
pure force-based methods for vertebral level counting, showing improved
performance. In particular, the fusion method is able to correctly classify
100% of the vertebral levels in the test set, while pure image and pure
force-based method could only classify 80% and 90% vertebrae, respectively. The
potential of the proposed method is evaluated in an exemplary simulated
clinical application.

Title: Disentangling Image Distortions in Deep Feature Space
Authors: Simone Bianco, Luigi Celona, Paolo Napoletano, and Raimondo Schettini
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Previous literature suggests that perceptual similarity is an emergent
property shared across deep visual representations. Experiments conducted on a
dataset of human-judged image distortions have proven that deep features
outperform, by a large margin, classic perceptual metrics. In this work we take
a further step in the direction of a broader understanding of such property by
analyzing the capability of deep visual representations to intrinsically
characterize different types of image distortions. To this end, we firstly
generate a number of synthetically distorted images by applying three
mainstream distortion types to the LIVE database and then we analyze the
features extracted by different layers of different Deep Network architectures.
We observe that a dimension-reduced representation of the features extracted
from a given layer permits to efficiently separate types of distortions in the
feature space. Moreover, each network layer exhibits a different ability to
separate between different types of distortions, and this ability varies
according to the network architecture. As a further analysis, we evaluate the
exploitation of features taken from the layer that better separates image
distortions for: i) reduced-reference image quality assessment, and ii)
distortion types and severity levels characterization on both single and
multiple distortion databases. Results achieved on both tasks suggest that deep
visual representations can be unsupervisedly employed to efficiently
characterize various image distortions.

  There have been many work in the literature on generation of various kinds of
images such as Hand-Written characters (MNIST dataset), scene images (CIFAR-10
dataset), various objects images (ImageNet dataset), road signboard images
(SVHN dataset) etc. Unfortunately, there have been very limited amount of work

amount of labeled data. Various kinds of Deep generative models can be
primarily divided into two categories. First category is auto-encoder (AE) and
the second one is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this paper, we
have evaluated various kinds of AE as well as GANs and have compared their
performances on hand-written digits dataset (MNIST) and also on historical
hand-written character dataset of Indonesian BALI language. Moreover, these
generated characters are recognized by using character recognition tool for
calculating the statistical performance of these generated characters with
respect to original character images.

  Deformable registration is one of the most challenging task in the field of
medical image analysis, especially for the alignment between different
sequences and modalities. In this paper, a non-rigid registration method is
proposed for 3D medical images leveraging unsupervised learning. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce gradient loss into
deep-learning-based registration. The proposed gradient loss is robust across
sequences and modals for large deformation. Besides, adversarial learning
approach is used to transfer multi-modal similarity to mono-modal similarity
and improve the precision. Neither ground-truth nor manual labeling is required
during training. We evaluated our network on a 3D brain registration task
comprehensively. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can cope
with the data which has non-functional intensity relations, noise and blur. Our
approach outperforms other methods especially in accuracy and speed.

Title: Efficient Semantic Video Segmentation with Per-frame Inference
Authors: Yifan Liu, Chunhua Shen, Changqian Yu, Jingdong Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In semantic segmentation, most existing real-time deep models trained with
each frame independently may produce inconsistent results for a video sequence.
Advanced methods take into considerations the correlations in the video
sequence, e.g., by propagating the results to the neighboring frames using
optical flow, or extracting the frame representations with other frames, which
may lead to inaccurate results or unbalanced latency. In this work, we process
efficient semantic video segmentation in a per-frame fashion during the
inference process. Different from previous per-frame models, we explicitly
consider the temporal consistency among frames as extra constraints during the
training process and embed the temporal consistency into the segmentation
network. Therefore, in the inference process, we can process each frame
independently with no latency, and improve the temporal consistency with no
extra computational cost and post-processing. We employ compact models for
real-time execution. To narrow the performance gap between compact models and
large models, new knowledge distillation methods are designed. Our results
outperform previous keyframe based methods with a better trade-off between the
accuracy and the inference speed on popular benchmarks, including the
Cityscapes and Camvid. The temporal consistency is also improved compared with
corresponding baselines which are trained with each frame independently. Code

  Humans navigate complex environments in an organized yet flexible manner,
adapting to the context and implicit social rules. Understanding these
naturally learned patterns of behavior is essential for applications such as
autonomous vehicles. However, algorithmically defining these implicit rules of
human behavior remains difficult. This work proposes a novel self-supervised
method for training a probabilistic network model to estimate the regions
humans are most likely to drive in as well as a multimodal representation of
the inferred direction of travel at each point. The model is trained on
individual human trajectories conditioned on a representation of the driving
environment. The model is shown to successfully generalize to new road scenes,
demonstrating potential for real-world application as a prior for socially
acceptable driving behavior in challenging or ambiguous scenarios which are
poorly handled by explicit traffic rules.

  In this work we propose a new computational framework, based on generative
deep models, for synthesis of photo-realistic food meal images from textual
list of its ingredients. Previous works on synthesis of images from text
typically rely on pre-trained text models to extract text features, followed by
generative neural networks (GAN) aimed to generate realistic images conditioned
on the text features. These works mainly focus on generating spatially compact
and well-defined categories of objects, such as birds or flowers, but meal
images are significantly more complex, consisting of multiple ingredients whose
appearance and spatial qualities are further modified by cooking methods. To
generate real-like meal images from ingredients, we propose Cook Generative
Adversarial Networks (CookGAN), CookGAN first builds an attention-based
ingredients-image association model, which is then used to condition a
generative neural network tasked with synthesizing meal images. Furthermore, a
cycle-consistent constraint is added to further improve image quality and
control appearance. Experiments show our model is able to generate meal images
corresponding to the ingredients.

  Taking full advantage of the information from both vision and language is
critical for the video captioning task. Existing models lack adequate visual
representation due to the neglect of interaction between object, and sufficient
training for content-related words due to long-tailed problems. In this paper,
we propose a complete video captioning system including both a novel model and
an effective training strategy. Specifically, we propose an object relational
graph (ORG) based encoder, which captures more detailed interaction features to
enrich visual representation. Meanwhile, we design a teacher-recommended
learning (TRL) method to make full use of the successful external language
model (ELM) to integrate the abundant linguistic knowledge into the caption
model. The ELM generates more semantically similar word proposals which extend
the ground-truth words used for training to deal with the long-tailed problem.
Experimental evaluations on three benchmarks: MSVD, MSR-VTT and VATEX show the
proposed ORG-TRL system achieves state-of-the-art performance. Extensive
ablation studies and visualizations illustrate the effectiveness of our system.

Title: Automatically Searching for U-Net Image Translator Architecture

  Image translators have been successfully applied to many important low level
image processing tasks. However, classical network architecture of image
translator like U-Net, is borrowed from other vision tasks like biomedical
image segmentation. This straightforward adaptation may not be optimal and
could cause redundancy in the network structure. In this paper, we propose an

evolutionary algorithm, we investigate a more efficient network architecture
which costs less computation resources and achieves better performance than the
original one. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we
transplant the searched network architecture to other datasets which are not
involved in the architecture searching procedure. Efficiency of the searched
architecture on these datasets further demonstrates the generalization of the

Title: ARMA Nets: Expanding Receptive Field for Dense Prediction
Authors: Jiahao Su, Shiqi Wang, Furong Huang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Global information is essential for dense prediction problems, whose goal is
to compute a discrete or continuous label for each pixel in the images.
Traditional convolutional layers in neural networks, originally designed for
image classification, are restrictive in these problems since their receptive
fields are limited by the filter size. In this work, we propose autoregressive
moving-average (ARMA) layer, a novel module in neural networks to allow
explicit dependencies of output neurons, which significantly expands the
receptive field with minimal extra parameters. We show experimentally that the
effective receptive field of neural networks with ARMA layers expands as
autoregressive coefficients become larger. In addition, we demonstrate that
neural networks with ARMA layers substantially improve the performance of
challenging pixel-level video prediction tasks as our model enlarges the
effective receptive field.

\\
  In this paper, we explore the space-time video super-resolution task, which
aims to generate a high-resolution (HR) slow-motion video from a low frame rate
(LFR), low-resolution (LR) video. A simple solution is to split it into two
sub-tasks: video frame interpolation (VFI) and video super-resolution (VSR).
However, temporal interpolation and spatial super-resolution are intra-related
in this task. Two-stage methods cannot fully take advantage of the natural
property. In addition, state-of-the-art VFI or VSR networks require a large
frame-synthesis or reconstruction module for predicting high-quality video
frames, which makes the two-stage methods have large model sizes and thus be
time-consuming. To overcome the problems, we propose a one-stage space-time
video super-resolution framework, which directly synthesizes an HR slow-motion
video from an LFR, LR video. Rather than synthesizing missing LR video frames
as VFI networks do, we firstly temporally interpolate LR frame features in
missing LR video frames capturing local temporal contexts by the proposed
feature temporal interpolation network. Then, we propose a deformable ConvLSTM
to align and aggregate temporal information simultaneously for better
leveraging global temporal contexts. Finally, a deep reconstruction network is
adopted to predict HR slow-motion video frames. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves
better quantitative and qualitative performance but also is more than three
times faster than recent two-stage state-of-the-art methods, e.g., DAIN+EDVR
and DAIN+RBPN.

Title: Dynamic Graph Correlation Learning for Disease Diagnosis with Incomplete
  Labels
Authors: Daizong Liu, Shuangjie Xu, Pan Zhou, Kun He, Wei Wei, Zichuan Xu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Disease diagnosis on chest X-ray images is a challenging multi-label
classification task. Previous works generally classify the diseases
independently on the input image without considering any correlation among
diseases. However, such correlation actually exists, for example, Pleural
Effusion is more likely to appear when Pneumothorax is present. In this work,
we propose a Disease Diagnosis Graph Convolutional Network (DD-GCN) that
presents a novel view of investigating the inter-dependency among different
diseases by using a dynamic learnable adjacency matrix in graph structure to
improve the diagnosis accuracy. To learn more natural and reliable correlation
relationship, we feed each node with the image-level individual feature map
corresponding to each type of disease. To our knowledge, our method is the
first to build a graph over the feature maps with a dynamic adjacency matrix
for correlation learning. To further deal with a practical issue of incomplete
labels, DD-GCN also utilizes an adaptive loss and a curriculum learning
strategy to train the model on incomplete labels. Experimental results on two
popular chest X-ray (CXR) datasets show that our prediction accuracy
outperforms state-of-the-arts, and the learned graph adjacency matrix
establishes the correlation representations of different diseases, which is
consistent with expert experience. In addition, we apply an ablation study to
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in DD-GCN.

Title: A Quadruplet Loss for Enforcing Semantically Coherent Embeddings in
  Multi-output Classification Problems
Authors: Hugo Proen\c{c}a and Ehsan Yaghoubi
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables
\\
  This paper describes one objective function for learning semantically
coherent feature embeddings in multi-output classification problems, i.e., when
the response variables have dimension higher than one. In particular, we
consider the problems of identity retrieval and soft biometrics in visual
surveillance environments, which have been attracting growing interests.
Inspired by the triplet loss function, we propose a generalization of that
concept: a quadruplet loss, that 1) defines a metric that analyzes the number
of agreeing labels between pairs of elements; and 2) disregards the notion of
anchor, replacing d(A1,A2) < d(A1,B) by d(A,B) < d(C,D) distance constraints,
according to such perceived semantic similarity between the elements of each
pair. Inherited from the triplet loss formulation, our proposal also privileges
small distances between positive pairs, but also explicitly enforces that the
distances between negative pairs directly correspond to their similarity in
terms of the number of agreeing labels. This typically yields feature
embeddings with a strong correspondence between the classes centroids and their
semantic descriptions, i.e., where elements that share some of the labels are
closer to each other in the destiny space than elements with fully disjoint
classes membership. Also, in opposition to its triplet counterpart, the
proposed loss is not particularly sensitive to the way learning pairs are
mined, being agnostic with regard to demanding criteria for mining learning
instances (such as the semi-hard pairs of triplet loss). Our experiments were
carried out in four different datasets (BIODI, LFW, Megaface and PETA) and
validate our assumptions, showing highly promising results.

  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must share space with human pedestrians, both in
on-road cases such as cars at pedestrian crossings and off-road cases such as
delivery vehicles navigating through crowds on high-streets. Unlike static and
kinematic obstacles, pedestrians are active agents with complex, interactive
motions. Planning AV actions in the presence of pedestrians thus requires
modelling of their probable future behaviour as well as detection and tracking
which enable such modelling. This narrative review article is Part I of a pair
which together survey the current technology stack involved in this process,
organising recent research into a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from low level
image detection to high-level psychology models, from the perspective of an AV
designer. This self-contained Part I covers the lower levels of this stack,
from sensing, through detection and recognition, up to tracking of pedestrians.
Technologies at these levels are found to be mature and available as
foundations for use in higher level systems such as behaviour modelling,
prediction and interaction control.

Title: Better coverage, better outcomes? Mapping mobile network data to
  official statistics using satellite imagery and radio propagation modelling
Authors: Till Koebe
Categories: cs.CY stat.CO stat.ME
\\
  Mobile sensing data has become a popular data source for geo-spatial
analysis, however, mapping it accurately to other sources of information such
as statistical data remains a challenge. Popular mapping approaches such as
point allocation or voronoi tessellation provide only crude approximations of
the mobile network coverage as they do not consider holes, overlaps and
within-cell heterogeneity. More elaborate mapping schemes often require
additional proprietary data operators are highly reluctant to share. In this
paper, I use human settlement information extracted from publicly available
satellite imagery in combination with stochastic radio propagation modelling
techniques to account for that. I investigate in a simulation study and a
real-world application on unemployment estimates in Senegal whether better
coverage approximations lead to better outcome predictions. The good news is:
it does not have to be complicated.

Title: Election in India: Polling in National Financial Switch
Authors: Subhankar Mishra
Categories: cs.CY
Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, to be published CSI 2020 Conference Proceeding
\\
  Indian voters from Kashmir to Kanyakumari select their representatives to
form their parliament by going to polls. India's election is one of the largest
democratic exercise in the world history. About 850 million eligible voters
determine which political party or alliance will form the government and in
turn, will serve as prime minister. Given the electoral rules of placing a
polling place within 2 kilometers of every habitation, it comes as no surprise
that is indeed a humongous task for the Election Commission of India (ECI). It
sends around 11 million election workers through tough terrains to reach the
last mile. This exercise also comes as ever growing expenditure for the ECI.
This paper proposes the use of Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and Point Of
Sale (POS) machines to be used to cover as much as urban, rural and semi-urban
places possible given the wide network of National Financial Switch (NFS) and
increase in connectivity through Digital India initiative. This would add to
the use of the existing infrastructure to accommodate a free, fair and
transparent election.

\\
  As freelancing work keeps on growing almost everywhere due to a sharp
decrease in communication costs and to the widespread of Internet-based labour
marketplaces (e.g., guru.com, feelancer.com, mturk.com, upwork.com), many
researchers and practitioners have started exploring the benefits of
outsourcing and crowdsourcing. Since employers often use these platforms to
find a group of workers to complete a specific task, researchers have focused
their efforts on the study of team formation and matching algorithms and on the
design of effective incentive schemes. Nevertheless, just recently, several
concerns have been raised on possibly unfair biases introduced through the
algorithms used to carry out these selection and matching procedures. For this
reason, researchers have started studying the fairness of algorithms related to
these online marketplaces, looking for intelligent ways to overcome the
algorithmic bias that frequently arises. Broadly speaking, the aim is to
guarantee that, for example, the process of hiring workers through the use of
machine learning and algorithmic data analysis tools does not discriminate,
even unintentionally, on grounds of nationality or gender. In this short paper,
we define the Fair Team Formation problem in the following way: given an online
labour marketplace where each worker possesses one or more skills, and where
all workers are divided into two or more not overlapping classes (for examples,
men and women), we want to design an algorithm that is able to find a team with
all the skills needed to complete a given task, and that has the same number of
people from all classes. We provide inapproximability results for the Fair Team
Formation problem together with four algorithms for the problem itself. We also
tested the effectiveness of our algorithmic solutions by performing experiments
using real data from an online labor marketplace.

Title: Trends of digitalization and adoption of big data & analytics among UK
  SMEs: Analysis and lessons drawn from a case study of 53 SMEs
Authors: Muhidin Mohamed
Categories: cs.CY cs.CL
\\
  Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) now generate digital data at an
unprecedented rate from online transactions, social media marketing and
associated customer interactions, online product or service reviews and
feedback, clinical diagnosis, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and production
processes. All these forms of data can be transformed into monetary value if
put into a proper data value chain. This requires both skills and IT
investments for the long-term benefit of businesses. However, such spending is
beyond the capacity of most SMEs due to their limited resources and restricted
access to finances. This paper presents lessons learned from a case study of 53
UK SMEs, mostly from the West Midlands region of England, supported as part of
a 3-year ERDF project, Big Data Corridor, in the areas of big data management,
analytics and related IT issues. Based on our study's sample companies, several
perspectives including the digital technology trends, challenges facing the UK
SMEs, and the state of their adoption in data analytics and big data, are
presented in the paper.

Title: Death by AI: Where Assured Autonomy in Smart Cities Meets the End-to-End
  Argument
Authors: Gregory Falco
Categories: cs.CY cs.CR cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: PREPRINT, 6 Pages
\\
  A smart city involves critical infrastructure systems that have been
digitally enabled. Increasingly, many smart city cyber-physical systems are
becoming automated. The extent of automation ranges from basic logic gates to
sophisticated, artificial intelligence (AI) that enables fully autonomous
systems. Because of modern society's reliance on autonomous systems in smart
cities, it is crucial for them to operate in a safe manner; otherwise, it is
feasible for these systems to cause considerable physical harm or even death.
Because smart cities could involve thousands of autonomous systems operating in
concert in densely populated areas, safety assurances are required. Challenges
abound to consistently manage the safety of such autonomous systems due to
their disparate developers, manufacturers, operators and users. A novel network
and a sample of associated network functions for autonomous systems is proposed
that aims to provide a baseline of safety for autonomous systems. This is
accomplished by establishing a custom-designed network for autonomous systems
that is separate from the Internet, and can handle certain functions that
enable safety through active networking. Such a network design sits at the
margins of the end-to-end principle, which is warranted considering the safety
of autonomous systems is at stake as is argued in this paper. Without a
scalable safety strategy for autonomous systems as proposed, assured autonomy
in smart cities will remain elusive.

  Urban population grows constantly. By 2050 two thirds of the world population
will reside in urban areas. This growth is faster and more complex than the
ability of cities to measure and plan for their sustainability. To understand
what makes a city inclusive for all, we define a methodology to identify and
characterize spatial subdivisions: areas with over- and under-representation of
specific population groups, named hot and cold spots respectively. Using
aggregated mobile phone data, we apply this methodology to the city of
Barcelona to assess the mobility of three groups of people: women, elders, and
tourists. We find that, within the three groups, cold spots have a lower
diversity of amenities and services than hot spots. Also, cold spots of women
and tourists tend to have lower population income. These insights apply to the
floating population of Barcelona, thus augmenting the scope of how
inclusiveness can be analyzed in the city.

  In the global move toward urbanization, making sure the people remaining in
rural areas are not left behind in terms of development and policy
considerations is a priority for governments worldwide. However, it is
increasingly challenging to track important statistics concerning this sparse,
geographically dispersed population, resulting in a lack of reliable,
up-to-date data. In this study, we examine the usefulness of the Facebook
Advertising platform, which offers a digital "census" of over two billions of
its users, in measuring potential rural-urban inequalities. We focus on Italy,
a country where about 30% of the population lives in rural areas. First, we
show that the population statistics that Facebook produces suffer from
instability across time and incomplete coverage of sparsely populated
municipalities. To overcome such limitation, we propose an alternative
methodology for estimating Facebook Ads audiences that nearly triples the
coverage of the rural municipalities from 19% to 55% and makes feasible
fine-grained sub-population analysis. Using official national census data, we
evaluate our approach and confirm known significant urban-rural divides in
terms of educational attainment and income. Extending the analysis to
Facebook-specific user "interests" and behaviors, we provide further insights
on the divide, for instance, finding that rural areas show a higher interest in
gambling. Notably, we find that the most predictive features of income in rural
areas differ from those for urban centres, suggesting researchers need to
consider a broader range of attributes when examining rural wellbeing. The
findings of this study illustrate the necessity of improving existing tools and
methodologies to include under-represented populations in digital demographic
studies -- the failure to do so could result in misleading observations,
conclusions, and most importantly, policies.

  Digital Engineering, the digital transformation of engineering to leverage
digital technologies, is coming globally. This paper explores digital systems
engineering, which aims at developing theory, methods, models, and tools to
support the emerging digital engineering. A critical task is to digitalize
engineering artifacts, thus enabling information sharing across platform,
across life cycle, and across domains. We identify significant challenges and
enabling digital technologies; analyze the transition from traditional
engineering to digital engineering; define core concepts, including
"digitalization", "unique identification", "digitalized artifacts", "digital
augmentation", and others; present a big picture of digital systems engineering
in four levels: vision, strategy, action, and foundation; briefly discuss each
of main areas of research issues. Digitalization enables fast infusing and
leveraging novel digital technologies; unique identification enables
information traceability and accountability in engineering lifecycle;
provenance enables tracing dependency relations among engineering artifacts;
supporting model reproducibility and replicability; helping with
trustworthiness evaluation of digital engineering artifacts.

basic k2-tree that can be applied to our solution in order to boost
compression. Experimental results in the flagship RDF dataset DBPedia show that
our proposal achieves better compression than existing alternatives, while
yielding competitive query times, particularly in the most frequent triple

  Recent advances in the interconnectedness and digitization of industrial

Indeed, the availability and the richness of production-related data enables

workload of a company and (2) predicts the workload using neural networks. Our
method relies on logs, representing the history of business processes related
to manufacturing. These logs are used to quantify the supply and demand and are
fed into a recurrent neural network model to predict customer orders. The
corresponding activities to fulfill these orders are then sampled from history
with a replay mechanism, based on criteria such as trace frequency and
activities similarity. An evaluation and illustration of the method is
performed on the administrative processes of Heraeus Materials SA. The workload
prediction on a one-year test set achieves an MAPE score of 19% for a one-week
forecast. The case study suggests a reasonable accuracy and confirms that a
good understanding of the historical workload combined to articulated
predictions are of great help for supporting management decisions and can
decrease costs with better resources planning on a medium-term level.

  SpGEMM (General Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication) has attracted much
attention from researchers in fields of multigrid methods and graph analysis.
Many optimization techniques have been developed for certain application fields
and computing architecture over the decades. The objective of this paper is to
provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on SpGEMM.
Existing optimization techniques have been grouped into different categories
based on their target problems and architectures. Covered topics include SpGEMM
applications, size prediction of result matrix, matrix partitioning and load
balancing, result accumulating, and target architecture-oriented optimization.
The rationales of different algorithms in each category are analyzed, and a
wide range of SpGEMM algorithms are summarized. This survey sufficiently
reveals the latest progress and research status of SpGEMM optimization from
1977 to 2019. More specifically, an experimentally comparative study of
existing implementations on CPU and GPU is presented. Based on our findings, we
highlight future research directions and how future studies can leverage our
findings to encourage better design and implementation.

Title: Bandwidth-Optimized Parallel Algorithms for Sparse Matrix-Matrix
  Multiplication using Propagation Blocking
Authors: Zhixiang Gu, Jose Moreira, David Edelsohn, Ariful Azad
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a widely used kernel in
various graph, scientific computing and machine learning algorithms. It is well
known that SpGEMM is a memory-bound operation, and its peak performance is
expected to be bound by the memory bandwidth. Yet, existing algorithms fail to
saturate the memory bandwidth, resulting in suboptimal performance under the
Roofline model. In this paper we characterize existing SpGEMM algorithms based
on their memory access patterns and develop practical lower and upper bounds
for SpGEMM performance. We then develop an SpGEMM algorithm based on outer
product matrix multiplication. The newly developed algorithm called PB-SpGEMM
saturates memory bandwidth by using the propagation blocking technique and by
performing in-cache sorting and merging. For many practical matrices, PB-SpGEMM
runs 20%-50% faster than the state-of-the-art heap and hash SpGEMM algorithms
on modern multicore processors. Most importantly, PB-SpGEMM attains performance
predicted by the Roofline model, and its performance remains stable with
respect to matrix size and sparsity.

Title: Romu: Fast Nonlinear Pseudo-Random Number Generators Providing High
  Quality
Authors: Mark A. Overton
Categories: cs.DC cs.CR
\\
  We introduce the Romu family of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) which
combines the nonlinear operation of rotation with the linear operations of
multiplication and (optionally) addition. Compared to conventional linear-only
PRNGs, this mixture of linear and nonlinear operations achieves a greater
degree of randomness using the same number of arithmetic operations. Or
equivalently, it achieves the same randomness with fewer operations, resulting
in higher speed. The statistical properties of these generators are strong, as
they pass BigCrush and PractRand -- the most stringent test suites available.
In addition, Romu generators take maximum advantage of instruction-level
parallelism in modern superscalar processors, giving them an output latency of
zero clock-cycles when inlined, thus adding no delay to an application.
Scaled-down versions of these generators can be created and tested, enabling
one to estimate the maximum number of values the full-size generators can
supply before their randomness declines, ensuring the success of large jobs.
Such capacity-estimates are rare for conventional PRNGs. A linear PRNG has a
single cycle of states of known length comprising almost all possible states.
However, a Romu generator computes pseudo-random permutations of those states,
creating multiple cycles with pseudo-random lengths which cannot be determined
by theory. But the ease of creating state-sizes of 128 or more bits allows (1)
short cycles to be constrained to vanishingly low probabilities, and (2)
thousands of parallel streams to be created having infinitesimal probabilities
of overlap.

Title: HFEL: Joint Edge Association and Resource Allocation for Cost-Efficient
  Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning
Authors: Siqi Luo, Xu Chen, Qiong Wu, Zhi Zhou and Shuai Yu
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: submitted for review
\\
  Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed as an appealing approach to handle
data privacy issue of mobile devices compared to conventional machine learning
at the remote cloud with raw user data uploading. By leveraging edge servers as
intermediaries to perform partial model aggregation in proximity and relieve
core network transmission overhead, it enables great potentials in low-latency
and energy-efficient FL. Hence we introduce a novel Hierarchical Federated Edge
Learning (HFEL) framework in which model aggregation is partially migrated to
edge servers from the cloud. We further formulate a joint computation and
communication resource allocation and edge association problem for device users
under HFEL framework to achieve global cost minimization. To solve the problem,
we propose an efficient resource scheduling algorithm in the HFEL framework. It
can be decomposed into two subproblems: \emph{resource allocation} given a
scheduled set of devices for each edge server and \emph{edge association} of
device users across all the edge servers. With the optimal policy of the convex
resource allocation subproblem for a set of devices under a single edge server,
an efficient edge association strategy can be achieved through iterative global
cost reduction adjustment process, which is shown to converge to a stable
system point. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate that our HFEL
framework outperforms the proposed benchmarks in global cost saving and
achieves better training performance compared to conventional federated
learning.

Title: Upper and Lower Bounds on the Space Complexity of Detectable Object
Authors: Ohad Ben-Baruch, Danny Hendler and Matan Rusanovsky
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  The emergence of systems with non-volatile main memory (NVM) increases the
interest in the design of \emph{recoverable concurrent objects} that are robust
to crash-failures, since their operations are able to recover from such
failures by using state retained in NVM. Of particular interest are recoverable
algorithms that, in addition to ensuring object consistency, also provide
\emph{detectability}, a correctness condition requiring that the recovery code
can infer if the failed operation was linearized or not and, in the former
case, obtain its response.
  In this work, we investigate the space complexity of detectable algorithms
and the external support they require. We make the following three
contributions. First, we present the first wait-free bounded-space detectable
read/write and CAS object implementations. Second, we prove that the bit
complexity of every $N$-process obstruction-free detectable CAS implementation,
assuming values from a domain of size at least $N$, is $\Omega(N)$. Finally, we
prove that the following holds for obstruction-free detectable implementations
of a large class of objects: their recoverable operations must be provided with
\emph{auxiliary state} -- state that is not required by the non-recoverable
counterpart implementation -- whose value must be provided from outside the
operation, either by the system or by the caller of the operation. In contrast,
this external support is, in general, not required if the recoverable algorithm
is not detectable.

Title: Relaxed Scheduling for Scalable Belief Propagation
Authors: Vitaly Aksenov and Dan Alistarh and Janne H. Korhonen
Categories: cs.DC cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The ability to leverage large-scale hardware parallelism has been one of the
key enablers of the accelerated recent progress in machine learning.
Consequently, there has been considerable effort invested into developing
efficient parallel variants of classic machine learning algorithms. However,
despite the wealth of knowledge on parallelization, some classic machine
learning algorithms often prove hard to parallelize efficiently while
maintaining convergence. In this paper, we focus on efficient parallel
algorithms for the key machine learning task of inference on graphical models,
in particular on the fundamental belief propagation algorithm. We address the
challenge of efficiently parallelizing this classic paradigm by showing how to
leverage scalable relaxed schedulers in this context. We present an extensive
empirical study, showing that our approach outperforms previous parallel belief
propagation implementations both in terms of scalability and in terms of
wall-clock convergence time, on a range of practical applications.

Title: Safe and Efficient Remote Application Code Execution on Disaggregated
  NVM Storage with eBPF
Authors: Kornilios Kourtis, Animesh Trivedi, Nikolas Ioannou
Categories: cs.DC cs.OS
\\
  With rapid improvements in NVM storage devices, the performance bottleneck is
gradually shifting to the network, thus giving rise to the notion of "data
movement wall". To reduce the amount of data movement over the network,
researchers have proposed near-data computing by shipping operations and
compute-extensions closer to storage devices. However, running arbitrary,
user-provided extensions in a shared, disaggregated storage environment
presents multiple challenges regarding safety, isolation, and performance.
Instead of approaching this problem from scratch, in this work we make a case
for leveraging the Linux kernel eBPF framework to program disaggregated NVM
storage devices. eBPF offers a safe, verifiable, and high-performance way of
executing untrusted, user-defined code in a shared runtime. In this paper, we
describe our experiences building a first prototype that supports remote
operations on storage using eBPF, discuss the limitations of our approach, and
directions for addressing them.

Title: Appending Atomically in Byzantine Distributed Ledgers
Authors: Vicent Cholvi and Antonio Fernandez Anta and Chryssis Georgiou and
  Nicolas Nicolaou and Michel Raynal
Categories: cs.DC cs.DB cs.DS
\\
  A Distributed Ledger Object (DLO) is a concurrent object that maintains a
totally ordered sequence of records, and supports two basic operations: append,
which appends a record at the end of the sequence, and get, which returns the
sequence of records. In this work we provide a proper formalization of a
Byzantine-tolerant Distributed Ledger Object (BDLO), which is a DLO in a
distributed system in which processes may deviate arbitrarily from their
indented behavior, i.e. they may be Byzantine. Our formal definition is
accompanied by algorithms to implement BDLOs by utilizing an underlying
Byzantine Atomic Broadcast service.
  We then utilize the BDLO implementations to solve the Atomic Appends problem
against Byzantine processes. The Atomic Appends problem emerges when several
clients have records to append, the record of each client has to be appended to
a different BDLO, and it must be guaranteed that either all records are
appended or none. We present distributed algorithms implementing solutions for
the Atomic Appends problem when the clients (which are involved in the appends)
and the servers (which maintain the BDLOs) may be Byzantine.

  Data makes science possible. Sharing data improves visibility, and makes the
research process transparent. This increases trust in the work, and allows for
independent reproduction of results. However, a large proportion of data from
published research is often only available to the original authors. Despite the
obvious benefits of sharing data, and scientists' advocating for the importance
of sharing data, most advice on sharing data discusses its broader benefits,
rather than the practical considerations of sharing. This paper provides
practical, actionable advice on how to actually share data alongside research.
The key message is sharing data falls on a continuum, and entering it should
come with minimal barriers.

Title: Intensive use of computing resources for dominations in grids and other
  combinatorial problems
Authors: Alexandre Talon
Categories: cs.DM

\\
  Our goal is to prove new results in graph theory and combinatorics thanks to
the speed of computers, used with smart algorithms. We tackle four problems.
  The four-colour theorem states that any map whose countries are connected can
be coloured with 4 colours such that neighbouring countries have differnt
colours. It was the first result proved using computers, in 1989. We wished to
automatise further its proof. We explain the proof and provide a program which
replays the proof. It also makes it possible to obtain other results with the
same method. We give ideas to automatise the search for discharging rules.
  We also study the problems of domination in grids. The simplest one is the
one of domination. It consists in putting a stone on some cells of a grid such
that every cell has a stone, or has a neighbour with a stone. This problem was
solved in 2011, using computers to prove a formula giving the minimum number of
stones needed. We adapt this method for the first time for variants of the
domination. We solve partially two other problems and give for them lower
bounds for grids of arbitrary size.
  We also tackle the counting problem for dominating sets. How many dominating
sets are there for a given grid? We study this counting problem for the
domination and three variants. For each of these problems, we prove the
existence of asymptotic growths rates for which we give bounds.
  Finally we study polyominoes and the way they can tile rectangles. We tried
to solve a problem from 1989: is there a polyomino of odd order? It consists in
finding a polyomino which can tile a rectangle with an odd number of copies,
but cannot tile any smaller rectangle. We did not manage to solve this problem,
but we made a program to enumerate polyominoes and try to find their orders,
discarding those which cannot tile rectangles. We also give statistics on the
orders of polyominoes of size up to 18.

Title: Stochastic Makespan Minimization in Structured Set Systems

Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 23 pages, 1 figure
Journal-ref: IPCO 2020
\\
  We study stochastic combinatorial optimization problems where the objective
is to minimize the expected maximum load (a.k.a. the makespan). In this
framework, we have a set of n tasks and m resources, where each task j uses
some subset of the resources. Tasks have random sizes X_j, and our goal is to
non-adaptively select t tasks to minimize the expected maximum load over all
resources, where the load on any resource i is the total size of all selected
tasks that use i. For example, given a set of intervals in time, with each
interval j having random load X_j, how do we choose t intervals to minimize the
expected maximum load at any time? Our technique is also applicable to other
problems with some geometric structure in the relation between tasks and
resources; e.g., packing paths, rectangles, and "fat" objects. Specifically, we
give an O(\log\log m)-approximation algorithm for all these problems.
  Our approach uses a strong LP relaxation using the cumulant generating
functions of the random variables. We also show that this LP has an
\Omega(\log^* m) integrality gap even for the problem of selecting intervals on
a line. Moreover, we show logarithmic gaps for problems without geometric
structure, showing that some structure is needed to get good results using
these techniques.

Title: 2-Dimensional Palindromes with $k$ Mismatches
Authors: Dina Sokol
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  This paper extends the problem of 2-dimensional palindrome search into the
area of approximate matching. Using the Hamming distance as the measure, we
search for 2D palindromes that allow up to $k$ mismatches. We consider two
different definitions of 2D palindromes and describe efficient algorithms for
both of them. The first definition implies a square, while the second
definition (also known as a \emph{centrosymmetric factor}), can be any
rectangular shape. Given a text of size $n \times m$, the time complexity of
the first algorithm is $O(nm (\log m + \log n + k))$ and for the second
algorithm it is $O(nm(\log m + k) + occ)$ where $occ$ is the size of the
output.

Title: An Improved Algorithm for Dynamic Set Cover
Authors: Sayan Bhattacharya and Monika Henzinger and Danupon Nanongkai and
  Xiaowei Wu
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We consider the minimum set cover problem in a dynamic setting. Here, we are
given a universe of elements $\mathcal{U}$ and a collection of sets
$\mathcal{S} \subseteq 2^{\mathcal{U}}$ as input, where each set $s \in
\mathcal{S}$ has a cost $1/C < c_s < 1$ for some parameter $C > 1$. The input
keeps changing via a sequence of updates. Each update inserts/deletes an
element in the universe, and specifies the sets in $\S$ containing that
element. The goal is to maintain a set cover of (approximately) minimum cost
with as small update time as possible. Let $n$ denote the number of sets in
$\mathcal{S}$, and let $m$ and $f$ respectively denote the maximum number of
elements in the universe and the maximum frequency of an element across all the
updates.
  This problem has received significant attention in recent years in the
dynamic algorithms community. Gupta et al. [STOC `17] designed a deterministic
$\Theta(\log m)$-approximation algorithm for this problem that has an update
time of $O(f \log m)$. On the other hand, the line of work by Bhattacharya et
al. [ICALP `15], Bhattacharya et al. [IPCO `17], Gupta et al. [STOC `17],
Abboud et al. [STOC `19] and Bhattacharya et al. [FOCS `19] very recently led
to a deterministic $(1+\epsilon)f$-approximation algorithm with $O(f \log
(Cm)/\epsilon^2)$ update time.
  In this paper, we obtain the first dynamic algorithm for this problem with
near-optimal approximation ratio whose update time is independent of $m, n$.
Specifically, our algorithm is deterministic and it achieves an approximation
ratio of $(1+\epsilon)f$ and an update time of
$O\left((f^2/\epsilon^3)+(f/\epsilon^2) \log C\right)$. Our algorithm is based
on the dynamic primal-dual framework, and it carefully combines the ideas from
the dynamic vertex cover algorithm of Bhattacharya and Kulkarni [SODA `19] and
the dynamic set cover algorithm of Bhattacharya et al. [FOCS `19].

Title: Spectral Sparsification via Bounded-Independence Sampling
Authors: Dean Doron, Jack Murtagh, Salil Vadhan, David Zuckerman
Categories: cs.DS cs.CC
Comments: 37 pages
\\
  We give a deterministic, nearly logarithmic-space algorithm for mild spectral
sparsification of undirected graphs. Given a weighted, undirected graph $G$ on
$n$ vertices described by a binary string of length $N$, an integer $k\leq \log
n$, and an error parameter $\epsilon > 0$, our algorithm runs in space
$\tilde{O}(k\log (N\cdot w_{\mathrm{max}}/w_{\mathrm{min}}))$ where
$w_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $w_{\mathrm{min}}$ are the maximum and minimum edge
weights in $G$, and produces a weighted graph $H$ with
$\tilde{O}(n^{1+2/k}/\epsilon^2)$ edges that spectrally approximates $G$, in
the sense of Spielmen and Teng [ST04], up to an error of $\epsilon$.
  Our algorithm is based on a new bounded-independence analysis of Spielman and
Srivastava's effective resistance based edge sampling algorithm [SS08] and uses
results from recent work on space-bounded Laplacian solvers [MRSV17]. In
particular, we demonstrate an inherent tradeoff (via upper and lower bounds)
between the amount of (bounded) independence used in the edge sampling
algorithm, denoted by $k$ above, and the resulting sparsity that can be
achieved.

Title: Streaming with Oracle: New Streaming Algorithms for Edit Distance and
  LCS
Authors: Alireza Farhadi, MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi, Aviad Rubinstein, Saeed
  Seddighin
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  The edit distance (ED) and longest common subsequence (LCS) are two
fundamental problems which quantify how similar two strings are to one another.
In this paper, we consider these problems in the streaming model where one
string is available via oracle queries and the other string comes as a stream
of characters. Our main contribution is a constant factor approximation
algorithm in this setting for ED with memory $O(n^{\delta})$ for any $\delta >
0$. In addition to this, we present an upper bound of $\tilde O(\sqrt{n})$ on
the memory needed to approximate ED or LCS within a factor $1+o(1)$ in our
setting. All our algorithms run in a single pass.
  For approximating ED within a constant factor, we discover yet another
application of triangle inequality, this time in the context of streaming
algorithms. Triangle inequality has been previously used to obtain subquadratic
time approximation algorithms for ED. Our technique is novel and elegantly
utilizes triangle inequality to save memory at the expense of an exponential
increase in the runtime.

Title: Space Efficient Representations of Finite Groups

Categories: cs.DS cs.SC
\\
  The Cayley table representation of a group uses $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ words for
a group of order $n$ and answers multiplication queries in time
$\mathcal{O}(1)$. It is interesting to ask if there is a $o(n^2)$ space
representation of groups that still has $\mathcal{O}(1)$ query-time. We show
that for any $\delta$, $\frac{1}{\log n} \le \delta \le 1$, there is an
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{n^{1 +\delta}}{\delta})$ space representation for groups of
order $n$ with $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\delta})$ query-time.
  We also show that for Z-groups, simple groups and several group classes
defined in terms of semidirect product, there are linear space representations
with at most logarithmic query-time.
  Farzan and Munro (ISSAC'06) defined a model for group representation and gave
a succinct data structure for abelian groups with constant query-time. They
asked if their result can be extended to categorically larger group classes. We
construct data structures in their model for Hamiltonian groups and some other
classes of groups with constant query-time.

a source and destination node, a path query returns whether there is a directed
path from the source to the destination node in the hidden graph. In this paper
we first give bounds for learning graphs on $n$ vertices and $k$ strongly
connected components. We then study the case of bounded degree directed trees

extra edges have been added. We also give some lower bound constructions

Title: Query-Efficient Correlation Clustering

  Correlation clustering is arguably the most natural formulation of
clustering. Given n objects and a pairwise similarity measure, the goal is to
cluster the objects so that, to the best possible extent, similar objects are
put in the same cluster and dissimilar objects are put in different clusters.
  A main drawback of correlation clustering is that it requires as input the
$\Theta(n^2)$ pairwise similarities. This is often infeasible to compute or
even just to store. In this paper we study \emph{query-efficient} algorithms
for correlation clustering. Specifically, we devise a correlation clustering
algorithm that, given a budget of $Q$ queries, attains a solution whose
expected number of disagreements is at most $3\cdot OPT + O(\frac{n^3}{Q})$,
where $OPT$ is the optimal cost for the instance. Its running time is $O(Q)$,
and can be easily made non-adaptive (meaning it can specify all its queries at
the outset and make them in parallel) with the same guarantees. Up to constant
factors, our algorithm yields a provably optimal trade-off between the number
of queries $Q$ and the worst-case error attained, even for adaptive algorithms.
  Finally, we perform an experimental study of our proposed method on both
synthetic and real data, showing the scalability and the accuracy of our
algorithm.

Title: A Polynomial Time Algorithm for Almost Optimal Vertex Fault Tolerant
  Spanners
Authors: Udit Agarwal
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We present the first polynomial time algorithm for the f vertex fault
tolerant spanner problem, which achieves almost optimal spanner size. Our
algorithm for constructing f vertex fault tolerant spanner takes $O(k\cdot
n\cdot m^2 \cdot W)$ time, where W is the maximum edge weight, and constructs a
spanner of size $O(n^{1+1/k}f^{1-1/k}\cdot (\log n)^{1-1/k})$. Our spanner has
almost optimal size and is at most a $\log n$ factor away from the upper bound
on the worst-case size. Prior to this work, no other polynomial time algorithm
was known for constructing f vertex fault tolerant spanner with optimal size.
  Our algorithm is based on first greedily constructing a hitting set for the
collection of paths of weight at most $k \cdot w(u,v)$ between the endpoints u
and v of an edge (u,v) and then using this set to decide whether the edge (u,v)
needs to be added to the growing spanner.

\\
  Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task often used to discover
meaningful structures in data, such as phylogenetic trees, taxonomies of
concepts, subtypes of cancer, and cascades of particle decays in particle
physics. When multiple hierarchical clusterings of the data are possible, it is
useful to represent uncertainty in the clustering through various probabilistic
quantities. Existing approaches represent uncertainty for a range of models;
however, they only provide approximate inference. This paper presents
dynamic-programming algorithms and proofs for exact inference in hierarchical
clustering. We are able to compute the partition function, MAP hierarchical
clustering, and marginal probabilities of sub-hierarchies and clusters. Our
method supports a wide range of hierarchical models and only requires a cluster
compatibility function. Rather than scaling with the number of hierarchical
clusterings of $n$ elements ($\omega(n n! / 2^{n-1})$), our approach runs in
time and space proportional to the significantly smaller powerset of $n$.
Despite still being large, these algorithms enable exact inference in
small-data applications and are also interesting from a theoretical
perspective. We demonstrate the utility of our method and compare its
performance with respect to existing approximate methods.

Title: Limitations of Greed: Influence Maximization in Undirected Networks
  Re-visited
Authors: Grant Schoenebeck, Biaoshuai Tao, Fang-Yi Yu
Categories: cs.DS cs.CC cs.SI

  Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
\\
  We consider the influence maximization problem (selecting $k$ seeds in a
network maximizing the expected total influence) on undirected graphs under the
linear threshold model. On the one hand, we prove that the greedy algorithm
always achieves a $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k + \Omega(1/k^3))$-approximation, showing
that the greedy algorithm does slightly better on undirected graphs than the
generic $(1- (1 - 1/k)^k)$ bound which also applies to directed graphs. On the
other hand, we show that substantial improvement on this bound is impossible by
presenting an example where the greedy algorithm can obtain at most a $(1- (1 -
1/k)^k + O(1/k^{0.2}))$ approximation. This result stands in contrast to the
previous work on the independent cascade model. Like the linear threshold
model, the greedy algorithm obtains a $(1-(1-1/k)^k)$-approximation on directed
graphs in the independent cascade model. However, Khanna and Lucier showed
that, in undirected graphs, the greedy algorithm performs substantially better:
a $(1-(1-1/k)^k + c)$ approximation for constant $c > 0$. Our results show
that, surprisingly, no such improvement occurs in the linear threshold model.
Finally, we show that, under the linear threshold model, the approximation
ratio $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k)$ is tight if 1) the graph is directed or 2) the
vertices are weighted. In other words, under either of these two settings, the
greedy algorithm cannot achieve a $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k + f(k))$-approximation for
any positive function $f(k)$. The result in setting 2) is again in a sharp
contrast to Khanna and Lucier's $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k + c)$-approximation result
for the independent cascade model, where the $(1 - (1 - 1/k)^k + c)$
approximation guarantee can be extended to the setting where vertices are
weighted. We also discuss extensions to more generalized settings including
those with edge-weighted graphs.

Title: Bitvectors with runs and the successor/predecessor problem

\\
  The successor and predecessor problem consists of obtaining the closest value
in a set of integers, greater/smaller than a given value. This problem has
interesting applications, like the intersection of inverted lists. It can be
easily modeled by using a bitvector of size $n$ and its operations rank and
select. However, there is a practical approach, which keeps the best
theoretical bounds, and allows to solve successor and predecessor more
efficiently. Based on that technique, we designed a novel compact data
structure for bitvectors with $k$ runs that achieves access, rank, and
successor/predecessor in $O(1)$ time by consuming space $O(\sqrt{kn})$ bits. In
practice, it obtains a compression ratio of $0.04\%-26.33\%$ when the runs are
larger than $100$, and becomes the fastest technique, which considers
compressibility, in successor/predecessor queries. Besides, we present a
recursive variant of our structure, which tends to $O(k)$ bits and takes
$O(\log \frac{n}{k})$ time.

  On-Chip Learning for Energy Efficient Neuromorphic Computing at the Edge
Authors: Minsuk Koo, Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan, Yong Shim, and Kaushik Roy
Categories: cs.ET cs.AR
\\
  In this work, we propose stochastic Binary Spiking Neural Network (sBSNN)
composed of stochastic spiking neurons and binary synapses (stochastic only
during training) that computes probabilistically with one-bit precision for
power-efficient and memory-compressed neuromorphic computing. We present an
energy-efficient implementation of the proposed sBSNN using 'stochastic bit' as
the core computational primitive to realize the stochastic neurons and
synapses, which are fabricated in 90nm CMOS process, to achieve efficient
on-chip training and inference for image recognition tasks. The measured data
shows that the 'stochastic bit' can be programmed to mimic spiking neurons, and
stochastic Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (or sSTDP) rule for training the
binary synaptic weights without expensive random number generators. Our results
indicate that the proposed sBSNN realization offers possibility of up to 32x
neuronal and synaptic memory compression compared to full precision (32-bit)
SNN and energy efficiency of 89.49 TOPS/Watt for two-layer fully-connected SNN.

  The quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) nano-technique has attracted computer
scientists due to its noticeable features such as low power consumption and
small size. Many papers have been published in the literature about the
utilization of this technology for de-signing many QCA circuits and for
presenting logic gates in an optimal structure. The T flip-flop, which is an
essential part of digital designs, can be used to design synchronous and
asynchronous counters. This paper presents a novel T flip-flop structure in an
optimal form. The presented novel gate was used to design an N-bit binary
synchronous counter. The QCADesigner software was used to verify the designed
circuits and to present the simulation results, while the QCAPro tool was used
for the power analysis. The proposed design required minimal power and showed
good improvements over previous designs.

Title: Buchi automata augmented with spatial constraints: simulating an
  alternating with a nondeterministic and deciding the emptiness problem for
  the latter
Authors: Amar Isli

Comments: See footnote 1 on the first page of the paper. arXiv admin note:

\\
  The aim of this work is to thoroughly investigate Buchi automata augmented
with spatial constraints. The input trees of such an automaton are infinite
k-ary Sigma-trees, with the nodes standing for time points, and Sigma
including, additionally to its uses in classical k-ary Sigma-trees, the
description of the snapshot of an n-object spatial scene of interest. The
constraints, from an RCC8-like spatial Relation Algebra (RA) x, are used to
impose spatial constraints on objects of the spatial scene, eventually at
different nodes of the input trees. We show that a Buchi alternating automaton
augmented with spatial constraints can be simulated with a classical Buchi
nondeterministic automaton of the same type, augmented with spatial
constraints. We then provide a nondeterministic doubly depth-first polynomial
space algorithm for the emptiness problem of the latter automaton. Our main
motivation came from another work, also submitted to this conference, which
defines a spatio-temporalisation of the well-known family ALC(D) of description
logics with a concrete domain: together, the two works provide an effective
solution to the satisfiability problem of a concept of the
spatio-temporalisation with respect to a weakly cyclic TBox.

  S-patches have many nice mathematical properties. It is known since their
first appearance, that any regular S-patch can be exactly converted into a
trimmed rational B\'ezier surface. This is a big advantage compared to other
multi-sided surface representations that have to be approximated for exporting
them into CAD/CAM systems. The actual conversion process, however, remained at
a theoretical level, with bits and pieces scattered in multiple publications.
In this paper we review the entirety of the algorithm, and investigate it from
a practical aspect.

  Transfinite patches provide a simple and elegant solution to the problem of
representing non-four-sided continuous surfaces, which are useful in a variety
of applications, such as curve network based design. Real-time responsiveness
is essential in this context, and thus reducing the computation cost is an
important concern. The Midpoint Coons (MC) patch presented in this paper is a
fusion of two previous transfinite schemes, combining the speed of one with the
superior control mechanism of the other. This is achieved using a new
constrained parameterization based on generalized barycentric coordinates and
transfinite blending functions.

Title: Designing Truthful Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits based Sponsored Search
  Auctions
Authors: Kumar Abhishek, Shweta Jain and Sujit Gujar
Categories: cs.GT cs.LG
\\
  For sponsored search auctions, we consider contextual multi-armed bandit
problem in the presence of strategic agents. In this setting, at each round, an
advertising platform (center) runs an auction to select the best-suited ads
relevant to the query posted by the user. It is in the best interest of the
center to select an ad that has a high expected value (i.e., probability of
getting a click $\times$ value it derives from a click of the ad). The
probability of getting a click (CTR) is unknown to the center and depends on
the user's profile (context) posting the query. Further, the value derived for
a click is the private information to the advertiser and thus needs to be
elicited truthfully. The existing solution in this setting is not practical as
it suffers from very high regret ($O(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$).

Title: Mechanism Design for Public Projects via Neural Networks
Authors: Guanhua Wang, Runqi Guo, Yuko Sakurai, Ali Babar, Mingyu Guo
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  We study mechanism design for nonexcludable and excludable binary public
project problems. We aim to maximize the expected number of consumers and the
expected social welfare. For the nonexcludable public project model, we
identify a sufficient condition on the prior distribution for the conservative
equal costs mechanism to be the optimal strategy-proof and individually
rational mechanism. For general distributions, we propose a dynamic program
that solves for the optimal mechanism. For the excludable public project model,
we identify a similar sufficient condition for the serial cost sharing
mechanism to be optimal for $2$ and $3$ agents. We derive a numerical upper
bound. Experiments show that for several common distributions, the serial cost
sharing mechanism is close to optimality.
  The serial cost sharing mechanism is not optimal in general. We design better
performing mechanisms via neural networks. Our approach involves several
technical innovations that can be applied to mechanism design in general. We
interpret the mechanisms as price-oriented rationing-free (PORF) mechanisms,
which enables us to move the mechanism's complex (e.g., iterative) decision
making off the network, to a separate program. We feed the prior distribution's
analytical form into the cost function to provide quality gradients for
training. We use supervision to manual mechanisms as a systematic way for
initialization. Our approach of "supervision and then gradient descent" is
effective for improving manual mechanisms' performances. It is also effective
for fixing constraint violations for heuristic-based mechanisms that are
infeasible.

Title: Gini Index based Initial Coin Offering Mechanism
Authors: Mingyu Guo, Zhenghui Wang, Yuko Sakurai
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  As a fundraising method, Initial Coin Offering (ICO) has raised billions of
dollars for thousands of startups in the past two years. Existing ICO
mechanisms place more emphasis on the short-term benefits of maximal
fundraising while ignoring the problem of unbalanced token allocation, which
negatively impacts subsequent fundraising and has bad effects on introducing
new investors and resources. We propose a new ICO mechanism which uses the
concept of Gini index for the very first time as a mechanism design constraint
to control allocation inequality. Our mechanism maintains an elegant and
straightforward structure. It allows the agents to modify their bids as a price
discovery process, while limiting the bids of whales. We analyze the agents'
equilibrium behaviors under our mechanism. Under natural technical assumptions,
we show that most agents have simple dominant strategies and the equilibrium
revenue approaches the optimal revenue asymptotically in the number of agents.
We verify our mechanism using real ICO dataset we collected, and confirm that
our mechanism performs well in terms of both allocation fairness and revenue.

Title: Computation of Dynamic Equilibria in Series-Parallel Networks
Authors: Marcus Kaiser
Categories: cs.GT cs.DS math.DS
\\
  We consider dynamic equilibria for flows over time under the fluid queuing
model. In this model, queues on the links of a network take care of flow
propagation. Flow enters the network at a single source and leaves at a single
sink. In a dynamic equilibrium, every infinitesimally small flow particle
reaches the sink as early as possible given the pattern of the rest of the
flow. While this model has been examined for many decades, progress has been
relatively recent. In particular, the derivatives of dynamic equilibria have
been characterized as thin flows with resetting, which allowed for more
structural results. Our two main results are based on the analysis of thin
flows with resetting. We present a constructive proof of existence for dynamic
equilibria if the inflow rate is right-monotone. The complexity of computing
thin flows with resetting, which occurs as a subproblem in this method, is
still open. We settle it for the class of two-terminal series-parallel networks
by giving a recursive algorithm that solves the problem for all flow values
simultaneously in polynomial time.

Title: The Efficiency of Best-Response Dynamics
Authors: Michal Feldman and Yuval Snappir and Tami Tamir
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  Best response (BR) dynamics is a natural method by which players proceed
toward a pure Nash equilibrium via a local search method. The quality of the
equilibrium reached may depend heavily on the order by which players are chosen
to perform their best response moves. A {\em deviator rule} $S$ is a method for
selecting the next deviating player. We provide a measure for quantifying the
performance of different deviator rules. The {\em inefficiency} of a deviator
rule $S$ is the maximum ratio, over all initial profiles $p$, between the
social cost of the worst equilibrium reachable by $S$ from $p$ and the social
cost of the best equilibrium reachable from $p$. This inefficiency always lies
between $1$ and the {\em price of anarchy}.
  We study the inefficiency of various deviator rules in network formation
games and job scheduling games (both are congestion games, where BR dynamics
always converges to a pure NE). For some classes of games, we compute optimal
deviator rules. Furthermore, we define and study a new class of deviator rules,
called {\em local} deviator rules. Such rules choose the next deviator as a
function of a restricted set of parameters, and satisfy a natural condition
called {\em independence of irrelevant players}. We present upper bounds on the
inefficiency of some local deviator rules, and also show that for some classes
of games, no local deviator rule can guarantee inefficiency lower than the
price of anarchy.

\\
  We study fair allocation of indivisible chores (i.e., items with non-positive
value) among agents with additive valuations. An allocation is deemed fair if
it is (approximately) equitable, which means that the disutilities of the
agents are (approximately) equal. Our main theoretical contribution is to show
that there always exists an allocation that is simultaneously equitable up to
one chore (EQ1) and Pareto optimal (PO), and to provide a pseudopolynomial-time
algorithm for computing such an allocation. In addition, we observe that the
Leximin solution---which is known to satisfy a strong form of approximate
equitability in the goods setting---fails to satisfy even EQ1 for chores. It
does, however, satisfy a novel fairness notion that we call equitability up to
any duplicated chore. Our experiments on synthetic as well as real-world data
obtained from the Spliddit website reveal that the algorithms considered in our
work satisfy approximate fairness and efficiency properties significantly more
often than the algorithm currently deployed on Spliddit.

Title: When showing your hand pays off: Announcing strategic intentions in

\\
  In competitive adversarial environments, it is often advantageous to
obfuscate one's strategies or capabilities. However, revealing one's strategic
intentions may shift the dynamics of the competition in complex ways. Can it
ever be advantageous to reveal strategic intentions to an opponent? In this
paper, we consider three-stage Colonel Blotto games in which one player can
choose whether or not to pre-commit resources to a single battlefield before
play begins. This pre-commitment is public knowledge. In response, the opponent
can either secure the battlefield by matching the pre-commitment with its own
forces, or withdraw. In a two-player setting, we show that a weaker player
never has an incentive to pre-commit any amount of resources to a battlefield
regardless of how valuable it is. We then consider a three-player setting in
which two players fight against a common adversary on separate fronts. Only one
of the two players facing the adversary has the option of pre-committing. We
find there are instances where this player benefits from pre-committing. The
analysis indicates that under non-cooperative team settings and no possibility
of forming alliances, there can be incentives to publicly announce one's
strategic intentions to an adversary.

Title: An Optimal Procedure to Check Pareto-Optimality in House Markets with

Categories: cs.GT cs.AI
Comments: Was initially part of our submission arXiv:1906.10250. We followed
  recommendations to make a distinct contribution with this material
\\
  Recently, the problem of allocating one resource per agent with initial
endowments (house markets) has seen a renewed interest: indeed, while in the
domain of strict preferences the Top Trading Cycle algorithm is known to be the
only procedure guaranteeing Pareto-optimality, individual rationality, and
strategy proofness. However, the situation differs in the single-peaked domain.
Indeed, Bade presented the Crawler, an alternative procedure enjoying the same
properties, with the additional advantage of being implementable in obviously
dominant strategies. In this paper we further investigate the Crawler and
propose the Diver, a variant which checks optimally whether an allocation is
Pareto-optimal for single-peaked preferences, thus improving over known
techniques used for checking Pareto-optimality in more general domains. We also
prove that the Diver is asymptotically optimal in terms of communication
complexity.

Title: Achieving Single-Sensor Complex Activity Recognition from Multi-Sensor
  Training Data
Authors: Paula Lago, Moe Matsuki, Sozo Inoue
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 17 pages
\\
  In this study, we propose a method for single sensor-based activity
recognition, trained with data from multiple sensors. There is no doubt that
the performance of complex activity recognition systems increases when we use
enough sensors with sufficient quality, however using such rich sensors may not
be feasible in real-life situations for various reasons such as user comfort,
privacy, battery-preservation, and/or costs. In many cases, only one device
such as a smartphone is available, and it is challenging to achieve high
accuracy with a single sensor, more so for complex activities. Our method
combines representation learning with feature mapping to leverage multiple
sensor information made available during training while using a single sensor
during testing or in real usage. Our results show that the proposed approach
can improve the F1-score of the complex activity recognition by up to 17\%
compared to that in training while utilizing the same sensor data in a new user
scenario.

\\
  Emotional expressions and their changes during an interaction affect heavily
how we perceive and behave towards other persons. To design an HRI scenario
that makes possible to observe, understand, and model affective interactions
and generate the appropriate responses or initiations of a robot is a very
challenging task. In this paper, we report our efforts in designing such a
scenario, and to propose a modeling strategy of affective interaction by
artificial intelligence deployed in autonomous robots. Overall, we present a
novel HRI game scenario that was designed to comply with the specific
requirements that will allow us to develop the next wave of affective-aware
social robots that provide adequate emotional responses.

Title: An Optimal Control Model of Mouse Pointing Using the LQR
Authors: Florian Fischer, Arthur Fleig, Markus Klar, Lars Gruene, Joerg Mueller
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 13 pages (including appendix), 11 figures, one table
\\
  In this paper we explore the Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to model
movement of the mouse pointer. We propose a model in which users are assumed to
behave optimally with respect to a certain cost function. Users try to minimize
the distance of the mouse pointer to the target smoothly and with minimal
effort, by simultaneously minimizing the jerk of the movement. We identify
parameters of our model from a dataset of reciprocal pointing with the mouse.
We compare our model to the classical minimum-jerk and second-order lag models
on data from 12 users with a total of 7702 movements. Our results show that our
approach explains the data significantly better than either of these previous
models.

Title: AutoEmb: Automated Embedding Dimensionality Search in Streaming
  Recommendations
Authors: Xiangyu Zhao, Chong Wang, Ming Chen, Xudong Zheng, Xiaobing Liu, and
  Jiliang Tang
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  Deep learning based recommender systems (DLRSs) often have embedding layers,
which are utilized to lessen the dimensionality of categorical variables (e.g.
user/item identifiers) and meaningfully transform them in the low-dimensional
space. The majority of existing DLRSs empirically pre-define a fixed and
unified dimension for all user/item embeddings. It is evident from recent
researches that different embedding sizes are highly desired for different
users/items according to their popularity. However, manually selecting
embedding sizes in recommender systems can be very challenging due to the large
number of users/items and the dynamic nature of their popularity. Thus, in this
paper, we propose an AutoML based end-to-end framework (AutoEmb), which can
enable various embedding dimensions according to the popularity in an automated
and dynamic manner. To be specific, we first enhance a typical DLRS to allow
various embedding dimensions; then we propose an end-to-end differentiable
framework that can automatically select different embedding dimensions
according to user/item popularity; finally we propose an AutoML based
optimization algorithm in a streaming recommendation setting. The experimental
results based on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of the AutoEmb framework.

Title: Ranking a set of objects: a graph based least-square approach
Authors: Evgenia Christoforou, Alessandro Nordio, Alberto Tarable, Emilio
  Leonardi
Categories: cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  We consider the problem of ranking $N$ objects starting from a set of noisy
pairwise comparisons provided by a crowd of equal workers. We assume that
objects are endowed with intrinsic qualities and that the probability with
which an object is preferred to another depends only on the difference between
the qualities of the two competitors. We propose a class of non-adaptive
ranking algorithms that rely on a least-squares optimization criterion for the
estimation of qualities. Such algorithms are shown to be asymptotically optimal
(i.e., they require $O(\frac{N}{\epsilon^2}\log \frac{N}{\delta})$ comparisons
to be $(\epsilon, \delta)$-PAC). Numerical results show that our schemes are
very efficient also in many non-asymptotic scenarios exhibiting a performance
similar to the maximum-likelihood algorithm. Moreover, we show how they can be
extended to adaptive schemes and test them on real-world datasets.

Title: Mobility and Blockage-aware Communications in Millimeter-Wave Vehicular
  Networks
Authors: Muddassar Hussain, Maria Scalabrin, Michele Rossi, Nicolo Michelusi
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted for Publication in IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology
  (TVT)
\\
  Mobility may degrade the performance of next-generation vehicular networks
operating at the millimeter-wave spectrum: frequent loss of alignment and
blockages require repeated beam training and handover, thus incurring huge
overhead. In this paper, an adaptive and joint design of beam training, data
transmission and handover is proposed, that exploits the mobility process of
mobile users (MUs) and the dynamics of blockages to optimally trade-off
throughput and power consumption. At each time slot, the serving base station
decides to perform either beam training, data communication, or handover when
blockage is detected. The decision problem is cast as a partially observable
Markov decision process, and the goal is to maximize the throughput delivered
to the MU, subject to an average power constraint. To address the high
dimensionality of the problem, an approximate dynamic programming algorithm
based on a variant of PERSEUS [1] is developed, where both the primal and dual
functions are simultaneously optimized to meet the power constraint. Numerical
results show that the PERSEUS-based policy has near-optimal performance, and
achieves a 55% gain in spectral efficiency compared to a baseline scheme with
periodic beam training. Motivated by the structure of the PERSEUS-based policy,
two heuristic policies with lower computational cost are proposed. These are
shown to achieve a performance comparable to that of PERSEUS, with just a 10%
loss in spectral efficiency.

\\
  We consider an Internet of Things (IoT) system in which a sensor observes a
phenomena of interest with exponentially distributed intervals and delivers the
updates to a monitor with the First-come-First-served (FCFS) policy. At the
monitor, the received updates are used to make decisions with deterministic or
random intervals. For this system, we investigate the freshness of the updates
at these decision epochs using the age upon decisions (AuD) metric. Theoretical
results show that 1) when the decisions are made with exponentially distributed
intervals, the average AuD of the system is smaller if the service time (e.g.,
transmission time) is uniformly distributed than when it is exponentially
distributed, and would be the smallest if it is deterministic; 2)when the
decisions are made periodically, the average AuD of the system is larger than,
and decreases with decision rate to, the average AuD of the corresponding
system with Poisson decision intervals; 3)the probability of missing to use a
received update for any decisions is decreasing with the decision rate, and is
the smallest if the service time is deterministic. For IoT monitoring systems,
therefore, it is suggested to use deterministic monitoring schemes,
deterministic transmitting schemes, and Poisson decision schemes, so that the
received updates are as fresh as possible at the time they are used to make
decisions.

Title: Symmetric uncoded caching schemes with low subpacketization levels
Authors: Tai Do Duc, Shuo Shao, Chaoping Xing
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Caching is a commonly used technique in content-delivery networks which aims
to deliver information from hosting servers to users in the most efficient way.
In 2014, Maddah-Ali and Niessen formulated caching into a formal information
theoretic problem and it has gained a lot of attention since then. It is known
that the caching schemes proposed by Ali-Niesen and Yu et. al. are optimal,
that is, they require the least number of transmissions from the server to
satisfy all users' demands. However for these schemes to work, each file needs
to be partitioned into $F^*$ subfiles ($F^*$ is called the subpacketization
level of files) with $F^*$ growing exponentially in the number $K$ of users. As
a result, it is problematic to apply these schemes in practical situations,
where $K$ tends to be very large. There rise the following questions: (1) are
there optimal schemes in which each file is partitioned into $F$ subfiles,
where $F$ is not exponential, say polynomial for example, in $K$? (2) if the
answer to this question is no, is there a near-optimal scheme, a scheme which
is as asymptotically good as the one in \cite{ali1,yu}, with $F$ polynomial in
$K$? Both these questions are open.
  Our main contribution in this paper is to provide answers to above questions.
Firstly, we prove that under some mild restriction on user's cache rate, there
are no optimal schemes with $F$ smaller than $F^*$. Moreover, we give necessary
and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal schemes in this case.
Secondly, we provide an affirmative answer to the second question raised above
by an explicit construction and a detailed performance analysis.

Title: Polar-Slotted ALOHA over Slot Erasure Channels
Authors: Zhijun Zhang, Kai Niu, Jincheng Dai, and Chao Dong
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures
\\
  In this paper, we design a new polar slotted ALOHA (PSA) protocol over the
slot erasure channels, which uses polar coding to construct the identical slot
pattern (SP) assembles within each active user and base station. A theoretical
analysis framework for the PSA is provided. First, by using the packet-oriented
operation for the overlap packets when they conflict in a slot interval, we
introduce the packet-based polarization transform and prove that this transform
is independent of the packet's length. Second, guided by the packet-based
polarization, an SP assignment (SPA) method with the variable slot erasure
probability (SEP) and a SPA method with a fixed SEP value are designed for the
PSA scheme. Then, a packet-oriented successive cancellation (pSC) and a pSC
list (pSCL) decoding algorithm are developed. Simultaneously, the finite-slots
throughput bounds and the asymptotic throughput for the pSC algorithm are
analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed PSA scheme can achieve
an improved throughput with the pSC/SCL decoding algorithm over the traditional
repetition slotted ALOHA scheme.

\\
  The objective of the Enhanced Mobile Broadband use case in 5G networks is to
deliver high capacity access to densely populated areas, like city centres,
transportation hubs or convention centres. Millimetre-wave communications are
the go-to technology to realise that objective, yet due to weak
outdoor-to-indoor penetration, outdoor deployments will not suffice and
dedicated indoor deployments will be necessary. In this article, we study dense
deployments of millimetre-wave access points mounted on the ceiling, with
directional antennas pointing downwards to illuminate selected spots on the
ground. In this setup, the signal propagation is primarily limited by human
body blockages. Therefore, we develop a body blockage model and derive an
expression for the probability of blockage. Using the developed expressions and
our simulation framework, we assess the impact of densification and body
blockage on the achievable performance. We find that both coverage and area
spectral efficiency curves exhibit non-trivial behaviour with respect to the
access point density and that there is an optimal beamwidth-density
configuration that only maximises either coverage or area spectral efficiency.
Such optimal configuration changes depending on the body blockage probability,
leading to a necessity for network designers to carefully consider their
intended application and scenario.

Title: Ultra Reliable Communication via Optimum Power Allocation for HARQ
  Retransmission Schemes
Authors: Endrit Dosti, Mohammad Shehab, Hirley Alves and Matti Latva-aho
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1701.08617
\\
  In this work, we develop low complexity, optimal power allocation algorithms
that would allow ultra reliable operation at any outage probability target with
minimum power consumption in the finite blocklength regime by utilizing
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In our setup, we assume that the
transmitter does not know the channel state information (CSI). First, we show
that achieving a very low packet outage probability by using an open loop setup
requires extremely high power consumption. Thus, we resort to retransmission
schemes as a solution, namely Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ), Chase Combining
Hybrid ARQ (CC-HARQ) and Incremental Redundancy (IR) HARQ. Countrary to
classical approaches, where it is optimal to allocate equal power with each
transmission, we show that for operation in the ultra reliable regime (URR),
the optimal strategy suggests transmission with incremental power in each
round. Numerically, we evaluate the power gains of the proposed protocol. We
show that the best power saving is given by IR-HARQ protocol. Further, we show
that when compared to the one shot transmission, these protocols enable large
average and maximum power gains. Finally, we show that the larger the number of
transmissions is, the larger power gains will be attained.

  In this work, we define composite matrices which are derived from group
rings. We extend the idea of G-codes to composite G-codes. We show that these
codes are ideals in a group ring, where the ring is a finite commutative
Frobenius ring and G is an arbitrary finite group. We prove that the dual of a
composite G-code is also a composite G-code. We define quasi-composite G-codes
and give a construction of these codes. We also study generator matrices, which
consist of the identity matrices and the composite matrices. Together with the
generator matrices, the well known extension method, the neighbour method and
its generalization, we find extremal binary self-dual codes of length 68 with
new weight enumerators for the rare parameters gamma=7,8 and 9. In particular,
we find 49 new such codes. Moreover, we show that the codes we find are
inaccessible from other constructions.

Title: Dynamic Incentive-aware Learning: Robust Pricing in Contextual Auctions

Categories: cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML
Comments: Accepted for publication in Operations Research Journal (An earlier
  version of this paper accepted to NeurIPS 2019.)
\\
  Motivated by pricing in ad exchange markets, we consider the problem of
robust learning of reserve prices against strategic buyers in repeated
contextual second-price auctions. Buyers' valuations for an item depend on the
context that describes the item. However, the seller is not aware of the
relationship between the context and buyers' valuations, i.e., buyers'
preferences. The seller's goal is to design a learning policy to set reserve
prices via observing the past sales data, and her objective is to minimize her
regret for revenue, where the regret is computed against a clairvoyant policy
that knows buyers' heterogeneous preferences. Given the seller's goal,
utility-maximizing buyers have the incentive to bid untruthfully in order to
manipulate the seller's learning policy. We propose learning policies that are
robust to such strategic behavior. These policies use the outcomes of the
auctions, rather than the submitted bids, to estimate the preferences while
controlling the long-term effect of the outcome of each auction on the future
reserve prices. When the market noise distribution is known to the seller, we
propose a policy called Contextual Robust Pricing (CORP) that achieves a
T-period regret of $O(d\log(Td) \log (T))$, where $d$ is the dimension of {the}
contextual information. When the market noise distribution is unknown to the
seller, we propose two policies whose regrets are sublinear in $T$.

Title: TxSim:Modeling Training of Deep Neural Networks on Resistive Crossbar
  Systems
Authors: Sourjya Roy, Shrihari Sridharan, Shubham Jain, and Anand Raghunathan
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  Resistive crossbars have attracted significant interest in the design of Deep
Neural Network (DNN) accelerators due to their ability to natively execute
massively parallel vector-matrix multiplications within dense memory arrays.
However, crossbar-based computations face a major challenge due to a variety of
device and circuit-level non-idealities, which manifest as errors in the
vector-matrix multiplications and eventually degrade DNN accuracy. To address
this challenge, there is a need for tools that can model the functional impact
of non-idealities on DNN training and inference. Existing efforts towards this
goal are either limited to inference, or are too slow to be used for
large-scale DNN training. We propose TxSim, a fast and customizable modeling
framework to functionally evaluate DNN training on crossbar-based hardware
considering the impact of non-idealities. The key features of TxSim that
differentiate it from prior efforts are: (i) It comprehensively models
non-idealities during all training operations (forward propagation, backward
propagation, and weight update) and (ii) it achieves computational efficiency
by mapping crossbar evaluations to well-optimized BLAS routines and
incorporates speedup techniques to further reduce simulation time with minimal
impact on accuracy. TxSim achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in
simulation speed over prior works, and thereby makes it feasible to evaluate
training of large-scale DNNs on crossbars. Our experiments using TxSim reveal
that the accuracy degradation in DNN training due to non-idealities can be
substantial (3%-10%) for large-scale DNNs, underscoring the need for further
research in mitigation techniques. We also analyze the impact of various device
and circuit-level parameters and the associated non-idealities to provide key
insights that can guide the design of crossbar-based DNN training accelerators.

Title: A Sample Complexity Separation between Non-Convex and Convex
  Meta-Learning
Authors: Nikunj Saunshi, Yi Zhang, Mikhail Khodak, Sanjeev Arora
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 34 pages
\\
  One popular trend in meta-learning is to learn from many training tasks a
common initialization for a gradient-based method that can be used to solve a
new task with few samples. The theory of meta-learning is still in its early
stages, with several recent learning-theoretic analyses of methods such as
Reptile [Nichol et al., 2018] being for convex models. This work shows that
convex-case analysis might be insufficient to understand the success of
meta-learning, and that even for non-convex models it is important to look
inside the optimization black-box, specifically at properties of the
optimization trajectory. We construct a simple meta-learning instance that
captures the problem of one-dimensional subspace learning. For the convex
formulation of linear regression on this instance, we show that the new task
sample complexity of any initialization-based meta-learning algorithm is
$\Omega(d)$, where $d$ is the input dimension. In contrast, for the non-convex
formulation of a two layer linear network on the same instance, we show that
both Reptile and multi-task representation learning can have new task sample
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, demonstrating a separation from convex
meta-learning. Crucially, analyses of the training dynamics of these methods
reveal that they can meta-learn the correct subspace onto which the data should
be projected.

Title: Reliable Estimation of Kullback-Leibler Divergence by Controlling
  Discriminator Complexity in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
Authors: Sandesh Ghimire, Prashnna K Gyawali, Linwei Wang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Several scalable methods to compute the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence
between two distributions using their samples have been proposed and applied in
large-scale machine learning models. While they have been found to be unstable,
the theoretical root cause of the problem is not clear. In this paper, we study
in detail a generative adversarial network based approach that uses a neural
network discriminator to estimate KL divergence. We argue that, in such case,
high fluctuations in the estimates are a consequence of not controlling the
complexity of the discriminator function space. We provide a theoretical
underpinning and remedy for this problem through the following contributions.
First, we construct a discriminator in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
(RKHS). This enables us to leverage sample complexity and mean embedding to
theoretically relate the error probability bound of the KL estimates to the
complexity of the neural-net discriminator. Based on this theory, we then
present a scalable way to control the complexity of the discriminator for a
consistent estimation of KL divergence. We support both our proposed theory and
method to control the complexity of the RKHS discriminator in controlled
experiments.

Title: EmbPred30: Assessing 30-days Readmission for Diabetic Patients using
  Categorical Embeddings
Authors: Sarthak, Shikhar Shukla, Surya Prakash Tripathi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Hospital readmission is a crucial healthcare quality measure that helps in
determining the level of quality of care that a hospital offers to a patient
and has proven to be immensely expensive. It is estimated that more than $25
billion are spent yearly due to readmission of diabetic patients in the USA.
This paper benchmarks existing models and proposes a new embedding based
state-of-the-art deep neural network(DNN). The model can identify whether a
hospitalized diabetic patient will be readmitted within 30 days or not with an
accuracy of 95.2% and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics(AUROC)
of 97.4% on data collected from 130 US hospitals between 1999-2008. The results
are encouraging with patients having changes in medication while admitted
having a high chance of getting readmitted. Identifying prospective patients

Title: Convex Geometry and Duality of Over-parameterized Neural Networks
Authors: Tolga Ergen, Mert Pilanci
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We develop a convex analytic framework for ReLU neural networks which
elucidates the inner workings of hidden neurons and their function space
characteristics. We show that neural networks with rectified linear units act
as convex regularizers, where simple solutions are encouraged via extreme
points of a certain convex set. For one dimensional regression and
classification, as well as rank-one data matrices, we prove that finite
two-layer ReLU networks with norm regularization yield linear spline
interpolation. We characterize the classification decision regions in terms of
a closed form kernel matrix and minimum L1 norm solutions. This is in contrast
to Neural Tangent Kernel which is unable to explain neural network predictions
with finitely many neurons. Our convex geometric description also provides
intuitive explanations of hidden neurons as auto-encoders. In higher
dimensions, we show that the training problem for two-layer networks can be
cast as a convex optimization problem with infinitely many constraints. We then
provide a family of convex relaxations to approximate the solution, and a
cutting-plane algorithm to improve the relaxations. We derive conditions for
the exactness of the relaxations and provide simple closed form formulas for
the optimal neural network weights in certain cases. We also establish a
connection to $\ell_0$-$\ell_1$ equivalence for neural networks analogous to
the minimal cardinality solutions in compressed sensing. Extensive experimental
results show that the proposed approach yields interpretable and accurate
models.

\\
  The time it takes for a classifier to make an accurate prediction can be
crucial in many behaviour recognition problems. For example, an autonomous
vehicle should detect hazardous pedestrian behaviour early enough for it to
take appropriate measures. In this context, we compare the switching linear
dynamical system (SLDS) and a three-layered bi-directional long short-term
memory (LSTM) neural network, which are applied to infer pedestrian behaviour
from motion tracks. We show that, though the neural network model achieves an
accuracy of 80%, it requires long sequences to achieve this (100 samples or
more). The SLDS, has a lower accuracy of 74%, but it achieves this result with
short sequences (10 samples). To our knowledge, such a comparison on sequence
length has not been considered in the literature before. The results provide a
key intuition of the suitability of the models in time-critical problems.

Title: Attacks Which Do Not Kill Training Make Adversarial Learning Stronger
Authors: Jingfeng Zhang, Xilie Xu, Bo Han, Gang Niu, Lizhen Cui, Masashi
  Sugiyama, Mohan Kankanhalli
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Adversarial training based on the minimax formulation is necessary for
obtaining adversarial robustness of trained models. However, it is conservative
or even pessimistic so that it sometimes hurts the natural generalization. In
this paper, we raise a fundamental question---do we have to trade off natural
generalization for adversarial robustness? We argue that adversarial training
is to employ confident adversarial data for updating the current model. We
propose a novel approach of friendly adversarial training (FAT): rather than
employing most adversarial data maximizing the loss, we search for least
adversarial (i.e., friendly adversarial) data minimizing the loss, among the
adversarial data that are confidently misclassified. Our novel formulation is
easy to implement by just stopping the most adversarial data searching
algorithms such as PGD (projected gradient descent) early, which we call
early-stopped PGD. Theoretically, FAT is justified by an upper bound of the
adversarial risk. Empirically, early-stopped PGD allows us to answer the
earlier question negatively---adversarial robustness can indeed be achieved
without compromising the natural generalization.

Title: Supervised Categorical Metric Learning with Schatten p-Norms
Authors: Xuhui Fan, Eric Gaussier
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML

  Metric learning has been successful in learning new metrics adapted to

further exploration. In this paper, we propose a method, called CPML for
\emph{categorical projected metric learning}, that tries to efficiently~(i.e.
less computational time and better prediction accuracy) address the problem of
metric learning in categorical data. We make use of the Value Distance Metric
to represent our data and propose new distances based on this representation.
We then show how to efficiently learn new metrics. We also generalize several
previous regularizers through the Schatten $p$-norm and provides a
generalization bound for it that complements the standard generalization bound
for metric learning. Experimental results show that our method provides

\\
  The recent breakthroughs in deep neural networks (DNNs) have spurred a
tremendously increased demand for DNN accelerators. However, designing DNN
accelerators is non-trivial as it often takes months/years and requires
cross-disciplinary knowledge. To enable fast and effective DNN accelerator
development, we propose DNN-Chip Predictor, an analytical performance predictor
which can accurately predict DNN accelerators' energy, throughput, and latency
prior to their actual implementation. Our Predictor features two highlights:
(1) its analytical performance formulation of DNN ASIC/FPGA accelerators
facilitates fast design space exploration and optimization; and (2) it supports
DNN accelerators with different algorithm-to-hardware mapping methods (i.e.,
dataflows) and hardware architectures. Experiment results based on 2 DNN models
and 3 different ASIC/FPGA implementations show that our DNN-Chip Predictor's
predicted performance differs from those of chip measurements of FPGA/ASIC
implementation by no more than 17.66% when using different DNN models, hardware
architectures, and dataflows. We will release code upon acceptance.

Title: Sparse Sinkhorn Attention

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  We propose Sparse Sinkhorn Attention, a new efficient and sparse method for
learning to attend. Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal
representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to
generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are
then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving
the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new
algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a
dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for
encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic
seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document
classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory
efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and
consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as
Sparse Transformers.

Title: PaDGAN: A Generative Adversarial Network for Performance Augmented
  Diverse Designs
Authors: Wei Chen, Faez Ahmed
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep generative models are proven to be a useful tool for automatic design
synthesis and design space exploration. When applied in engineering design,
existing generative models face two challenges: 1) generated designs lack
diversity and do not cover all areas of the design space and 2) it is difficult
to explicitly improve the overall performance or quality of generated designs
without excluding low-quality designs from the dataset, which may impair the
performance of the trained model due to reduced training sample size. In this
paper, we simultaneously address these challenges by proposing a new
Determinantal Point Processes based loss function for probabilistic modeling of
diversity and quality. With this new loss function, we develop a variant of the
Generative Adversarial Network, named "Performance Augmented Diverse Generative
Adversarial Network" or PaDGAN, which can generate novel high-quality designs
with good coverage of the design space. We demonstrate that PaDGAN can generate
diverse and high-quality designs on both synthetic and real-world examples and
compare PaDGAN against other models such as the vanilla GAN and the BezierGAN.
Unlike typical generative models that usually generate new designs by
interpolating within the boundary of training data, we show that PaDGAN expands
the design space boundary towards high-quality regions. The proposed method is
broadly applicable to many tasks including design space exploration, design
optimization, and creative solution recommendation.

Title: Invariance vs. Robustness of Neural Networks
Authors: Sandesh Kamath, Amit Deshpande, K V Subrahmanyam
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE stat.ML
Comments: Preliminary version presented in ICML 2018 Workshop on "Towards
  learning with limited labels: Equivariance, Invariance,and Beyond" as
  "Understanding Adversarial Robustness of Symmetric Networks"
\\
  We study the performance of neural network models on random geometric
transformations and adversarial perturbations. Invariance means that the
model's prediction remains unchanged when a geometric transformation is applied
to an input. Adversarial robustness means that the model's prediction remains
unchanged after small adversarial perturbations of an input. In this paper, we
show a quantitative trade-off between rotation invariance and robustness. We
empirically study the following two cases: (a) change in adversarial robustness
as we improve only the invariance of equivariant models via training
augmentation, (b) change in invariance as we improve only the adversarial
robustness using adversarial training. We observe that the rotation invariance
of equivariant models (StdCNNs and GCNNs) improves by training augmentation
with progressively larger random rotations but while doing so, their
adversarial robustness drops progressively, and very significantly on MNIST. We
take adversarially trained LeNet and ResNet models which have good $L_\infty$
adversarial robustness on MNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively, and observe that
adversarial training with progressively larger perturbations results in a
progressive drop in their rotation invariance profiles. Similar to the
trade-off between accuracy and robustness known in previous work, we give a
theoretical justification for the invariance vs. robustness trade-off observed
in our experiments.

Title: Convergence to Second-Order Stationarity for Non-negative Matrix
  Factorization: Provably and Concurrently
Authors: Ioannis Panageas and Stratis Skoulakis and Antonios Varvitsiotis and
  Xiao Wang
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a fundamental non-convex
optimization problem with numerous applications in Machine Learning (music
analysis, document clustering, speech-source separation etc). Despite having
received extensive study, it is poorly understood whether or not there exist
natural algorithms that can provably converge to a local minimum. Part of the
reason is because the objective is heavily symmetric and its gradient is not
Lipschitz. In this paper we define a multiplicative weight update type dynamics
(modification of the seminal Lee-Seung algorithm) that runs concurrently and
provably avoids saddle points (first order stationary points that are not
second order). Our techniques combine tools from dynamical systems such as
stability and exploit the geometry of the NMF objective by reducing the
standard NMF formulation over the non-negative orthant to a new formulation
over (a scaled) simplex. An important advantage of our method is the use of
concurrent updates, which permits implementations in parallel computing
environments.

Title: Rethinking Bias-Variance Trade-off for Generalization of Neural Networks
Authors: Zitong Yang, Yaodong Yu, Chong You, Jacob Steinhardt, Yi Ma
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The classical bias-variance trade-off predicts that bias decreases and
variance increase with model complexity, leading to a U-shaped risk curve.
Recent work calls this into question for neural networks and other
over-parameterized models, for which it is often observed that larger models
generalize better. We provide a simple explanation for this by measuring the
bias and variance of neural networks: while the bias is monotonically
decreasing as in the classical theory, the variance is unimodal or bell-shaped:
it increases then decreases with the width of the network. We vary the network
architecture, loss function, and choice of dataset and confirm that variance
unimodality occurs robustly for all models we considered. The risk curve is the
sum of the bias and variance curves and displays different qualitative shapes
depending on the relative scale of bias and variance, with the double descent
curve observed in recent literature as a special case. We corroborate these
empirical results with a theoretical analysis of two-layer linear networks with
random first layer. Finally, evaluation on out-of-distribution data shows that
most of the drop in accuracy comes from increased bias while variance increases
by a relatively small amount. Moreover, we find that deeper models decrease
bias and increase variance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
data.

Title: Structured Linear Contextual Bandits: A Sharp and Geometric Smoothed
  Analysis
Authors: Vidyashankar Sivakumar, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Arindam Banerjee
Categories: cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  Bandit learning algorithms typically involve the balance of exploration and
exploitation. However, in many practical applications, worst-case scenarios
needing systematic exploration are seldom encountered. In this work, we
consider a smoothed setting for structured linear contextual bandits where the
adversarial contexts are perturbed by Gaussian noise and the unknown parameter
$\theta^*$ has structure, e.g., sparsity, group sparsity, low rank, etc. We
propose simple greedy algorithms for both the single- and multi-parameter
(i.e., different parameter for each context) settings and provide a unified
regret analysis for $\theta^*$ with any assumed structure. The regret bounds
are expressed in terms of geometric quantities such as Gaussian widths
associated with the structure of $\theta^*$. We also obtain sharper regret
bounds compared to earlier work for the unstructured $\theta^*$ setting as a
consequence of our improved analysis. We show there is implicit exploration in
the smoothed setting where a simple greedy algorithm works.

Title: Understanding Self-Training for Gradual Domain Adaptation
Authors: Ananya Kumar, Tengyu Ma, Percy Liang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Machine learning systems must adapt to data distributions that evolve over
time, in applications ranging from sensor networks and self-driving car
perception modules to brain-machine interfaces. We consider gradual domain
adaptation, where the goal is to adapt an initial classifier trained on a
source domain given only unlabeled data that shifts gradually in distribution
towards a target domain. We prove the first non-vacuous upper bound on the
error of self-training with gradual shifts, under settings where directly
adapting to the target domain can result in unbounded error. The theoretical
analysis leads to algorithmic insights, highlighting that regularization and
label sharpening are essential even when we have infinite data, and suggesting
that self-training works particularly well for shifts with small
Wasserstein-infinity distance. Leveraging the gradual shift structure leads to
higher accuracies on a rotating MNIST dataset and a realistic Portraits
dataset.

Title: Lipschitz standardization for robust multivariate learning
Authors: Adri\'an Javaloy, Isabel Valera
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Current trends in machine learning rely on out-of-the-box gradient-based
approaches. With the aim of mitigating numerical errors and to improve the
convergence of the learning process, a common empirical practice is to
standardize or normalize the data. However, there is a lack of theoretical
analysis regarding why and when these methods result in an improvement of the
learning process. In this work, we first study these methods in the context of
black-box variational inference, specifically analyzing the effect that scaling
the data has on the smoothness of the optimization landscape. Our analysis
shows that no general rule applies in order to decide which of the existing
data scaling methods, or even if they, will improve the learning process.
Second, we highlight the issues that arise when dealing with multivariate data,
due to the discrepancy in smoothness of the likelihood functions for different
variables, and the inability to scale discrete data. Finally, we propose a
novel Lipschitz standardization, and its extension for discrete data, which
overcomes the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, as backed by our
experiments, Lipschitz standardization i) favors a fairer learning across
different variables in the data; and ii) results in faster and more accurate
learning.

  Driver distraction a significant risk to driving safety. Apart from spatial
domain, research on temporal inattention is also necessary. In this paper, we
propose an actor-critic method - Attention-based Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic policy gradient (ATD3) algorithm to approximate a driver's action
according to observations and measure the driver's attention allocation for
consecutive time steps in car-following model. Considering reaction time, we
construct the attention mechanism in the actor network to capture temporal
dependencies of consecutive observations. In the critic network, we employ Twin
Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) to address
overestimated value estimates persisting in the actor-critic algorithm. We
conduct experiments on real-world vehicle trajectory datasets and show that the
accuracy of our proposed approach outperforms seven baseline algorithms.
Moreover, the results reveal that the attention of the drivers in smooth
vehicles is uniformly distributed in previous observations while they keep
their attention to recent observations when sudden decreases of relative speeds
occur. This study is the first contribution to drivers' temporal attention.

  Neural networks are important tools for data-intensive analysis and are
commonly applied to model non-linear relationships between dependent and
independent variables. However, neural networks are usually seen as "black

predict the response in a fitted model. This article describes the

neural networks using the partial derivatives method. Functions in the package
can be used to obtain the sensitivities of the output with respect to the input
variables, evaluate variable importance based on sensitivity measures and
characterize relationships between input and output variables. Methods to
calculate sensitivities are provided for objects from common neural network

models, a theoretical foundation of how are calculated the partial derivatives
of the output with respect to the inputs of a multi-layer perceptron model, a

Title: Non-Asymptotic Bounds for Zeroth-Order Stochastic Optimization
Authors: Nirav Bhavsar and Prashanth L A
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  We consider the problem of optimizing an objective function with and without
convexity in a simulation-optimization context, where only stochastic
zeroth-order information is available. We consider two techniques for
estimating gradient/Hessian, namely simultaneous perturbation (SP) and Gaussian
smoothing (GS). We introduce an optimization oracle to capture a setting where
the function measurements have an estimation error that can be controlled. Our
oracle is appealing in several practical contexts where the objective has to be
estimated from i.i.d. samples, and increasing the number of samples reduces the
estimation error. In the stochastic non-convex optimization context, we analyze
the zeroth-order variant of the randomized stochastic gradient (RSG) and
quasi-Newton (RSQN) algorithms with a biased gradient/Hessian oracle, and with
its variant involving an estimation error component. In particular, we provide
non-asymptotic bounds on the performance of both algorithms, and our results
provide a guideline for choosing the batch size for estimation, so that the
overall error bound matches with the one obtained when there is no estimation
error. Next, in the stochastic convex optimization setting, we provide
non-asymptotic bounds that hold in expectation for the last iterate of a
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, and our bound for the GS variant
of SGD matches the bound for SGD with unbiased gradient information. We perform
simulation experiments on synthetic as well as real-world datasets, and the
empirical results validate the theoretical findings.

Title: DeBayes: a Bayesian method for debiasing network embeddings
Authors: Maarten Buyl, Tijl De Bie
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  As machine learning algorithms are increasingly deployed for high-impact
automated decision making, ethical and increasingly also legal standards demand
that they treat all individuals fairly, without discrimination based on their
age, gender, race or other sensitive traits. In recent years much progress has
been made on ensuring fairness and reducing bias in standard machine learning
settings. Yet, for network embedding, with applications in vulnerable domains
ranging from social network analysis to recommender systems, current options
remain limited both in number and performance. We thus propose DeBayes: a
conceptually elegant Bayesian method that is capable of learning debiased
embeddings by using a biased prior. Our experiments show that these
representations can then be used to perform link prediction that is
significantly more fair in terms of popular metrics such as demographic parity
and equalized opportunity.

Title: Dual Graph Representation Learning
Authors: Huiling Zhu, Xin Luo, and Hankz Hankui Zhuo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Graph representation learning embeds nodes in large graphs as low-dimensional
vectors and is of great benefit to many downstream applications. Most embedding
frameworks, however, are inherently transductive and unable to generalize to
unseen nodes or learn representations across different graphs. Although
inductive approaches can generalize to unseen nodes, they neglect different
contexts of nodes and cannot learn node embeddings dually. In this paper, we
present a context-aware unsupervised dual encoding framework, \textbf{CADE}, to
generate representations of nodes by combining real-time neighborhoods with
neighbor-attentioned representation, and preserving extra memory of known
nodes. We exhibit that our approach is effective by comparing to
state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Decidability of Sample Complexity of PAC Learning in finite setting
Authors: Alberto Gandolfi
Categories: cs.LG cs.LO stat.ML
MSC-class: 68Q32, 68T05, 03B25, 14P10
\\
  In this short note we observe that the sample complexity of PAC machine
learning of various concepts, including learning the maximum (EMX), can be
exactly determined when the support of the probability measures considered as
models satisfies an a-priori bound. This result contrasts with the recently
discovered undecidability of EMX within ZFC for finitely supported
probabilities (with no a priori bound). Unfortunately, the decision procedure
is at present, at least doubly exponential in the number of points times the
uniform bound on the support size.

Title: A Survey towards Federated Semi-supervised Learning
Authors: Yilun Jin, Xiguang Wei, Yang Liu, Qiang Yang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The success of Artificial Intelligence (AI) should be largely attributed to
the accessibility of abundant data. However, this is not exactly the case in
reality, where it is common for developers in industry to face insufficient,
incomplete and isolated data. Consequently, federated learning was proposed to
alleviate such challenges by allowing multiple parties to collaboratively build
machine learning models without explicitly sharing their data and in the
meantime, preserve data privacy. However, existing algorithms of federated
learning mainly focus on examples where, either the data do not require
explicit labeling, or all data are labeled. Yet in reality, we are often
confronted with the case that labeling data itself is costly and there is no
sufficient supply of labeled data. While such issues are commonly solved by
semi-supervised learning, to the best of knowledge, no existing effort has been
put to federated semi-supervised learning. In this survey, we briefly summarize
prevalent semi-supervised algorithms and make a brief prospect into federated
semi-supervised learning, including possible methodologies, settings and
challenges.

Title: Randomization matters. How to defend against strong adversarial attacks
Authors: Rafael Pinot, Raphael Ettedgui, Geovani Rizk, Yann Chevaleyre, Jamal
  Atif
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Is there a classifier that ensures optimal robustness against all adversarial
attacks? This paper answers this question by adopting a game-theoretic point of
view. We show that adversarial attacks and defenses form an infinite zero-sum
game where classical results (e.g. Sion theorem) do not apply. We demonstrate
the non-existence of a Nash equilibrium in our game when the classifier and the
Adversary are both deterministic, hence giving a negative answer to the above
question in the deterministic regime. Nonetheless, the question remains open in
the randomized regime. We tackle this problem by showing that, undermild
conditions on the dataset distribution, any deterministic classifier can be
outperformed by a randomized one. This gives arguments for using randomization,
and leads us to a new algorithm for building randomized classifiers that are
robust to strong adversarial attacks. Empirical results validate our
theoretical analysis, and show that our defense method considerably outperforms
Adversarial Training against state-of-the-art attacks.

Title: Overfitting in adversarially robust deep learning
Authors: Leslie Rice, Eric Wong, J. Zico Kolter
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  It is common practice in deep learning to use overparameterized networks and
train for as long as possible; there are numerous studies that show, both
theoretically and empirically, that such practices surprisingly do not unduly
harm the generalization performance of the classifier. In this paper, we
empirically study this phenomenon in the setting of adversarially trained deep
networks, which are trained to minimize the loss under worst-case adversarial
perturbations. We find that overfitting to the training set does in fact harm
robust performance to a very large degree in adversarially robust training
across multiple datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet) and
perturbation models ($\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$). Based upon this observed
effect, we show that the performance gains of virtually all recent algorithmic
improvements upon adversarial training can be matched by simply using early
stopping. We also show that effects such as the double descent curve do still
occur in adversarially trained models, yet fail to explain the observed
overfitting. Finally, we study several classical and modern deep learning
remedies for overfitting, including regularization and data augmentation, and
find that no approach in isolation improves significantly upon the gains
achieved by early stopping. All code for reproducing the experiments as well as
pretrained model weights and training logs can be found at

Title: NestedVAE: Isolating Common Factors via Weak Supervision
Authors: Matthew J. Vowels, Necati Cihan Camgoz and Richard Bowden
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Fair and unbiased machine learning is an important and active field of
research, as decision processes are increasingly driven by models that learn
from data. Unfortunately, any biases present in the data may be learned by the
model, thereby inappropriately transferring that bias into the decision making
process. We identify the connection between the task of bias reduction and that
of isolating factors common between domains whilst encouraging domain specific
invariance. To isolate the common factors we combine the theory of deep latent
variable models with information bottleneck theory for scenarios whereby data
may be naturally paired across domains and no additional supervision is
required. The result is the Nested Variational AutoEncoder (NestedVAE). Two
outer VAEs with shared weights attempt to reconstruct the input and infer a
latent space, whilst a nested VAE attempts to reconstruct the latent
representation of one image, from the latent representation of its paired
image. In so doing, the nested VAE isolates the common latent factors/causes
and becomes invariant to unwanted factors that are not shared between paired
images. We also propose a new metric to provide a balanced method of evaluating
consistency and classifier performance across domains which we refer to as the
Adjusted Parity metric. An evaluation of NestedVAE on both domain and attribute
invariance, change detection, and learning common factors for the prediction of
biological sex demonstrates that NestedVAE significantly outperforms
alternative methods.

Title: Recommendation on a Budget: Column Space Recovery from Partially
  Observed Entries with Random or Active Sampling
Authors: C. Kim, M. Bayati
Categories: cs.LG cs.IR stat.ML
Comments: A shorter version is accepted to AISTATS
\\
  We analyze alternating minimization for column space recovery of a partially
observed, approximately low rank matrix with a growing number of columns and a
fixed budget of observations per column. In this work, we prove that if the
budget is greater than the rank of the matrix, column space recovery succeeds
-- as the number of columns grows, the estimate from alternating minimization
converges to the true column space with probability tending to one. From our
proof techniques, we naturally formulate an active sampling strategy for
choosing entries of a column that is theoretically and empirically (on
synthetic and real data) better than the commonly studied uniformly random
sampling strategy.

Title: Differentially Private Mean Embeddings with Random Features (DP-MERF)
  for Simple & Practical Synthetic Data Generation
Authors: Frederik Harder, Kamil Adamczewski, Mijung Park
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We present a differentially private data generation paradigm using random
feature representations of kernel mean embeddings when comparing the
distribution of true data with that of synthetic data. We exploit the random
feature representations for two important benefits. First, we require a very
low privacy cost for training deep generative models. This is because unlike
kernel-based distance metrics that require computing the kernel matrix on all
pairs of true and synthetic data points, we can detach the data-dependent term
from the term solely dependent on synthetic data. Hence, we need to perturb the
data-dependent term once-for-all and then use it until the end of the generator
training. Second, we can obtain an analytic sensitivity of the kernel mean
embedding as the random features are norm bounded by construction. This removes
the necessity of hyperparameter search for a clipping norm to handle the
unknown sensitivity of an encoder network when dealing with high-dimensional
data. We provide several variants of our algorithm, differentially private mean
embeddings with random features (DP-MERF) to generate (a) heterogeneous tabular
data, (b) input features and corresponding labels jointly; and (c)
high-dimensional data. Our algorithm achieves better privacy-utility trade-offs
than existing methods tested on several datasets.

Title: Online Learning in Contextual Bandits using Gated Linear Networks
Authors: Eren Sezener, Marcus Hutter, David Budden, Jianan Wang, Joel Veness
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  We introduce a new and completely online contextual bandit algorithm called
Gated Linear Contextual Bandits (GLCB). This algorithm is based on Gated Linear
Networks (GLNs), a recently introduced deep learning architecture with
properties well-suited to the online setting. Leveraging data-dependent gating
properties of the GLN we are able to estimate prediction uncertainty with
effectively zero algorithmic overhead. We empirically evaluate GLCB compared to
9 state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage deep neural networks, on a standard
benchmark suite of discrete and continuous contextual bandit problems. GLCB
obtains median first-place despite being the only online method, and we further
support these results with a theoretical study of its convergence properties.

Title: The Differentially Private Lottery Ticket Mechanism

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose the differentially private lottery ticket mechanism (DPLTM). An
end-to-end differentially private training paradigm based on the lottery ticket
hypothesis. Using "high-quality winners", selected via our custom score
function, DPLTM significantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off over the
state-of-the-art. We show that DPLTM converges faster, allowing for early
stopping with reduced privacy budget consumption. We further show that the
tickets from DPLTM are transferable across datasets, domains, and
architectures. Our extensive evaluation on several public datasets provides
evidence to our claims.

  Student dropout prediction provides an opportunity to improve student
engagement, which maximizes the overall effectiveness of learning experiences.
However, researches on student dropout were mainly conducted on school dropout
or course dropout, and study session dropout in a mobile learning environment
has not been considered thoroughly. In this paper, we investigate the study
session dropout prediction problem in a mobile learning environment. First, we
define the concept of the study session, study session dropout and study
session dropout prediction task in a mobile learning environment. Based on the
definitions, we propose a novel Transformer based model for predicting study
session dropout, DAS: Deep Attentive Study Session Dropout Prediction in Mobile
Learning Environment. DAS has an encoder-decoder structure which is composed of
stacked multi-head attention and point-wise feed-forward networks. The deep
attentive computations in DAS are capable of capturing complex relations among
dynamic student interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to investigate study session dropout in a mobile learning environment.
Empirical evaluations on a large-scale dataset show that DAS achieves the best
performance with a significant improvement in area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve compared to baseline models.

Title: Learning Navigation Costs from Demonstration in Partially Observable
  Environments
Authors: Tianyu Wang, Vikas Dhiman, Nikolay Atanasov
Categories: cs.LG cs.RO stat.ML
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures
\\
  This paper focuses on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to enable safe and
efficient autonomous navigation in unknown partially observable environments.
The objective is to infer a cost function that explains expert-demonstrated
navigation behavior while relying only on the observations and state-control
trajectory used by the expert. We develop a cost function representation
composed of two parts: a probabilistic occupancy encoder, with recurrent
dependence on the observation sequence, and a cost encoder, defined over the
occupancy features. The representation parameters are optimized by
differentiating the error between demonstrated controls and a control policy
computed from the cost encoder. Such differentiation is typically computed by
dynamic programming through the value function over the whole state space. We
observe that this is inefficient in large partially observable environments
because most states are unexplored. Instead, we rely on a closed-form
subgradient of the cost-to-go obtained only over a subset of promising states
via an efficient motion-planning algorithm such as A* or RRT. Our experiments
show that our model exceeds the accuracy of baseline IRL algorithms in robot
navigation tasks, while substantially improving the efficiency of training and
test-time inference.

Title: Corrupted Multidimensional Binary Search: Learning in the Presence of
  Irrational Agents
Authors: Akshay Krishnamurthy, Thodoris Lykouris, and Chara Podimata
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.DS cs.GT econ.GN q-fin.EC stat.ML
\\
  Standard game-theoretic formulations for settings like contextual pricing and
security games assume that agents act in accordance with a specific behavioral
model. In practice however, some agents may not prescribe to the dominant
behavioral model or may act in ways that are arbitrarily inconsistent. Existing
algorithms heavily depend on the model being (approximately) accurate for all
agents and have poor performance in the presence of even a few such arbitrarily
irrational agents. \emph{How do we design learning algorithms that are robust
to the presence of arbitrarily irrational agents?}
  We address this question for a number of canonical game-theoretic
applications by designing a robust algorithm for the fundamental problem of
multidimensional binary search. The performance of our algorithm degrades
gracefully with the number of corrupted rounds, which correspond to irrational
agents and need not be known in advance. As binary search is the key primitive
in algorithms for contextual pricing, Stackelberg Security Games, and other
game-theoretic applications, we immediately obtain robust algorithms for these
settings.
  Our techniques draw inspiration from learning theory, game theory,
high-dimensional geometry, and convex analysis, and may be of independent
algorithmic interest.

Title: Provable Meta-Learning of Linear Representations
Authors: Nilesh Tripuraneni, Chi Jin, Michael I. Jordan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can
utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new
environments. Representation learning---a key tool for performing
meta-learning---learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge across
multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce. Despite a
recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the theoretical
underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially in the
context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we focus on
the problem of multi-task linear regression---in which multiple linear
regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. Here,
we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual
challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related
tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are
central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these
results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample
complexity of learning these linear features, showing that our algorithms are
optimal up to logarithmic factors.

\\
  Generating clinical reports from raw recordings such as X-rays and
electroencephalogram (EEG) is an essential and routine task for doctors.
However, it is often time-consuming to write accurate and detailed reports.
Most existing methods try to generate the whole reports from the raw input with
limited success because 1) generated reports often contain errors that need
manual review and correction, 2) it does not save time when doctors want to
write additional information into the report, and 3) the generated reports are
not customized based on individual doctors' preference. We propose {\it
CL}inic{\it A}l {\it R}eport {\it A}uto-completion (CLARA), an interactive
method that generates reports in a sentence by sentence fashion based on
doctors' anchor words and partially completed sentences. CLARA searches for
most relevant sentences from existing reports as the template for the current
report. The retrieved sentences are sequentially modified by combining with the
input feature representations to create the final report. In our experimental
evaluation, CLARA achieved 0.393 CIDEr and 0.248 BLEU-4 on X-ray reports and
0.482 CIDEr and 0.491 BLEU-4 for EEG reports for sentence-level generation,
which is up to 35% improvement over the best baseline. Also via our qualitative
evaluation, CLARA is shown to produce reports which have a significantly higher
level of approval by doctors in a user study (3.74 out of 5 for CLARA vs 2.52
out of 5 for the baseline).

Title: Generalized Hindsight for Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Alexander C. Li, Lerrel Pinto, Pieter Abbeel
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE cs.RO stat.ML
\\
  One of the key reasons for the high sample complexity in reinforcement
learning (RL) is the inability to transfer knowledge from one task to another.
In standard multi-task RL settings, low-reward data collected while trying to
solve one task provides little to no signal for solving that particular task
and is hence effectively wasted. However, we argue that this data, which is
uninformative for one task, is likely a rich source of information for other
tasks. To leverage this insight and efficiently reuse data, we present
Generalized Hindsight: an approximate inverse reinforcement learning technique
for relabeling behaviors with the right tasks. Intuitively, given a behavior
generated under one task, Generalized Hindsight returns a different task that
the behavior is better suited for. Then, the behavior is relabeled with this
new task before being used by an off-policy RL optimizer. Compared to standard
relabeling techniques, Generalized Hindsight provides a substantially more
efficient reuse of samples, which we empirically demonstrate on a suite of
multi-task navigation and manipulation tasks. Videos and code can be accessed
here: https://sites.google.com/view/generalized-hindsight.

coalgebra and focus on generic algorithms for computing the winning strategies

it exists) is then transformed into a modal formula that distinguishes the
given non-bisimilar states. The modalities required for the formula are also
synthesized on-the-fly, and we present a recipe for re-coding the formula with
different modalities, given a separating set of predicate liftings. Both the
game and the generation of the distinguishing formulas have been implemented in
a tool called T-BEG.

Title: Computational Aspects of Geometric Algebra Products of Two Homogeneous

Authors: Stephane Breuils, Vincent Nozick, Akihiro Sugimoto
Categories: cs.MS cs.CC
\\
  Studies on time and memory costs of products in geometric algebra have been
limited to cases where multivectors with multiple grades have only non-zero
elements. This allows to design efficient algorithms for a generic purpose;
however, it does not reflect the practical usage of geometric algebra. Indeed,
in applications related to geometry, multivectors are likely to be full
homogeneous, having their non-zero elements over a single grade. In this paper,
we provide a complete computational study on geometric algebra products of two
full homogeneous multivectors, that is, the outer, inner, and geometric
products of two full homogeneous multivectors. We show tight bounds on the
number of the arithmetic operations required for these products. We also show
that algorithms exist that achieve this number of arithmetic operations.

Title: Neural Parametric Fokker-Planck Equations

Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 49 pages
\\
  In this paper, we develop and analyze numerical methods for high dimensional
Fokker-Planck equations by leveraging generative models from deep learning. Our
starting point is a formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation as a system of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on finite-dimensional parameter space
with the parameters inherited from generative models such as normalizing flows.
We call such ODEs neural parametric Fokker-Planck equation. The fact that the
Fokker-Planck equation can be viewed as the $L^2$-Wasserstein gradient flow of
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence allows us to derive the ODEs as the
constrained $L^2$-Wasserstein gradient flow of KL divergence on the set of
probability densities generated by neural networks. For numerical computation,
we design a variational semi-implicit scheme for the time discretization of the
proposed ODE. Such an algorithm is sampling-based, which can readily handle
Fokker-Planck equations in higher dimensional spaces. Moreover, we also
establish bounds for the asymptotic convergence analysis of the neural
parametric Fokker-Planck equation as well as its error analysis for both the
continuous and discrete (forward-Euler time discretization) versions. Several
numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed
algorithms and analysis.

Title: Numerical Solution of Inverse Problems by Weak Adversarial Networks

Categories: math.NA cs.LG cs.NA
\\
  We consider a weak adversarial network approach to numerically solve a class
of inverse problems, including electrical impedance tomography and dynamic
electrical impedance tomography problems. We leverage the weak formulation of
PDE in the given inverse problem, and parameterize the solution and the test
function as deep neural networks. The weak formulation and the boundary
conditions induce a minimax problem of a saddle function of the network
parameters. As the parameters are alternatively updated, the network gradually
approximates the solution of the inverse problem. We provide theoretical
justifications on the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Our method is
completely mesh-free without any spatial discretization, and is particularly
suitable for problems with high dimensionality and low regularity on solutions.
Numerical experiments on a variety of test inverse problems demonstrate the
promising accuracy and efficiency of our approach.

Title: Time integration of tree tensor networks
Authors: Gianluca Ceruti, Christian Lubich, Hanna Walach
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Dynamical low-rank approximation by tree tensor networks is studied for the
data-sparse approximation to large time-dependent data tensors and unknown
solutions of tensor differential equations. A time integration method for tree
tensor networks of prescribed tree rank is presented and analyzed. It extends
the known projector-splitting integrators for dynamical low-rank approximation
by matrices and Tucker tensors and is shown to inherit their favorable
properties. The integrator is based on recursively applying the Tucker tensor
integrator. In every time step, the integrator climbs up and down the tree: it
uses a recursion that passes from the root to the leaves of the tree for the
construction of initial value problems on subtree tensor networks using
appropriate restrictions and prolongations, and another recursion that passes
from the leaves to the root for the update of the factors in the tree tensor
network. The integrator reproduces given time-dependent tree tensor networks of
the specified tree rank exactly and is robust to the typical presence of small
singular values in matricizations of the connection tensors, in contrast to
standard integrators applied to the differential equations for the factors in
the dynamical low-rank approximation by tree tensor networks.

Title: Quasi-optimal and pressure robust discretizations of the Stokes
  equations by moment- and divergence-preserving operators
Authors: Christian Kreuzer, R\"udiger Verf\"urth and Pietro Zanotti
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We approximate the solution of the Stokes equations by a new quasi-optimal
and pressure robust discontinuous Galerkin discretization of arbitrary order.
This means quasi-optimality of the velocity error independent of the pressure.
Moreover, the discretization is well-defined for any load which is admissible
for the continuous problem and it also provides classical quasi-optimal
estimates for the sum of velocity and pressure errors. The key design principle
is a careful discretization of the load involving a linear operator, which maps
discontinuous Galerkin test functions onto conforming ones thereby preserving
the discrete divergence and certain moment conditions on faces and elements.

Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 42 pages, 10 figures

\\
  We develop a convergence theory of space-time discretizations for the linear,
2nd-order wave equation in polygonal $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, possibly
occupied by piecewise homogeneous media with different propagation speeds.
Building on an unconditionally stable space-time DG formulation developed in
[Moiola, Perugia 2018], we (a) prove optimal convergence rates for the
space-time scheme with local isotropic corner mesh refinement on the spatial
domain, and (b) demonstrate numerically optimal convergence rates of a suitable
sparse space-time version of the DG scheme. The latter scheme is based on the
so-called combination formula, in conjunction with a family of anisotropic
space-time DG-discretizations. It results in optimal-order convergent schemes,
also in domains with corners, in work and memory which scales essentially (up
to logarithmic terms) like the DG solution of one stationary elliptic problem
in $\Omega$ on the finest spatial grid. Numerical experiments for both smooth
and singular solutions support convergence rate optimality on spatially refined
meshes of the full and sparse space-time DG schemes.

Title: An Extended Galerkin Analysis for Linear Elasticity with Strongly
  Symmetric Stress Tensor
Authors: Qingguo Hong and Jun Hu and Limin Ma and Jinchao Xu
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This paper presents an extended Galerkin analysis for various Galerkin
methods of the linear elasticity problem. The analysis is based on a unified
Galerkin discretization formulation for the linear elasticity problem
consisting of four discretization variables: strong symmetric stress tensor
$\boldsymbol \sigma_h$, displacement $u_h$ inside each element and the
modifications of these two variables $\check \boldsymbol \sigma_h$ and $\check
u_h$ on elementary boundaries. Motivated by many relevant methods in
literature, this formulation can be used to derive most existing discontinuous,
nonconforming and conforming Galerkin methods for linear elasticity problem and
especially to develop a number of new discontinuous Galerkin methods. Many
special cases of this four-field formulation are proved to be hybridizable and
can be reduced to some known hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin, weak Galerkin
and local discontinuous Galerkin methods by eliminating one or two of the four
fields. As certain stabilization parameter tends to infinity, this four-field
formulation is proved to converge to some conforming and nonconforming mixed
methods for linear elasticity problem. Two families of inf-sup conditions, one
known as $H^1$-philic and another known as H(div)-phillic, are proved to be
uniformly valid with respect to different choices of discrete spaces and
parameters. These inf-sup conditions guarantee the well-posedness of the new
proposed formulations and also offer a new and unified analysis for many
existing methods in literature as a by-product.

  The main purpose of this paper is to present a new corrected decoupled scheme
combined with a spatial finite volume method for chemotaxis models. First, we
derive the scheme for a parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis model arising in
embryology. We then establish the existence and uniqueness of the numerical
solution, and we prove that it converges to a corresponding weak solution for
the studied model. In the last section, several numerical tests are presented
by applying our approach to a number of chemotaxis systems. The obtained
numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme and its
effectiveness to capture different forms of spatial patterns.

  Unpredictable nature of fading channels and difficulty in tracking channel
state information pose major challenge in wireless energy harvesting
communication system design. In this work, we address relay selection problem
for wireless powered communication networks, where the relays harvest energy
from the source radio frequency signals. A single source-destination pair is
considered without a direct link. The connecting relay nodes are equipped with
storage batteries of infinite size. We assume that the channel state
information (CSI) on the source-relay link is available at the relay nodes.
Depending on the availability of the CSI on the relay-destination link at the
relay node, we propose two relay selection schemes and evaluate their outage
probability. Availability of the CSI at the relay node on the relay-destination
link considerably improves the performance due to additional flexibility in the
relay selection mechanism. Due to absence of CSI throughout the network at the
time of transmission path selection, the analysis of the problem is not
tractable. Therefore, we relax our assumptions on availability of CSI and
closed-form expressions of the outage probability as a function of the amount
of the available harvested energy are derived for both CSI availability cases.
Finally, we numerically quantify the performance for the proposed schemes and
compare the outage probability for fixed and equal number of wireless powered
forwarding relays.

  This paper describes the development of a system that enables real time data
visualization via a webapp regarding sound intensity using multiple node
devices connected through internet. The prototypes were realized using
ATmega328 (Arduino Nano) and ESP8266 hardware modules, NodeMCU Arduino wrapper
library, Google maps and firebase API along with JavaScript webapp. System
architecture is such that multiple node devices will be installed in different
locations of the target area. On each node device, an Arduino Nano interfaced
with a Sound Sensor measures the ambient sound intensity and ESP8266 Wi-Fi
module transmits the data to a database via web API. On the webapp, it plots
all the real-time data from the devices over Google maps according to the
locations of the node devices. The logged data that is collected can then be
used to carry out researches regarding sound pollution in targeted areas.

  The wireless industry is driven by key stakeholders that follow a holistic
approach of "one-system-fits-all" that leads to moving network functionality of
meeting stringent E2E communication requirements towards the core and cloud
infrastructures. This trend is limiting smaller and new players for bringing in
new and novel solutions. For meeting these E2E requirements, tenants and
end-users need to be active players for bringing their needs and innovations.
Driving E2E communication not only in terms of QoS but also overall carbon
footprint and spectrum efficiency from one specific community may lead to
undesirable simplifications and a higher level of abstraction of other network
segments may lead to sub-optimal operations. Based on this, the paper presents
a paradigm shift that will enlarge the role of wireless innovation at academia,
SME's, industries and start-ups while taking into account decentralized
mandate-driven intelligence in E2E communications

cacheable to non-cacheable storage but also the rate by which non-cacheable
content is transmitted, the rate by which cacheable content is requested, as
well as different popularity distributions of the cached files.

Title: Declarative Programming with Intensional Sets in Java Using JSetL
Authors: Maximiliano Cristi\'a and Andrea Fois and Gianfranco Rossi
Categories: cs.PL
\\
  Intensional sets are sets given by a property rather than by enumerating
their elements. In previous work, we have proposed a decision procedure for a
first-order logic language which provides Restricted Intensional Sets (RIS),
i.e., a sub-class of intensional sets that are guaranteed to denote
finite---though unbounded---sets. In this paper we show how RIS can be
exploited as a convenient programming tool also in a conventional setting,
namely, the imperative O-O language Java. We do this by considering a Java
library, called JSetL, that integrates the notions of logical variable, (set)
unification and constraints that are typical of constraint logic programming
languages into the Java language. We show how JSetL is naturally extended to
accommodate for RIS and RIS constraints, and how this extension can be
exploited, on the one hand, to support a more declarative style of programming
and, on the other hand, to effectively enhance the expressive power of the
constraint language provided by the library.

Title: Linear-Time Variational Integrators in Maximal Coordinates
Authors: Jan Br\"udigam and Zachary Manchester
Categories: cs.RO physics.comp-ph
\\
  Most dynamic simulation tools parameterize the configuration of multi-body
robotic systems using minimal coordinates, also called generalized or joint
coordinates. However, maximal-coordinate approaches have several advantages
over minimal-coordinate parameterizations, including native handling of closed
kinematic loops and nonholonomic constraints. This paper describes a
linear-time variational integrator that is formulated in maximal coordinates.
Due to its variational formulation, the algorithm does not suffer from
constraint drift and has favorable energy and momentum conservation properties.
A sparse matrix factorization technique allows the dynamics of a loop-free
articulated mechanism with $n$ links to be computed in $O(n)$ (linear) time.
Additional constraints that introduce loops can also be handled by the
algorithm without incurring much computational overhead. Experimental results
show that our approach offers speed competitive with state-of-the-art
minimal-coordinate algorithms while outperforming them in several scenarios,
especially when dealing with closed loops and configuration singularities.

success from learning-based methods. Due to the innate complexity of this task,
researchers have tried approaching the problem from a variety of different
angles, the full scope of which has not yet been captured within an overarching

approaches for visual navigation and its related tasks. Firstly, we summarize
the current work in terms of task representations and applied methods along
with their properties. We then further identify and discuss lingering issues
impeding the performance of VIN tasks and motivate future research in these key
areas worth exploring in the future for the community.

  In this paper, we introduce a new quadcopter fail-safe flight solution that

strategy of actively controlling the center of gravity position to restore the
nominal flight performance. A dedicated control structure is introduced, along
with a detailed analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the platform that
change during emergency flights. Experimental results are provided to validate
the feasibility of the proposed fail-safe flight strategy.

Title: Probabilistic approach to physical object disentangling
Authors: Joni Pajarinen, Oleg Arenz, Jan Peters, Gerhard Neumann
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Physically disentangling entangled objects from each other is a problem
encountered in waste segregation or in any task that requires disassembly of
structures. Often there are no object models, and, especially with cluttered
irregularly shaped objects, the robot can not create a model of the scene due
to occlusion. One of our key insights is that based on previous sensory input
we are only interested in moving an object out of the disentanglement around
obstacles. That is, we only need to know where the robot can successfully move
in order to plan the disentangling. Due to the uncertainty we integrate
information about blocked movements into a probability map. The map defines the
probability of the robot successfully moving to a specific configuration. Using
as cost the failure probability of a sequence of movements we can then plan and
execute disentangling iteratively. Since our approach circumvents only
obstacles that it already knows about new movements will yield information
about unknown obstacles that block movement until the robot has learned to
circumvent all obstacles and disentangling succeeds. In the experiments, we use
a special probabilistic version of the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT)
algorithm for planning and demonstrate successful disentanglement of objects
both in 2-D and 3-D simulation, and, on a KUKA LBR 7-DOF robot. Moreover, our
approach outperforms baseline methods.

Title: PointTrackNet: An End-to-End Network For 3-D Object Detection and

Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 7 pages, ICRA-RAL2020 accepted
\\
  Recent machine learning-based multi-object tracking (MOT) frameworks are
becoming popular for 3-D point clouds. Most traditional tracking approaches use
filters (e.g., Kalman filter or particle filter) to predict object locations in
a time sequence, however, they are vulnerable to extreme motion conditions,
such as sudden braking and turning. In this letter, we propose PointTrackNet,
an end-to-end 3-D object detection and tracking network, to generate foreground
masks, 3-D bounding boxes, and point-wise tracking association displacements
for each detected object. The network merely takes as input two adjacent
point-cloud frames. Experimental results on the KITTI tracking dataset show
competitive results over the state-of-the-arts, especially in the irregularly
and rapidly changing scenarios.

\\
  Quadcopters can suffer from loss of propellers in mid-flight, thus requiring
a need to have a system that detects single and multiple propeller failures and
an adaptive controller that stabilizes the propeller-deficient quadcopter. This
paper presents reinforcement learning based controllers for quadcopters with 4,
3, and 2 (opposing) functional propellers. The system is adaptive, unlike
traditional control system based controllers. In order to develop an end-to-end
system, the paper also proposes a novel neural network based propeller fault
detection system to detect propeller loss and switch to the appropriate
controller. Our simulation results demonstrate a stable quadcopter with
efficient waypoint tracking for all controllers. The detection system is able
to detect propeller failure within 2.5 seconds and stabilize for all heights
above 3 meters.

  Compared to rigid robots that are often studied in reinforcement learning,
the physical characteristics of some sophisticated robots such as software or
continuum are more complicated. Moreover, recent reinforcement learning methods
are data-inefficient and can not be directly deployed to the robot without
simulation. In this paper, we propose an efficient reinforcement learning
method based on inexplicit prior knowledge in response to such problems. The
method is firstly corroborated by simulation and employed directly in the real
world. By using our method, we can achieve visual active tracking and distance
maintenance of a tendon-driven robot which will be critical in
minimally-invasive procedures.

  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based automatic speech recognition has
nowadays become prevalent on mobile devices such as smart phones. However,
previous RNN compression techniques either suffer from hardware performance
overhead due to irregularity or significant accuracy loss due to the preserved
regularity for hardware friendliness. In this work, we propose RTMobile that
leverages both a novel block-based pruning approach and compiler optimizations
to accelerate RNN inference on mobile devices. Our proposed RTMobile is the
first work that can achieve real-time RNN inference on mobile platforms.
Experimental results demonstrate that RTMobile can significantly outperform
existing RNN hardware acceleration methods in terms of inference accuracy and
time. Compared with prior work on FPGA, RTMobile using Adreno 640 embedded GPU
on GRU can improve the energy-efficiency by about 40$\times$ while maintaining
the same inference time.

Title: An Open-set Recognition and Few-Shot Learning Dataset for Audio Event
  Classification in Domestic Environments
Authors: Javier Naranjo-Alcazar, Sergi Perez-Castanos, Pedro Zuccarrello and
  Maximo Cobos
Categories: cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS
Comments: To be submitted to Expert System with Applications
\\
  The problem of training a deep neural network with a small set of positive
samples is known as few-shot learning (FSL). It is widely known that
traditional deep learning (DL) algorithms usually show very good performance
when trained with large datasets. However, in many applications, it is not
possible to obtain such a high number of samples. In the image domain, typical
FSL applications are those related to face recognition. In the audio domain,
music fraud or speaker recognition can be clearly benefited from FSL methods.
This paper deals with the application of FSL to the detection of specific and
intentional acoustic events given by different types of sound alarms, such as
door bells or fire alarms, using a limited number of samples. These sounds
typically occur in domestic environments where many events corresponding to a
wide variety of sound classes take place. Therefore, the detection of such
alarms in a practical scenario can be considered an open-set recognition (OSR)
problem. To address the lack of a dedicated public dataset for audio FSL,
researchers usually make modifications on other available datasets. This paper
is aimed at providing the audio recognition community with a carefully
annotated dataset for FSL and OSR comprised of 1360 clips from 34 classes
divided into \emph{pattern sounds} and \emph{unwanted sounds}. To facilitate
and promote research in this area, results with two baseline systems (one
trained from scratch and another based on transfer learning), are presented.

Title: Who is the Centre of the Movie Universe? Using Python and NetworkX to
  Analyse the Social Network of Movie Stars
Authors: Rhyd Lewis
Categories: cs.SI
Comments: 22 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables. Contains Python code
\\
  This paper provides the technical details of an article originally published
in The Conversation in February 2020. The purpose is to use centrality measures
to analyse the social network of movie stars and thereby identify the most
"important" actors in the movie business. The analysis is presented in a
step-by-step, tutorial-like fashion and makes use of the Python programming
language together with the NetworkX library. It reveals that the most central
actors in the network are those with lengthy acting careers, such as
Christopher Lee, Nassar, Sukumari, Michael Caine, Om Puri, Jackie Chan, and
Robert De Niro. We also present similar results for the movie releases of each
decade. These indicate that the most central actors since the turn of the
millennium include people like Angelina Jolie, Brahmanandam, Samuel L. Jackson,
Nassar, and Ben Kingsley.

Title: An Information Diffusion Approach to Rumor Propagation and
  Identification on Twitter
Authors: Abiola Osho, Caden Waters, George Amariucai
Categories: cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  With the increasing use of online social networks as a source of news and
information, the propensity for a rumor to disseminate widely and quickly poses
a great concern, especially in disaster situations where users do not have
enough time to fact-check posts before making the informed decision to react to
a post that appears to be credible. In this study, we explore the propagation
pattern of rumors on Twitter by exploring the dynamics of microscopic-level
misinformation spread, based on the latent message and user interaction
attributes. We perform supervised learning for feature selection and
prediction. Experimental results with real-world data sets give the models'
prediction accuracy at about 90\% for the diffusion of both True and False
topics. Our findings confirm that rumor cascades run deeper and that rumor
masked as news, and messages that incite fear, will diffuse faster than other
messages. We show that the models for True and False message propagation differ
significantly, both in the prediction parameters and in the message features
that govern the diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion pattern is an
important metric in identifying the credibility of a tweet.

Title: Computing the Value of Spatio-Temporal Data in Wholesale and Retail Data
  Marketplaces
Authors: Santiago Andres Azcoitia, Marius Paraschiv, Nikolaos Laoutaris
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  Spatio-temporal information is increasingly used for driving a plethora of
intelligent transportation, smart-city, and crowd-sensing applications. At the
same time, different types of data marketplaces are proposed for de-siloing and
monetising individual and enterprise data. In this paper we study the problem
of estimating the relative value of spatio-temporal data sold in wholesale and
retail data marketplaces for the purpose of forecasting future demand in a
certain area, e.g. a city. Using as case studies large datasets of taxi rides
from Chicago and New York, we ask questions such as "When does it make sense
for different taxi companies to combine their data?" and "How should different
companies be compensated for the data that they share?". We then turn our
attention to the even harder problem of establishing the value of the data
brought to retail marketplaces by individual drivers. Overall, we show that
simplistic approaches, such as assuming that the value of the data held by
companies or drivers is proportional to its volume are inaccurate, because they
fail to consider the complex complementarities that may exist among different
datasets. To remedy this, more complex notions of value-sharing from economics
and game-theory, such as the Shapley value need to be used to capture the
effect of mixing datasets on the accuracy of forecasting algorithms driven by
them. Applying the Shapley value to large datasets from many sources is
computationally challenging. We use structured sampling to overcome such
scalability challenges and manage to compute accurately the importance of
different data sources, even when their number ranges in the thousands, as in
the case of all the taxi drivers in a large metropolis.

Title: MGA: Momentum Gradient Attack on Network
Authors: Jinyin Chen, Yixian Chen, Haibin Zheng, Shijing Shen, Shanqing Yu, Dan
  Zhang, Qi Xuan
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  The adversarial attack methods based on gradient information can adequately
find the perturbations, that is, the combinations of rewired links, thereby
reducing the effectiveness of the deep learning model based graph embedding
algorithms, but it is also easy to fall into a local optimum. Therefore, this
paper proposes a Momentum Gradient Attack (MGA) against the GCN model, which
can achieve more aggressive attacks with fewer rewiring links. Compared with
directly updating the original network using gradient information, integrating
the momentum term into the iterative process can stabilize the updating
direction, which makes the model jump out of poor local optimum and enhance the
method with stronger transferability. Experiments on node classification and
community detection methods based on three well-known network embedding
algorithms show that MGA has a better attack effect and transferability.

Title: Network Representation Learning for Link Prediction: Are we improving
  upon simple heuristics?
Authors: Alexandru Mara, Jefrey Lijffijt and Tijl De Bie
Categories: cs.SI cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Network representation learning has become an active research area in recent
years with many new methods showcasing their performance on downstream
prediction tasks such as Link Prediction. Despite the efforts of the community
to ensure reproducibility of research by providing method implementations,
important issues remain. The complexity of the evaluation pipelines and
abundance of design choices have led to difficulties in quantifying the
progress in the field and identifying the state-of-the-art. In this work, we
analyse 17 network embedding methods on 7 real-world datasets and find, using a
consistent evaluation pipeline, only thin progress over the recent years. Also,
many embedding methods are outperformed by simple heuristics. Finally, we
discuss how standardized evaluation tools can repair this situation and boost
progress in this field.

Title: Zero-inertia Systems: Sufficient Conditions for Phasor Modeling
Authors: Georgios Misyris, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis and Tilman Weckesser
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Time-domain simulations are a critical tool for power system operators.
Depending on the instability mechanism under consideration and the system
characteristics, such as the time constants of controllers, either phasor or
Electro-Magnetic Transient (EMT) models should be employed. On the one hand,
EMT models provide a detailed-modeling of the system dynamics, thus increase
the reliability of stability analysis; on the other end, using these models
increase the computational times of simulations, slowing down the security
assessment process. To decrease computational time, system operators could
resort to phasor-mode simulations for a (hopefully large) subset of
disturbances. This paper investigates the appropriateness of
phasor-approximation models on simulating events related to power supply and
balance stability in zero-inertia systems. First, the stability boundaries,
which each model is able to identify, are analyzed; then sufficient conditions
for control parameters are derived, which allow using phasor-approximation
models to monitor power sharing among grid-forming converter-based resources.
Time-domain simulations are performed in PowerFactory DigSilent to verify the
results.

Title: Distributed Weighted Least-squares Estimation for Networked Systems with
  Edge Measurements
Authors: Qiqi Yang, Zhaorong Zhang, Minyue Fu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 6 pages
\\
  This paper studies the problem of distributed weighted least-squares (WLS)
estimation for an interconnected linear measurement network with additive
noise. Two types of measurements are considered: self measurements for
individual nodes, and edge measurements for the connecting nodes. Each node in
the network carries out distributed estimation by using its own measurement and
information transmitted from its neighbours. We study two distributed
estimation algorithms: a recently proposed distributed WLS algorithm and the
so-called Gaussian Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm. We first establish the
equivalence of the two algorithms. We then prove a key result which shows that
the information matrix is always generalised diagonally dominant, under some
very mild condition. Using these two results and some known convergence
properties of the Gaussian BP algorithm, we show that the aforementioned
distributed WLS algorithm gives the globally optimal WLS estimate
asymptotically. A bound on its convergence rate is also presented.

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  For systems evolving on a Riemannian manifold, we propose converse Lyapunov
theorems for asymptotic and exponential stability. The novelty of the proposed
approach is that is does not rely on local Euclidean coordinate, and is thus
valid on a wider domain than the immediate vicinity of the considered
equilibrium. We also show how the constructions can be useful for robustness
analysis.

Title: On Geometric and Lyapunov Characterizations of Incremental Stable
  Systems on Finsler Manifolds
Authors: Dongjun Wu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In this paper, we report several new geometric and Lyapunov characterizations
of incremental stable systems on Finsler and Riemannian manifolds. First, a new
and intrinsic proof of an important theorem in contraction analysis is given
via the complete lift of a vector field. Based on this, two Lyapunov
characterizations of incremental stable systems are derived. The first one is a
converse contraction theorem, and the second one reveals a connection between
incremental stability and stability of an equilibrium point. This result
recovers and extends the classical Krasovskii's method. At the end, we show how
to extend the results to discrete time systems.

Comments: Submitted to PMAPS 2020
\\
  The decarbonisation of heat in developed economies represents a significant
challenge, with increased penetration of electrical heating technologies
potentially leading to unprecedented increases in peak electricity demand. This
work considers a method to evaluate the impact of rapid electrification of heat
by utilising historic gas demand data. The work is intended to provide a
data-driven complement to popular generative heat demand models, with a
particular aim of informing regulators and actors in capacity markets as to how
policy changes could impact on medium-term system adequacy metrics (up to five
years ahead). Results from a GB case study show that the representation of heat
demand using scaled gas demand profiles more than doubles the rate at which
1-in-20 system peaks grow, when compared to the use of scaled electricity
demand profiles. Low end-use system efficiency, in terms of aggregate
coefficient of performance and demand side response capabilities, are shown to
potentially lead to a trebling of electrical demand-temperature sensitivity
following five years of heat demand growth.

\\
  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) implement a specific form of multi-variate
extrapolation and will generate an output for any input pattern, even when
there is no similar training pattern. Extrapolations are not necessarily to be
trusted, and in order to support safety critical systems, we require such
systems to give an indication of the training sample related uncertainty
associated with their output. Some readers may think that this is a well known
issue which is already covered by the basic principles of pattern recognition.
We will explain below how this is not the case and how the conventional
(Likelihood estimate of) conditional probability of classification does not
correctly assess this uncertainty. We provide a discussion of the standard
interpretations of this problem and show how a quantitative approach based upon
long standing methods can be practically applied. The methods are illustrated
on the task of early diagnosis of dementing diseases using Magnetic Resonance
Imaging.

Title: Quantum Cognitive Triad. Semantic geometry of context representation
Authors: Ilya A. Surov
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.AI quant-ph
\\
  The paper describes an algorithm for cognitive representation of triples of
related behavioral contexts two of which correspond to mutually exclusive
states of some binary situational factor while uncertainty of this factor is
the third context. The contexts are mapped to vector states in the
two-dimensional quantum Hilbert space describing a dichotomic decision
alternative in relation to which the contexts are subjectively recognized. The
obtained triad of quantum cognitive representations functions as a minimal
carrier of semantic relations between the contexts, which are quantified by
phase relations between the corresponding quantum representation states. The
described quantum model of subjective semantics supports interpretable vector
calculus which is geometrically visualized in the Bloch sphere view of quantum
cognitive states.

Title: Fast Lower and Upper Estimates for the Price of Constrained Multiple

Authors: Nicolas Essis-Breton and Patrice Gaillardetz
Categories: q-fin.CP cs.AI cs.LG math.OC q-fin.PR

  This article presents fast lower and upper estimates for a large class of
options: the class of constrained multiple exercise American options. Typical
options in this class are swing options with volume and timing constraints, and
passport options with multiple lookback rights. The lower estimate algorithm
uses the artificial intelligence method of lookahead search. The upper estimate
algorithm uses the dual approach to option pricing on a nearest-neighbor basis
for the martingale space. Probabilistic convergence guarantees are provided.
Several numerical examples illustrate the approaches including a swing option
with four constraints, and a passport option with 16 constraints.

Title: Analytical Equations based Prediction Approach for PM2.5 using
  Artificial Neural Network
Authors: Jalpa Shah and Biswajit Mishra
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Particulate matter pollution is one of the deadliest types of air pollution
worldwide due to its significant impacts on the global environment and human
health. Particulate Matter (PM2.5) is one of the important particulate
pollutants to measure the Air Quality Index (AQI). The conventional instruments
used by the air quality monitoring stations to monitor PM2.5 are costly,
bulkier, time-consuming, and power-hungry. Furthermore, due to limited data
availability and non-scalability, these stations cannot provide high spatial
and temporal resolution in real-time. To overcome the disadvantages of existing
methodology this article presents analytical equations based prediction
approach for PM2.5 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Since the derived
analytical equations for the prediction can be computed using a Wireless Sensor
Node (WSN) or low-cost processing tool, it demonstrates the usefulness of the
proposed approach. Moreover, the study related to correlation among the PM2.5
and other pollutants is performed to select the appropriate predictors. The
large authenticate data set of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) online
station, India is used for the proposed approach. The RMSE and coefficient of
determination (R2) obtained for the proposed prediction approach using eight
predictors are 1.7973 ug/m3 and 0.9986 respectively. While the proposed
approach results show RMSE of 7.5372 ug/m3 and R2 of 0.9708 using three
predictors. Therefore, the results demonstrate that the proposed approach is
one of the promising approaches for monitoring PM2.5 without power-hungry gas
sensors and bulkier analyzers.

Title: Wave propagation modeling in periodic elasto-thermo-diffusive materials
  via multifield asymptotic homogenization
Authors: Francesca Fantoni and Andrea Bacigalupo
Categories: physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.CE
\\
  A multifield asymptotic homogenization technique for periodic
thermo-diffusive elastic materials is provided in the present study. Field
equations for the first-order equivalent medium are derived and overall
constitutive tensors are obtained in closed form. These lasts depend upon the
micro constitutive properties of the different phases composing the composite
material and upon periodic perturbation functions, which allow taking into
account the effects of microstructural heterogeneities. Perturbation functions
are determined as solutions of recursive non homogeneous cell problems emanated
from the substitution of asymptotic expansions of the micro fields in powers of
the microstructural characteristic size into local balance equations. Average
field equations of infinite order are also provided, whose formal solution can
be obtained through asymptotic expansions of the macrofields. With the aim of
investigating dispersion properties of waves propagating inside the medium,
proper integral transforms are applied to governing field equations of the
homogenized medium. A quadratic generalized eigenvalue problem is thus
obtained, whose solution characterizes the complex valued frequency band
structure of the first-order equivalent material. The validity of the proposed
technique has been confirmed by the very good matching obtained between
dispersion curves of the homogenized medium and the lowest frequency ones
relative to the heterogeneous material. These lasts are computed from the
resolution of a quadratic generalized eigenvalue problem over the periodic cell
subjected to Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions. An illustrative benchmark is
conducted referring to a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)-like material, whose
microstructure can be modeled through the spatial tessellation of the domain
with a periodic cell subjected to thermo-diffusive phenomena.

exchange is interpreted into a game with a Markov property consisting of
states, actions, and rewards. A system for trading the fixed volume of a
financial instrument is proposed and experimentally tested; this is based on
the asynchronous advantage actor-critic method with the use of several neural
network architectures. The application of recurrent layers in this approach is
investigated. The experiments were performed on real anonymized data. The best
architecture demonstrated a trading strategy for the RTS Index futures

Title: Sphere tangencies, line incidences, and Lie's line-sphere correspondence
Authors: Joshua Zahl
Categories: math.CO cs.CG
Comments: 20 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Two spheres with centers $p$ and $q$ and signed radii $r$ and $s$ are said to
be in contact if $|p-q|^2 = (r-s)^2$. Using Lie's line-sphere correspondence,
we show that if $F$ is a field in which $-1$ is not a square, then there is an
isomorphism between the set of spheres in $F^3$ and the set of lines in a
suitably constructed Heisenberg group that is embedded in $(F[i])^3$; under
this isomorphism, contact between spheres translates to incidences between
lines.
  In the past decade there has been significant progress in understanding the
incidence geometry of lines in three space. The contact-incidence isomorphism
allows us to translate statements about the incidence geometry of lines into
statements about the contact geometry of spheres. This leads to new bounds for
Erd\H{o}s' repeated distances problem in $F^3$, and improved bounds for the
number of point-sphere incidences in three dimensions. These new bounds are
sharp for certain ranges of parameters.

Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, presented at 2019 IEEE Automatic Speech
  Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU 2019)
\\
  This article describes a density ratio approach to integrating external
Language Models (LMs) into end-to-end models for Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR). Applied to a Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) ASR model
trained on a given domain, a matched in-domain RNN-LM, and a target domain
RNN-LM, the proposed method uses Bayes' Rule to define RNN-T posteriors for the
target domain, in a manner directly analogous to the classic hybrid model for
ASR based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or LSTMs in the Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) framework (Bourlard & Morgan, 1994). The proposed approach is evaluated
in cross-domain and limited-data scenarios, for which a significant amount of
target domain text data is used for LM training, but only limited (or no)
{audio, transcript} training data pairs are used to train the RNN-T.
Specifically, an RNN-T model trained on paired audio & transcript data from
YouTube is evaluated for its ability to generalize to Voice Search data. The
Density Ratio method was found to consistently outperform the dominant approach
to LM and end-to-end ASR integration, Shallow Fusion.

Comments: 5 pages, accepted to ICLR 2020 Workshop on Towards Trustworthy ML:
  Rethinking Security and Privacy for ML
\\
  A necessary characteristic for the deployment of deep learning models in real
world applications is resistance to small adversarial perturbations while
maintaining accuracy on non-malicious inputs. While robust training provides
models that exhibit better adversarial accuracy than standard models, there is
still a significant gap in natural accuracy between robust and non-robust
models which we aim to bridge. We consider a number of ensemble methods
designed to mitigate this performance difference. Our key insight is that model
trained to withstand small attacks, when ensembled, can often withstand
significantly larger attacks, and this concept can in turn be leveraged to
optimize natural accuracy. We consider two schemes, one that combines
predictions from several randomly initialized robust models, and the other that
fuses features from robust and standard models.

  While theories postulating a dual cognitive system take hold, quantitative
confirmations are still needed to understand and identify interactions between
the two systems or conflict events. Eye movements are among the most direct
markers of the individual attentive load and may serve as an important proxy of
information. In this work we propose a computational method, within a modified
visual version of the well-known Stroop test, for the identification of
different tasks and potential conflicts events between the two systems through
the collection and processing of data related to eye movements. A statistical
analysis shows that the selected variables can characterize the variation of
attentive load within different scenarios. Moreover, we show that Machine
Learning techniques allow to distinguish between different tasks with a good
classification accuracy and to investigate more in depth the gaze dynamics.

challenges for the translation of chest x-ray algorithms to the clinical
setting. We examine the performance of the top 10 performing models on the
CheXpert challenge leaderboard on three tasks: (1) TB detection, (2) pathology
detection on photos of chest x-rays, and (3) pathology detection on data from
an external institution. First, we find that the top 10 chest x-ray models on
the CheXpert competition achieve an average AUC of 0.851 on the task of
detecting TB on two public TB datasets without fine-tuning or including the TB
labels in training data. Second, we find that the average performance of the
models on photos of x-rays (AUC = 0.916) is similar to their performance on the
original chest x-ray images (AUC = 0.924). Third, we find that the models
tested on an external dataset either perform comparably to or exceed the
average performance of radiologists. We believe that our investigation will
inform rapid translation of deep learning algorithms to safe and effective
clinical decision support tools that can be validated prospectively with large
impact studies and clinical trials.

Title: Unpaired Image Super-Resolution using Pseudo-Supervision
Authors: Shunta Maeda
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures
\\
  In most studies on learning-based image super-resolution (SR), the paired
training dataset is created by downscaling high-resolution (HR) images with a
predetermined operation (e.g., bicubic). However, these methods fail to
super-resolve real-world low-resolution (LR) images, for which the degradation
process is much more complicated and unknown. In this paper, we propose an
unpaired SR method using a generative adversarial network that does not require
a paired/aligned training dataset. Our network consists of an unpaired
kernel/noise correction network and a pseudo-paired SR network. The correction
network removes noise and adjusts the kernel of the inputted LR image; then,
the corrected clean LR image is upscaled by the SR network. In the training
phase, the correction network also produces a pseudo-clean LR image from the
inputted HR image, and then a mapping from the pseudo-clean LR image to the
inputted HR image is learned by the SR network in a paired manner. Because our
SR network is independent of the correction network, well-studied existing
network architectures and pixel-wise loss functions can be integrated with the
proposed framework. Experiments on diverse datasets show that the proposed
method is superior to existing solutions to the unpaired SR problem.

\\
  Glioma is a common type of brain tumor, and accurate detection of it plays a
vital role in the diagnosis and treatment process. Despite advances in medical
image analyzing, accurate tumor segmentation in brain magnetic resonance (MR)
images remains a challenge due to variations in tumor texture, position, and
shape. In this paper, we propose a fast, automated method, with light
computational complexity, to find the smallest bounding box around the tumor
region. This region-of-interest can be used as a preprocessing step in training
networks for subregion tumor segmentation. By adopting the outputs of this
algorithm, redundant information is removed; hence the network can focus on
learning notable features related to subregions' classes. The proposed method
has six main stages, in which the brain segmentation is the most vital step.
Expectation-maximization (EM) and K-means algorithms are used for brain
segmentation. The proposed method is evaluated on the BraTS 2015 dataset, and
the average gained DICE score is 0.73, which is an acceptable result for this
application.

Title: Device Heterogeneity in Federated Learning: A Superquantile Approach
Authors: Yassine Laguel, Krishna Pillutla, J\'er\^ome Malick, Zaid Harchaoui
Categories: stat.ML cs.DC cs.LG math.OC
\\
  We propose a federated learning framework to handle heterogeneous client
devices which do not conform to the population data distribution. The approach
hinges upon a parameterized superquantile-based objective, where the parameter
ranges over levels of conformity. We present an optimization algorithm and
establish its convergence to a stationary point. We show how to practically
implement it using secure aggregation by interleaving iterations of the usual
federated averaging method with device filtering. We conclude with numerical
experiments on neural networks as well as linear models on tasks from computer
vision and natural language processing.

Title: Acceleration for Compressed Gradient Descent in Distributed and
  Federated Optimization
Authors: Zhize Li and Dmitry Kovalev and Xun Qian and Peter Richt\'arik
Categories: math.OC cs.DC cs.LG
Comments: 27 pages, 2 algoritms, 4 theorems, 5 lemmas, 10 figures
\\
  Due to the high communication cost in distributed and federated learning
problems, methods relying on compression of communicated messages are becoming
increasingly popular. While in other contexts the best performing gradient-type
methods invariably rely on some form of acceleration/momentum to reduce the
number of iterations, there are no methods which combine the benefits of both
gradient compression and acceleration. In this paper, we remedy this situation
and propose the first accelerated compressed gradient descent (ACGD) methods.
In the single machine regime, we prove that ACGD enjoys the rate
$O\left((1+\omega)\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ for
$\mu$-strongly convex problems and
$O\left((1+\omega)\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}}\right)$ for convex problems,
respectively, where $L$ is the smoothness constant and $\omega$ is the
compression parameter. Our results improve upon the existing non-accelerated
rates $O\left((1+\omega)\frac{L}{\mu}\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ and
$O\left((1+\omega)\frac{L}{\epsilon}\right)$, respectively, and recover the
optimal rates of accelerated gradient descent as a special case when no
compression ($\omega=0$) is applied. We further propose a distributed variant
of ACGD (called ADIANA) and prove the convergence rate
$\widetilde{O}\left(\omega+\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}
+\sqrt{\left(\frac{\omega}{n}+\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{n}}\right)\frac{\omega
L}{\mu}}\right)$, where $n$ is the number of devices/workers and
$\widetilde{O}$ hides the logarithmic factor $\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}$. This
improves upon the previous best result $\widetilde{O}\left(\omega +
\frac{L}{\mu}+\frac{\omega L}{n\mu} \right)$ achieved by the DIANA method of
Mishchenko et al (2019). Finally, we conduct several experiments on real-world
datasets which corroborate our theoretical results and confirm the practical
superiority of our methods.

Title: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Predicting the State
  of Reactive Mixing

Categories: stat.ML cs.DC cs.LG cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 31 pages
\\
  Accurate predictions of reactive mixing are critical for many Earth and
environmental science problems. To investigate mixing dynamics over time under
different scenarios, a high-fidelity, finite-element-based numerical model is
built to solve the fast, irreversible bimolecular reaction-diffusion equations
to simulate a range of reactive-mixing scenarios. A total of 2,315 simulations
are performed using different sets of model input parameters comprising various
spatial scales of vortex structures in the velocity field, time-scales
associated with velocity oscillations, the perturbation parameter for the
vortex-based velocity, anisotropic dispersion contrast, and molecular
diffusion. Outputs comprise concentration profiles of the reactants and
products. The inputs and outputs of these simulations are concatenated into
feature and label matrices, respectively, to train 20 different machine
learning (ML) emulators to approximate system behavior. The 20 ML emulators
based on linear methods, Bayesian methods, ensemble learning methods, and
multilayer perceptron (MLP), are compared to assess these models. The ML
emulators are specifically trained to classify the state of mixing and predict
three quantities of interest (QoIs) characterizing species production, decay,
and degree of mixing. Linear classifiers and regressors fail to reproduce the
QoIs; however, ensemble methods (classifiers and regressors) and the MLP
accurately classify the state of reactive mixing and the QoIs. Among ensemble
methods, random forest and decision-tree-based AdaBoost faithfully predict the
QoIs. At run time, trained ML emulators are $\approx10^5$ times faster than the
high-fidelity numerical simulations. Speed and accuracy of the ensemble and MLP
models facilitate uncertainty quantification, which usually requires 1,000s of
model run, to estimate the uncertainty bounds on the QoIs.

Title: Distributed Algorithms for Composite Optimization: Unified and Tight
  Convergence Analysis
Authors: Jinming Xu, Ye Tian, Ying Sun, Gesualdo Scutari
Categories: math.OC cs.DC cs.MA
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1910.09817
\\
  We study distributed composite optimization over networks: agents minimize a
sum of smooth (strongly) convex functions, the agents' sum-utility, plus a
nonsmooth (extended-valued) convex one. We propose a general unified
algorithmic framework for such a class of problems and provide a unified
convergence analysis leveraging the theory of operator splitting.
Distinguishing features of our scheme are: (i) When the agents' functions are
strongly convex, the algorithm converges at a linear rate, whose dependence on
the agents' functions and network topology is decoupled, matching the typical
rates of centralized optimization; the rate expression is sharp and improves on
existing results; (ii) When the objective function is convex (but not strongly
convex), similar separation as in (i) is established for the coefficient of the
proved sublinear rate; (iii) The algorithm can adjust the ratio between the
number of communications and computations to achieve a rate (in terms of
computations) independent on the network connectivity; and (iv) A by-product of
our analysis is a tuning recommendation for several existing (non accelerated)
distributed algorithms yielding the fastest provably (worst-case) convergence
rate. This is the first time that a general distributed algorithmic framework
applicable to composite optimization enjoys all such properties.

Title: Comparing copy-number profiles under multi-copy amplifications and
  deletions
Authors: Garance Cordonnier, Manuel Lafond
Categories: q-bio.GN cs.DS
\\
  During cancer progression, malignant cells accumulate somatic mutations that
can lead to genetic aberrations. In particular, evolutionary events akin to
segmental duplications or deletions can alter the copy-number profile (CNP) of
a set of genes in a genome. Our aim is to compute the evolutionary distance
between two cells for which only CNPs are known. This asks for the minimum
number of segmental amplifications and deletions to turn one CNP into another.
This was recently formalized into a model where each event is assumed to alter
a copy-number by $1$ or $-1$, even though these events can affect large
portions of a chromosome. We propose a general cost framework where an event
can modify the copy-number of a gene by larger amounts. We show that any cost
scheme that allows segmental deletions of arbitrary length makes computing the
distance strongly NP-hard. We then devise a factor $2$ approximation algorithm
for the problem when copy-numbers are non-zero and provide an implementation
called \textsf{cnp2cnp}. We evaluate our approach experimentally by
reconstructing simulated cancer phylogenies from the pairwise distances
inferred by \textsf{cnp2cnp} and compare it against two other alternatives,
namely the \textsf{MEDICC} distance and the Euclidean distance. The
experimental results show that our distance yields more accurate phylogenies on
average than these alternatives if the given CNPs are error-free, but that the
\textsf{MEDICC} distance is slightly more robust against error in the data. In
all cases, our experiments show that either our approach or the \textsf{MEDICC}
approach should preferred over the Euclidean distance.

  Individual migration has been regarded as an important factor for the
evolution of cooperation in mobile populations. Motivations of migration,
however, can be largely divergent: one is highly frustrated by the vicinity of
an exploiter or defector, while other enthusiastically searches cooperator
mates. Albeit both extreme attitudes are observed in human behavior, but their
specific impacts on wellbeing remained unexplored. In this work, we propose an
orientation-driven migration approach for mobile individuals in combination
with the mentioned migration preferences and study their roles in the
cooperation level in a two-dimensional public goods game. We find that
cooperation can be greatly promoted when individuals are more inclined to
escape away from their defective neighbors. On the contrary, cooperation cannot
be effectively maintained when individuals are more motivated to approach their
cooperative neighbors. In addition, compared with random migration, movement by
leaving defectors can promote cooperation more effectively. By means of
theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we further find that when
individuals only choose to escape away from their defective neighbors, the
average distance between cooperators and defectors can be enlarged, hence the
natural invasion of defection can be efficiently blocked. Our work, thus,
provides further insight on how different migration preferences influence the
evolution of cooperation in the unified framework of spatially social games.

\\
  Anytime reliable communication systems are needed in contexts where the
property of vanishing error probability with time is critical. This is the case
of unstable real time systems that are to be controlled through the
transmission and processing of remotely sensed data. The most successful
anytime reliable transmission systems developed so far are based on channel
codes and channel coding theory. In this work, another focus is proposed,
placing the stress on the waveform level rather than just on the coding level.
This alleviates the coding and decoding complexity problems faced by other
proposals. To this purpose, chaos theory is successfully exploited in order to
design two different anytime reliable alternatives. The anytime reliability
property is formally demonstrated in each case for the AWGN channel, under
given conditions. The simulation results shown validate the theoretical
developments, and demonstrate that these systems can achieve anytime
reliability with affordable resource expenditure.

  In this article, we propose an index modulation system suitable for optical
communications, based on jointly driving the time and frequency of the signal:
an index-time frequency hopping (I-TFH) system. We analyze its performance from
the point of view of its efficiency in power and spectrum, and its behavior in
terms of error probability for the non-turbulent free-space optical (FSO)
channel. We compare I-TFH with already proposed index modulated systems of the
same nature, but where the amplitude or the number of transmitters are driven
instead of the signal frequency. We derive and compare approximations for the
average symbol and bit error probabilities of all these systems. The simulation
results show that said approximations are tight enough for a wide range of
signal-to-noise ratios and system parameters. Moreover, I-TFH shows to be
better performing in BER and/or power efficiency than the comparative
alternatives, and may offer interesting properties in a variety of contexts.

Title: Performance Analysis of QAM-MPPM in Turbulence-Free FSO Channels:
  Accurate Derivations and Practical Approximations
Authors: Francisco J. Escribano and Alexandre Wagemakers
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Following the trends of index modulated (IM) techniques for optical
communications, in the last few years several new waveform proposals have been
made, aiming at conveying a higher density of information by driving different
signal properties. One of these proposals mixes multi-pulse pulse-position
modulation (MPPM) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) in a system called
QAM-MPPM. We present here a new way to demodulate its compound waveform, and,
for the non-turbulent free space optical (FSO) channel, we provide accurate
analytical expressions for its error probabilities, both in the case of the
traditional and the new detector. Based on these analytical derivations, we
also provide simplified expressions for the estimation of the error
probabilities. We show that the new detector offers a gain of some tenths of dB
in signal-to-noise ratio with respect to the previously defined one without an
increase in complexity, and that our error probability estimations are more
accurate than previously published results. To the best of our knowledge, this
work is the first to provide simulation results validating the study of the
error probability performance of QAM-MPPM.

  In this paper, we design a novel high-throughput random access scheme for an
indoor optical wireless communication (OWC) massive Internet of Things (IoT)
scenario. Due to the large density of both IoT devices and OWC access points
(APs), we base the proposed scheme on multi-receiver coded slotted ALOHA. In
this scenario, collisions at APs are resolved by a centralized interference
cancellation decoder that may exploit both spatial and temporal diversity. By
applying adaptive control of each OWC AP field of view (FOV), the proposed
system is able to dynamically adapt to different IoT device activation rates,
in order to maintain a high total throughput. Using illustrative simulation
results, we demonstrate the design methodology and performance possibilities of
the proposed method.

Title: Concatenated Convolution-Polar codes over Rayleigh Channels degraded as
  Erasure Channels
Authors: Mohammed Usman
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Polar codes have been shown to approach capacity of symmetric binary erasure
channels and also have low encoding and decoding complexity. Wireless channels
are bursty in nature and a method to apply polar codes over wireless channels
is proposed. This paper investigates the performance of polar codes over
typical urban fading wireless channels. The wireless channel is modeled as a
degraded erasure channel by using an inner convolution code and interleaving.
When the convolution code fails to correct any errors, the corresponding bits
are discarded and treated as erasures. We present the performance of polar
codes over such degraded wireless channels using different code rates for the
inner convolution code.

Comments: 56 pages
\\
  The profile of a sample is the multiset of its symbol frequencies. We show
that for samples of discrete distributions, profile entropy is a fundamental
measure unifying the concepts of estimation, inference, and compression.
Specifically, profile entropy a) determines the speed of estimating the
distribution relative to the best natural estimator; b) characterizes the rate
of inferring all symmetric properties compared with the best estimator over any
label-invariant distribution collection; c) serves as the limit of profile
compression, for which we derive optimal near-linear-time block and sequential
algorithms. To further our understanding of profile entropy, we investigate its
attributes, provide algorithms for approximating its value, and determine its
magnitude for numerous structural distribution families.

  The Functional Failure Rate analysis of today's complex circuits is a
difficult task and requires a significant investment in terms of human efforts,
processing resources and tool licenses. Thereby, de-rating or vulnerability
factors are a major instrument of failure analysis efforts. Usually
computationally intensive fault-injection simulation campaigns are required to
obtain a fine-grained reliability metrics for the functional level. Therefore,
the use of machine learning algorithms to assist this procedure and thus,
optimising and enhancing fault injection efforts, is investigated in this
paper. Specifically, machine learning models are used to predict accurate
per-instance Functional De-Rating data for the full list of circuit instances,
an objective that is difficult to reach using classical methods. The described
methodology uses a set of per-instance features, extracted through an analysis
approach, combining static elements (cell properties, circuit structure,
synthesis attributes) and dynamic elements (signal activity). Reference data is
obtained through first-principles fault simulation approaches. One part of this
reference dataset is used to train the machine learning model and the remaining
is used to validate and benchmark the accuracy of the trained tool. The
presented methodology is applied on a practical example and various machine
learning models are evaluated and compared.

Title: Smoothing Graphons for Modelling Exchangeable Relational Data
Authors: Xuhui Fan, Yaqiong Li, Ling Chen, Bin Li, Scott A. Sisson
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Modelling exchangeable relational data can be described by \textit{graphon
theory}. Most Bayesian methods for modelling exchangeable relational data can
be attributed to this framework by exploiting different forms of graphons.
However, the graphons adopted by existing Bayesian methods are either
piecewise-constant functions, which are insufficiently flexible for accurate
modelling of the relational data, or are complicated continuous functions,
which incur heavy computational costs for inference. In this work, we introduce
a smoothing procedure to piecewise-constant graphons to form {\em smoothing
graphons}, which permit continuous intensity values for describing relations,
but without impractically increasing computational costs. In particular, we
focus on the Bayesian Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and demonstrate how to adapt
the piecewise-constant SBM graphon to the smoothed version. We initially
propose the Integrated Smoothing Graphon (ISG) which introduces one smoothing
parameter to the SBM graphon to generate continuous relational intensity
values. We then develop the Latent Feature Smoothing Graphon (LFSG), which
improves on the ISG by introducing auxiliary hidden labels to decompose the
calculation of the ISG intensity and enable efficient inference. Experimental
results on real-world data sets validate the advantages of applying smoothing
strategies to the Stochastic Block Model, demonstrating that smoothing graphons
can greatly improve AUC and precision for link prediction without increasing
computational complexity.

Title: Information Directed Sampling for Linear Partial Monitoring
Authors: Johannes Kirschner, Tor Lattimore, Andreas Krause
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Partial monitoring is a rich framework for sequential decision making under
uncertainty that generalizes many well known bandit models, including linear,
combinatorial and dueling bandits. We introduce information directed sampling
(IDS) for stochastic partial monitoring with a linear reward and observation
structure. IDS achieves adaptive worst-case regret rates that depend on precise
observability conditions of the game. Moreover, we prove lower bounds that
classify the minimax regret of all finite games into four possible regimes. IDS
achieves the optimal rate in all cases up to logarithmic factors, without
tuning any hyper-parameters. We further extend our results to the contextual
and the kernelized setting, which significantly increases the range of possible
applications.

estimation problems that includes many important instances arising from
applications in computational imaging, genomics, and network analysis. The
proposed estimator consists of finding a low-rank tensor fit to the data under
generalized parametric models. To overcome the difficulty of non-convexity in
these problems, we introduce a unified approach of projected gradient descent
that adapts to the underlying low-rank structure. Under mild conditions on the
loss function, we establish both an upper bound on statistical error and the
linear rate of computational convergence through a general deterministic
analysis. Then we further consider a suite of generalized tensor estimation
problems, including sub-Gaussian tensor denoising, tensor regression, and
Poisson and binomial tensor PCA. We prove that the proposed algorithm achieves
the minimax optimal rate of convergence in estimation error. Finally, we
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework via extensive experiments
on both simulated and real data.

Title: Incorporating Expert Prior Knowledge into Experimental Design via
  Posterior Sampling
Authors: Cheng Li, Sunil Gupta, Santu Rana, Vu Nguyen, Antonio Robles-Kelly,

\\
  Scientific experiments are usually expensive due to complex experimental
preparation and processing. Experimental design is therefore involved with the
task of finding the optimal experimental input that results in the desirable
output by using as few experiments as possible. Experimenters can often acquire
the knowledge about the location of the global optimum. However, they do not
know how to exploit this knowledge to accelerate experimental design. In this
paper, we adopt the technique of Bayesian optimization for experimental design
since Bayesian optimization has established itself as an efficient tool for
optimizing expensive black-box functions. Again, it is unknown how to
incorporate the expert prior knowledge about the global optimum into Bayesian
optimization process. To address it, we represent the expert knowledge about
the global optimum via placing a prior distribution on it and we then derive
its posterior distribution. An efficient Bayesian optimization approach has
been proposed via posterior sampling on the posterior distribution of the
global optimum. We theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed
algorithm and discuss the robustness of incorporating expert prior. We evaluate
the efficiency of our algorithm by optimizing synthetic functions and tuning
hyperparameters of classifiers along with a real-world experiment on the
synthesis of short polymer fiber. The results clearly demonstrate the
advantages of our proposed method.

Title: Adversarial Monte Carlo Meta-Learning of Optimal Prediction Procedures
Authors: Alex Luedtke, Incheoul Chung, Oleg Sofrygin

MSC-class: 62C20
ACM-class: G.3
\\
  We frame the meta-learning of prediction procedures as a search for an
optimal strategy in a two-player game. In this game, Nature selects a prior
over distributions that generate labeled data consisting of features and an
associated outcome, and the Predictor observes data sampled from a distribution
drawn from this prior. The Predictor's objective is to learn a function that
maps from a new feature to an estimate of the associated outcome. We establish
that, under reasonable conditions, the Predictor has an optimal strategy that
is equivariant to shifts and rescalings of the outcome and is invariant to
permutations of the observations and to shifts, rescalings, and permutations of
the features. We introduce a neural network architecture that satisfies these
properties. The proposed strategy performs favorably compared to standard
practice in both parametric and nonparametric experiments.

Title: Learning Product Graphs Underlying Smooth Graph Signals

Comments: 14 pages, 5 figures, and 2 tables; preprint of a journal submission
\\
  Real-world data is often times associated with irregular structures that can
analytically be represented as graphs. Having access to this graph, which is
sometimes trivially evident from domain knowledge, provides a better
representation of the data and facilitates various information processing
tasks. However, in cases where the underlying graph is unavailable, it needs to
be learned from the data itself for data representation, data processing and
inference purposes. Existing literature on learning graphs from data has mostly
considered arbitrary graphs, whereas the graphs generating real-world data tend
to have additional structure that can be incorporated in the graph learning
procedure. Structure-aware graph learning methods require learning fewer
parameters and have the potential to reduce computational, memory and sample
complexities. In light of this, the focus of this paper is to devise a method
to learn structured graphs from data that are given in the form of product
graphs. Product graphs arise naturally in many real-world datasets and provide
an efficient and compact representation of large-scale graphs through several
smaller factor graphs. To this end, first the graph learning problem is posed
as a linear program, which (on average) outperforms the state-of-the-art graph
learning algorithms. This formulation is of independent interest itself as it
shows that graph learning is possible through a simple linear program.
Afterwards, an alternating minimization-based algorithm aimed at learning
various types of product graphs is proposed, and local convergence guarantees
to the true solution are established for this algorithm. Finally the
performance gains, reduced sample complexity, and inference capabilities of the
proposed algorithm over existing methods are also validated through numerical
simulations on synthetic and real datasets.

  Flash points of organic molecules play an important role in preventing
flammability hazards and large databases of measured values exist, although
millions of compounds remain unmeasured. To rapidly extend existing data to new
compounds many researchers have used quantitative structure-property
relationship (QSPR) analysis to effectively predict flash points. In recent
years graph-based deep learning (GBDL) has emerged as a powerful alternative
method to traditional QSPR. In this paper, GBDL models were implemented in
predicting flash point for the first time. We assessed the performance of two
GBDL models, message-passing neural network (MPNN) and graph convolutional
neural network (GCNN), by comparing methods. Our result shows that MPNN both
outperforms GCNN and yields slightly worse but comparable performance with
previous QSPR studies. The average R2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) scores of
MPNN are, respectively, 2.3% lower and 2.0 K higher than previous comparable
studies. To further explore GBDL models, we collected the largest flash point
dataset to date, which contains 10575 unique molecules. The optimized MPNN
gives a test data R2 of 0.803 and MAE of 17.8 K on the complete dataset. We
also extracted 5 datasets from our integrated dataset based on molecular types
(acids, organometallics, organogermaniums, organosilicons, and organotins) and
explore the quality of the model in these classes.against 12 previous QSPR

Title: Bayesian Nonparametric Space Partitions: A Survey
Authors: Xuhui Fan, Bin Li, Ling Luo, Scott A. Sisson
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Bayesian nonparametric space partition (BNSP) models provide a variety of
strategies for partitioning a $D$-dimensional space into a set of blocks. In
this way, the data points lie in the same block would share certain kinds of
homogeneity. BNSP models can be applied to various areas, such as
regression/classification trees, random feature construction, relational
modeling, etc. In this survey, we investigate the current progress of BNSP
research through the following three perspectives: models, which review various
strategies for generating the partitions in the space and discuss their
theoretical foundation `self-consistency'; applications, which cover the
current mainstream usages of BNSP models and their potential future practises;
and challenges, which identify the current unsolved problems and valuable
future research topics. As there are no comprehensive reviews of BNSP
literature before, we hope that this survey can induce further exploration and
exploitation on this topic.

Title: Predicting Neural Network Accuracy from Weights

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We study the prediction of the accuracy of a neural network given only its
weights with the goal of better understanding network training and performance.
To do so, we propose a formal setting which frames this task and connects to
previous work in this area. We collect (and release) a large dataset of almost
80k convolutional neural networks trained on four image datasets. We
demonstrate that strong predictors of accuracy exist. Moreover, they can
achieve good predictions while only using simple statistics of the weights.
Surprisingly, these predictors are able to rank networks trained on unobserved
datasets or using different architectures.

  Process Models
Authors: Th\'eo Galy-Fajou, Florian Wenzel, Manfred Opper
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at AISTATS 2020
\\
  We propose automated augmented conjugate inference, a new inference method
for non-conjugate Gaussian processes (GP) models. Our method automatically
constructs an auxiliary variable augmentation that renders the GP model
conditionally conjugate. Building on the conjugate structure of the augmented
model, we develop two inference methods. First, a fast and scalable stochastic
variational inference method that uses efficient block coordinate ascent
updates, which are computed in closed form. Second, an asymptotically correct
Gibbs sampler that is useful for small datasets. Our experiments show that our
method are up two orders of magnitude faster and more robust than existing
state-of-the-art black-box methods.

Title: A general framework for ensemble distribution distillation
Authors: Jakob Lindqvist, Amanda Olmin, Fredrik Lindsten, Lennart Svensson
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Ensembles of neural networks have been shown to give better performance than
single networks, both in terms of predictions and uncertainty estimation.
Additionally, ensembles allow the uncertainty to be decomposed into aleatoric
(data) and epistemic (model) components, giving a more complete picture of the
predictive uncertainty. Ensemble distillation is the process of compressing an
ensemble into a single model, often resulting in a leaner model that still
outperforms the individual ensemble members. Unfortunately, standard
distillation erases the natural uncertainty decomposition of the ensemble. We
present a general framework for distilling both regression and classification
ensembles in a way that preserves the decomposition. We demonstrate the desired
behaviour of our framework and show that its predictive performance is on par
with standard distillation.

Authors: Ilyes Khemakhem, Ricardo Pio Monti, Diederik P. Kingma, Aapo
  Hyv\"arinen
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Despite the growing popularity of energy-based models, their identifiability
properties are not well-understood. In this paper we establish sufficient
conditions under which a large family of conditional energy-based models is
identifiable in function space, up to a simple transformation. Our results
build on recent developments in the theory of nonlinear ICA, showing that the
latent representations in certain families of deep latent-variable models are
identifiable. We extend these results to a very broad family of conditional
energy-based models. In this family, the energy function is simply the
dot-product between two feature extractors, one for the dependent variable, and
one for the conditioning variable. We show that under mild conditions, the
features are unique up to scaling and permutation. Second, we propose the
framework of independently modulated component analysis (IMCA), a new form of
nonlinear ICA where the indepencence assumption is relaxed. Importantly, we
show that our energy-based model can be used for the estimation of the
components: the features learned are a simple and often trivial transformation
of the latents.

Comments: 8 pages + appendix, 6 figures
\\
  We consider a high-dimensional mixture of two Gaussians in the noisy regime
where even an oracle knowing the centers of the clusters misclassifies a small
but finite fraction of the points. We provide a rigorous analysis of the
generalization error of regularized convex classifiers, including ridge, hinge
and logistic regression, in the high-dimensional limit where the number $n$ of
samples and their dimension $d$ go to infinity while their ratio is fixed to
$\alpha= n/d$. We discuss surprising effects of the regularization that in some
cases allows to reach the Bayes-optimal performances. We also illustrate the
interpolation peak at low regularization, and analyze the role of the
respective sizes of the two clusters.

Title: Proximal Gradient Algorithm with Momentum and Flexible Parameter Restart
  for Nonconvex Optimization
Authors: Yi Zhou and Zhe Wang and Kaiyi Ji and Yingbin Liang and Vahid Tarokh
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
\\
  Various types of parameter restart schemes have been proposed for accelerated
gradient algorithms to facilitate their practical convergence in convex
optimization. However, the convergence properties of accelerated gradient
algorithms under parameter restart remain obscure in nonconvex optimization. In
this paper, we propose a novel accelerated proximal gradient algorithm with
parameter restart (named APG-restart) for solving nonconvex and nonsmooth
problems. Our APG-restart is designed to 1) allow for adopting flexible
parameter restart schemes that cover many existing ones; 2) have a global
sub-linear convergence rate in nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization; and 3)
have guaranteed convergence to a critical point and have various types of
asymptotic convergence rates depending on the parameterization of local
geometry in nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Title: Stagewise Enlargement of Batch Size for SGD-based Learning
Authors: Shen-Yi Zhao, Yin-Peng Xie, and Wu-Jun Li
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Existing research shows that the batch size can seriously affect the
performance of stochastic gradient descent~(SGD) based learning, including
training speed and generalization ability. A larger batch size typically
results in less parameter updates. In distributed training, a larger batch size
also results in less frequent communication. However, a larger batch size can
make a generalization gap more easily. Hence, how to set a proper batch size
for SGD has recently attracted much attention. Although some methods about
setting batch size have been proposed, the batch size problem has still not
been well solved. In this paper, we first provide theory to show that a proper
batch size is related to the gap between initialization and optimum of the
model parameter. Then based on this theory, we propose a novel method, called
\underline{s}tagewise \underline{e}nlargement of \underline{b}atch
\underline{s}ize~(\mbox{SEBS}), to set proper batch size for SGD. More
specifically, \mbox{SEBS} adopts a multi-stage scheme, and enlarges the batch
size geometrically by stage. We theoretically prove that, compared to classical
stagewise SGD which decreases learning rate by stage, \mbox{SEBS} can reduce
the number of parameter updates without increasing generalization error. SEBS
is suitable for \mbox{SGD}, momentum \mbox{SGD} and AdaGrad. Empirical results
on real data successfully verify the theories of \mbox{SEBS}. Furthermore,
empirical results also show that SEBS can outperform other baselines.

Title: Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning for External Validity under a
  Covariate Shift
Authors: Masahiro Kato, Masatoshi Uehara, Shota Yasui
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG econ.EM
\\
  We consider the evaluation and training of a new policy for the evaluation
data by using the historical data obtained from a different policy. The goal of
off-policy evaluation (OPE) is to estimate the expected reward of a new policy
over the evaluation data, and that of off-policy learning (OPL) is to find a
new policy that maximizes the expected reward over the evaluation data.
Although the standard OPE and OPL assume the same distribution of covariate
between the historical and evaluation data, there often exists a problem of a
covariate shift, i.e., the distribution of the covariate of the historical data
is different from that of the evaluation data. In this paper, we derive the
efficiency bound of OPE under a covariate shift. Then, we propose doubly robust
and efficient estimators for OPE and OPL under a covariate shift by using an
estimator of the density ratio between the distributions of the historical and
evaluation data. We also discuss other possible estimators and compare their
theoretical properties. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
estimators through experiments.

Title: Firms Default Prediction with Machine Learning
Authors: Tesi Aliaj and Aris Anagnostopoulos and Stefano Piersanti
Categories: q-fin.RM cs.LG
ACM-class: J.4
\\
  Academics and practitioners have studied over the years models for predicting
firms bankruptcy, using statistical and machine-learning approaches. An earlier
sign that a company has financial difficulties and may eventually bankrupt is
going in \emph{default}, which, loosely speaking means that the company has
been having difficulties in repaying its loans towards the banking system.
Firms default status is not technically a failure but is very relevant for bank
lending policies and often anticipates the failure of the company. Our study
uses, for the first time according to our knowledge, a very large database of
granular credit data from the Italian Central Credit Register of Bank of Italy
that contain information on all Italian companies' past behavior towards the
entire Italian banking system to predict their default using machine-learning
techniques. Furthermore, we combine these data with other information regarding
companies' public balance sheet data. We find that ensemble techniques and
random forest provide the best results, corroborating the findings of Barboza
et al. (Expert Syst. Appl., 2017).

Comments: conference
\\
  Heart rate is an important vital sign used in the diagnosis of many medical
conditions. Conventionally, heart rate is measured using a medical device such
as pulse oxymeter. Physiological parameters such as heart rate bear a
correlation to speech characteristics of an individual. Hence, there is a
possibility to measure heart rate from speech signals using machine learning
and deep learning, which would also allow non-invasive, non contact based and
remote monitoring of patients. However, to design such a scheme and verify its
accuracy, it is necessary to collect speech recordings along with heart rates
measured using a medical device, simultaneously during the recording. This
article provides a dataset as well as the procedure used to create the dataset
which could be used to facilitate research in developing techniques to estimate
heart rate accurately by observing speech signal.

Title: Lying on networks: The role of structure and topology in promoting
  honesty
Authors: Valerio Capraro, Matjaz Perc, Daniele Vilone
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.SI q-bio.PE
Comments: 11 two-column pages, 6 figures
\\
  Lies can have a negating impact on governments, companies, and the society as
a whole. Understanding the dynamics of lying is therefore of crucial importance
across different fields of research. While lying has been studied before in
well-mixed populations, it is a fact that real interactions are rarely
well-mixed. Indeed, they are usually structured and thus best described by
networks. Here we therefore use the Monte Carlo method to study the evolution
of lying in the sender-receiver game in a one-parameter family of networks,
systematically covering complete networks, small-world networks, and
one-dimensional rings. We show that lies which benefit the sender at a cost to
the receiver, the so-called black lies, are less likely to proliferate on
networks than they do in well-mixed populations. Honesty is thus more likely to
evolve, but only when the benefit for the sender is smaller than the cost for
the receiver. Moreover, this effect is particularly strong in small-world
networks, but less so in the one-dimensional ring. For lies that favor the
receiver at a cost to the sender, the so-called altruistic white lies, we show
that honesty is also more likely to evolve than it is in well-mixed
populations. But contrary to black lies, this effect is more expressed in the
one-dimensional ring, whereas in small-world networks it is present only when
the cost to the sender is greater than the benefit for the receiver. Lastly,
for lies that benefit both the sender and the receiver, the so-called Pareto
white lies, we show that the network structure actually favors the evolution of
lying, but this only when the benefit for the sender is slightly greater than
the benefit for the receiver. In this case again the small-world topology acts
as an amplifier of the effect, while other network topologies fail to do the
same.

  Heat and power have become the most indispensable resources. However, the
traditional ways of generating power and heat are inefficient and cause high
pollution; a CHP (Combined Heat and Power) unit can solve these problems well.
In recent years, more attention has been paid to energy conservation and
environmental protection, and Combined Heat and Power Economic Emission
Dispatch (CHPEED) has become an important multi-objective optimization problem.
In this paper, an Indicator & crowding Distance-based Evolutionary Algorithm
(IDBEA) is put forward for handling this non-convex and non-linear problem.
With consideration of the valve-point effects and power transmission loss,
IDBEA is tested on three standard test systems with different types, including
four units, five units and seven units. In the experiment, IDBEA is compared
with several evolutionary algorithms, the simulation results demonstrate that
IDBEA has strong stability and superiority, while the solutions show better
convergence and diversity than several typical algorithms.

Authors: Tommaso Nesti, John Moriarty, Alessandro Zocca, Bert Zwart
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY math.PR physics.soc-ph
Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures
\\
  This paper investigates large fluctuations of Locational Marginal Prices
(LMPs) in wholesale energy markets caused by volatile renewable generation
profiles. Specifically, we study events of the form $\mathbb{P} \Big (
\mathbf{LMP} \notin \prod_{i=1}^n [\alpha_i^-, \alpha_i^+] \Big),$ where
$\mathbf{LMP}$ is the vector of LMPs at the $n$ power grid nodes, and
$\boldsymbol{\alpha}^-,\boldsymbol{\alpha}^+\in\mathbb{R}^n$ are vectors of
price thresholds specifying undesirable price occurrences. By exploiting the
structure of the supply-demand matching mechanism in power grids, we look at
LMPs as deterministic piecewise affine, possibly discontinuous functions of the
stochastic input process, modeling uncontrollable renewable generation. We
utilize techniques from large deviations theory to identify the most likely
ways for extreme price spikes to happen, and to rank the nodes of the power
grid in terms of their likelihood of experiencing a price spike. Our results
are derived in the case of Gaussian fluctuations and are validated numerically
on the IEEE 14-bus test case.

Title: Performance-based Post-earthquake Decision-making for Instrumented
  Buildings
Authors: Milad Roohi, Eric M. Hernandez
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: Under Review in Journal of Civil Structural Health Monitoring
\\
  This paper presents a framework for decision-making regarding post-earthquake
assessment of instrumented buildings in a manner consistent with
performance-based design criteria. This framework is achieved by simultaneously
combining and advancing existing knowledge from seismic structural health
monitoring and performance-based earthquake engineering paradigms and consists
of 1) optimal sensor placement, 2) dynamic response reconstruction, 3) damage
estimation, and 4) performance-assessment and decision-making. In particular,
the main objective is to reconstruct inter-story drifts with a probabilistic
measure of exceeding performance-based acceptance limits and determining the
post-earthquake re-occupancy classification of the instrumented building of
interest. Since the proposed framework is probabilistic, the outcome can be
used to obtain the probability of losses based on the defined decision
variables and be integrated into a risk-based decision-making process by city
officials, building owners, and emergency managers. The framework is
illustrated using data from the Van Nuys hotel testbed, a seven-story
reinforced concrete building instrumented by the California Strong Motion
Instrumentation Program (Station 24386).
