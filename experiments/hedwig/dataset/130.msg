Title: Ontology for Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles

\\
  The development of assessment methods for the performance of Automated
Vehicles (AVs) is essential to enable and speed up the deployment of automated
driving technologies, due to the complex operational domain of AVs. As
traditional methods for assessing vehicles are not applicable for AVs, other
approaches have been proposed. Among these, real-world scenario-based
assessment is widely supported by many players in the automotive field. In this
approach, test cases are derived from real-world scenarios that are obtained
from driving data.
  To minimize any ambiguity regarding these test cases and scenarios, a clear
definition of the notion of scenario is required. In this paper, we propose a
more concrete definition of scenario, compared to what is known to the authors
from the literature. This is achieved by proposing an ontology in which the
quantitative building blocks of a scenario are defined. An example illustrates
that the presented ontology is applicable for scenario-based assessment of AVs.

Title: Augmenting Visual Question Answering with Semantic Frame Information in
  a Multitask Learning Approach
Authors: Mehrdad Alizadeh, Barbara Di Eugenio
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 14th IEEE International Conference on SEMANTIC COMPUTING, 8 Pages,
  February 2020, San Diego CA USA
\\
  Visual Question Answering (VQA) concerns providing answers to Natural
Language questions about images. Several deep neural network approaches have
been proposed to model the task in an end-to-end fashion. Whereas the task is
grounded in visual processing, if the question focuses on events described by
verbs, the language understanding component becomes crucial. Our hypothesis is
that models should be aware of verb semantics, as expressed via semantic role
labels, argument types, and/or frame elements. Unfortunately, no VQA dataset
exists that includes verb semantic information. Our first contribution is a new
VQA dataset (imSituVQA) that we built by taking advantage of the imSitu
annotations. The imSitu dataset consists of images manually labeled with
semantic frame elements, mostly taken from FrameNet. Second, we propose a
multitask CNN-LSTM VQA model that learns to classify the answers as well as the
semantic frame elements. Our experiments show that semantic frame element
classification helps the VQA system avoid inconsistent responses and improves
performance.

Title: Modeling Sensing and Perception Errors towards Robust Decision Making in
  Autonomous Vehicles

\\
  Sensing and Perception (S&P) is a crucial component of an autonomous system
(such as a robot), especially when deployed in highly dynamic environments
where it is required to react to unexpected situations. This is particularly
true in case of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) driving on public roads. However, the
current evaluation metrics for perception algorithms are typically designed to
measure their accuracy per se and do not account for their impact on the
decision making subsystem(s). This limitation does not help developers and
third party evaluators to answer a critical question: is the performance of a
perception subsystem sufficient for the decision making subsystem to make
robust, safe decisions? In this paper, we propose a simulation-based
methodology towards answering this question. At the same time, we show how to
analyze the impact of different kinds of sensing and perception errors on the
behavior of the autonomous system.

Title: A comparison of Vector Symbolic Architectures
Authors: Kenny Schlegel, Peer Neubert, Peter Protzel
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures, preprint - manuscript
\\
  Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) combine a high-dimensional vector space
with a set of carefully designed operators in order to perform symbolic
computations with large numerical vectors. Major goals are the exploitation of
their representational power and ability to deal with fuzziness and ambiguity.
Over the past years, VSAs have been applied to a broad range of tasks and
several VSA implementations have been proposed. The available implementations
differ in the underlying vector space (e.g., binary vectors or complex-valued
vectors) and the particular implementations of the required VSA operators -
with important ramifications for the properties of these architectures. For
example, not every VSA is equally well suited to address each task, including
complete incompatibility. In this paper, we give an overview of eight available
VSA implementations and discuss their commonalities and differences in the
underlying vector space, bundling, and binding/unbinding operations. We create
a taxonomy of available binding/unbinding operations and show an important
ramification for non self-inverse binding operation using an example from
analogical reasoning. A main contribution is the experimental comparison of the
available implementations regarding (1) the capacity of bundles, (2) the
approximation quality of non-exact unbinding operations, and (3) the influence
of combined binding and bundling operations on the query answering performance.
We expect this systematization and comparison to be relevant for development
and evaluation of new VSAs, but most importantly, to support the selection of
an appropriate VSA for a particular task.

\\
  Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), which elegantly combine logic rules and
probabilistic graphical models, can be used to address many knowledge graph
problems. However, inference in MLN is computationally intensive, making the
industrial-scale application of MLN very difficult. In recent years, graph
neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as efficient and effective tools for
large-scale graph problems. Nevertheless, GNNs do not explicitly incorporate
prior logic rules into the models, and may require many labeled examples for a
target task. In this paper, we explore the combination of MLNs and GNNs, and
use graph neural networks for variational inference in MLN. We propose a GNN
variant, named ExpressGNN, which strikes a nice balance between the
representation power and the simplicity of the model. Our extensive experiments
on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ExpressGNN leads to effective
and efficient probabilistic logic reasoning.

Title: Automatic Generation of Application-Specific FPGA Overlays with
  RapidWright
Authors: Joel Mandebi Mbongue, Danielle Tchuinkou Kwadjo and Christophe Bobda
Categories: cs.AR
Comments: 4 pages, 7 figures, FPT 2019 Conference. This paper is the 8-pages
  version of the FPT 2019 paper
\\
  Overlay architectures implemented on FPGA devices have been proposed as a
means to increase FPGA adoption in general-purpose computing. They provide the
benefits of software such as flexibility and programmability, thus making it
easier to build dedicated compilers. However, existing overlays are generic,
resource and power hungry with performance usually an order of magnitude lower
than bare metal implementations. As a result, FPGA overlays have been confined
to research and some niche applications. In this paper, we introduce
Application-Specific FPGA Overlays (AS-Overlays), which can provide bare-metal
performance to FPGA overlays, thus opening doors for broader adoption. Our
approach is based on the automatic extraction of hardware kernels from data
flow applications. Extracted kernels are then leveraged for
application-specific generation of hardware accelerators. Reconfiguration of
the overlay is done with RapidWright which allows to bypass the HDL design
flow. Through prototyping, we demonstrated the viability and relevance of our
approach. Experiments show a productivity improvement up to 20x compared to the
state of the art FPGA overlays, while achieving over 1.33x higher Fmax than
direct FPGA implementation and the possibility of lower resource and power
consumption compared to bare metal.

Title: The Lagrangian remainder of Taylor's series, distinguishes
  $\mathcal{O}(f(x))$ time complexities to polynomials or not

  The purpose of this letter is to investigate the time complexity consequences
of the truncated Taylor series, known as Taylor Polynomials
\cite{bakas2019taylor,Katsoprinakis2011,Nestoridis2011}. In particular, it is
demonstrated that the examination of the $\mathbf{P=NP}$ equality, is
associated with the determination of whether the $n^{th}$ derivative of a
particular solution is bounded or not. Accordingly, in some cases, this is not
true, and hence in general.

Title: Self-Adversarial Learning with Comparative Discrimination for Text
  Generation
Authors: Wangchunshu Zhou, Tao Ge, Ke Xu, Furu Wei, Ming Zhou
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: to be published in ICLR 2020
\\
  Conventional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for text generation tend
to have issues of reward sparsity and mode collapse that affect the quality and
diversity of generated samples. To address the issues, we propose a novel
self-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm for improving GANs' performance in
text generation. In contrast to standard GANs that use a binary classifier as
its discriminator to predict whether a sample is real or generated, SAL employs
a comparative discriminator which is a pairwise classifier for comparing the
text quality between a pair of samples. During training, SAL rewards the
generator when its currently generated sentence is found to be better than its
previously generated samples. This self-improvement reward mechanism allows the
model to receive credits more easily and avoid collapsing towards the limited
number of real samples, which not only helps alleviate the reward sparsity
issue but also reduces the risk of mode collapse. Experiments on text
generation benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach substantially
improves both the quality and the diversity, and yields more stable performance
compared to the previous GANs for text generation.

Title: Pseudo-Bidirectional Decoding for Local Sequence Transduction
Authors: Wangchunshu Zhou, Tao Ge, Ke Xu
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Local sequence transduction (LST) tasks are sequence transduction tasks where
there exists massive overlapping between the source and target sequences, such
as Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and spell or OCR correction. Previous
work generally tackles LST tasks with standard sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)
models that generate output tokens from left to right and suffer from the issue
of unbalanced outputs. Motivated by the characteristic of LST tasks, in this
paper, we propose a simple but versatile approach named Pseudo-Bidirectional
Decoding (PBD) for LST tasks. PBD copies the corresponding representation of
source tokens to the decoder as pseudo future context to enable the decoder to
attends to its bi-directional context. In addition, the bidirectional decoding
scheme and the characteristic of LST tasks motivate us to share the encoder and
the decoder of seq2seq models. The proposed PBD approach provides right side
context information for the decoder and models the inductive bias of LST tasks,
reducing the number of parameters by half and providing good regularization
effects. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our
approach consistently improves the performance of standard seq2seq models on
LST tasks.

Title: Teaching Machines to Converse
Authors: Jiwei Li
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: phd thesis
\\
  The ability of a machine to communicate with humans has long been associated
with the general success of AI. This dates back to Alan Turing's epoch-making
work in the early 1950s, which proposes that a machine's intelligence can be
tested by how well it, the machine, can fool a human into believing that the
machine is a human through dialogue conversations. Many systems learn
generation rules from a minimal set of authored rules or labels on top of
hand-coded rules or templates, and thus are both expensive and difficult to
extend to open-domain scenarios. Recently, the emergence of neural network
models the potential to solve many of the problems in dialogue learning that
earlier systems cannot tackle: the end-to-end neural frameworks offer the
promise of scalability and language-independence, together with the ability to
track the dialogue state and then mapping between states and dialogue actions
in a way not possible with conventional systems. On the other hand, neural
systems bring about new challenges: they tend to output dull and generic
responses; they lack a consistent or a coherent persona; they are usually
optimized through single-turn conversations and are incapable of handling the
long-term success of a conversation; and they are not able to take the
advantage of the interactions with humans. This dissertation attempts to tackle
these challenges: Contributions are two-fold: (1) we address new challenges
presented by neural network models in open-domain dialogue generation systems;
(2) we develop interactive question-answering dialogue systems by (a) giving
the agent the ability to ask questions and (b) training a conversation agent
through interactions with humans in an online fashion, where a bot improves
through communicating with humans and learning from the mistakes that it makes.

Title: Break It Down: A Question Understanding Benchmark

\\
  Understanding natural language questions entails the ability to break down a
question into the requisite steps for computing its answer. In this work, we
introduce a Question Decomposition Meaning Representation (QDMR) for questions.
QDMR constitutes the ordered list of steps, expressed through natural language,
that are necessary for answering a question. We develop a crowdsourcing
pipeline, showing that quality QDMRs can be annotated at scale, and release the
Break dataset, containing over 83K pairs of questions and their QDMRs. We
demonstrate the utility of QDMR by showing that (a) it can be used to improve
open-domain question answering on the HotpotQA dataset, (b) it can be
deterministically converted to a pseudo-SQL formal language, which can
alleviate annotation in semantic parsing applications. Last, we use Break to
train a sequence-to-sequence model with copying that parses questions into QDMR
structures, and show that it substantially outperforms several natural
baselines.

Title: Hybrid Tiled Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Sentiment

Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in the 12th

\\
  The tiled convolutional neural network (tiled CNN) has been applied only to
computer vision for learning invariances. We adjust its architecture to NLP to
improve the extraction of the most salient features for sentiment analysis.
Knowing that the major drawback of the tiled CNN in the NLP field is its
inflexible filter structure, we propose a novel architecture called hybrid
tiled CNN that applies a filter only on the words that appear in the similar
contexts and on their neighbor words (a necessary step for preventing the loss
of some n-grams). The experiments on the datasets of IMDB movie reviews and
SemEval 2017 demonstrate the efficiency of the hybrid tiled CNN that performs
better than both CNN and tiled CNN.

Title: An efficient automated data analytics approach to large scale
  computational comparative linguistics
Authors: Gabija Mikulyte and David Gilbert
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 50 pages, 30 figures
ACM-class: J.m
\\
  This research project aimed to overcome the challenge of analysing human
language relationships, facilitate the grouping of languages and formation of
genealogical relationship between them by developing automated comparison
techniques. Techniques were based on the phonetic representation of certain key
words and concept. Example word sets included numbers 1-10 (curated), large
database of numbers 1-10 and sheep counting numbers 1-10 (other sources),
colours (curated), basic words (curated).
  To enable comparison within the sets the measure of Edit distance was
calculated based on Levenshtein distance metric. This metric between two
strings is the minimum number of single-character edits, operations including:
insertions, deletions or substitutions. To explore which words exhibit more or
less variation, which words are more preserved and examine how languages could
be grouped based on linguistic distances within sets, several data analytics
techniques were involved. Those included density evaluation, hierarchical
clustering, silhouette, mean, standard deviation and Bhattacharya coefficient
calculations. These techniques lead to the development of a workflow which was
later implemented by combining Unix shell scripts, a developed R package and
SWI Prolog. This proved to be computationally efficient and permitted the fast
exploration of large language sets and their analysis.

  Answering simple questions over knowledge graphs is a well-studied problem in
question answering. Previous approaches for this task built on recurrent and
convolutional neural network based architectures that use pretrained word
embeddings. It was recently shown that finetuning pretrained transformer
networks (e.g. BERT) can outperform previous approaches on various natural
language processing tasks. In this work, we investigate how well BERT performs
on SimpleQuestions and provide an evaluation of both BERT and BiLSTM-based
models in datasparse scenarios.

  In this paper we experimentally evaluate a physical unclonable function based
on a polymer optical waveguide, as a time-invariant, replication-resilient,
source of entropy. The elevated physical unclonability of our implementation is
combined with spatial light modulation and post processing techniques, thus
allowing the deterministic generation of an exponentially large pool of
unpredictable responses. The quality of the generated numbers is validated
through NIST/DIEHARD(ER) suites, whereas the overall security of the scheme is
benchmarked assuming attackers with elevated privileges in terms of system
access. Finally, based on the demonstrated key features, we present and analyze
a mutual authentication implementation scenario which is fully compatible with
state-of-the-art commercial Internet-Of-Things architectures

Title: Adversarial vs behavioural-based defensive AI with joint, continual and

\\
  Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have brought new
capabilities to behavioural analysis (UEBA) for cyber-security consisting in
the detection of hostile action based on the unusual nature of events observed
on the Information System.In our previous work (presented at C\&ESAR 2018 and
FIC 2019), we have associated deep neural networks auto-encoders for anomaly
detection and graph-based events correlation to address major limitations in
UEBA systems. This resulted in reduced false positive and false negative rates,
improved alert explainability, while maintaining real-time performances and
scalability. However, we did not address the natural evolution of behaviours
through time, also known as concept drift. To maintain effective detection
capabilities, an anomaly-based detection system must be continually trained,
which opens a door to an adversary that can conduct the so-called
"frog-boiling" attack by progressively distilling unnoticed attack traces
inside the behavioural models until the complete attack is considered normal.
In this paper, we present a solution to effectively mitigate this attack by
improving the detection process and efficiently leveraging human expertise. We
also present preliminary work on adversarial AI conducting deception attack,
which, in term, will be used to help assess and improve the defense system.
These defensive and offensive AI implement joint, continual and active
learning, in a step that is necessary in assessing, validating and certifying
AI-based defensive solutions.

Title: NASS: Optimizing Secure Inference via Neural Architecture Search

  Conference on Artificial Intelligence
\\
  Due to increasing privacy concerns, neural network (NN) based secure
inference (SI) schemes that simultaneously hide the client inputs and server
models attract major research interests. While existing works focused on
developing secure protocols for NN-based SI, in this work, we take a different
approach. We propose {\placeholder}, an integrated framework to search for
tailored NN architectures designed specifically for SI. In particular, we
propose to model cryptographic protocols as design elements with associated
reward functions. The characterized models are then adopted in a joint
optimization with predicted hyperparameters in identifying the best NN
architectures that balance prediction accuracy and execution efficiency. In the
experiment, it is demonstrated that we can achieve the best of both worlds by
using NASS, where the prediction accuracy can be improved from 81.6% to 84.6%,

Title: Adversarial Code Learning for Image Generation
Authors: Jiangbo Yuan, Bing Wu, Wanying Ding, Qing Ping, and Zhendong Yu
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  We introduce the "adversarial code learning" (ACL) module that improves
overall image generation performance to several types of deep models. Instead
of performing a posterior distribution modeling in the pixel spaces of
generators, ACLs aim to jointly learn a latent code with another image
encoder/inference net, with a prior noise as its input. We conduct the learning
in an adversarial learning process, which bears a close resemblance to the
original GAN but again shifts the learning from image spaces to prior and
latent code spaces. ACL is a portable module that brings up much more
flexibility and possibilities in generative model designs. First, it allows
flexibility to convert non-generative models like Autoencoders and standard
classification models to decent generative models. Second, it enhances existing
GANs' performance by generating meaningful codes and images from any part of
the prior. We have incorporated our ACL module with the aforementioned
frameworks and have performed experiments on synthetic, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CelebA datasets. Our models have achieved significant improvements which
demonstrated the generality for image generation tasks.

Title: Dual Convolutional LSTM Network for Referring Image Segmentation
Authors: Linwei Ye, Zhi Liu, Yang Wang

Comments: 12 pages, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia
DOI: 10.1109/TMM.2020.2971171
\\
  We consider referring image segmentation. It is a problem at the intersection
of computer vision and natural language understanding. Given an input image and
a referring expression in the form of a natural language sentence, the goal is
to segment the object of interest in the image referred by the linguistic
query. To this end, we propose a dual convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) network to
tackle this problem. Our model consists of an encoder network and a decoder
network, where ConvLSTM is used in both encoder and decoder networks to capture
spatial and sequential information. The encoder network extracts visual and
linguistic features for each word in the expression sentence, and adopts an
attention mechanism to focus on words that are more informative in the
multimodal interaction. The decoder network integrates the features generated
by the encoder network at multiple levels as its input and produces the final
precise segmentation mask. Experimental results on four challenging datasets
demonstrate that the proposed network achieves superior segmentation
performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

\\
  Egocentric perception has grown rapidly with the advent of immersive
computing devices. Human gaze prediction is an important problem in analyzing
egocentric videos and has largely been tackled through either saliency-based
modeling or highly supervised learning. In this work, we tackle the problem of
jointly predicting human gaze points and temporal segmentation of egocentric
videos, in an unsupervised manner without using any training data. We introduce
an unsupervised computational model that draws inspiration from cognitive
psychology models of human attention and event perception. We use Grenander's
pattern theory formalism to represent spatial-temporal features and model
surprise as a mechanism to predict gaze fixation points and temporally segment
egocentric videos. Extensive evaluation on two publicly available datasets -
GTEA and GTEA+ datasets show that the proposed model is able to outperform all
unsupervised baselines and some supervised gaze prediction baselines. Finally,
we show that the model can also temporally segment egocentric videos with a
performance comparable to more complex, fully supervised deep learning
baselines.

Title: Ellipse R-CNN: Learning to Infer Elliptical Object from Clustering and
  Occlusion
Authors: Wenbo Dong, Pravakar Roy, Cheng Peng, Volkan Isler
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: 12 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Images of heavily occluded objects in cluttered scenes, such as fruit
clusters in trees, are hard to segment. To further retrieve the 3D size and 6D
pose of each individual object in such cases, bounding boxes are not reliable
from multiple views since only a little portion of the object's geometry is
captured. We introduce the first CNN-based ellipse detector, called Ellipse
R-CNN, to represent and infer occluded objects as ellipses. We first propose a
robust and compact ellipse regression based on the Mask R-CNN architecture for
elliptical object detection. Our method can infer the parameters of multiple
elliptical objects even they are occluded by other neighboring objects. For
better occlusion handling, we exploit refined feature regions for the
regression stage, and integrate the U-Net structure for learning different
occlusion patterns to compute the final detection score. The correctness of
ellipse regression is validated through experiments performed on synthetic data
of clustered ellipses. We further quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate
that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model (i.e., Mask R-CNN
followed by ellipse fitting) and its three variants on both synthetic and real
datasets of occluded and clustered elliptical objects.

  Research in the field of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has
significantly advanced in recent years, mainly due to their relevance in a
large variety of commercial, industrial, and military applications. However,
UAV navigation in GPS-denied environments continues to be a challenging problem
that has been tackled in recent research through sensor-based approaches. This
paper presents a novel offline, portable, real-time in-door UAV localization
technique that relies on macro-feature detection and matching. The proposed
system leverages the support of machine learning, traditional computer vision
techniques, and pre-existing knowledge of the environment. The main
contribution of this work is the real-time creation of a macro-feature
description vector from the UAV captured images which are simultaneously
matched with an offline pre-existing vector from a Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
model. This results in a quick UAV localization within the CAD model. The
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed system were evaluated through
simulations and experimental prototype implementation. Final results reveal the
algorithm's low computational burden as well as its ease of deployment in
GPS-denied environments.

Title: Search for Better Students to Learn Distilled Knowledge
Authors: Jindong Gu, Volker Tresp
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Journal-ref: 24th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI), 2020
\\
  Knowledge Distillation, as a model compression technique, has received great
attention. The knowledge of a well-performed teacher is distilled to a student
with a small architecture. The architecture of the small student is often
chosen to be similar to their teacher's, with fewer layers or fewer channels,
or both. However, even with the same number of FLOPs or parameters, the
students with different architecture can achieve different generalization
ability. The configuration of a student architecture requires intensive network
architecture engineering. In this work, instead of designing a good student
architecture manually, we propose to search for the optimal student
automatically. Based on L1-norm optimization, a subgraph from the teacher
network topology graph is selected as a student, the goal of which is to
minimize the KL-divergence between student's and teacher's outputs. We verify
the proposal on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. The empirical experiments show
that the learned student architecture achieves better performance than ones
specified manually. We also visualize and understand the architecture of the
found student.

Title: ParkingSticker: A Real-World Object Detection Dataset
Authors: Ethem F. Can, Caroline Potts, Aysu Ezen Can, Xiangqian Hu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 8 figures
\\
  We present a new and challenging object detection dataset, ParkingSticker,
which mimics the type of data available in industry problems more closely than
popular existing datasets like PASCAL VOC. ParkingSticker contains 1,871 images
that come from a security camera's video footage. The objective is to identify
parking stickers on cars approaching a gate that the security camera faces.
Bounding boxes are drawn around parking stickers in the images. The parking
stickers are much smaller on average than the objects in other popular object
detection datasets; this makes ParkingSticker a challenging test for object
detection methods. This dataset also very realistically represents the data
available in many industry problems where a customer presents a few video
frames and asks for a solution to a very difficult problem. Performance of
various object detection pipelines using a YOLOv2 architecture are presented
and indicate that identifying the parking stickers in ParkingSticker is
challenging yet feasible. We believe that this dataset will challenge
researchers to solve a real-world problem with real-world constraints such as
non-ideal camera positioning and small object-size-to-image-size ratios.

\\
  With the prevalence of RGB-D cameras, multi-modal video data have become more
available for human action recognition. One main challenge for this task lies
in how to effectively leverage their complementary information. In this work,
we propose a Modality Compensation Network (MCN) to explore the relationships
of different modalities, and boost the representations for human action
recognition. We regard RGB/optical flow videos as source modalities, skeletons
as auxiliary modality. Our goal is to extract more discriminative features from
source modalities, with the help of auxiliary modality. Built on deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks,
our model bridges data from source and auxiliary modalities by a modality
adaptation block to achieve adaptive representation learning, that the network
learns to compensate for the loss of skeletons at test time and even at
training time. We explore multiple adaptation schemes to narrow the distance
between source and auxiliary modal distributions from different levels,
according to the alignment of source and auxiliary data in training. In
addition, skeletons are only required in the training phase. Our model is able
to improve the recognition performance with source data when testing.
Experimental results reveal that MCN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
four widely-used action recognition benchmarks.

Title: Symmetrical Synthesis for Deep Metric Learning
Authors: Geonmo Gu, Byungsoo Ko
Categories: cs.CV cs.IR
Comments: Accepted by AAAI 2020
\\
  Deep metric learning aims to learn embeddings that contain semantic
similarity information among data points. To learn better embeddings, methods
to generate synthetic hard samples have been proposed. Existing methods of
synthetic hard sample generation are adopting autoencoders or generative
adversarial networks, but this leads to more hyper-parameters, harder
optimization, and slower training speed. In this paper, we address these
problems by proposing a novel method of synthetic hard sample generation called
symmetrical synthesis. Given two original feature points from the same class,
the proposed method firstly generates synthetic points with each other as an
axis of symmetry. Secondly, it performs hard negative pair mining within the
original and synthetic points to select a more informative negative pair for
computing the metric learning loss. Our proposed method is hyper-parameter free
and plug-and-play for existing metric learning losses without network
modification. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
existing methods for a variety of loss functions on clustering and image
retrieval tasks. Our implementations is publicly available.

Title: C-DLinkNet: considering multi-level semantic features for human parsing
Authors: Yu Lu, Muyan Feng, Ming Wu, Chuang Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Human parsing is an essential branch of semantic segmentation, which is a
fine-grained semantic segmentation task to identify the constituent parts of
human. The challenge of human parsing is to extract effective semantic features
to resolve deformation and multi-scale variations. In this work, we proposed an
end-to-end model called C-DLinkNet based on LinkNet, which contains a new
module named Smooth Module to combine the multi-level features in Decoder part.
C-DLinkNet is capable of producing competitive parsing performance compared
with the state-of-the-art methods with smaller input sizes and no additional
information, i.e., achiving mIoU=53.05 on the validation set of LIP dataset.

Comments: 42 pages, 17 figures
\\
  High order data is modeled using matrices whose entries are numerical arrays
of a fixed size. These arrays, called t-scalars, form a commutative ring under
the convolution product. Matrices with elements in the ring of t-scalars are
referred to as t-matrices. The t-matrices can be scaled, added and multiplied
in the usual way. There are t-matrix generalizations of positive matrices,
orthogonal matrices and Hermitian symmetric matrices. With the t-matrix model,
it is possible to generalize many well-known matrix algorithms. In particular,
the t-matrices are used to generalize the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition),
HOSVD (High Order SVD), PCA (Principal Component Analysis), 2DPCA (Two
Dimensional PCA) and GCA (Grassmannian Component Analysis). The generalized
t-matrix algorithms, namely TSVD, THOSVD,TPCA, T2DPCA and TGCA, are applied to
low-rank approximation, reconstruction,and supervised classification of images.
Experiments show that the t-matrix algorithms compare favorably with standard
matrix algorithms.

\\
  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with mounted cameras have the advantage of
capturing aerial (bird-view) images. The availability of aerial visual data and
the recent advances in object detection algorithms led the computer vision
community to focus on object detection tasks on aerial images. As a result of
this, several aerial datasets have been introduced, including visual data with
object annotations. UAVs are used solely as flying-cameras in these datasets,
discarding different data types regarding the flight (e.g., time, location,
internal sensors). In this work, we propose a multi-purpose aerial dataset
(AU-AIR) that has multi-modal sensor data (i.e., visual, time, location,
altitude, IMU, velocity) collected in real-world outdoor environments. The
AU-AIR dataset includes meta-data for extracted frames (i.e., bounding box
annotations for traffic-related object category) from recorded RGB videos.
Moreover, we emphasize the differences between natural and aerial images in the
context of object detection task. For this end, we train and test mobile object
detectors (including YOLOv3-Tiny and MobileNetv2-SSDLite) on the AU-AIR
dataset, which are applicable for real-time object detection using on-board
computers with UAVs. Since our dataset has diversity in recorded data types, it
contributes to filling the gap between computer vision and robotics. The

Title: Reconstructing Natural Scenes from fMRI Patterns using BigBiGAN
Authors: Milad Mozafari, Leila Reddy, Rufin VanRullen
Categories: cs.CV cs.HC eess.IV q-bio.NC
\\
  Decoding and reconstructing images from brain imaging data is a research area
of high interest. Recent progress in deep generative neural networks has
introduced new opportunities to tackle this problem. Here, we employ a recently
proposed large-scale bi-directional generative adversarial network, called
BigBiGAN, to decode and reconstruct natural scenes from fMRI patterns. BigBiGAN
converts images into a 120-dimensional latent space which encodes class and
attribute information together, and can also reconstruct images based on their
latent vectors. We trained a linear mapping between fMRI data, acquired over
images from 150 different categories of ImageNet, and their corresponding
BigBiGAN latent vectors. Then, we applied this mapping to the fMRI activity
patterns obtained from 50 new test images from 50 unseen categories in order to
retrieve their latent vectors, and reconstruct the corresponding images.
Pairwise image decoding from the predicted latent vectors was highly accurate
(84%). Moreover, qualitative and quantitative assessments revealed that the
resulting image reconstructions were visually plausible, successfully captured
many attributes of the original images, and had high perceptual similarity with
the original content. This method establishes a new state-of-the-art for
fMRI-based natural image reconstruction, and can be flexibly updated to take
into account any future improvements in generative models of natural scene
images.

\\
  This paper addresses the task of set prediction using deep feed-forward
neural networks. A set is a collection of elements which is invariant under
permutation and the size of a set is not fixed in advance. Many real-world
problems, such as image tagging and object detection, have outputs that are
naturally expressed as sets of entities. This creates a challenge for
traditional deep neural networks which naturally deal with structured outputs
such as vectors, matrices or tensors. We present a novel approach for learning
to predict sets with unknown permutation and cardinality using deep neural
networks. In our formulation we define a likelihood for a set distribution
represented by a) two discrete distributions defining the set cardinally and
permutation variables, and b) a joint distribution over set elements with a
fixed cardinality. Depending on the problem under consideration, we define
different training models for set prediction using deep neural networks. We
demonstrate the validity of our set formulations on relevant vision problems
such as: 1)multi-label image classification where we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, 2) object detection, for
which our formulation outperforms state-of-the-art detectors such as Faster
R-CNN and YOLO v3, and 3) a complex CAPTCHA test, where we observe that,
surprisingly, our set-based network acquired the ability of mimicking
arithmetics without any rules being coded.

Title: Lossless Attention in Convolutional Networks for Facial Expression
  Recognition in the Wild

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 5 pages,4 figures
\\
  Unlike the constraint frontal face condition, faces in the wild have various
unconstrained interference factors, such as complex illumination, changing
perspective and various occlusions. Facial expressions recognition (FER) in the
wild is a challenging task and existing methods can't perform well. However,
for occluded faces (containing occlusion caused by other objects and
self-occlusion caused by head posture changes), the attention mechanism has the
ability to focus on the non-occluded regions automatically. In this paper, we
propose a Lossless Attention Model (LLAM) for convolutional neural networks
(CNN) to extract attention-aware features from faces. Our module avoids decay
information in the process of generating attention maps by using the
information of the previous layer and not reducing the dimensionality.
Sequentially, we adaptively refine the feature responses by fusing the
attention map with the feature map. We participate in the seven basic
expression classification sub-challenges of FG-2020 Affective Behavior Analysis
in-the-wild Challenge. And we validate our method on the Aff-Wild2 datasets
released by the Challenge. The total accuracy (Accuracy) and the unweighted
mean (F1) of our method on the validation set are 0.49 and 0.38 respectively,
and the final result is 0.42 (0.67 F1-Score + 0.33 Accuracy).

\\
  Understanding how goal states control behavior is a question ripe for
interrogation by new methods from machine learning. These methods require large
and labeled datasets to train models. To annotate a large-scale image dataset
with observed search fixations, we collected 16,184 fixations from people
searching for either microwaves or clocks in a dataset of 4,366 images
(MS-COCO). We then used this behaviorally-annotated dataset and the machine
learning method of Inverse-Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to learn
target-specific reward functions and policies for these two target goals.
Finally, we used these learned policies to predict the fixations of 60 new
behavioral searchers (clock = 30, microwave = 30) in a disjoint test dataset of
kitchen scenes depicting both a microwave and a clock (thus controlling for
differences in low-level image contrast). We found that the IRL model predicted
behavioral search efficiency and fixation-density maps using multiple metrics.
Moreover, reward maps from the IRL model revealed target-specific patterns that
suggest, not just attention guidance by target features, but also guidance by
scene context (e.g., fixations along walls in the search of clocks). Using
machine learning and the psychologically-meaningful principle of reward, it is
possible to learn the visual features used in goal-directed attention control.

Title: A framework for large-scale mapping of human settlement extent from
  Sentinel-2 images via fully convolutional neural networks
Authors: C. Qiu and M. Schmitt and C. Geiss and T. K. Chen and X. X. Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Human settlement extent (HSE) information is a valuable indicator of
world-wide urbanization as well as the resulting human pressure on the natural
environment. Therefore, mapping HSE is critical for various environmental
issues at local, regional, and even global scales. This paper presents a
deep-learning-based framework to automatically map HSE from multi-spectral
Sentinel-2 data using regionally available geo-products as training labels. A
straightforward, simple, yet effective fully convolutional network-based
architecture, Sen2HSE, is implemented as an example for semantic segmentation
within the framework. The framework is validated against both manually labelled
checking points distributed evenly over the test areas, and the OpenStreetMap
building layer. The HSE mapping results were extensively compared to several
baseline products in order to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed HSE mapping framework. The HSE mapping power is consistently
demonstrated over 10 representative areas across the world. We also present one
regional-scale and one country-wide HSE mapping example from our framework to
show the potential for upscaling. The results of this study contribute to the
generalization of the applicability of CNN-based approaches for large-scale
urban mapping to cases where no up-to-date and accurate ground truth is
available, as well as the subsequent monitor of global urbanization.

  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have evolved as popular machine
learning models for image classification during the past few years, due to
their ability to learn the problem-specific features directly from the input
images. The success of deep learning models solicits architecture engineering
rather than hand-engineering the features. However, designing state-of-the-art
CNN for a given task remains a non-trivial and challenging task. While
transferring the learned knowledge from one task to another, fine-tuning with
the target-dependent fully connected layers produces better results over the
target task. In this paper, the proposed AutoFCL model attempts to learn the
structure of Fully Connected (FC) layers of a CNN automatically using Bayesian
optimization. To evaluate the performance of the proposed AutoFCL, we utilize
five popular CNN models such as VGG-16, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and
NASNetMobile. The experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely
CalTech-101, Oxford-102 Flowers, and UC Merced Land Use datasets. Fine-tuning
the newly learned (target-dependent) FC layers leads to state-of-the-art
performance, according to the experiments carried out in this research. The
proposed AutoFCL method outperforms the existing methods over CalTech-101 and
Oxford-102 Flowers datasets by achieving the accuracy of 94.38% and 98.89%,
respectively. However, our method achieves comparable performance on the UC
Merced Land Use dataset with 96.83% accuracy.

Title: Continuous Emotion Recognition via Deep Convolutional Autoencoder and
  Support Vector Regressor

\\
  Automatic facial expression recognition is an important research area in the
emotion recognition and computer vision. Applications can be found in several
domains such as medical treatment, driver fatigue surveillance, sociable
robotics, and several other human-computer interaction systems. Therefore, it
is crucial that the machine should be able to recognize the emotional state of
the user with high accuracy. In recent years, deep neural networks have been
used with great success in recognizing emotions. In this paper, we present a
new model for continuous emotion recognition based on facial expression
recognition by using an unsupervised learning approach based on transfer
learning and autoencoders. The proposed approach also includes preprocessing
and post-processing techniques which contribute favorably to improving the
performance of predicting the concordance correlation coefficient for arousal
and valence dimensions. Experimental results for predicting spontaneous and
natural emotions on the RECOLA 2016 dataset have shown that the proposed
approach based on visual information can achieve CCCs of 0.516 and 0.264 for
valence and arousal, respectively.

Title: Theoretical Model and Practical Considerations for Data Lineage
  Reconstruction
Authors: Egor Pushkin
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  We live in a world driven by data. The amount of it outgrows anyone's ability
to oversee it or even observe its scope. Along with all the advances in the
space of data management, there is still a significant lack of formalism and
standardization around defining data ecosystems and processes occurring within
those. In order to address the issue we propose a notation for data flow
modeling and evaluate some of the most common applications of it based on
real-world use cases. To facilitate future work, we provide detailed reference
of the data model we defined and consider potential programming paradigms.

Title: Edit Distance Embedding using Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Xinyan Dai, Xiao Yan, Kaiwen Zhou, Yuxuan Wang, Han Yang, James Cheng
Categories: cs.DB cs.LG
\\
  Edit-distance-based string similarity search has many applications such as
spell correction, data de-duplication, and sequence alignment. However,
computing edit distance is known to have high complexity, which makes string
similarity search challenging for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a
deep learning pipeline (called CNN-ED) that embeds edit distance into Euclidean
distance for fast approximate similarity search. A convolutional neural network
(CNN) is used to generate fixed-length vector embeddings for a dataset of
strings and the loss function is a combination of the triplet loss and the
approximation error. To justify our choice of using CNN instead of other
structures (e.g., RNN) as the model, theoretical analysis is conducted to show
that some basic operations in our CNN model preserve edit distance.
Experimental results show that CNN-ED outperforms data-independent CGK
embedding and RNN-based GRU embedding in terms of both accuracy and efficiency
by a large margin. We also show that string similarity search can be
significantly accelerated using CNN-based embeddings, sometimes by orders of
magnitude.

\\
  Our work has been originally motivated by Tezos, a public blockchain which
focuses on software correctness and which enables formal reasoning and
verification. To further strengthen the resilience of Tezos, which now depends
on a consensus protocol delivering only probabilistic finality, we propose a
consensus protocol that brings deterministic finality. Our solution is backward
compatible with the current liquid proof-of-stake system underlying Tezos. The
main contributions of this paper are the following: (i) a formal specification
of the Dynamic Repeated Consensus (DRC) problem, an adaptation of the repeated
consensus problem to dynamic committees, (ii) Tenderbake, a solution to the DRC
problem in a Byzantine and partially synchronous system model. In contrast to
recent proposals, Tenderbake works with bounded message buffers. This feature
represents a countermeasure to spamming and prevents runtime memory errors. For
these reasons we think that Tenderbake is suitable for blockchains aiming to
guarantee deterministic finality in a public setting.

Title: Unsatisfiability Proofs for Weight 16 Codewords in Lam's Problem

Categories: cs.DM cs.LO cs.SC math.CO
\\
  In the 1970s and 1980s, searches performed by L. Carter, C. Lam, L. Thiel,
and S. Swiercz showed that projective planes of order ten with weight 16
codewords do not exist. These searches required highly specialized and
optimized computer programs and required about 2,000 hours of computing time on
mainframe and supermini computers. In 2011, these searches were verified by D.
Roy using an optimized C program and 16,000 hours on a cluster of desktop
machines. We performed a verification of these searches by reducing the problem
to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Our verification uses the
cube-and-conquer SAT solving paradigm, symmetry breaking techniques using the
computer algebra system Maple, and a result of Carter that there are ten
nonisomorphic cases to check. Our searches completed in about 30 hours on a
desktop machine and produced nonexistence proofs of about 1 terabyte in the
DRAT (deletion resolution asymmetric tautology) format.

Title: Nonexistence Certificates for Ovals in a Projective Plane of Order Ten

Categories: cs.DM cs.LO cs.SC math.CO
\\
  In 1983, a computer search was performed for ovals in a projective plane of
order ten. The search was exhaustive and negative, implying that such ovals do
not exist. However, no nonexistence certificates were produced by this search,
and to the best of our knowledge the search has never been independently
verified. In this paper, we rerun the search for ovals in a projective plane of
order ten and produce a collection of nonexistence certificates that, when
taken together, imply that such ovals do not exist. Our search program uses the
cube-and-conquer paradigm from the field of satisfiability (SAT) checking,
coupled with a programmatic SAT solver and the nauty symbolic computation
library for removing symmetries from the search.

Title: An algebraic 1.375-approximation algorithm for the Transposition
  Distance Problem
Authors: L. A. G. Silva, L. A. B. Kowada, N. R. Rocco, M. E. M. T. Walter
Categories: cs.DS math.CO
\\
  In genome rearrangements, the mutational event \emph{transposition} swaps two
adjacent blocks of genes in one chromosome. The \emph{Transposition Distance
Problem} (TDP) aims to find the minimum number of transpositions (distance)
required to transform one chromosome into another, both represented as
permutations. Setting the target permutation as the identity permutation, makes
the TDP equivalent to the problem of \emph{Sorting by Transpositions} (SBT).
  TDP is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard and the best approximation algorithm with a
$1.375$ ratio was proposed in 2006 by Elias and Hartman. Their algorithm
employs a technique called \emph{simplification} to transform an input
permutation $\pi$ into a \emph{simple permutation} $\hat{\pi}$, obtained by
inserting new symbols into $\pi$ in a way that the lower bound of the
transposition distance of $\pi$ is kept on $\hat{\pi}$. The assumption is that
handling with simple permutations is easier than with normal ones. A sequence
of transpositions sorting $\hat{\pi}$ can be mimicked to sort $\pi$.
  In this work, we first show that the algorithm of Elias and Hartman may
require one transposition above the intended approximation ratio of $1.375$,
depending on how the input permutation is simplified. Then, we propose a new
$1.375$-approximation algorithm to solve TDP based on an algebraic formalism
which does not use simplification, ensuring the approximation ratio of $1.375$
for all the permutations in the Symmetric Group $S_n$. We also propose a new
upper bound for the transposition distance.
  Implementations of our algorithm and the one of Elias and Hartman were
audited using GRAAu tool. The results show that, taking as input short
permutations with maximum length $13$, in addition to keeping the approximation
below the $1.375$ ratio, our algorithm returns a higher percentage of exact
distances than the one of Elias and Hartman.

Title: Optimal selection on $X+Y$ simplified with layer-ordered heaps
Authors: Oliver Serang
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Selection on the Cartesian sum, $A+B$, is a classic and important problem.
Frederickson's 1993 algorithm produced the first algorithm that made possible
an optimal runtime. Kaplan \emph{et al.}'s recent 2018 paper descibed an
alternative optimal algorithm by using Chazelle's soft heaps. These extant
optimal algorithms are very complex; this complexity can lead to difficulty
implementing them and to poor performance in practice. Here, a new optimal
algorithm is presented, which uses layer-ordered heaps. This new algorithm is
both simple to implement and practically efficient.

Title: Efficient Differentially Private F_0 Linear Sketching
Authors: Rasmus Pagh and Nina Mesing Stausholm
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  A powerful feature of linear sketches is that from sketches of two data
vectors, one can compute the sketch of the difference between the vectors. This
allows us to answer fine-grained questions about the difference between two
data sets. In this work, we consider how to achieve this kind of property with
sketches that are differentially private. We describe how to compute linear
sketches for $F_0$, the number of distinct elements, that can efficiently be
made differentially private. Specifically, we consider a sketch that is linear
over GF(2), mapping a vector $x\in \{0,1\}^u$ to $Hx\in\{0,1\}^\tau$ for a
matrix $H$ sampled from a suitable distribution $\mathcal{H}$. Differential
privacy is achieved by using randomized response, flipping each bit of $Hx$
with probability $p<1/2$. That is, for a vector $\varphi \in \{0,1\}^\tau$
where $\Pr[(\varphi)_j = 1] = p$ independently for each entry $j$, we consider
the noisy sketch $Hx + \varphi$, where the addition of noise happens over
GF(2). We show that for every choice of $0<\beta, \varepsilon < 1$ there exists
$p<1/2$ and a distribution $\mathcal{H}$ of linear sketches of size $\tau =
O(\log^4(u)\varepsilon^{-2}\beta^{-2})$ such that: 1) For random
$H\sim\mathcal{H}$ and noise vector $\varphi$, given $Hx + \varphi$ we can
compute an estimate of $\Vert x\Vert_0$ that is accurate within a factor
$1\pm\beta$, plus an additive error $O(\log^3(u)\varepsilon^{-2}\beta^{-2})$,
with high probability, and 2) For every $H\sim\mathcal{H}$, $Hx + \varphi$ is
$\varepsilon$-differentially private over the randomness in $\varphi$.
Previously, Mir et al.~(PODS 2011) had described a private way of sketching
$F_0$, but their noise vector $\varphi$ is constructed using the exponential
mechanism, and is not computationally efficient (quasipolynomial time in the
sketch size)...

Title: Ultimate greedy approximation of independent sets in subcubic graphs
Authors: Piotr Krysta, Mathieu Mari, Nan Zhi
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: Preliminary version of this paper has been published in the
  proceedings of ACM-SIAM SODA 2020
\\
  We study the approximability of the maximum size independent set (MIS)
problem in bounded degree graphs. This is one of the most classic and widely
studied NP-hard optimization problems. We focus on the well known minimum
degree greedy algorithm for this problem. This algorithm iteratively chooses a
minimum degree vertex in the graph, adds it to the solution and removes its
neighbors, until the remaining graph is empty. The approximation ratios of this
algorithm have been very widely studied, where it is augmented with an advice
that tells the greedy which minimum degree vertex to choose if it is not
unique. Our main contribution is a new mathematical theory for the design of
such greedy algorithms with efficiently computable advice and for the analysis
of their approximation ratios. With this new theory we obtain the ultimate
approximation ratio of 5/4 for greedy on graphs with maximum degree 3, which
completely solves the open problem from the paper by Halldorsson and Yoshihara
(1995). Our algorithm is the fastest currently known algorithm with this
approximation ratio on such graphs. We apply our new algorithm to the minimum
vertex cover problem on graphs with maximum degree 3 to obtain a substantially
faster 6/5-approximation algorithm than the one currently known. We complement
our positive, upper bound results with negative, lower bound results which
prove that the problem of designing good advice for greedy is computationally
hard and even hard to approximate on various classes of graphs. These results
significantly improve on such previously known hardness results. Moreover,
these results suggest that obtaining the upper bound results on the design and
analysis of greedy advice is non-trivial.

  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the field of artificial
intelligence and have achieved unprecedented success in cognitive tasks such as
image and speech recognition. Training of large DNNs, however, is
computationally intensive and this has motivated the search for novel computing
architectures targeting this application. A computational memory unit with
nanoscale resistive memory devices organized in crossbar arrays could store the
synaptic weights in their conductance states and perform the expensive weighted
summations in place in a non-von Neumann manner. However, updating the
conductance states in a reliable manner during the weight update process is a
fundamental challenge that limits the training accuracy of such an
implementation. Here, we propose a mixed-precision architecture that combines a
computational memory unit performing the weighted summations and imprecise
conductance updates with a digital processing unit that accumulates the weight
updates in high precision. A combined hardware/software training experiment of
a multilayer perceptron based on the proposed architecture using a phase-change
memory (PCM) array achieves 97.73% test accuracy on the task of classifying
handwritten digits (based on the MNIST dataset), within 0.6% of the software
baseline. The architecture is further evaluated using accurate behavioral
models of PCM on a wide class of networks, namely convolutional neural
networks, long-short-term-memory networks, and generative-adversarial networks.
Accuracies comparable to those of floating-point implementations are achieved
without being constrained by the non-idealities associated with the PCM
devices. A system-level study demonstrates 173x improvement in energy
efficiency of the architecture when used for training a multilayer perceptron
compared with a dedicated fully digital 32-bit implementation.

Title: The Uniform Measure of Simple Regular Sets of Infinite Trees
Authors: Marcin Przyby{\l}ko, Micha{\l} Skrzypczak
Categories: cs.FL
\\
  We consider the problem of computing the measure of a regular set of infinite
binary trees. While the general case remains unsolved, we show that the measure
of a language can be computed when the set is given in one of the following
three formalisms: a first-order formula with no descendant relation; a Boolean
combination of conjunctive queries (with descendant relation); or by a
non-deterministic safety tree automaton. Additionally, in the first two cases
the measure of the set is always rational, while in the third it is an
algebraic number. Moreover, we provide an example of a first-order formula that
uses descendant relation and defines a language of infinite trees having an
irrational (but algebraic) measure.

Title: On the binomial equivalence classes of finite words
Authors: Marie Lejeune, Michel Rigo, Matthieu Rosenfeld
Categories: cs.FL cs.DM math.CO
\\
  Two finite words $u$ and $v$ are $k$-binomially equivalent if, for each word
$x$ of length at most $k$, $x$ appears the same number of times as a
subsequence (i.e., as a scattered subword) of both $u$ and $v$. This notion
generalizes abelian equivalence. In this paper, we study the equivalence
classes induced by the $k$-binomial equivalence with a special focus on the
cardinalities of the classes. We provide an algorithm generating the
$2$-binomial equivalence class of a word. For $k \geq 2$ and alphabet of $3$ or
more symbols, the language made of lexicographically least elements of every
$k$-binomial equivalence class and the language of singletons, i.e., the words
whose $k$-binomial equivalence class is restricted to a single element, are
shown to be non context-free. As a consequence of our discussions, we also
prove that the submonoid generated by the generators of the free nil-$2$ group
on $m$ generators is isomorphic to the quotient of the free monoid $\{ 1,
\ldots , m\}^{*}$ by the $2$-binomial equivalence.

Title: Coupled Charging-and-Driving Incentives Design for Electric Vehicles in
  Urban Networks
Authors: Beno\^it Sohet, Yezekael Hayel, Olivier Beaude, and Alban Jeandin

Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent
  Transportation Systems
\\
  Electric Vehicles (EV) impact urban networks both when driving (e.g., noise
and pollution reduction) and charging. For the electrical grid, the flexibility
of EV charging makes it a significant actor in "Demand Response" mechanisms.
Therefore, there is a need to design incentive mechanisms to foster customer
engagement. A congestion game approach is adopted to evaluate the performance
of such electrical transportation system with multiple classes of vehicles: EV
and Gasoline Vehicles. Both temporal and energy operating costs are considered.
The latter is nonseparable as it depends on the global charging need of all EV,
which is scheduled in time by a centralized aggregator in function of
nonflexible consumption at charging location. Thus, driving and charging
decisions are coupled. An adaptation of Beckmann's method proves the existence
of a Wardrop Equilibrium (WE) in the considered nonseparable congestion game;
this WE is unique when the charging unit price is an increasing function of the
global charging need. A condition on the nonflexible load is given to guarantee
the monotonicity of this function. This condition is tested on real consumption
data in France and in Texas, USA. Optimal tolls are used to control this
electrical transportation system and then computed in order to minimize an
environmental cost on a simple network topology.

Title: The Competitive Effects of Variance-based Pricing
Authors: Ludwig Dierks, Sven Seuken
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  In many markets, like electricity or cloud computing markets, providers incur
large costs for keeping sufficient capacity in reserve to accommodate demand
fluctuations of a mostly fixed user base. These costs are significantly
affected by the unpredictability of the users' demand. Nevertheless, standard
mechanisms charge fixed per-unit prices that do not depend on the variability
of the users' demand. In this paper, we study a variance-based pricing rule in
a two-provider market setting and perform a game-theoretic analysis of the
resulting competitive effects. We show that an innovative provider who employs
variance-based pricing can choose a pricing strategy that guarantees himself a
higher profit than using fixed per-unit prices for any individually rational
response of a provider playing a fixed pricing strategy. We characterize all
equilibria for the setting where both providers employ variance-based pricing
strategies. We find that, while in equilibrium, the profits of the providers
may increase or decrease depending on their cost functions, social welfare
always weakly increases.

Title: Tiny Noise Can Make an EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interface Speller Output
  Anything
Authors: Xiao Zhang, Dongrui Wu, Lieyun Ding, Hanbin Luo, Chin-Teng Lin and
  Tzyy-Ping Jung
Categories: cs.HC cs.LG eess.SP
\\
  An electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) speller
allows a user to input text to a computer by thought. It is particularly useful
to severely disabled individuals, e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients,
who have no other effective means of communication with another person or a
computer. Most studies so far focused on making EEG-based BCI spellers faster
and more reliable; however, few have considered their security. Here we show
that P300 and steady-state visual evoked potential BCI spellers are very
vulnerable, i.e., they can be severely attacked by adversarial perturbations,
which are too tiny to be noticed when added to EEG signals, but can mislead the
spellers to spell anything the attacker wants. The consequence could range from
merely user frustration to severe misdiagnosis in clinical applications. We
hope our research can attract more attention to the security of EEG-based BCI
spellers, and more broadly, EEG-based BCIs, which has received little attention
before.

Title: Analysis of the Bergen-Belsen VR/AR application by means of the Virtual
  Subjectiveness Model
Authors: Alvaro Pastor, Laia Pujol
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures
ACM-class: H.5.1
\\
  We test the usefulness of Virtual Subjectiveness (Par\'es and Par\'es, 2006)
as an analytical model for AMVR projects by means of the evaluation of the
Bergen-Belsen VR/AR application. This application allows users to retrieve
geolocated historical data through 3D architectural reconstructions, while
exploring the site of the former concentration camp. Having analyzed the
context of development of this application, its interface, mappings and
interaction behaviors, and their interrelation in time, we found the Virtual
Subjectiveness model to be an adequate paradigm to make a structured evaluation
of the technical and conceptual levels of the chosen VR/AR application.

  Personality has been identified as a vital factor in understanding the
quality of human robot interactions. Despite this the research in this area
remains fragmented and lacks a coherent framework. This makes it difficult to
understand what we know and identify what we do not. As a result our knowledge
of personality in human robot interactions has not kept pace with the
deployment of robots in organizations or in our broader society. To address
this shortcoming, this paper reviews 83 articles and 84 separate studies to
assess the current state of human robot personality research. This review: (1)
highlights major thematic research areas, (2) identifies gaps in the
literature, (3) derives and presents major conclusions from the literature and
(4) offers guidance for future research.

Title: iCap: Interative Image Captioning with Predictive Text
Authors: Zhengxiong Jia and Xirong Li
Categories: cs.HC cs.CV
\\
  In this paper we study a brand new topic of interactive image captioning with
human in the loop. Different from automated image captioning where a given test
image is the sole input in the inference stage, we have access to both the test
image and a sequence of (incomplete) user-input sentences in the interactive
scenario. We formulate the problem as Visually Conditioned Sentence Completion
(VCSC). For VCSC, we propose asynchronous bidirectional decoding for image
caption completion (ABD-Cap). With ABD-Cap as the core module, we build iCap, a
web-based interactive image captioning system capable of predicting new text
with respect to live input from a user. A number of experiments covering both
automated evaluations and real user studies show the viability of our
proposals.

Title: Enhancement of Short Text Clustering by Iterative Classification

Comments: 30 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Short text clustering is a challenging task due to the lack of signal
contained in such short texts. In this work, we propose iterative
classification as a method to b o ost the clustering quality (e.g., accuracy)
of short texts. Given a clustering of short texts obtained using an arbitrary
clustering algorithm, iterative classification applies outlier removal to
obtain outlier-free clusters. Then it trains a classification algorithm using
the non-outliers based on their cluster distributions. Using the trained
classification model, iterative classification reclassifies the outliers to
obtain a new set of clusters. By repeating this several times, we obtain a much
improved clustering of texts. Our experimental results show that the proposed
clustering enhancement method not only improves the clustering quality of
different clustering methods (e.g., k-means, k-means--, and hierarchical
clustering) but also outperforms the state-of-the-art short text clustering
methods on several short text datasets by a statistically significant margin.

\\
  With the ever-growing interest in the area of mobile information retrieval
and the ongoing fast development of mobile devices and, as a consequence,
mobile apps, an active research area lies in studying users' behavior and
search queries users submit on mobile devices. However, many researchers
require to develop an app that collects useful information from users while
they search on their phones or participate in a user study. In this paper, we
aim to address this need by providing a comprehensive Android app, called
Omicron, which can be used to collect mobile query logs and perform user
studies on mobile devices. Omicron, at its current version, can collect users'
mobile queries, relevant documents, sensor data as well as user activity and
interaction data in various study settings. Furthermore, we designed Omicron in
such a way that it is conveniently extendable to conduct more specific studies
and collect other types of sensor data. Finally, we provide a tool to monitor
the participants and their data both during and after the collection process.

Title: Rank and Kernel of $\mathbb{F}_p$-Additive Generalised Hadamard Codes
Authors: Steven T. Dougherty, Josep Rif\`a and Merc\`e Villanueva
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  A subset of a vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ is $K$-additive if it is a linear
space over the subfield $K\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$. Let $q=p^e$, $p$ prime, and
$e>1$. Bounds on the rank and dimension of the kernel of generalised Hadamard
(GH) codes which are $\mathbb{F}_p$-additive are established. For specific
ranks and dimensions of the kernel within these bounds, $\mathbb{F}_p$-additive
GH codes are constructed. Moreover, for the case $e=2$, it is shown that the
given bounds are tight and it is possible to construct an
$\mathbb{F}_p$-additive GH code for all allowable ranks and dimensions of the
kernel between these bounds. Finally, we also prove that these codes are
self-orthogonal with respect to the trace Hermitian inner product, and generate
pure quantum codes.

Title: QoS-aware Stochastic Spatial PLS Model for Analysing Secrecy Performance
  under Eavesdropping and Jamming
Authors: Bhawna Ahuja, Deepak Mishra, and Ranjan Bose
Categories: cs.IT cs.CR eess.SP math.IT
Comments: Accepted in IET communications
\\
  Securing wireless communication, being inherently vulnerable to eavesdropping
and jamming attacks, becomes more challenging in resource-constrained networks
like Internet-of-Things. Towards this, physical layer security (PLS) has gained
significant attention due to its low complexity. In this paper, we address the
issue of random inter-node distances in secrecy analysis and develop a
comprehensive quality-of-service (QoS) aware PLS framework for the analysis of
both eavesdropping and jamming capabilities of attacker. The proposed solution
covers spatially stochastic deployment of legitimate nodes and attacker. We
characterise the secrecy outage performance against both attacks using
inter-node distance based probabilistic distribution functions. The model takes
into account the practical limits arising out of underlying QoS requirements,
which include the maximum distance between legitimate users driven by transmit
power and receiver sensitivity. A novel concept of eavesdropping zone is
introduced, and relative impact of jamming power is investigated. Closed-form
expressions for asymptotic secrecy outage probability are derived offering
insights into design of optimal system parameters for desired security level
against the attacker's capability of both attacks. Analytical framework,
validated by numerical results, establishes that the proposed solution offers
potentially accurate characterisation of the PLS performance and key design
perspective from point-of-view of both legitimate user and attacker.

Title: Resource Allocation for Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted
  Cognitive Radio Networks
Authors: Dongfang Xu, Xianghao Yu, and Robert Schober
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to conference
\\
  In this paper, we investigate resource allocation algorithm design for
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiuser cognitive radio (CR)
systems. In particular, an IRS is deployed to mitigate the interference caused
by the secondary network to the primary users. The beamforming vectors at the
base station (BS) and the phase shift matrix at the IRS are jointly optimized
for maximization of the sum rate of the secondary system. The algorithm design
is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account the
maximum interference tolerance of the primary users. To tackle the resulting
non-convex optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization-based
suboptimal algorithm exploiting semidefinite relaxation, the penalty method,
and successive convex approximation. Our simulation results show that the
system sum rate is dramatically improved by our proposed scheme compared to two
baseline schemes. Moreover, our results also illustrate the benefits of
deploying IRSs in CR networks.

Title: Crowdsourced Classification with XOR Queries: Fundamental Limits and An
  Efficient Algorithm
Authors: Daesung Kim and Hye Won Chung
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML
Comments: 24 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Crowdsourcing systems have emerged as an effective platform to label data and
classify objects with relatively low cost by exploiting non-expert workers. To
ensure reliable recovery of unknown labels with as few number of queries as
possible, we consider an effective query type that asks "group attribute" of a
chosen subset of objects. In particular, we consider the problem of classifying
$m$ binary labels with XOR queries that ask whether the number of objects
having a given attribute in the chosen subset of size $d$ is even or odd. The
subset size $d$, which we call query degree, can be varying over queries. Since
a worker needs to make more efforts to answer a query of a higher degree, we
consider a noise model where the accuracy of worker's answer changes depending
both on the worker reliability and query degree $d$. For this general model, we
characterize the information-theoretic limit on the optimal number of queries
to reliably recover $m$ labels in terms of a given combination of degree-$d$
queries and noise parameters. Further, we propose an efficient inference
algorithm that achieves this limit even when the noise parameters are unknown.

Title: Spatio-temporal Modeling for Massive and Sporadic Access
Authors: Yi Zhong, Guoqiang Mao, Xiaohu Ge
Categories: cs.IT cs.NI math.IT
Comments: 13 pages, 13 figures
\\
  Envision for smart city and Internet of Everything imperiously appeals to the
implementation of massive machine type communication (mMTC), some features of
which, such as massive number of devices and bursty short packet transmissions,
require new methods to enable the cellular system to seamlessly support the
integration of mMTC. Rigorous theoretical analysis is indispensable to obtain
constructive insight for the design of mMTC mechanism. In this paper, we
propose and define the notion of massive and sporadic access (MSA) to
quantitatively describe the scenario of mMTC. We evaluate the correlation of
interference and the correlation of successful transmission events, and verify
that these correlations are negligible in the scenario of MSA. In view of this,
in order to resolve the difficulty in the precise spatio-temporal analysis that
complex interactions persist among the queues, we propose the approximation
that all nodes are moving extremely fast so that their locations are
independent at different time instants. Furthermore, we compare the original
static network and the equivalent network with high mobility to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approximation method. The proposed approach is
promising for providing a convenient and general solution to evaluate and
design the mMTC with massive and sporadic access.

Title: Statistical Approximations of LOS/NLOS Probability in Urban Environment
Authors: Rimvydas Aleksiejunas
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: Conference paper
\\
  Analysis of line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight (LOS/NLOS) visibility
conditions is an important aspect of wireless channel modeling. For statistical
channel models the Monte Carlo simulations are usually used to generate
spatially consistent visibility states based on particular LOS probability. The
present works addresses LOS probability approximation problem using a mix of
distance-dependent exponential functions for urban areas with high and low
building densities. The proposed model divides site coverage area into LOS and
NLOS zones approximated by trigonometric series and support vector
classification methods. Compared to commonly used generic ITU-R and 3GPP LOS
probability models the proposed approximation is more accurate compared to real
world LOS distributions. The accuracy of LOS probability model has been tested
against visibility predictions obtained from the digital building data over
Manhattan and San Francisco city areas.

\\
  Ultra-narrowband communications has become a signature feature for many
emerging low-power wide-area (LPWA) networks. Specifically, using extremely
narrowband signals helps the network connect more Internet-of-things (IoT)
devices within a given band. It also improves robustness to interference,
extending the coverage of the network. In this paper, we study the coexistence
capability of UNB networks and their scalability to enable massive access. To
this end, we develop a stochastic geometry framework to analyze and model UNB
networks on a large scale. The framework captures the unique characteristics of
UNB communications, including the asynchronous time-frequency access, signal
repetition, and the absence of base station (BS) association. Closed-form
expressions of the transmission success probability and network connection
density are presented for several UNB protocols. We further discuss multiband
access for UNB networks, proposing a low-complexity protocol. Our analysis
reveals several insights on the geographical diversity achieved when devices do
not connect to a single BS, the optimal number of signal repetitions, and how
to utilize multiple bands without increasing the complexity of BSs. Simulation
results are provided to validate the analysis, and they show that UNB
communications enables a single BS to connect thousands of devices even in the
presence of interfering networks.

Title: Real-Time Deployment Aspects of C-Band and Millimeter-Wave 5G-NR Systems

  Communications (ICC), Dublin, Ireland
\\
  Fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) deployments are being rolled out in both
the C-band (3.3 - 5.0 GHz) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) band (24.5 - 29.5 GHz).
For outdoor scenarios, the C-band is expected to provide wide area coverage and
throughput uniformity, whereas the mmWave band is expected to provide
ultra-high throughput to dedicated areas within the C-band coverage. Due to the
differences in the frequency bands, both systems are expected to be designed
with different transmit and receive parameters, naturally resulting in
performance variations proportional to the chosen parameters. Unlike many
previous works, this paper presents measurement evaluations in central
Auckland, New Zealand, from a pre-commercial deployment of a single-user,
single-cell 5G-NR system operating in both bands. The net throughput, coverage
reliability, and channel rank are analyzed across the two bands with baseband
and analog beamforming. Our results show that the C-band coverage is
considerably better than mmWave, with a consistently higher channel rank.
Furthermore, the spatial stationarity region (SSR) for the azimuth
angles-of-departure (AODs) is characterized, and a model derived from the
measured beam identities is presented. The SSR of azimuth AODs is seen to
closely follow a gamma distribution.

Title: On the Coverage Performance of Boolean-Poisson Cluster Models for
  Wireless Sensor Networks
Authors: Kaushlendra Pandey, Abhishek Gupta
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we consider wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with sensor nodes
exhibiting clustering in their deployment. We model the coverage region of such
WSNs by Boolean Poisson cluster models (BPCM) where sensors nodes' location is
according to a Poisson cluster process (PCP) and each sensor has an independent
sensing range around it. We consider two variants of PCP, in particular \matern
and Thomas cluster process to form Boolean \matern and Thomas cluster models.
We first derive the capacity functional of these models. Using the derived
expressions, we compute the sensing probability of an event and compare it with
sensing probability of a WSN modeled by a Boolean Poisson model where sensors
are deployed according to a Poisson point process. We also derive the power
required for each cluster to collect data from all of its sensors for the three
considered WSNs. We show that a BPCM WSN has less power requirement in
comparison to the Boolean Poisson WSN, but it suffers from lower coverage,
leading to a trade-off between per-cluster power requirement and the sensing
performance. A cluster process with desired clustering may provide better
coverage while maintaining low power requirements.

\\
  Guo, Kopparty and Sudan have initiated the study of error-correcting codes
derived by lifting of affine-invariant codes. Lifted Reed-Solomon (RS) codes
are defined as the evaluation of polynomials in a vector space over a field by
requiring their restriction to every line in the space to be a codeword of the
RS code. In this paper, we investigate lifted RS codes and discuss their
application to batch codes, a notion introduced in the context of private
information retrieval and load-balancing in distributed storage systems. First,
we improve the estimate of the code rate of lifted RS codes for lifting
parameter $m\ge 3$ and large field size. Second, a new explicit construction of
batch codes utilizing lifted RS codes is proposed. For some parameter regimes,
our codes have a better trade-off between parameters than previously known
batch codes.

Title: Faster Projection-free Online Learning
Authors: Elad Hazan and Edgar Minasyan
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  In many online learning problems the computational bottleneck for
gradient-based methods is the projection operation. For this reason, in many
problems the most efficient algorithms are based on the Frank-Wolfe method,
which replaces projections by linear optimization. In the general case,
however, online projection-free methods require more iterations than
projection-based methods: the best known regret bound scales as $T^{3/4}$.
Despite significant work on various variants of the Frank-Wolfe method, this
bound has remained unchanged for a decade. In this paper we give an efficient
projection-free algorithm that guarantees $T^{2/3}$ regret for general online
convex optimization with smooth cost functions and one linear optimization
computation per iteration. As opposed to previous Frank-Wolfe approaches, our
algorithm is derived using the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader method and is
analyzed using an online primal-dual framework.

Title: Domain-Adversarial and -Conditional State Space Model for Imitation
  Learning
Authors: Ryo Okumura, Masashi Okada and Tadahiro Taniguchi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO stat.ML
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures
\\
  State representation learning (SRL) in partially observable Markov decision
processes has been studied to learn abstract features of data useful for robot
control tasks. For SRL, acquiring domain-agnostic states is essential for
achieving efficient imitation learning (IL). Without these states, IL is
hampered by domain-dependent information useless for control. However, existing
methods fail to remove such disturbances from the states when the data from
experts and agents show large domain shifts. To overcome this issue, we propose
a domain-adversarial and -conditional state space model (DAC-SSM) that enables
control systems to obtain domain-agnostic and task- and dynamics-aware states.
DAC-SSM jointly optimizes the state inference, observation reconstruction,
forward dynamics, and reward models. To remove domain-dependent information
from the states, the model is trained with domain discriminators in an
adversarial manner, and the reconstruction is conditioned on domain labels. We
experimentally evaluated the model predictive control performance via IL for
continuous control of sparse reward tasks in simulators and compared it with
the performance of the existing SRL method. The agents from DAC-SSM achieved
performance comparable to experts and more than twice the baselines. We
conclude domain-agnostic states are essential for IL that has large domain
shifts and can be obtained using DAC-SSM.

Title: On the Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent with Low-Rank
  Projections for Convex Low-Rank Matrix Problems
Authors: Dan Garber
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  We revisit the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for solving convex
optimization problems that serve as highly popular convex relaxations for many
important low-rank matrix recovery problems such as \textit{matrix completion},
\textit{phase retrieval}, and more. The computational limitation of applying
SGD to solving these relaxations in large-scale is the need to compute a
potentially high-rank singular value decomposition (SVD) on each iteration in
order to enforce the low-rank-promoting constraint. We begin by considering a
simple and natural sufficient condition so that these relaxations indeed admit
low-rank solutions. This condition is also necessary for a certain notion of
low-rank-robustness to hold. Our main result shows that under this condition
which involves the eigenvalues of the gradient vector at optimal points, SGD
with mini-batches, when initialized with a "warm-start" point, produces
iterates that are low-rank with high probability, and hence only a low-rank SVD
computation is required on each iteration. This suggests that SGD may indeed be
practically applicable to solving large-scale convex relaxations of low-rank
matrix recovery problems. Our theoretical results are accompanied with
supporting preliminary empirical evidence. As a side benefit, our analysis is
quite simple and short.

Title: Boosting Simple Learners
Authors: Noga Alon and Alon Gonen and Elad Hazan and Shay Moran
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We consider boosting algorithms under the restriction that the weak learners
come from a class of bounded VC-dimension. In this setting, we focus on two
main questions: (i) \underline{Oracle Complexity:} we show that the restriction
on the complexity of the weak learner significantly improves the number of
calls to the weak learner. We describe a boosting procedure which makes
only~$\tilde O(1/\gamma)$ calls to the weak learner, where $\gamma$ denotes the
weak learner's advantage. This circumvents a lower bound of
$\Omega(1/\gamma^2)$ due to Freund and Schapire ('95, '12) for the general
case. Unlike previous boosting algorithms which aggregate the weak hypotheses
by majority votes, our method use more complex aggregation rules, and we show
this to be necessary.
  (ii) \underline{Expressivity:} we consider the question of what can be
learned by boosting weak hypotheses of bounded VC-dimension?
  Towards this end we identify a combinatorial-geometric parameter called the
$\gamma$-VC dimension which quantifies the expressivity of a class of weak
hypotheses when used as part of a boosting procedure.
  We explore the limits of the $\gamma$-VC dimension and compute it for
well-studied classes such as halfspaces and decision stumps.
  Along the way, we establish and exploit connections with {\it Discrepancy
theory}.

distribution as the training data, and the other is that the model is correctly
specified. In real applications, however, we often have little prior knowledge
on the test data and on the underlying true model. Under model
misspecification, agnostic distribution shift between training and test data
leads to inaccuracy of parameter estimation and instability of prediction
across unknown test data. To address these problems, we propose a novel
Decorrelated Weighting Regression (DWR) algorithm which jointly optimizes a
variable decorrelation regularizer and a weighted regression model. The
variable decorrelation regularizer estimates a weight for each sample such that
variables are decorrelated on the weighted training data. Then, these weights
are used in the weighted regression to improve the accuracy of estimation on
the effect of each variable, thus help to improve the stability of prediction
across unknown test data. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our
DWR algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of parameter estimation
and stability of prediction with model misspecification and agnostic
distribution shift.

Title: Locally Private Distributed Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Hajime Ono and Tsubasa Takahashi
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  We study locally differentially private algorithms for reinforcement learning
to obtain a robust policy that performs well across distributed private
environments. Our algorithm protects the information of local agents' models
from being exploited by adversarial reverse engineering. Since a local policy
is strongly being affected by the individual environment, the output of the
agent may release the private information unconsciously. In our proposed
algorithm, local agents update the model in their environments and report noisy
gradients designed to satisfy local differential privacy (LDP) that gives a
rigorous local privacy guarantee. By utilizing a set of reported noisy
gradients, a central aggregator updates its model and delivers it to different
local agents. In our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate how our method
performs well under LDP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that actualizes distributed reinforcement learning under LDP. This work enables
us to obtain a robust agent that performs well across distributed private
environments.

Title: Local intrinsic dimensionality estimators based on concentration of
  measure
Authors: Jonathan Bac, Andrei Zinovyev
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Intrinsic dimensionality (ID) is one of the most fundamental characteristics
of multi-dimensional data point clouds. Knowing ID is crucial to choose the
appropriate machine learning approach as well as to understand its behavior and
validate it. ID can be computed globally for the whole data distribution, or
estimated locally in a point. In this paper, we introduce new local estimators
of ID based on linear separability of multi-dimensional data point clouds,
which is one of the manifestations of concentration of measure. We empirically
study the properties of these measures and compare them with other recently
introduced ID estimators exploiting various effects of measure concentration.
Observed differences in the behaviour of different estimators can be used to
anticipate their behaviour in practical applications.

Title: Statistical stability indices for LIME: obtaining reliable explanations
  for Machine Learning models
Authors: Giorgio Visani, Enrico Bagli, Federico Chesani, Alessandro Poluzzi and
  Davide Capuzzo
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Nowadays we are witnessing a transformation of the business processes towards
a more computation driven approach. The ever increasing usage of Machine
Learning techniques is the clearest example of such trend.
  This sort of revolution is often providing advantages, such as an increase in
prediction accuracy and a reduced time to obtain the results. However, these
methods present a major drawback: it is very difficult to understand on what
grounds the algorithm took the decision.
  To address this issue we consider the LIME method. We give a general
background on LIME then, we focus on the stability issue: employing the method
repeated times, under the same conditions, may yield to different explanations.
  Two complementary indices are proposed, to measure LIME stability. It is
important for the practitioner to be aware of the issue, as well as to have a
tool for spotting it. Stability guarantees LIME explanations to be reliable,
therefore a stability assessment, made through the proposed indices, is
crucial.
  As a case study, we apply both Machine Learning and classical statistical
techniques to Credit Risk data. We test LIME on the Machine Learning algorithm
and check its stability. Eventually, we examine the goodness of the
explanations returned.

Title: Encoding-based Memory Modules for Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Antonio Carta, Alessandro Sperduti, Davide Bacciu
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML
Comments: preprint submitted at Elsevier Neural Networks
\\
  Learning to solve sequential tasks with recurrent models requires the ability
to memorize long sequences and to extract task-relevant features from them. In
this paper, we study the memorization subtask from the point of view of the
design and training of recurrent neural networks. We propose a new model, the
Linear Memory Network, which features an encoding-based memorization component
built with a linear autoencoder for sequences. We extend the memorization
component with a modular memory that encodes the hidden state sequence at
different sampling frequencies. Additionally, we provide a specialized training
algorithm that initializes the memory to efficiently encode the hidden
activations of the network. The experimental results on synthetic and
real-world datasets show that specializing the training algorithm to train the
memorization component always improves the final performance whenever the
memorization of long sequences is necessary to solve the problem.

  Active inference is a process theory of the brain that states that all living

However, current experiments are limited to predefined, often discrete, state

Title: Semantic Discord: Finding Unusual Local Patterns for Time Series
Authors: Li Zhang, Yifeng Gao, Jessica Lin
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: SDM 2020
\\
  Finding anomalous subsequence in a long time series is a very important but
difficult problem. Existing state-of-the-art methods have been focusing on
searching for the subsequence that is the most dissimilar to the rest of the
subsequences; however, they do not take into account the background patterns
that contain the anomalous candidates. As a result, such approaches are likely
to miss local anomalies. We introduce a new definition named \textit{semantic
discord}, which incorporates the context information from larger subsequences
containing the anomaly candidates. We propose an efficient algorithm with a
derived lower bound that is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the brute
force algorithm in real world data. We demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in locating anomalies by
extensive experiments. We further explain the interpretability of semantic
discord.

  Hypercomplex-valued neural networks, including quaternion-valued neural
networks, can treat multi-dimensional data as a single entity. In this paper,
we present the quaternion-valued recurrent projection neural networks (QRPNNs).
Briefly, QRPNNs are obtained by combining the non-local projection learning
with the quaternion-valued recurrent correlation neural network (QRCNNs). We
show that QRPNNs overcome the cross-talk problem of QRCNNs. Thus, they are
appropriate to implement associative memories. Furthermore, computational
experiments reveal that QRPNNs exhibit greater storage capacity and noise
tolerance than their corresponding QRCNNs.

Gateaux Derivative (LEGD). This new approach will be referred to as
G\^ateaux-Hopfiel Neural Network (GHNN). A first order Fredholm integral
problem was used to test this new method and it was found to converge 22 times
faster to the exact solutions for {\alpha} > 1 if compared with the HNN integer

analysing the results for different values of {\alpha}. The robustness and

Title: Additive Tree Ensembles: Reasoning About Potential Instances
Authors: Laurens Devos, Wannes Meert, Jesse Davis
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Imagine being able to ask questions to a black box model such as "Which
adversarial examples exist?", "Does a specific attribute have a
disproportionate effect on the model's prediction?" or "What kind of
predictions are possible for a partially described example?" This last question
is particularly important if your partial description does not correspond to
any observed example in your data, as it provides insight into how the model
will extrapolate to unseen data. These capabilities would be extremely helpful
as it would allow a user to better understand the model's behavior,
particularly as it relates to issues such as robustness, fairness, and bias. In
this paper, we propose such an approach for an ensemble of trees. Since, in
general, this task is intractable we present a strategy that (1) can prune part
of the input space given the question asked to simplify the problem; and (2)
follows a divide and conquer approach that is incremental and can always return
some answers and indicates which parts of the input domains are still
uncertain. The usefulness of our approach is shown on a diverse set of use
cases.

Title: An Autonomous Intrusion Detection System Using Ensemble of Advanced
  Learners
Authors: Amir Andalib, Vahid Tabataba Vakili
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 5 pages
\\
  An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a vital security component of modern
computer networks. With networks finding their ways into providing sensitive
services, IDSs need to be more intelligent and autonomous. Aside from autonomy,
another important attribute for an IDS is its ability to detect zero-day
attacks. To address these issues in this paper we propose an IDS which reduces
the amount of manual interaction and needed expert knowledge and is able to
yield acceptable performance under zero-day attacks. Our approach is to use
three learning techniques in parallel, gated recurrent unit (GRU),
convolutional neural network as deep techniques and Random Forest as an
ensemble technique. These systems are trained in parallel and the results are
combined under two logics, majority vote and "OR" logic. We use the NSL-KDD
dataset to verify the proficiency of our proposed system. Simulation results
show that the system has the potential to operate with a very low technician
interaction under the zero-day attacks. We achieved 87.28% accuracy in the
NSL-KDD's "KDDTest+" dataset and 76.61% accuracy on the challenging
"KDDTest-21" with lower training time and lower needed computational resources.

Title: Consensus-based Optimization on the Sphere II: Convergence to Global
  Minimizers and Machine Learning
Authors: Massimo Fornasier, Hui Huang, Lorenzo Pareschi, Philippe S\"unnen
Categories: cs.LG cs.NA math.AP math.NA math.OC stat.ML
\\
  We present the implementation of a new stochastic Kuramoto-Vicsek-type model
for global optimization of nonconvex functions on the sphere. This model
belongs to the class of Consensus-Based Optimization. In fact, particles move
on the sphere driven by a drift towards an instantaneous consensus point, which
is computed as a convex combination of particle locations, weighted by the cost
function according to Laplace's principle, and it represents an approximation
to a global minimizer. The dynamics is further perturbed by a random vector
field to favor exploration, whose variance is a function of the distance of the
particles to the consensus point. In particular, as soon as the consensus is
reached the stochastic component vanishes. The main results of this paper are
about the proof of convergence of the numerical scheme to global minimizers
provided conditions of well-preparation of the initial datum. The proof
combines previous results of mean-field limit with a novel asymptotic analysis,
and classical convergence results of numerical methods for SDE. We present
several numerical experiments, which show that the algorithm proposed in the
present paper scales well with the dimension and is extremely versatile. To
quantify the performances of the new approach, we show that the algorithm is
able to perform essentially as good as ad hoc state of the art methods in
challenging problems in signal processing and machine learning, namely the
phase retrieval problem and the robust subspace detection.

Title: Deontological Ethics By Monotonicity Shape Constraints
Authors: Serena Wang and Maya Gupta
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: AISTATS 2020
\\
  We demonstrate how easy it is for modern machine-learned systems to violate
common deontological ethical principles and social norms such as "favor the
less fortunate", and "do not penalize good attributes." We propose that in some
cases such ethical principles can be incorporated into a machine-learned model
by adding shape constraints that constrain the model to respond only positively
to relevant inputs. We analyze the relationship between these deontological
constraints that act on individuals and the consequentialist group-based
fairness goals of one-sided statistical parity and equal opportunity. This
strategy works with sensitive attributes that are Boolean or real-valued such
as income and age, and can help produce more responsible and trustworthy AI.

Title: Neural MMO v1.3: A Massively Multiagent Game Environment for Training
  and Evaluating Neural Networks
Authors: Joseph Suarez, Yilun Du, Igor Mordach, Phillip Isola
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.MA stat.ML
\\
  Progress in multiagent intelligence research is fundamentally limited by the
number and quality of environments available for study. In recent years,
simulated games have become a dominant research platform within reinforcement
learning, in part due to their accessibility and interpretability. Previous
works have targeted and demonstrated success on arcade, first person shooter
(FPS), real-time strategy (RTS), and massive online battle arena (MOBA) games.
Our work considers massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs or
MMOs), which capture several complexities of real-world learning that are not
well modeled by any other game genre. We present Neural MMO, a massively
multiagent game environment inspired by MMOs and discuss our progress on two
more general challenges in multiagent systems engineering for AI research:
distributed infrastructure and game IO. We further demonstrate that standard
policy gradient methods and simple baseline models can learn interesting
emergent exploration and specialization behaviors in this setting.

Title: Theory inspired deep network for instantaneous-frequency extraction and
  signal components recovery from discrete blind-source data
Authors: Charles K. Chui, Ningning Han, Hrushikesh N. Mhaskar
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of recovering the unknown
signal components, along with extraction of their instantaneous frequencies
(IFs), governed by the adaptive harmonic model (AHM), from discrete (and
possibly non-uniform) samples of the blind-source composite signal.
  None of the existing decomposition methods and algorithms, including the most
popular empirical mode decomposition (EMD) computational scheme and its current
modifications, is capable of solving this inverse problem.
  In order to meet the AHM formulation and to extract the IFs of the decomposed
components, called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), each IMF of EMD is extended
to an analytic function in the upper half of the complex plane via the Hilbert
transform, followed by taking the real part of the polar form of the analytic
extension.
  Unfortunately, this approach most often fails to resolve the inverse problem
satisfactorily.
  More recently, to resolve the inverse problem, the notion of synchrosqueezed
wavelet transform (SST) was proposed by Daubechies and Maes, and further
developed in many other papers, while a more direct method, called signal
separation operation (SSO), was proposed and developed in our previous work
published in the journal, Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis, vol.
30(2):243-261, 2016.
  In the present paper, we propose a synthesis of SSO using a deep neural
network, based directly on a discrete sample set, that may be non-uniformly
sampled, of the blind-source signal.
  Our method is localized, as illustrated by a number of numerical examples,
including components with different signal arrival and departure times.
  It also yields short-term prediction of the signal components, along with
their IFs.
  Our neural networks are inspired by theory, designed so that they do not
require any training in the traditional sense.

  We propose a new approach for modelling the functional behaviour of an Earth
observation satellite. We leverage this approach in order to develop a safety
critical software, a "telecommand verifier", that is in charge of checking
onboard whether a sequence of instructions is safe for execution. This new
service is needed in order to add more autonomy to satellites. To do so, we
propose a new Domain Specific Modelling Language and the toolchain required for
integration into an embedded software. This framework is based on the
composition of deterministic finite state machines with safety conditions ,
timeouts, and transitions that accept durations as a parameter. It is able to
generate code in the synchronous programming language Lustre from a high-level
specification of the satellite. This gives a formal way to derive an
event-based algorithm simulating the execution of telecommand sequence and,
thereupon, a provably correct onboard verifier.

models captures a natural class of Markov processes. We further extend previous
constructions to provide a model of linear logic as a type system over the set
of all (discrete-time, time-independent) sub-Markov processes.

Title: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Concurrent Bilateral

Authors: Pallavi Bagga, Nicola Paoletti, Bedour Alrayes, Kostas Stathis
Categories: cs.MA cs.AI
\\
  We present a novel negotiation model that allows an agent to learn how to
negotiate during concurrent bilateral negotiations in unknown and dynamic
e-markets. The agent uses an actor-critic architecture with model-free
reinforcement learning to learn a strategy expressed as a deep neural network.
We pre-train the strategy by supervision from synthetic market data, thereby
decreasing the exploration time required for learning during negotiation. As a
result, we can build automated agents for concurrent negotiations that can
adapt to different e-market settings without the need to be pre-programmed. Our
experimental evaluation shows that our deep reinforcement learning-based agents
outperform two existing well-known negotiation strategies in one-to-many
concurrent bilateral negotiations for a range of e-market settings.

Authors: Martin Bauer, Harald K\"ostler, Ulrich R\"ude
Categories: cs.MS cs.CE cs.DC
\\
  Lattice Boltzmann methods are a popular mesoscopic alternative to macroscopic
computational fluid dynamics solvers. Many variants have been developed that
vary in complexity, accuracy, and computational cost. Extensions are available
to simulate multi-phase, multi-component, turbulent, or non-Newtonian flows. In
this work we present lbmpy, a code generation package that supports a wide
variety of different methods and provides a generic development environment for
new schemes as well. A high-level domain-specific language allows the user to
formulate, extend and test various lattice Boltzmann schemes. The method
specification is represented in a symbolic intermediate representation.
Transformations that operate on this intermediate representation optimize and
parallelize the method, yielding highly efficient lattice Boltzmann compute
kernels not only for single- and two-relaxation-time schemes but also for
multi-relaxation-time, cumulant, and entropically stabilized methods. An
integration into the HPC framework waLBerla makes massively parallel,
distributed simulations possible, which is demonstrated through scaling

Title: Generalized Unnormalized Optimal Transport and its fast algorithms
Authors: Wonjun Lee, Rongjie Lai, Wuchen Li, Stanley Osher
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.OC
\\
  We introduce fast algorithms for generalized unnormalized optimal transport.
To handle densities with different total mass, we consider a dynamic model,
which mixes the $L^p$ optimal transport with $L^p$ distance. For $p=1$, we
derive the corresponding $L^1$ generalized unnormalized Kantorovich formula. We
further show that the problem becomes a simple $L^1$ minimization which is
solved efficiently by a primal-dual algorithm. For $p=2$, we derive the $L^2$
generalized unnormalized Kantorovich formula, a new unnormalized Monge problem
and the corresponding Monge-Amp\`ere equation. Furthermore, we introduce a new
unconstrained optimization formulation of the problem. The associated gradient
flow is essentially related to an elliptic equation which can be solved
efficiently. Here the proposed gradient descent procedure together with the
Nesterov acceleration involves the Hamilton-Jacobi equation which arises from
the KKT conditions. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Algebraic multigrid preconditioning of the Hessian in PDE-constrained
  optimization
Authors: Andrew T. Barker and Andrei Draganescu

\\
  We construct an algebraic multigrid (AMG) based preconditioner for the
reduced Hessian of a linear-quadratic optimization problem constrained by an
elliptic partial differential equation. While the preconditioner generalizes a
geometric multigrid preconditioner introduced in earlier works, its
construction relies entirely on a standard AMG infrastructure built for solving
the forward elliptic equation, thus allowing for it to be implemented using a
variety of AMG methods and standard packages. Our analysis establishes a clear
connection between the quality of the preconditioner and the AMG method used.
The proposed strategy has a broad and robust applicability to problems with
unstructured grids, complex geometry, and varying coefficients. The method is
implemented using the Hypre package and several numerical examples are
presented.

Title: Simulation-Driven Optimization of High-Order Meshes in ALE Hydrodynamics

\\
  In this paper we propose tools for high-order mesh optimization and
demonstrate their benefits in the context of multi-material Arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) compressible shock hydrodynamic applications. The
mesh optimization process is driven by information provided by the simulation
which uses the optimized mesh, such as shock positions, material regions, known
error estimates, etc. These simulation features are usually represented
discretely, for instance, as finite element functions on the Lagrangian mesh.
The discrete nature of the input is critical for the practical applicability of
the algorithms we propose and distinguishes this work from approaches that
strictly require analytical information. Our methods are based on node movement
through a high-order extension of the Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm
(TMOP) of Knupp. The proposed formulation is fully algebraic and relies only on
local Jacobian matrices, so it is applicable to all types of mesh elements, in
2D and 3D, and any order of the mesh. We discuss the notions of constructing
adaptive target matrices and obtaining their derivatives, reconstructing
discrete data in intermediate meshes, node limiting that enables improvement of
global mesh quality while preserving space-dependent local mesh features, and
appropriate normalization of the objective function. The adaptivity methods are
combined with automatic ALE triggers that can provide robustness of the mesh
evolution and avoid excessive remap procedures. The benefits of the new
high-order TMOP technology are illustrated on several simulations performed in
the high-order ALE application BLAST.

Title: A mathematical and numerical framework for gradient meta-surfaces built
  upon periodically repeating arrays of Helmholtz resonators
Authors: Habib Ammari and Kthim Imeri

Comments: 25 pages, 6 figures
MSC-class: 35B27, 35A08, 35B34, 35C20
\\
  In this paper a mathematical model is given for the scattering of an incident
wave from a surface covered with microscopic small Helmholtz resonators, which
are cavities with small openings. More precisely, the surface is built upon a
finite number of Helmholtz resonators in a unit cell and that unit cell is
repeated periodically. To solve the scattering problem, the mathematical
framework elaborated in [Ammari et al., Asympt. Anal., 2019] is used. The main
result is an approximate formula for the scattered wave in terms of the lengths
of the openings. Our framework provides analytic expressions for the scattering
wave vector and angle and the phase-shift. It justifies the apparent
absorption. Moreover, it shows that at specific lengths for the openings and a
specific frequency there is an abrupt shift of the phase of the scattered wave
due to the subwavelength resonances of the Helmholtz resonators. A numerically
fast implementation is given to identify a region of those specific values of
the openings and the frequencies.

Title: Parallel Skeletonization for Integral Equations in Evolving
  Multiply-Connected Domains
Authors: John Paul Ryan and Anil Damle
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 22 pages, 12 figures
\\
  This paper presents a general method for applying hierarchical matrix
skeletonization factorizations to the numerical solution of boundary integral
equations with possibly rank-deficient integral operators. Rank-deficient
operators arise in boundary integral approaches to elliptic partial
differential equations with multiple boundary components, such as in the case
of multiple vesicles in a viscous fluid flow. Our generalized skeletonization
factorization retains the locality property afforded by the "proxy point
method", and allows for a parallelized implementation where different
processors work on different parts of the boundary simultaneously. Further,
when the boundary undergoes local geometric perturbations (such as movement of
an interior hole), the solution can be recomputed in logarithmic time with
respect to the number of discretization nodes. We present an application that
leverages a parallel implementation of skeletonization with updates in a shape
optimization regime.

Title: Exponential tractability of linear weighted tensor product problems in
  the worst-case setting for arbitrary linear functionals
Authors: Peter Kritzer, Friedrich Pillichshammer, Henryk Wo\'zniakowski
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 65Y20, 65D15
\\
  We study the approximation of compact linear operators defined over certain
weighted tensor product Hilbert spaces. The information complexity is defined
as the minimal number of arbitrary linear functionals which is needed to obtain
an $\varepsilon$-approximation for the $d$-variate problem. It is fully
determined in terms of the weights and univariate singular values. Exponential
tractability means that the information complexity is bounded by a certain
function which depends polynomially on $d$ and logarithmically on
$\varepsilon^{-1}$. The corresponding un-weighted problem was studied recently
by Hickernell, Kritzer and Wo\'{z}niakowski with many negative results for
exponential tractability. The product weights studied in the present paper
change the situation. Depending on the form of polynomial dependence on $d$ and
logarithmic dependence on $\varepsilon^{-1}$, we study exponential strong
polynomial, exponential polynomial, exponential quasi-polynomial, and
exponential $(s,t)$-weak tractability with $\max(s,t)\ge1$. For all these
notions of exponential tractability, we establish necessary and sufficient
conditions on weights and univariate singular values for which it is indeed
possible to achieve the corresponding notion of exponential tractability. The
case of exponential $(s,t)$-weak tractability with $\max(s,t)<1$ is left for
future study.

  By supplementing the pressure space for the Taylor-Hood element a triangular
element that satisfies continuity over each element is produced. Making a novel
extension of the patch argument to prove stability, this element is shown to be
globally stable and give optimal rates of convergence on a wide range of
triangular grids. This theoretical result is extended in the discussion given
in the appendix, showing how optimal convergence rates can be obtained on all
grids. Two examples are presented, one illustrating the convergence rates and
the other illustrating difficulties with the Taylor-Hood element which are
overcome by the element presented here.

Title: A spectral deferred correction method for incompressible flow with
  variable viscosity
Authors: J\"org Stiller
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This paper presents a semi-implicit spectral deferred correction (SDC) method
for incompressible Navier-Stokes problems with variable viscosity and
time-dependent boundary conditions.The proposed method integrates elements of
velocity- and pressure-correction schemes, which yields a simpler pressure
handling in comparison to the SDPC method of Minion & Saye (J. Comput. Phys.
375: 797-822, 2018). Combined with the discontinuous Galerkin spectral-element
method for spatial discretization it can in theory reach arbitrary order of
accuracy in time and space. Numerical experiments in three space dimensions
demonstrate up to order 12 in time and 17 in space for constant,
spatiotemporally varying as well as solution-dependent viscosity. The
phenomenon of order reduction also reported by Minion & Saye is observed in the
case of time-dependent boundary conditions, where it manifests in terms of a
slower convergence of the correction sweeps.

Title: Efficient computation of extreme excursion probabilities for dynamical
  systems
Authors: Vishwas Rao and Mihai Anitescu
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.DS math.PR
\\
  We develop a novel computational method for evaluating the extreme excursion
probabilities arising for random initialization of nonlinear dynamical systems.
The method uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo or a Laplace approximation approach
to construct a biasing distribution that in turn is used in an importance
sampling procedure to estimate the extreme excursion probabilities. The prior
and likelihood of the biasing distribution are obtained by using Rice's formula
from excursion probability theory. We use Gaussian mixture biasing
distributions and approximate the non-Gaussian initial excitation by the method
of moments to circumvent the linearity and Gaussianity assumptions needed by
excursion probability theory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
computational framework for nonlinear dynamical systems of up to 100
dimensions.

Title: A study of defect-based error estimates for the Krylov approximation of
  $\varphi$-functions
Authors: Tobias Jawecki
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Prior recent work, devoted to the study of polynomial Krylov techniques for
the approximation of the action of the matrix exponential ${\rm e}^{tA}v$, is
extended to the case of associated $\varphi$-functions (which occur within the
class of exponential integrators). In particular, a~posteriori error bounds and
estimates, based on the notion of the defect (residual) of the Krylov
approximation are considered. Computable error bounds and estimates are
discussed and analyzed. This includes a new error bound which favorably
compares to existing error bounds in specific cases. The accuracy of various
error bounds is characterized in relation to corresponding Ritz values of $A$.
Ritz values yield properties of the spectrum of $A$ (specific properties are
known a~priori, e.g. for Hermitian or skew-Hermitian matrices) in relation to
the actual starting vector $v$ and can be computed. This gives theoretical
results together with criteria to quantify the achieved accuracy on the run.
For other existing error estimates the reliability and performance is studied
by similar techniques. Effects of finite precision (floating point arithmetic)
are also taken into account.

Title: SGP-DT: Semantic Genetic Programming Based on Dynamic Targets
Authors: Stefano Ruberto and Valerio Terragni and Jason H. Moore
Categories: cs.NE
Comments: 16 pages, European Conference on Genetic Programming (EuroGP 20)
\\
  Semantic GP is a promising approach that introduces semantic awareness during
genetic evolution. This paper presents a new Semantic GP approach based on
Dynamic Target (SGP-DT) that divides the search problem into multiple GP runs.
The evolution in each run is guided by a new (dynamic) target based on the
residual errors. To obtain the final solution, SGP-DT combines the solutions of
each run using linear scaling. SGP-DT presents a new methodology to produce the
offspring that does not rely on the classic crossover. The synergy between such
a methodology and linear scaling yields to final solutions with low
approximation error and computational cost. We evaluate SGP-DT on eight
well-known data sets and compare with {\epsilon}-lexicase, a state-of-the-art
evolutionary technique. SGP-DT achieves small RMSE values, on average 23.19%
smaller than the one of {\epsilon}-lexicase.

Title: Neural Networks in Evolutionary Dynamic Constrained Optimization:
  Computational Cost and Benefits
Authors: Maryam Hasani-Shoreh, Renato Hermoza Aragon\'es, Frank Neumann
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG
\\
  Neural networks (NN) have been recently applied together with evolutionary
algorithms (EAs) to solve dynamic optimization problems. The applied NN
estimates the position of the next optimum based on the previous time best
solutions. After detecting a change, the predicted solution can be employed to
move the EA's population to a promising region of the solution space in order
to accelerate convergence and improve accuracy in tracking the optimum. While
previous works show improvement of the results, they neglect the overhead
created by NN. In this work, we reflect the time spent on training NN in the
optimization time and compare the results with a baseline EA. We explore if by
considering the generated overhead, NN is still able to improve the results,
and under which condition is able to do so.
  The main difficulties to train the NN are: 1) to get enough samples to
generalize predictions for new data, and 2) to obtain reliable samples. As NN
needs to collect data at each time step, if the time horizon is short, we will
not be able to collect enough samples to train the NN. To alleviate this, we
propose to consider more individuals on each change to speed up sample
collection in shorter time steps. In environments with a high frequency of
changes, the solutions produced by EA are likely to be far from the real
optimum. Using unreliable train data for the NN will, in consequence, produce
unreliable predictions. Also, as the time spent for NN stays fixed regardless
of the frequency, a higher frequency of change will mean a higher produced
overhead by the NN in proportion to the EA. In general, after considering the
generated overhead, we conclude that NN is not suitable in environments with a
high frequency of changes and/or short time horizons. However, it can be
promising for the low frequency of changes, and especially for the environments
that changes have a pattern.

\\
  Solving many-objective problems (MaOPs) is still a significant challenge in
the multi-objective optimization (MOO) field. One way to measure algorithm
performance is through the use of benchmark functions (also called test
functions or test suites), which are artificial problems with a well-defined
mathematical formulation, known solutions and a variety of features and
difficulties. In this paper we propose a parameterized generator of scalable
and customizable benchmark problems for MaOPs. It is able to generate problems
that reproduce features present in other benchmarks and also problems with some
new features. We propose here the concept of generative benchmarking, in which
one can generate an infinite number of MOO problems, by varying parameters that
control specific features that the problem should have: scalability in the
number of variables and objectives, bias, deceptiveness, multimodality, robust
and non-robust solutions, shape of the Pareto front, and constraints. The
proposed Generalized Position-Distance (GPD) tunable benchmark generator uses
the position-distance paradigm, a basic approach to building test functions,
used in other benchmarks such as Deb, Thiele, Laumanns and Zitzler (DTLZ),
Walking Fish Group (WFG) and others. It includes scalable problems in any
number of variables and objectives and it presents Pareto fronts with different
characteristics. The resulting functions are easy to understand and visualize,
easy to implement, fast to compute and their Pareto optimal solutions are
known.

Title: Improved Fitness-Dependent Optimizer Algorithm
Authors: Danial A. Muhammed, Soran AM. Saeed, Tarik A. Rashid
Categories: cs.NE
Comments: 17 pages
Journal-ref: IEEE Access, 2020
\\
  The fitness-dependent optimizer (FDO) algorithm was recently introduced in
2019. An improved FDO (IFDO) algorithm is presented in this work, and this
algorithm contributes considerably to refining the ability of the original FDO
to address complicated optimization problems. To improve the FDO, the IFDO
calculates the alignment and cohesion and then uses these behaviors with the
pace at which the FDO updates its position. Moreover, in determining the
weights, the FDO uses the weight factor (wf), which is zero in most cases and
one in only a few cases. Conversely, the IFDO performs wf randomization in the
[0-1] range and then minimizes the range when a better fitness weight value is
achieved. In this work, the IFDO algorithm and its method of converging on the
optimal solution are demonstrated. Additionally, 19 classical standard test
function groups are utilized to test the IFDO, and then the FDO and three other
well-known algorithms, namely, the particle swarm algorithm (PSO), dragonfly
algorithm (DA), and genetic algorithm (GA), are selected to evaluate the IFDO
results. Furthermore, the CECC06 2019 Competition, which is the set of IEEE
Congress of Evolutionary Computation benchmark test functions, is utilized to
test the IFDO, and then, the FDO and three recent algorithms, namely, the salp
swarm algorithm (SSA), DA and whale optimization algorithm (WOA), are chosen to
gauge the IFDO results. The results show that IFDO is practical in some cases,
and its results are improved in most cases. Finally, to prove the
practicability of the IFDO, it is used in real-world applications.

  This paper presents an in-depth survey and performance evaluation of the Cat
Swarm Optimization (CSO) Algorithm. CSO is a robust and powerful metaheuristic
swarm-based optimization approach that has received very positive feedback
since its emergence. It has been tackling many optimization problems and many
variants of it have been introduced. However, the literature lacks a detailed
survey or a performance evaluation in this regard. Therefore, this paper is an
attempt to review all these works, including its developments and applications,
and group them accordingly. In addition, CSO is tested on 23 classical
benchmark functions and 10 modern benchmark functions (CEC 2019). The results
are then compared against three novel and powerful optimization algorithms,
namely Dragonfly algorithm (DA), Butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) and
Fitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO). These algorithms are then ranked according
to Friedman test and the results show that CSO ranks first on the whole.
Finally, statistical approaches are employed to further confirm the
outperformance of CSO algorithm.

Categories: cs.NE cs.MM
\\
  Source identification is an important topic in image forensics, since it
allows to trace back the origin of an image. This represents a precious
information to claim intellectual property but also to reveal the authors of
illicit materials. In this paper we address the problem of device
identification based on sensor noise and propose a fast and accurate solution
using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we propose a
2-channel-based CNN that learns a way of comparing camera fingerprint and image
noise at patch level. The proposed solution turns out to be much faster than
the conventional approach and to ensure an increased accuracy. This makes the
approach particularly suitable in scenarios where large databases of images are
analyzed, like over social networks. In this vein, since images uploaded on
social media usually undergo at least two compression stages, we include
investigations on double JPEG compressed images, always reporting higher
accuracy than standard approaches.

Title: Routing-Led Placement of VNFs in Arbitrary Networks
Authors: Joseph Billingsley, Ke Li, Wang Miao, Geyong Min, Nektarios Georgalas
Categories: cs.NI cs.NE
\\
  The ever increasing demand for computing resources has led to the creation of
hyperscale datacentres with tens of thousands of servers. As demand continues
to rise, new technologies must be incorporated to ensure high quality services
can be provided without the damaging environmental impact of high energy
consumption. Virtualisation technology such as network function virtualisation
(NFV) allows for the creation of services by connecting component parts known
as virtual network functions (VNFs). VNFs cam be used to maximally utilise
available datacentre resources by optimising the placement and routes of VNFs,
to maintain a high quality of service whilst minimising energy costs. Current
research on this problem has focussed on placing VNFs and considered routing as
a secondary concern. In this work we argue that the opposite approach, a
routing-led approach is preferable. We propose a novel routing-led algorithm
and analyse each of the component parts over a range of different topologies on
problems with up to 16000 variables and compare its performance against a
traditional placement based algorithm. Empirical results show that our
routing-led algorithm can produce significantly better, faster solutions to
large problem instances on a range of datacentre topologies.

Title: Learning from Peers at the Wireless Edge
Authors: Shuvam Chakraborty, Hesham Mohammed, Dola Saha
Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
\\
  The last mile connection is dominated by wireless links where heterogeneous
nodes share the limited and already crowded electromagnetic spectrum. Current
contention based decentralized wireless access system is reactive in nature to
mitigate the interference. In this paper, we propose to use neural networks to
learn and predict spectrum availability in a collaborative manner such that its
availability can be predicted with a high accuracy to maximize wireless access
and minimize interference between simultaneous links. Edge nodes have a wide
range of sensing and computation capabilities, while often using different
operator networks, who might be reluctant to share their models. Hence, we
introduce a peer to peer Federated Learning model, where a local model is
trained based on the sensing results of each node and shared among its peers to
create a global model. The need for a base station or access point to act as
centralized parameter server is replaced by empowering the edge nodes as
aggregators of the local models and minimizing the communication overhead for
model transmission. We generate wireless channel access data, which is used to
train the local models. Simulation results for both local and global models
show over 95% accuracy in predicting channel opportunities in various network
topology.

Title: Skin-MIMO: Vibration-based MIMO Communication over Human Skin
Authors: Dong Ma, Yuezhong Wu, Ming Ding, Mahbub Hassan, Wen Hu
Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
\\
  We explore the feasibility of Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO)
communication through vibrations over human skin. Using off-the-shelf motors
and piezo transducers as vibration transmitters and receivers, respectively, we
build a 2x2 MIMO testbed to collect and analyze vibration signals from real
subjects. Our analysis reveals that there exist multiple independent vibration
channels between a pair of transmitter and receiver, confirming the feasibility
of MIMO. Unfortunately, the slow ramping of mechanical motors and rapidly
changing skin channels make it impractical for conventional channel sounding
based channel state information (CSI) acquisition, which is critical for
achieving MIMO capacity gains. To solve this problem, we propose Skin-MIMO, a
deep learning based CSI acquisition technique to accurately predict CSI
entirely based on inertial sensor (accelerometer and gyroscope) measurements at
the transmitter, thus obviating the need for channel sounding. Based on
experimental vibration data, we show that Skin-MIMO can improve MIMO capacity
by a factor of 2.3 compared to Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) or open-loop
MIMO, which do not have access to CSI. A surprising finding is that gyroscope,
which measures the angular velocity, is found to be superior in predicting skin
vibrations than accelerometer, which measures linear acceleration and used
widely in previous research for vibration communications over solid objects.

Title: Middle-mile Network Optimization in Rural Wireless Meshes
Authors: Yung-Fu Chen and Anish Arora
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  The status quo of limited broadband connectivity in rural areas motivates the
need for fielding alternatives such as long-distance wireless mesh networks. A
key aspect of fielding wireless meshes cost-effectively is planning how to
connect the last-mile networks to the core network service providers (i.e., the
network between the edge access terminals and the landline / optical fiber
terminals) with minimal infrastructure cost and throughput constraints. This
so-called middle-mile network optimization, which includes topology
construction, tower height assignment, antenna and orientation selection, as
well as transmit power assignment, is known to be a computationally hard
problem.
  In this paper, we provide the first polynomial time approximation solution
for a generalized version of the middle-mile network optimization problem,
wherein point-to-point (i.e., WiFi p2p) links are deployed to bridge last-mile
networks. Our solution has a cost performance ratio of
$O(\ln{|A|}+\frac{|B|}{|A|}+\frac{|A|+|B|}{\gamma})$, where A and B
respectively denote the number of terminals and non-terminals and $\gamma$ is
the ratio of $\frac{link\ capacity}{terminal\ demand}$. Furthermore, our
solution extends to hybrid networks, i.e., point-to-multipoint (i.e., WiFi
p2mp) or omnidirectional (i.e., TV White Space) can serve as hyperlinks in
addition to point-to-point links, to further reduce the cost of wireless links.
We provide a complementary heuristic for our middle-mile network optimization
solution that adds hyperlinks if and only if they reduce the cost.

  We analyze the loss of information and the loss of learning capability inside
an arrangement of neural networks. Our method is new and based on the
formulation of non-unitary Bogoliubov transformations in order to connect the
information between different points of the arrangement. This can be done after
expanding the activation function in a Fourier series and then assuming that
its information is stored inside a Quantum scalar field.

Title: Toward a Mechanized Compendium of Gradual Typing
Authors: Jeremy G. Siek
Categories: cs.PL
Comments: In submission to Journal of Functional Programming
\\
  The research on gradual typing has grown considerably over the last decade,
with more than 150 papers in the Gradual Typing Bibliography. There are a large
number of alternative language designs that have been proposed and there are
many interesting approaches for addressing the efficiency challenges. To better
understand and categorize a central portion of the research on gradual typing,
this article begins the development of a compendium of gradual typing,
mechanized using the Agda proof assistant. This article identifies abstractions
that capture similarities between many cast calculi, thereby enabling the reuse
of definitions and theorems across different designs for many gradually typed
languages.

  The use of adaptive workflow management for in situ visualization and
analysis has been a growing trend in large-scale scientific simulations.
However, coordinating adaptive workflows with traditional procedural
programming languages can be difficult, because system flow is determined by
unpredictable scientific phenomena, which often appear in an unknown order and
can evade event handling. This makes the implementation of adaptive workflows
tedious and errorprone. Recently, reactive and declarative programming
paradigms have been recognized as well-suited solutions to similar problems in
other domains. Not much work has been done to adopt these methods into the
field of in situ visualization and analysis. With this paper, we present a
proof-of-concept language, parser and runtime system for designing adaptive
systems through a declarative and reactive programming paradigm. We illustrate
how an adaptive workflow system is implemented using our approach, and
demonstrate it with use cases from real scientific simulations.

Title: Understanding Profunctor Optics: a representation theorem
Authors: Guillaume Boisseau
Categories: cs.PL
Comments: Submitted as a thesis for the degree of MSc in Computer Science at
  the University of Oxford in 2017. 65 pages
\\
  Optics, aka functional references, are classes of tools that allow composable
access into compound data structures. Usually defined as programming language
libraries, they provide combinators to manipulate different shapes of data such
as sums, products and collections, that can be composed to operate on larger
structures. Together they form a powerful language to describe transformations
of data. Among the different approaches to describing optics, one particular
type of optics, called profunctor optics, stands out. It describes alternative
but equivalent representations of most of the common combinators, and enhances
them with elegant composability properties via a higher-order encoding.
Notably, it enables easy composition across different optic families.
Unfortunately, profunctor optics are difficult to reason about, and linking
usual optics with an equivalent profunctor representation has so far been done
on a case-by-case basis, with definitions that sometimes seem very ad hoc. This
makes it hard both to analyse properties of existing profunctor optics and to
define new ones. This thesis presents an equivalent representation of
profunctor optics, called isomorphism optics, that is both closer to intuition
and easier to reason about. This tool enables powerful theorems to be derived
generically about profunctor optics. Finally, this thesis develops a framework
to ease deriving new profunctor encodings from concrete optic families.

Title: Path Planning in Dynamic Environments using Generative RNNs and Monte

\\
  State of the art methods for robotic path planning in dynamic environments,
such as crowds or traffic, rely on hand crafted motion models for agents. These
models often do not reflect interactions of agents in real world scenarios. To
overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an integrated path planning
framework using generative Recurrent Neural Networks within a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS). This approach uses a learnt model of social response to predict
crowd dynamics during planning across the action space. This extends our recent
work using generative RNNs to learn the relationship between planned robotic
actions and the likely response of a crowd. We show that the proposed framework
can considerably improve motion prediction accuracy during interactions,
allowing more effective path planning. The performance of our method is
compared in simulation with existing methods for collision avoidance in a crowd
of pedestrians, demonstrating the ability to control future states of nearby
individuals. We also conduct preliminary real world tests to validate the
effectiveness of our method.

  Developmental Systems, see https://btalb.github.io/abstract_map/ for access

\\
  Human navigation in built environments depends on symbolic spatial
information which has unrealised potential to enhance robot navigation
capabilities. Information sources such as labels, signs, maps, planners, spoken
directions, and navigational gestures communicate a wealth of spatial
information to the navigators of built environments; a wealth of information
that robots typically ignore. We present a robot navigation system that uses
the same symbolic spatial information employed by humans to purposefully
navigate in unseen built environments with a level of performance comparable to
humans. The navigation system uses a novel data structure called the abstract
map to imagine malleable spatial models for unseen spaces from spatial symbols.
Sensorimotor perceptions from a robot are then employed to provide purposeful
navigation to symbolic goal locations in the unseen environment. We show how a
dynamic system can be used to create malleable spatial models for the abstract
map, and provide an open source implementation to encourage future work in the
area of symbolic navigation. Symbolic navigation performance of humans and a
robot is evaluated in a real-world built environment. The paper concludes with
a qualitative analysis of human navigation strategies, providing further
insights into how the symbolic navigation capabilities of robots in unseen
built environments can be improved in the future.

  For the human operator, it is often easier and faster to catch a small size
quadrotor right in the midair instead of landing it on a surface. However,
interaction strategies for such cases have not yet been considered properly,
especially when more than one drone has to be landed at the same time. In this
paper, we propose a novel interaction strategy to land multiple robots on the
human hands using vibrotactile feedback. We developed a wearable tactile
display that is activated by the intensity of light emitted from an LED ring on
the bottom of the quadcopter. We conducted experiments, where participants were
asked to adjust the position of the palm to land one or two
vertically-descending drones with different landing speeds, by having only
visual feedback, only tactile feedback or visual-tactile feedback. We conducted
statistical analysis of the drone landing positions, landing pad and human head
trajectories. Two-way ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference
between the feedback conditions. Experimental analysis proved that with an
increasing number of drones, tactile feedback plays a more important role in
accurate hand positioning and operator's convenience. The most precise landing
of one and two drones was achieved with the combination of tactile and visual
feedback.

Title: Learning How to Walk: Warm-starting Optimal Control Solver with Memory
  of Motion
Authors: Teguh Santoso Lembono, Carlos Mastalli, Pierre Fernbach, Nicolas
  Mansard and Sylvain Calinon
Categories: cs.RO math.OC
\\
  In this paper, we propose a framework to build a memory of motion to
warm-start an optimal control solver for the locomotion task of the humanoid
robot Talos. We use HPP Loco3D, a versatile locomotion planner, to generate
offline a set of dynamically consistent whole-body trajectory to be stored as
the memory of motion. The learning problem is formulated as a regression
problem to predict a single-step motion given the desired contact locations,
which is then used as building block for multi-step motions. The predicted
trajectory is then used as warm-starts for the fast optimal control solver
Crocoddyl. We have shown that the approach manages to reduce the required
number of iterations to reach the convergence from $\sim$9.5 to only $\sim$3.0
iterations for the single-step motion and from $\sim$6.2 to $\sim$4.5
iterations for the multi-step motion, while maintaining the solution's quality.

Title: Using a memory of motion to efficiently achieve visual predictive

Authors: Antonio Paolillo, Teguh Santoso Lembono, Sylvain Calinon
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  This paper addresses the problem of efficiently achieving visual predictive
control tasks. To this end, a memory of motion, containing a set of
trajectories built off-line, is used for leveraging precomputation and dealing
with difficult visual tasks. Regression techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors
and Gaussian process regression, are used to query the memory and provide
on-line the control optimization process with a warm-start and way points. The
proposed technique allows the robot to achieve difficult tasks and, at the same
time, keep the execution time limited. Simulation and experimental results,
carried out with a 7-axis manipulator, show the effectiveness of the approach.

  In this article, we present a probabilistic algorithm to compute the product

We mainly rely on sparse interpolation and on a new algorithm for verifying a
sparse product that has also a quasi-linear time complexity. Using Kronecker

Categories: cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS stat.ML
\\
  Supervised deep learning has gained significant attention for speech
enhancement recently. The state-of-the-art deep learning methods perform the
task by learning a ratio/binary mask that is applied to the mixture in the
time-frequency domain to produce the clean speech. Despite the great
performance in the single-channel setting, these frameworks lag in performance
in the multichannel setting as the majority of these methods a) fail to exploit
the available spatial information fully, and b) still treat the deep
architecture as a black box which may not be well-suited for multichannel audio
processing. This paper addresses these drawbacks, a) by utilizing complex ratio
masking instead of masking on the magnitude of the spectrogram, and more
importantly, b) by introducing a channel-attention mechanism inside the deep
architecture to mimic beamforming. We propose Channel-Attention Dense U-Net, in
which we apply the channel-attention unit recursively on feature maps at every
layer of the network, enabling the network to perform non-linear beamforming.
We demonstrate the superior performance of the network against the
state-of-the-art approaches on the CHiME-3 dataset.

  Authorship attribution of source code has been an established research topic
for several decades. State-of-the-art results for the authorship attribution
problem look promising for the software engineering field, where they could be
applied to detect plagiarized code and prevent legal issues. With this study,
we first introduce a language-agnostic approach to authorship attribution of
source code. Two machine learning models based on our approach match or improve
over state-of-the-art results, originally achieved by language-specific
approaches, on existing datasets for code in C++, Python, and Java. After that,
we discuss limitations of existing synthetic datasets for authorship
attribution, and propose a data collection approach that delivers datasets that
better reflect aspects important for potential practical use in software
engineering. In particular, we discuss the concept of work context and its
importance for authorship attribution. Finally, we demonstrate that high
accuracy of authorship attribution models on existing datasets drastically
drops when they are evaluated on more realistic data. We conclude the paper by
outlining next steps in design and evaluation of authorship attribution models
that could bring the research efforts closer to practical use.

  With the increase in acceptance of open source platforms for knowledge
sharing, Question and Answer (Q\&A) websites such as Stack Overflow have become
increasingly popular in the programming domain. Many novice programmers visit
Stack Overflow for reasons that include posing questions, finding answers for
issues they come across in the process of programming. Practitioners
voluntarily answer questions on Stack Overflow based on their experience or
prior knowledge. Most of these answers are also accompanied by comments from
users of Stack Overflow. Questions, answers and comments on Stack Overflow also
include sentiments of users, which when analysed and presented could motivate
users in reading and contributing to the posts. However, the sentiment of these
posts is not being depicted in the current Stack Overflow platform. There is
extensive research on analysing sentiments on social networking platforms such
as twitter. Representing sentiment of a post might motivate users to follow or
answer certain posts. While there exist several tools that augment or annotate
Stack Overflow platform for developers, we are not aware of tools that deal
with sentiment of the posts. In this paper, we propose StackEmo as a Google
Chrome plugin to augment comments on Stack Overflow with emojis, based on the
sentiment of the comments posted, with the aim to provide users with visual
cues that could motivate the users to review and contribute to available
comments. We evaluated StackEmo through an in-user likert scale based survey
with 30 university students. The results of the survey provided us insights on
improving StackEmo, with 83% participants having recommended the plugin to
their peers.

  A model is a simplified representation of portion of reality that hides a
system s nonessential characteristics. It provides a means for reducing
complexity as well as visualization and communication and a basis for building
it. Most models involve graphic languages during many of the software lifecycle
phases. A new model, called thinging machine (TM), has recently been developed
as an extension of the input-process-output framework. The paper focuses on
events in a TM, offering a new perspective that captures a system s dynamic
behaviors and a means of diagrammatically modeling events. The event notion is
an important factor in giving semantics to specifications and providing a
natural way to specify the interfaces and observable behavior of system
components. Specifically, five generic TM event processes are analyzed: create,
process, receive, release, and transfer. All events can be mapped (or reduced)
to the events of these five event processes

  In Model Predictive Control~(MPC) formulations of trajectory tracking
problems, infeasible reference trajectories and a-priori unknown constraints
can lead to cumbersome designs, aggressive tracking and loss of recursive
feasibility. This is the case, for example, in trajectory tracking applications
for mobile systems in presence of pop-up obstacles.
  The Model Predictive Flexible trajectory Tracking Control~(MPFTC) framework
proposed here accommodates stability and recursive feasibility, in presence of
infeasible reference trajectories and a-priori unknown constraints. In the
proposed framework, constraint satisfaction is guaranteed at all time while the
reference trajectory is tracked as good as constraint satisfaction allows, thus
simplifying the controller design and reducing possibly aggressive tracking
behavior. The proposed framework is illustrated with three numerical examples.

Title: Interval Distribution State Estimation using an LP-RDM Contractor
Authors: VietCuong Ngo, Wenchuan Wu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  State estimation (SE) of distribution networks relies on pseudo measurements
that introduce significant errors, as real-time data are not normally
available. Interval SE models are regularly used, where true values of system
states are categorized according to estimated ranges. However, conventional
interval SE algorithms do not consider the correlations of same interval
variables in constraints, which results in overly conservative estimation
results. In this paper, we propose a Linear Programming Contractor algorithm
that uses a relative distance measure (RDM) interval operation to solve this
problem. In the proposed model, measurement errors are assumed to be bounded
into given sets, thus converting the state variables to RDM variables. In this
case, the SE model is a non-convex model, and the solution credibility cannot
be guaranteed. Therefore, the nonlinear measurement equations in the model were
transformed into inequality linear equations using the mean value theorem, to
form a linear programming contractor that iteratively narrows the upper and
lower bounds of the system state variables. Additionally, an algorithm is
proposed to detect bad data. Numerical tests on IEEE distribution systems
varying in scale show that the proposed method outperforms conventional
interval-constrained propagation techniques and an optimization based interval
SE method.

Title: Statistical Approach to Detection of Attacks for Stochastic

Authors: Dami\'an Marelli, Tianju Sui, Minyue Fu and Renquan Lu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  We study the problem of detecting an attack on a stochastic cyber-physical
system. We aim to treat the problem in its most general form. We start by
introducing the notion of asymptotically detectable attacks, as those attacks
introducing changes to the system's output statistics which persist
asymptotically. We then provide a necessary and sufficient condition for
asymptotic detectability. This condition preserves generality as it holds under
no restrictive assumption on the system and attacking scheme. To show the
importance of this condition, we apply it to detect certain attacking schemes
which are undetectable using simple statistics. Our necessary and sufficient
condition naturally leads to an algorithm which gives a confidence level for
attack detection. We present simulation results to illustrate the performance
of this algorithm.

Authors: Michael Hertneck, Steffen Linsenmayer, Frank Allg\"ower
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In this paper, we present a model-based periodic event-triggered control
mechanism for nonlinear continuous-time Networked Control Systems. A
sampled-data prediction of the system behavior is used at the actuator to
reduce the amount of required communication while maintaining a user-defined
performance level. This prediction is based on a possibly inaccurate
discretization of the nonlinear system dynamics and can be implemented on
simple hardware. Nevertheless, guarantees for asymptotic stability and a
user-defined performance level are given for the periodic event-triggered
control (PETC) mechanism, whilst the reduction of the required amount of
transmissions of state information depends on the quality of the prediction. We
discuss furthermore how the prediction can be implemented. The performance of
the proposed PETC mechanism is illustrated with a numerical example. This paper
is the accepted version of [1], containing also the proofs of the main results.

Title: Inverse Filtering for Hidden Markov Models with Applications to
  Counter-Adversarial Autonomous Systems
Authors: Robert Mattila, Cristian R. Rojas, Vikram Krishnamurthy, Bo Wahlberg
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Bayesian filtering deals with computing the posterior distribution of the
state of a stochastic dynamic system given noisy observations. In this paper,
motivated by applications in counter-adversarial systems, we consider the
following inverse filtering problem: Given a sequence of posterior
distributions from a Bayesian filter, what can be inferred about the transition
kernel of the state, the observation likelihoods of the sensor and the measured
observations? For finite-state Markov chains observed in noise (hidden Markov
models), we show that a least-squares fit for estimating the parameters and
observations amounts to a combinatorial optimization problem with non-convex
objective. Instead, by exploiting the algebraic structure of the corresponding
Bayesian filter, we propose an algorithm based on convex optimization for
reconstructing the transition kernel, the observation likelihoods and the
observations. We discuss and derive conditions for identifiability. As an
application of our results, we illustrate the design of counter-adversarial
systems: By observing the actions of an autonomous enemy, we estimate the
accuracy of its sensors and the observations it has received. The proposed
algorithms are evaluated in numerical examples.

Title: Optimal Controller Synthesis and Dynamic Quantizer Switching for
  Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian Systems
Authors: Dipankar Maity and Panagiotis Tsiotras
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.DS
\\
  In networked control systems, often the sensory signals are quantized before
being transmitted to the controller. Consequently, performance is affected by
the coarseness of this quantization process. Modern communication technologies
allow users to obtain resolution-varying quantized measurements based on the
prices paid. In this paper, we consider optimal controller synthesis of a
Quantized-Feedback Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (QF-LQG) system where the
measurements are to be quantized before being transmitted to the controller.
The system is presented with several choices of quantizers, along with the cost
of operating each quantizer. The objective is to jointly select the quantizers
and the controller that would maintain an optimal balance between control
performance and quantization cost. Under certain assumptions, this problem can
be decoupled into two optimization problems: one for optimal controller
synthesis and the other for optimal quantizer selection. We show that,
similarly to the classical LQG problem, the optimal controller synthesis
subproblem is characterized by Riccati equations. On the other hand, the
optimal quantizer selection policy is found by solving a certain
Markov-Decision-Process (MDP).

Title: Cooperative Energy Scheduling for Microgrids under Peak Demand Energy
  Plans
Authors: Amir Valibeygi, Raymond A de Callafon
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Journal-ref: 2019 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC 2019)
\\
  A cooperative energy scheduling method is proposed that allows joint energy
optimization for a group of microgrids to achieve cost savings that the
microgrids could not achieve individually. The discussed microgrids may be
commercial entities in a distribution network under utility electricity rate
plans comprising both Time of Use (ToU) and peak demand charge. Defining a
stable operation as a situation where all microgrids would be willing to
participate, it is shown that under such rate plans and in particular due to
the peak demand charge, a cost distribution that is seemingly fair does not
necessarily result in a stable cooperation. These results are derived in this
paper using concepts from cooperative games. It is therefore sought to devise a
stable cost distribution algorithm that, while maximizing some measure of
fairness among the participating microgrids, ensures they all benefit from
their participation. A simple case study is presented that demonstrates
fairness and stability aspects of the cooperation.

Title: Artificial Intelligence Aided Next-Generation Networks Relying on UAVs
Authors: Xiao Liu, Mingzhe Chen, Yuanwei Liu, Yue Chen, Shuguang Cui, and Lajos
  Hanzo
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided
next-generation networking is proposed for dynamic environments. In the
AI-enabled UAV-aided wireless networks (UAWN), multiple UAVs are employed as
aerial base stations, which are capable of rapidly adapting to the dynamic
environment by collecting information about the users' position and
tele-traffic demands, learning from the environment and acting upon the
feedback received from the users. Moreover, AI enables the interaction amongst
a swarm of UAVs for cooperative optimization of the system. As a benefit of the
AI framework, several challenges of conventional UAWN may be circumvented,
leading to enhanced network performance, improved reliability and agile
adaptivity. As a further benefit, dynamic trajectory design and resource
allocation are demonstrated. Finally, potential research challenges and
opportunities are discussed.

Title: Unwanted Advances in Higher Education: Uncovering Sexual Harassment
  Experiences in Academia with Text Mining

\\
  Sexual harassment in academia is often a hidden problem because victims are
usually reluctant to report their experiences. Recently, a web survey was
developed to provide an opportunity to share thousands of sexual harassment
experiences in academia. Using an efficient approach, this study collected and
investigated more than 2,000 sexual harassment experiences to better understand
these unwanted advances in higher education. This paper utilized text mining to
disclose hidden topics and explore their weight across three variables:
harasser gender, institution type, and victim's field of study. We mapped the
topics on five themes drawn from the sexual harassment literature and found
that more than 50% of the topics were assigned to the unwanted sexual attention
theme. Fourteen percent of the topics were in the gender harassment theme, in
which insulting, sexist, or degrading comments or behavior was directed towards
women. Five percent of the topics involved sexual coercion (a benefit is
offered in exchange for sexual favors), 5% involved sex discrimination, and 7%
of the topics discussed retaliation against the victim for reporting the
harassment, or for simply not complying with the harasser. Findings highlight
the power differential between faculty and students, and the toll on students
when professors abuse their power. While some topics did differ based on type
of institution, there were no differences between the topics based on gender of
harasser or field of study. This research can be beneficial to researchers in
further investigation of this paper's dataset, and to policymakers in improving
existing policies to create a safe and supportive environment in academia.

Title: The time-adaptive statistical testing for random number generators
Authors: Boris Ryabko
Categories: math.ST cs.CR stat.TH
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1912.06542
\\
  The problem of constructing effective statistical tests for random number
generators (RNG) is considered. Currently, there are hundreds of RNG
statistical tests that are often combined into so-called batteries, each
containing from a dozen to more than one hundred tests.
  When a battery test is used, it is applied to a sequence generated by the
RNG, and the calculation time is determined by the length of the sequence and
the number of tests. Generally speaking, the longer the sequence, the smaller
deviations from randomness can be found by a specific test. So, when a battery
is applied, on the one hand, the "better" tests are in the battery, the more
chances to reject a "bad" RNG. On the other hand, the larger the battery, the
less time can be spent on each test and, therefore, the shorter the test
sequence. In turn, this reduces the ability to find small deviations from
randomness. To reduce this trade-off, we propose an adaptive way to use
batteries (and other sets) of tests, which requires less time but, in a certain
sense, preserves the power of the original battery. We call this method
time-adaptive battery of tests.

Title: A Private Quantum Bit String Commitment
Authors: Mariana Gama, Paulo Mateus, Andr\'e Souto
Categories: quant-ph cs.CR
Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures
\\
  We propose an entanglement-based quantum bit string commitment protocol whose
composability is proven in the random oracle model. This protocol has the
additional property of preserving the privacy of the committed message. Even
though this property is not resilient against man-in-the-middle attacks, this
threat can be circumvented by considering that the parties communicate through
an authenticated channel. The protocol remains secure (but not private) if we
realize the random oracles as physical unclonable functions in the so-called
bad PUF model with access before the opening phase.

Title: Inter-slice image augmentation based on frame interpolation for boosting
  medical image segmentation accuracy
Authors: Zhaotao Wu and Jia Wei and Wenguang Yuan and Jiabing Wang and Tolga
  Tasdizen
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  We introduce the idea of inter-slice image augmentation whereby the numbers
of the medical images and the corresponding segmentation labels are increased
between two consecutive images in order to boost medical image segmentation
accuracy. Unlike conventional data augmentation methods in medical imaging,
which only increase the number of training samples directly by adding new
virtual samples using simple parameterized transformations such as rotation,
flipping, scaling, etc., we aim to augment data based on the relationship
between two consecutive images, which increases not only the number but also
the information of training samples. For this purpose, we propose a
frame-interpolation-based data augmentation method to generate intermediate
medical images and the corresponding segmentation labels between two
consecutive images. We train and test a supervised U-Net liver segmentation
network on SLIVER07 and CHAOS2019, respectively, with the augmented training
samples, and obtain segmentation scores exhibiting significant improvement
compared to the conventional augmentation methods.

Title: Automated quantification of myocardial tissue characteristics from

  uncertainty-based quality-control
Authors: Esther Puyol Anton, Bram Ruijsink, Christian F. Baumgartner, Matthew

\\
  Tissue characterisation with CMR parametric mapping has the potential to
detect and quantify both focal and diffuse alterations in myocardial structure
not assessable by late gadolinium enhancement. Native T1 mapping in particular
has shown promise as a useful biomarker to support diagnostic, therapeutic and
prognostic decision-making in ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathies.
Convolutional neural networks with Bayesian inference are a category of
artificial neural networks which model the uncertainty of the network output.
This study presents an automated framework for tissue characterisation from
native ShMOLLI T1 mapping at 1.5T using a Probabilistic Hierarchical
Segmentation (PHiSeg) network. In addition, we use the uncertainty information
provided by the PHiSeg network in a novel automated quality control (QC) step
to identify uncertain T1 values. The PHiSeg network and QC were validated
against manual analysis on a cohort of the UK Biobank containing healthy
subjects and chronic cardiomyopathy patients. We used the proposed method to
obtain reference T1 ranges for the left ventricular myocardium in healthy
subjects as well as common clinical cardiac conditions. T1 values computed from
automatic and manual segmentations were highly correlated (r=0.97).
Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the automated and manual
measurements. The average Dice metric was 0.84 for the left ventricular
myocardium. The sensitivity of detection of erroneous outputs was 91%. Finally,
T1 values were automatically derived from 14,683 CMR exams from the UK Biobank.
The proposed pipeline allows for automatic analysis of myocardial native T1
mapping and includes a QC process to detect potentially erroneous results. T1
reference values were presented for healthy subjects and common clinical
cardiac conditions from the largest cohort to date using T1-mapping images.

Title: Automatic lung segmentation in routine imaging is a data diversity

\\
  Automated segmentation of anatomical structures is a crucial step in many
medical image analysis tasks. For lung segmentation, a variety of approaches
exist, involving sophisticated pipelines trained and validated on a range of
different data sets. However, during translation to clinical routine the
applicability of these approaches across diseases remains limited. Here, we
show that the accuracy and reliability of lung segmentation algorithms on
demanding cases primarily does not depend on methodology, but on the diversity
of training data. We compare 4 generic deep learning approaches and 2 published
lung segmentation algorithms on routine imaging data with more than 6 different
disease patterns and 3 published data sets. We show that a basic approach -
U-net - performs either better, or competitively with other approaches on both
routine data and published data sets, and outperforms published approaches once
trained on a diverse data set covering multiple diseases. Training data
composition consistently has a bigger impact than algorithm choice on accuracy
across test data sets. We carefully analyse the impact of data diversity, and
the specifications of annotations on both training and validation sets to
provide a reference for algorithms, training data, and annotation. Results on a
seemingly well understood task of lung segmentation suggest the critical
importance of training data diversity compared to model choice.

Title: Noise2Inverse: Self-supervised deep convolutional denoising for linear
  inverse problems in imaging
Authors: Allard A. Hendriksen, Daniel M. Pelt and K. Joost Batenburg
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Recovering a high-quality image from noisy indirect measurement is an
important problem with many applications. For such inverse problems, supervised
deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoising methods have shown
strong results, but their success critically depends on the availability of a
high-quality training dataset of similar measurements. For image denoising,
methods are available that enable training without a separate training dataset
by assuming that the noise in two different pixels is uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not hold for inverse problems, resulting in artifacts in
the output of existing methods. Here, we propose Noise2Inverse, a deep
CNN-based denoising method for linear inverse problems in imaging that does not
require any additional clean or noisy data. Training a CNN-based denoiser is
enabled by exploiting the noise model to compute multiple statistically
independent reconstructions. We develop a theoretical framework which shows
that such training indeed obtains a denoising CNN, assuming the measured noise
is element-wise independent and zero-mean. On simulated CT datasets,
Noise2Inverse demonstrates a substantial improvement in peak signal-to-noise
ratio (> 2dB) and structural similarity index (> 30%) compared to image
denoising methods and conventional reconstruction methods, such as
Total-Variation Minimization. We also demonstrate that the method is able to
significantly reduce noise in challenging real-world experimental datasets.

Title: A Heteroscedastic Uncertainty Model for Decoupling Sources of MRI Image
  Quality
Authors: Richard Shaw and Carole H. Sudre and Sebastien Ourselin and M. Jorge
  Cardoso
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Quality control (QC) of medical images is essential to ensure that downstream
analyses such as segmentation can be performed successfully. Currently, QC is
predominantly performed visually at significant time and operator cost. We aim
to automate the process by formulating a probabilistic network that estimates
uncertainty through a heteroscedastic noise model, hence providing a proxy
measure of task-specific image quality that is learnt directly from the data.
By augmenting the training data with different types of simulated k-space
artefacts, we propose a novel cascading CNN architecture based on a
student-teacher framework to decouple sources of uncertainty related to
different k-space augmentations in an entirely self-supervised manner. This
enables us to predict separate uncertainty quantities for the different types
of data degradation. While the uncertainty measures reflect the presence and
severity of image artefacts, the network also provides the segmentation
predictions given the quality of the data. We show models trained with
simulated artefacts provide informative measures of uncertainty on real-world
images and we validate our uncertainty predictions on problematic images
identified by human-raters.

Title: Learning Deep Analysis Dictionaries -- Part I: Unstructured Dictionaries
Authors: Jun-Jie Huang and Pier Luigi Dragotti
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Inspired by the recent success of Deep Neural Networks and the recent efforts
to develop multi-layer dictionary models, we propose a Deep Analysis dictionary
Model (DeepAM) which is optimized to address a specific regression task known
as single image super-resolution. Contrary to other multi-layer dictionary
models, our architecture contains L layers of analysis dictionary and
soft-thresholding operators to gradually extract high-level features and a
layer of synthesis dictionary which is designed to optimize the regression task
at hand. In our approach, each analysis dictionary is partitioned into two
sub-dictionaries: an Information Preserving Analysis Dictionary (IPAD) and a
Clustering Analysis Dictionary (CAD). The IPAD together with the corresponding
soft-thresholds is designed to pass the key information from the previous layer
to the next layer, while the CAD together with the corresponding
soft-thresholding operator is designed to produce a sparse feature
representation of its input data that facilitates discrimination of key
features. Simulation results show that the proposed deep analysis dictionary
model achieves comparable performance with a Deep Neural Network which has the
same structure and is optimized using back-propagation.

\\
  Housing scholars stress the importance of the information environment in
shaping housing search behavior and outcomes. Rental listings have increasingly
moved online over the past two decades and, in turn, online platforms like
Craigslist are now central to the search process. Do these technology platforms
serve as information equalizers or do they reflect traditional information
inequalities that correlate with neighborhood sociodemographics? We synthesize
and extend analyses of millions of US Craigslist rental listings and find they
supply significantly different volumes, quality, and types of information in
different communities. Technology platforms have the potential to broaden,
diversify, and equalize housing search information, but they rely on landlord
behavior and, in turn, likely will not reach this potential without a
significant redesign or policy intervention. Smart cities advocates hoping to
build better cities through technology must critically interrogate technology
platforms and big data for systematic biases.

  In this paper we study codes with sparse generator matrices. More

in the generator matrix are considered. The end result is the following. For
any binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channel and any epsilon > 2
epsilon*, where epsilon^* = \frac{1}{6}-\frac{5}{3}\log{\frac{4}{3}} \approx
0.085, we show an explicit sequence of capacity-achieving codes with all the

where N is the code block length. The constructions are based on polar codes.
Applications to crowdsourcing are also shown.

  Locating arrays (LAs) can be used to detect and identify interaction faults
among factors in a component-based system. The optimality and constructions of
LAs with a single fault have been investigated extensively under the assumption
that all the factors have the same values. However, in real life, different
factors in a system have different numbers of possible values. Thus, it is
necessary for LAs to satisfy such requirements. We herein establish a general
lower bound on the size of mixed-level $(\bar{1},t)$-locating arrays. Some
methods for constructing LAs including direct and recursive constructions are
provided. In particular, constructions that produce optimal LAs satisfying the
lower bound are described. Additionally, some series of optimal LAs satisfying
the lower bound are presented.

  A square-free word $w$ over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$ is extremal if every

extremal square-free word, and demonstrated that there are arbitrarily long
extremal square-free ternary words. We find all lengths which admit an extremal
square-free ternary word. In particular, we show that there is an extremal
square-free ternary word of every sufficiently large length. We also solve the

Comments: 18 figures, 15 pages
\\
  Understanding how the D-Wave quantum computer could be used for machine
learning problems is of growing interest. Our work evaluates the feasibility of
using the D-Wave as a sampler for machine learning. We describe a hybrid system
that combines a classical deep neural network autoencoder with a quantum
annealing Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using the D-Wave. We evaluate our
hybrid autoencoder algorithm using two datasets, the MNIST dataset and MNIST
Fashion dataset. We evaluate the quality of this method by using a downstream
classification method where the training is based on quantum RBM-generated
samples. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the current 2000-qubit
D-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate
typical problem sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions and
samples that are binary pixel representations. As a consequence of these
limitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression
factor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a
lossy recovery of the original 28 x 28 grayscale images. We further show how
generating samples from the D-Wave after training the RBM, resulted in 28 x 28
images that were variations of the original input data distribution, as opposed
to recreating the training samples. We formulated an MNIST classification
problem using a deep convolutional neural network that used samples from a
quantum RBM to train the MNIST classifier and compared the results with an
MNIST classifier trained with the original MNIST training data set, as well as
an MNIST classifier trained using classical RBM samples. Our hybrid autoencoder
approach indicates advantage for RBM results relative to the use of a current
RBM classical computer implementation for image-based machine learning and even
more promising results for the next generation D-Wave quantum system.

Title: Duopolistic platform competition for revenue and throughput
Authors: Mansi Sood, Ankur A. Kulkarni, Sharayu Moharir
Categories: math.OC cs.GT
\\
  We consider two competing platforms operating in a two-sided market and
offering identical services to their customers at potentially different prices.
The objective of each platform is to maximize its throughput or revenue by
suitably pricing its services. We assume that customers have a preference or
loyalty to the platforms while the workers freelance for the two platforms.
Assuming that the resulting interaction between the users is such that their
aggregate utility is maximized, we show that for each value of the loyalty,
there exists a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for both the throughput and
revenue competition game and characterize it.

\\
  The concept of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
transmission, where phases of reflected signals are adjusted in an effective
arrangement, has been recently put forward as a promising solution for 6G and
beyond networks. Considering this and the undeniable potential of index
modulation (IM) techniques, an RIS-based space shift keying (SSK) scheme is
proposed in this letter to maintain all inherent advantages of both RISs and
SSK. Specifically, a mathematical framework is presented by using a maximum
likelihood (ML) detector for the calculation of the average bit error rate
(ABER). Extensive computer simulation results are provided to assess the
potential of the proposed RIS-based SSK system and to verify the theoretical
derivations. The obtained results indicate that the proposed scheme enables
highly reliable transmission with unconventionally high energy efficiency,
however with the added cost of increased receiver complexity.

Title: Analytic Study of Double Descent in Binary Classification: The Impact of
  Loss
Authors: Ganesh Kini and Christos Thrampoulidis
Categories: stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Extensive empirical evidence reveals that, for a wide range of different
learning methods and datasets, the risk curve exhibits a double-descent (DD)
trend as a function of the model size. In a recent paper
[Zeyu,Kammoun,Thrampoulidis,2019] the authors studied binary linear
classification models and showed that the test error of gradient descent (GD)
with logistic loss undergoes a DD. In this paper, we complement these results
by extending them to GD with square loss. We show that the DD phenomenon
persists, but we also identify several differences compared to logistic loss.
This emphasizes that crucial features of DD curves (such as their transition
threshold and global minima) depend both on the training data and on the
learning algorithm. We further study the dependence of DD curves on the size of
the training set. Similar to our earlier work, our results are analytic: we
plot the DD curves by first deriving sharp asymptotics for the test error under
Gaussian features. Albeit simple, the models permit a principled study of DD
features, the outcomes of which theoretically corroborate related empirical
findings occurring in more complex learning tasks.

Title: Geometry based Stochastic Channel Modeling using Ambit Processes
Authors: Rakesh R. T., Emanuele Viterbo
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  The simulation of vehicular wireless channels using geometry-based radio
channel models is computationally intensive when the number of scatterers is
significantly high. In this paper, we propose a new geometry-based stochastic
channel model to simulate and analyze the aforementioned channels based on a
framework developed from the theory of ambit processes. Under reasonable
assumptions, the underlying mathematical structure of the proposed channel
model enables the characterization of high mobility channels in terms of fading
statistics, spatio-temporal channel correlation, and Doppler spectrum, besides
ensuring tractable analysis. The developed algorithm facilitates fast
simulation of high mobility channels and accounts for key features of vehicular
channels including appearance and disappearance of multi-path components,
spatial consistency, and captures the correlation between time-evolving delay
and Doppler associated with multi-path components. Finally, we carry out
simulations to obtain crucial insights about the characteristics of typical
vehicle-to-infrastructure channels based on the proposed channel model.

Title: ANN-Based Detection in MIMO-OFDM Systems with Low-Resolution ADCs
Authors: Shabnam Rezaei and Sofiene Affes
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we propose a multi-layer artificial neural network (ANN) that
is trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for use in signal detection
over multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) systems, particularly those with low-resolution analog-to-digital
converters (LR-ADCs). We consider a blind detection scheme where data symbol
estimation is carried out without knowing the channel state information at the
receiver (CSIR)---in contrast to classical algorithms. The main power of the
proposed ANN-based detector (ANND) lies in its versatile use with any
modulation scheme, blindly, yet without a change in its structure. We compare
by simulations this new receiver with conventional ones, namely, the maximum
likelihood (ML), minimum mean square error (MMSE), and zero-forcing (ZF), in
terms of symbol error rate (SER) performance. Results suggest that ANND
approaches ML at much lower complexity, outperforms ZF over the entire range of
assessed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, and so does it also, though, with
the MMSE over different SNR ranges.

Title: Gaussian noise removal with exponential functions and spectral norm of
  weighted Hankel matrices
Authors: Tianyu Qiu, Wenjing Liao, Di Guo, Dongbao Liu, Xin Wang, Xiaobo Qu
Categories: physics.med-ph cs.IT math.IT math.SP
\\
  Exponential functions are powerful tools to model signals in various
scenarios, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging, radar, and
concatenative text-to-speech synthesis. Exponential signals, however, are
usually corrupted by Gaussian noise in practice, raising difficulties in
sequential analysis and quantification of the signals. In this work, we propose
a denoising method based on low-rank Hankel matrices for exponential signals
corrupted by Gaussian noise. An accurate estimate of the spectral norm of
weighted Hankel matrices is provided as theoretical guidance to set the
regularization parameter. The bound can be efficiently calculated since it only
depends on the standard deviation of the noise and a constant. Aided by the
bound, one can easily obtain a good regularization parameter to produce
promising denoised results. Our experiments on simulated and magnetic resonance
spectroscopy data demonstrate a superior denoising performance of our proposed
approach in comparison with the typical Cadzow and the state-of-the-art QR
decomposition methods, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime.

Title: Learning the Hypotheses Space from data Part II: Convergence and
  Feasibility
Authors: Diego Marcondes, Adilson Simonis and Junior Barrera
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  In part \textit{I} we proposed a structure for a general Hypotheses Space
$\mathcal{H}$, the Learning Space $\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$, which can be
employed to avoid \textit{overfitting} when estimating in a complex space with
relative shortage of examples. Also, we presented the U-curve property, which
can be taken advantage of in order to select a Hypotheses Space without
exhaustively searching $\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$. In this paper, we carry
further our agenda, by showing the consistency of a model selection framework
based on Learning Spaces, in which one selects from data the Hypotheses Space
on which to learn. The method developed in this paper adds to the
state-of-the-art in model selection, by extending Vapnik-Chervonenkis Theory to
\textit{random} Hypotheses Spaces, i.e., Hypotheses Spaces learned from data.
In this framework, one estimates a random subspace $\hat{\mathcal{M}} \in
\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$ which converges with probability one to a target
Hypotheses Space $\mathcal{M}^{\star} \in \mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$ with desired
properties. As the convergence implies asymptotic unbiased estimators, we have
a consistent framework for model selection, showing that it is feasible to
learn the Hypotheses Space from data. Furthermore, we show that the
generalization errors of learning on $\hat{\mathcal{M}}$ are lesser than those
we commit when learning on $\mathcal{H}$, so it is more efficient to learn on a
subspace learned from data.

  Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is critical to the understanding
of the early universe and precise estimation of cosmological constants. Due to
the contamination of thermal dust noise in the galaxy, the CMB map that is an
image on the two-dimensional sphere has missing observations, mainly
concentrated on the equatorial region. The noise of the CMB map has a
significant impact on the estimation precision for cosmological parameters.
Inpainting the CMB map can effectively reduce the uncertainty of parametric
estimation. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based variational
autoencoder --- CosmoVAE, to restoring the missing observations of the CMB map.
The input and output of CosmoVAE are square images. To generate training,
validation, and test data sets, we segment the full-sky CMB map into many small
images by Cartesian projection. CosmoVAE assigns physical quantities to the
parameters of the VAE network by using the angular power spectrum of the
Gaussian random field as latent variables. CosmoVAE adopts a new loss function
to improve the learning performance of the model, which consists of $\ell_1$
reconstruction loss, Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior
distribution of encoder network and the prior distribution of latent variables,
perceptual loss, and total-variation regularizer. The proposed model achieves
state of the art performance for Planck \texttt{Commander} 2018 CMB map
inpainting.

  The transparent cornea is the window of the eye, facilitating the entry of
light rays and controlling focusing the movement of the light within the eye.
The cornea is critical, contributing to 75% of the refractive power of the eye.
Keratoconus is a progressive and multifactorial corneal degenerative disease
affecting 1 in 2000 individuals worldwide. Currently, there is no cure for
keratoconus other than corneal transplantation for advanced stage keratoconus
or corneal cross-linking, which can only halt KC progression. The ability to
accurately identify subtle KC or KC progression is of vital clinical
significance. To date, there has been little consensus on a useful model to
classify KC patients, which therefore inhibits the ability to predict disease
progression accurately.
  In this paper, we utilised machine learning to analyse data from 124 KC
patients, including topographical and clinical variables. Both supervised
multilayer perceptron and unsupervised variational autoencoder models were used
to classify KC patients with reference to the existing Amsler-Krumeich (A-K)
classification system. Both methods result in high accuracy, with the
unsupervised method showing better performance. The result showed that the
unsupervised method with a selection of 29 variables could be a powerful tool
to provide an automatic classification tool for clinicians. These outcomes
provide a platform for additional analysis for the progression and treatment of
keratoconus.

Title: Re-Examining Linear Embeddings for High-Dimensional Bayesian
  Optimization
Authors: Benjamin Letham, Roberto Calandra, Akshara Rai, Eytan Bakshy
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular approach to optimize
expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. A significant challenge in BO is to
scale to high-dimensional parameter spaces while retaining sample efficiency. A
solution considered in existing literature is to embed the high-dimensional
space in a lower-dimensional manifold, often via a random linear embedding. In
this paper, we identify several crucial issues and misconceptions about the use
of linear embeddings for BO. We study the properties of linear embeddings from
the literature and show that some of the design choices in current approaches
adversely impact their performance. We show empirically that properly
addressing these issues significantly improves the efficacy of linear
embeddings for BO on a range of problems, including learning a gait policy for
robot locomotion.

Title: A study on the role of subsidiary information in replay attack spoofing
  detection
Authors: Jee-weon Jung, Hye-jin Shim, Hee-Soo Heo, Ha-Jin Yu
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD
\\
  In this study, we analyze the role of various categories of subsidiary
information in conducting replay attack spoofing detection: `Room Size',
`Reverberation', `Speaker-to-ASV distance, `Attacker-to-Speaker distance', and
`Replay Device Quality'. As a means of analyzing subsidiary information, we use
two frameworks to either subtract or include a category of subsidiary
information to the code extracted from a deep neural network. For subtraction,
we utilize an adversarial process framework which makes the code orthogonal to
the basis vectors of the subsidiary information. For addition, we utilize the
multi-task learning framework to include subsidiary information to the code.
All experiments are conducted using the ASVspoof 2019 physical access scenario
with the provided meta data. Through the analysis of the result of the two
approaches, we conclude that various categories of subsidiary information does
not reside enough in the code when the deep neural network is trained for
binary classification. Explicitly including various categories of subsidiary
information through the multi-task learning framework can help improve
performance in closed set condition.

Title: Point Spread Function Modelling for Wide Field Small Aperture Telescopes
  with a Denoising Autoencoder
Authors: Peng Jia, Xiyu Li, Zhengyang Li, Weinan Wang, Dongmei Cai
Categories: astro-ph.IM cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures, Accpeted after minor revision by MNRAS
\\
  The point spread function reflects the state of an optical telescope and it
is important for data post-processing methods design. For wide field small
aperture telescopes, the point spread function is hard to model, because it is
affected by many different effects and has strong temporal and spatial
variations. In this paper, we propose to use the denoising autoencoder, a type
of deep neural network, to model the point spread function of wide field small
aperture telescopes. The denoising autoencoder is a pure data based point
spread function modelling method, which uses calibration data from real
observations or numerical simulated results as point spread function templates.
According to real observation conditions, different levels of random noise or
aberrations are added to point spread function templates, making them as
realizations of the point spread function, i.e., simulated star images. Then we
train the denoising autoencoder with realizations and templates of the point
spread function. After training, the denoising autoencoder learns the manifold
space of the point spread function and can map any star images obtained by wide
field small aperture telescopes directly to its point spread function, which
could be used to design data post-processing or optical system alignment
methods.

Title: Convolutional Neural Networks as Summary Statistics for Approximate
  Bayesian Computation
Authors: Mattias {\AA}kesson, Prashant Singh, Fredrik Wrede, Andreas Hellander
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Approximate Bayesian Computation is widely used in systems biology for
inferring parameters in stochastic gene regulatory network models. Its
performance hinges critically on the ability to summarize high-dimensional
system responses such as time series into a few informative, low-dimensional
summary statistics. The quality of those statistics critically affect the
accuracy of the inference. Existing methods to select the best subset out of a
pool of candidate statistics do not scale well with large pools. Since it is
imperative for good performance this becomes a serious bottleneck when doing
inference on complex and high-dimensional problems. This paper proposes a
convolutional neural network architecture for automatically learning
informative summary statistics of temporal responses. We show that the proposed
network can effectively circumvent the statistics selection problem as a
preprocessing step to ABC for a challenging inference problem learning
parameters in a high-dimensional stochastic genetic oscillator. We also study
the impact of experimental design on network performance by comparing different
data richness and different data acquisition strategies.

\\
  Extracting implied information, like volatility and/or dividend, from
observed option prices is a challenging task when dealing with American
options, because of the computational costs needed to solve the corresponding
mathematical problem many thousands of times. We will employ a data-driven
machine learning approach to estimate the Black-Scholes implied volatility and
the dividend yield for American options in a fast and robust way. To determine
the implied volatility, the inverse function is approximated by an artificial
neural network on the computational domain of interest, which decouples the
offline (training) and online (prediction) phases and thus eliminates the need
for an iterative process. For the implied dividend yield, we formulate the
inverse problem as a calibration problem and determine simultaneously the
implied volatility and dividend yield. For this, a generic and robust
calibration framework, the Calibration Neural Network (CaNN), is introduced to
estimate multiple parameters. It is shown that machine learning can be used as
an efficient numerical technique to extract implied information from American
options.

Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We introduce for the first time the utilization of Long short-term memory
(LSTM) neural network architectures for the compensation of fiber
nonlinearities in digital coherent systems. We conduct numerical simulations
considering either C-band or O-band transmission systems for single channel and
multi-channel 16-QAM modulation format with polarization multiplexing. A
detailed analysis regarding the effect of the number of hidden units and the
length of the word of symbols that trains the LSTM algorithm and corresponds to
the considered channel memory is conducted in order to reveal the limits of
LSTM based receiver with respect to performance and complexity. The numerical
results show that LSTM Neural Networks can be very efficient as post processors
of optical receivers which classify data that have undergone non-linear
impairments in fiber and provide superior performance compared to digital back
propagation, especially in the multi-channel transmission scenario. The
complexity analysis shows that LSTM becomes more complex as the number of
hidden units and the channel memory increase can be less complex than DBP in
long distances (> 1000 km).

Title: Community Detection in Bipartite Networks with Stochastic Blockmodels
Authors: Tzu-Chi Yen, Daniel B. Larremore
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML
Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures
\\
  In bipartite networks, community structures are restricted to being
disassortative, in that nodes of one type are grouped according to common
patterns of connection with nodes of the other type. This makes the stochastic
block model (SBM), a highly flexible generative model for networks with block
structure, an intuitive choice for bipartite community detection. However,
typical formulations of the SBM do not make use of the special structure of
bipartite networks. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian nonparametric
formulation of the SBM and a corresponding algorithm to efficiently find
communities in bipartite networks without overfitting. The biSBM improves
community detection results over general SBMs when data are noisy, improves the
model resolution limit by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$, and expands our understanding
of the complicated optimization landscape associated with community detection
tasks. A direct comparison of certain terms of the prior distributions in the
biSBM and a related high-resolution hierarchical SBM also reveals a
counterintuitive regime of community detection problems, populated by smaller
and sparser networks, where non-hierarchical models outperform their more
flexible counterpart.

Title: Learning Unitaries by Gradient Descent
Authors: Bobak Toussi Kiani, Seth Lloyd, Reevu Maity
Categories: quant-ph cs.LG math-ph math.MP
\\
  We study the hardness of learning unitary transformations by performing
gradient descent on the time parameters of sequences of alternating operators.
Such sequences are the basis for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm
and represent one of the simplest possible settings for investigating problems
of controllability. In general, the loss function landscape of alternating
operator sequences in $U(d)$ is highly non-convex, and standard gradient
descent can fail to converge to the global minimum in such spaces. In this
work, we provide numerical evidence that -- despite the highly non-convex
nature of the control landscape -- when the alternating operator sequence
contains $d^2$ or more parameters, gradient descent always converges to the
target unitary. The rates of convergence provide evidence for a "computational
phase transition." When the number of parameters is less than $d^2$, gradient
descent converges to a sub-optimal solution. When the number of parameters is
greater than $d^2$, gradient descent converges rapidly and exponentially to an
optimal solution. At the computational critical point where the number of
parameters in the alternating operator sequence equals $d^2$, the rate of
convergence is polynomial with a critical exponent of approximately 1.25.

Title: Centralized and distributed online learning for sparse time-varying
  optimization
Authors: Sophie M. Fosson
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
\\
  The development of online algorithms to track time-varying systems has drawn
a lot of attention in the last years, in particular in the framework of online
convex optimization. Meanwhile, sparse time-varying optimization has emerged as
a powerful tool to deal with widespread applications, ranging from dynamic
compressed sensing to parsimonious system identification. In most of the
literature on sparse time-varying problems, some prior information on the
system's evolution is assumed to be available. In contrast, in this paper, we
propose an online learning approach, which does not employ a given model and is
suitable for adversarial frameworks. Specifically, we develop centralized and
distributed algorithms, and we theoretically analyze them in terms of dynamic
regret, in an online learning perspective. Further, we propose numerical
experiments that illustrate their practical effectiveness.

model is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We provide a graphical
representation of such mixture distributions and prove that this representation
encodes the conditional independence relations of the mixture distribution. We
then consider the problem of structure learning based on samples from such
distributions. Since the mixing variable is latent, we consider causal
structure discovery algorithms such as FCI that can deal with latent variables.
We show that such algorithms recover a "union" of the component DAGs and can
identify variables whose conditional distribution across the component DAGs
vary. We demonstrate our results on synthetic and real data showing that the
inferred graph identifies nodes that vary between the different mixture
components. As an immediate application, we demonstrate how retrieval of this
causal information can be used to cluster samples according to each mixture
component.

Title: Non-reversibly updating a uniform [0,1] value for Metropolis
  accept/reject decisions
Authors: Radford M. Neal
Categories: stat.CO cs.LG
\\
  I show how it can be beneficial to express Metropolis accept/reject decisions
in terms of comparison with a uniform [0,1] value, u, and to then update u
non-reversibly, as part of the Markov chain state, rather than sampling it
independently each iteration. This provides a small improvement for random walk
Metropolis and Langevin updates in high dimensions. It produces a larger
improvement when using Langevin updates with persistent momentum, giving
performance comparable to that of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with long
trajectories. This is of significance when some variables are updated by other
methods, since if HMC is used, these updates can be done only between
trajectories, whereas they can be done more often with Langevin updates. I
demonstrate that for a problem with some continuous variables, updated by HMC
or Langevin updates, and also discrete variables, updated by Gibbs sampling
between updates of the continuous variables, Langevin with persistent momentum
and non-reversible updates to u samples nearly a factor of two more efficiently
than HMC. Benefits are also seen for a Bayesian neural network model in which
hyperparameters are updated by Gibbs sampling.

Title: Fast Monte Carlo Dropout and Error Correction for Radio Transmitter
  Classification
Authors: Liangping Ma, John Kaewell
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG cs.NI
Comments: Work completed in October, 2019
\\
  Monte Carlo dropout may effectively capture model uncertainty in deep
learning, where a measure of uncertainty is obtained by using multiple
instances of dropout at test time. However, Monte Carlo dropout is applied
across the whole network and thus significantly increases the computational
complexity, proportional to the number of instances. To reduce the
computational complexity, at test time we enable dropout layers only near the
output of the neural network and reuse the computation from prior layers while
keeping, if any, other dropout layers disabled. Additionally, we leverage the
side information about the ideal distributions for various input samples to do
`error correction' on the predictions. We apply these techniques to the radio
frequency (RF) transmitter classification problem and show that the proposed
algorithm is able to provide better prediction uncertainty than the simple
ensemble average algorithm and can be used to effectively identify transmitters
that are not in the training data set while correctly classifying transmitters
it has been trained on.

Title: Consensus-Based Optimization on the Sphere I: Well-Posedness and
  Mean-Field Limit
Authors: Massimo Fornasier, Hui Huang, Lorenzo Pareschi, Philippe S\"unnen
Categories: math.AP cs.LG math.OC
\\
  We introduce a new stochastic Kuramoto-Vicsek-type model for global
optimization of nonconvex functions on the sphere. This model belongs to the
class of Consensus-Based Optimization methods. In fact, particles move on the
sphere driven by a drift towards an instantaneous consensus point, computed as
a convex combination of the particle locations weighted by the cost function
according to Laplace's principle. The consensus point represents an
approximation to a global minimizer. The dynamics is further perturbed by a
random vector field to favor exploration, whose variance is a function of the
distance of the particles to the consensus point. In particular, as soon as the
consensus is reached, then the stochastic component vanishes. In this paper, we
study the well-posedness of the model and we derive rigorously its mean-field
approximation for large particle limit.

Title: Hierarchy and co-evolution processes in urban systems
Authors: Juste Raimbault
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.MA
Comments: 16 pages, 4 figures, 1 table
\\
  The concept of hierarchy in complex systems is tightly linked to
co-evolutionary processes. We propose here to explore it in the case of the
co-evolution between transportation networks and territories. More precisely,
we extend a co-evolution model for systems of cities and infrastructure
networks, and systematically study its behavior following specific hierarchy
indicators we introduce. We show that population hierarchy and network
hierarchy are tightly linked, but that a broad range of regimes can exist.
Model exploration furthermore yields non-trivial stylized facts which can be
taken into account for territorial planning on such long time scales with
co-evolutionary processes.

\\
  Classical scalar-response regression methods treat covariates as a vector and
estimate a corresponding vector of regression coefficients. In medical
applications, however, regressors are often in a form of multi-dimensional
arrays. For example, one may be interested in using MRI imaging to identify
which brain regions are associated with a health outcome. Vectorizing the
two-dimensional image arrays is an unsatisfactory approach since it destroys
the inherent spatial structure of the images and can be computationally
challenging. We present an alternative approach - regularized matrix regression
- where the matrix of regression coefficients is defined as a solution to the
specific optimization problem. The method, called SParsity Inducing Nuclear
Norm EstimatoR (SpINNEr), simultaneously imposes two penalty types on the
regression coefficient matrix---the nuclear norm and the lasso norm---to
encourage a low rank matrix solution that also has entry-wise sparsity. A
specific implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is used to build a fast and efficient numerical solver. Our simulations
show that SpINNEr outperforms other methods in estimation accuracy when the
response-related entries (representing the brain's functional connectivity) are
arranged in well-connected communities. SpINNEr is applied to investigate
associations between HIV-related outcomes and functional connectivity in the
human brain.

  Molecular processes of neuronal learning have been well-described. However,
learning mechanisms of non-neuronal cells have not been fully understood at the
molecular level. Here, we discuss molecular mechanisms of cellular learning,
including conformational memory of intrinsically disordered proteins and
prions, signaling cascades, protein translocation, RNAs (microRNA and lncRNA),
and chromatin memory. We hypothesize that these processes constitute the
learning of signaling networks and correspond to a generalized Hebbian learning
process of single, non-neuronal cells, and discuss how cellular learning may
open novel directions in drug design and inspire new artificial intelligence
methods.

Title: Bio-inspired Flexible Twisting Wings Increase Lift and Efficiency of a
  Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicle
Authors: David Colmenares, Randall Kania, Wang Zhang, and Metin Sitti
Categories: physics.flu-dyn cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages, 8 figures
\\
  We investigate the effect of wing twist flexibility on lift and efficiency of
a flapping-wing micro air vehicle capable of liftoff. Wings used previously
were chosen to be fully rigid due to modeling and fabrication constraints.
However, biological wings are highly flexible and other micro air vehicles have
successfully utilized flexible wing structures for specialized tasks. The goal
of our study is to determine if dynamic twisting of flexible wings can increase
overall aerodynamic lift and efficiency. A flexible twisting wing design was
found to increase aerodynamic efficiency by 41.3%, translational lift
production by 35.3%, and the effective lift coefficient by 63.7% compared to
the rigid-wing design. These results exceed the predictions of quasi-steady
blade element models, indicating the need for unsteady computational fluid
dynamics simulations of twisted flapping wings.

Title: Graph Cepstrum: Spatial Feature Extracted from Partially Connected
  Microphones
Authors: Keisuke Imoto
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: Accepted to IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems. arXiv
  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1805.11782
\\
  In this paper, we propose an effective and robust method of spatial feature
extraction for acoustic scene analysis utilizing partially synchronized and/or
closely located distributed microphones. In the proposed method, a new cepstrum
feature utilizing a graph-based basis transformation to extract spatial
information from distributed microphones, while taking into account whether any
pairs of microphones are synchronized and/or closely located, is introduced.
Specifically, in the proposed graph-based cepstrum, the log-amplitude of a
multichannel observation is converted to a feature vector utilizing the inverse
graph Fourier transform, which is a method of basis transformation of a signal
on a graph. Results of experiments using real environmental sounds show that
the proposed graph-based cepstrum robustly extracts spatial information with
consideration of the microphone connections. Moreover, the results indicate
that the proposed method more robustly classifies acoustic scenes than
conventional spatial features when the observed sounds have a large
synchronization mismatch between partially synchronized microphone groups.

Title: Guiding Cascading Failure Search with Interpretable Graph Convolutional
  Network
Authors: Yuxiao Liu, Ning Zhang, Dan Wu, Audun Botterud, Rui Yao, Chongqing
  Kang
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 9 pages,8 figures
\\
  Power system cascading failures become more time variant and complex because
of the increasing network interconnection and higher renewable energy
penetration. High computational cost is the main obstacle for a more frequent
online cascading failure search, which is essential to improve system security.
In this work, we show that the complex mechanism of cascading failures can be
well captured by training a graph convolutional network (GCN) offline.
Subsequently, the search of cascading failures can be significantly accelerated
with the aid of the trained GCN model. We link the power network topology with
the structure of the GCN, yielding a smaller parameter space to learn the
complex mechanism. We further enable the interpretability of the GCN model by a
layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm. The proposed method is tested
on both the IEEE RTS-79 test system and China's Henan Province power system.
The results show that the GCN guided method can not only accelerate the search
of cascading failures, but also reveal the reasons for predicting the potential
cascading failures.
