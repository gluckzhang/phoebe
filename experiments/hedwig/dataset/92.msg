Title: Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for Circle Bin Packing Problem
Authors: Kun He, Kevin Tole, Fei Ni, Yong Yuan, Linyun Liao
Categories: cs.AI cs.DC
Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables
\\
  We address a new variant of packing problem called the circle bin packing
problem (CBPP), which is to find a dense packing of circle items to multiple
square bins so as to minimize the number of used bins. To this end, we propose
an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm, which uses our Greedy
Algorithm with Corner Occupying Action (GACOA) to construct an initial layout.
The greedy solution is usually in a local optimum trap, and ALNS enables
multiple neighborhood search that depends on the stochastic annealing schedule
to avoid getting stuck in local minimum traps. Specifically, ALNS perturbs the
current layout to jump out of a local optimum by iteratively reassigns some
circles and accepts the new layout with some probability during the search. The
acceptance probability is adjusted adaptively using simulated annealing that
fine-tunes the search direction in order to reach the global optimum. We
benchmark computational results against GACOA in heterogeneous instances. ALNS
always outperforms GACOA in improving the objective function, and in several
cases, there is a significant reduction on the number of bins used in the
packing.

Title: Emergence of Pragmatics from Referential Game between Theory of Mind
  Agents
Authors: Luyao Yuan, Zipeng Fu, Jingyue Shen, Lu Xu, Junhong Shen, Song-Chun
  Zhu
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG cs.MA
\\
  Pragmatics studies how context can contribute to language meanings [1]. In
human communication, language is never interpreted out of context, and
sentences can usually convey more information than their literal meanings [2].
However, this mechanism is missing in most multi-agent systems [3, 4, 5, 6],
restricting the communication efficiency and the capability of human-agent
interaction. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, using which agents can
spontaneously learn the ability to "read between lines" without any explicit
hand-designed rules. We integrate the theory of mind (ToM) [7, 8] in a
cooperative multi-agent pedagogical situation and propose an adaptive
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to develop a communication protocol. ToM
is a profound cognitive science concept, claiming that people regularly reason
about other's mental states, including beliefs, goals, and intentions, to
obtain performance advantage in competition, cooperation or coalition. With
this ability, agents consider language as not only messages but also rational
acts reflecting others' hidden states. Our experiments demonstrate the
advantage of pragmatic protocols over non-pragmatic protocols. We also show the
teaching complexity following the pragmatic protocol empirically approximates
to recursive teaching dimension (RTD).

Title: A Journey into Ontology Approximation: From Non-Horn to Hon
Authors: Anneke Haga, Carsten Lutz, Johannes Marti, Frank Wolter
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 20 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ijcai2020
\\
  We study complete approximations of an ontology formulated in a non-Horn
description logic (DL) such as $\mathcal{ALC}$ in a Horn DL such
as~$\mathcal{EL}$. We provide concrete approximation schemes that are
necessarily infinite and observe that in the $\mathcal{ELU}$-to-$\mathcal{EL}$
case finite approximations tend to exist in practice and are guaranteed to
exist when the original ontology is acyclic. In contrast, neither of this is
the case for $\mathcal{ELU}_\bot$-to-$\mathcal{EL}_\bot$ and for
$\mathcal{ALC}$-to-$\mathcal{EL}_\bot$ approximations. We also define a notion
of approximation tailored towards ontology-mediated querying, connect it to
subsumption-based approximations, and identify a case where finite
approximations are guaranteed to exist.

  Online Social Networks(OSNs) have established virtual platforms enabling
people to express their opinions, interests and thoughts in a variety of
contexts and domains, allowing legitimate users as well as spammers and other
untrustworthy users to publish and spread their content. Hence, the concept of
social trust has attracted the attention of information processors/data
scientists and information consumers/business firms. One of the main reasons
for acquiring the value of Social Big Data (SBD) is to provide frameworks and
methodologies using which the credibility of OSNs users can be evaluated. These
approaches should be scalable to accommodate large-scale social data. Hence,
there is a need for well comprehending of social trust to improve and expand
the analysis process and inferring the credibility of SBD. Given the exposed
environment's settings and fewer limitations related to OSNs, the medium allows
legitimate and genuine users as well as spammers and other low trustworthy
users to publish and spread their content. Hence, this paper presents an
approach incorporates semantic analysis and machine learning modules to measure
and predict users' trustworthiness in numerous domains in different time
periods. The evaluation of the conducted experiment validates the applicability
of the incorporated machine learning techniques to predict highly trustworthy
domain-based users.

Title: Benchmarking Symbolic Execution Using Constraint Problems -- Initial
  Results
Authors: Sahil Verma, Roland H.C. Yap

\\
  Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for bug finding and program
testing. It is successful in finding bugs in real-world code. The core
reasoning techniques use constraint solving, path exploration, and search,
which are also the same techniques used in solving combinatorial problems,
e.g., finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). We propose CSP
instances as more challenging benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of the
core techniques in symbolic execution. We transform CSP benchmarks into C
programs suitable for testing the reasoning capabilities of symbolic execution
tools. From a single CSP P, we transform P depending on transformation choice
into different C programs. Preliminary testing with the KLEE, Tracer-X, and
LLBMC tools show substantial runtime differences from transformation and solver
choice. Our C benchmarks are effective in showing the limitations of existing
symbolic execution tools. The motivation for this work is we believe that
benchmarks of this form can spur the development and engineering of improved
core reasoning in symbolic execution engines.

\\
  A person ontology comprising concepts, attributes and relationships of people
has a number of applications in data protection, didentification, population of
knowledge graphs for business intelligence and fraud prevention. While
artificial neural networks have led to improvements in Entity Recognition,
Entity Classification, and Relation Extraction, creating an ontology largely
remains a manual process, because it requires a fixed set of semantic relations
between concepts. In this work, we present a system for automatically
populating a person ontology graph from unstructured data using neural models
for Entity Classification and Relation Extraction. We introduce a new dataset
for these tasks and discuss our results.

Title: Algorithms for Tensor Network Contraction Ordering
Authors: Frank Schindler, Adam S. Jermyn
Categories: cs.AI cs.NA math.NA physics.comp-ph quant-ph
Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Contracting tensor networks is often computationally demanding. Well-designed
contraction sequences can dramatically reduce the contraction cost. We explore
the performance of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, two common
discrete optimization techniques, to this ordering problem. We benchmark their
performance as well as that of the commonly-used greedy search on physically
relevant tensor networks. Where computationally feasible, we also compare them
with the optimal contraction sequence obtained by an exhaustive search. We find
that the algorithms we consider consistently outperform a greedy search given
equal computational resources, with an advantage that scales with tensor
network size. We compare the obtained contraction sequences and identify signs
of highly non-local optimization, with the more sophisticated algorithms
sacrificing run-time early in the contraction for better overall performance.

Title: Accelerating supply chains with Ant Colony Optimization across range of
  hardware solutions
Authors: Ivars Dzalbs, Tatiana Kalganova
Categories: cs.AI cs.DC cs.NE
\\
  Ant Colony algorithm has been applied to various optimization problems,
however most of the previous work on scaling and parallelism focuses on
Travelling Salesman Problems (TSPs). Although, useful for benchmarks and new
idea comparison, the algorithmic dynamics does not always transfer to complex
real-life problems, where additional meta-data is required during solution
construction. This paper looks at real-life outbound supply chain problem using
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and its scaling dynamics with two parallel ACO
architectures - Independent Ant Colonies (IAC) and Parallel Ants (PA). Results
showed that PA was able to reach a higher solution quality in fewer iterations
as the number of parallel instances increased. Furthermore, speed performance
was measured across three different hardware solutions - 16 core CPU, 68 core
Xeon Phi and up to 4 Geforce GPUs. State of the art, ACO vectorization
techniques such as SS-Roulette were implemented using C++ and CUDA. Although
excellent for TSP, it was concluded that for the given supply chain problem
GPUs are not suitable due to meta-data access footprint required. Furthermore,
compared to their sequential counterpart, vectorized CPU AVX2 implementation
achieved 25.4x speedup on CPU while Xeon Phi with its AVX512 instruction set
reached 148x on PA with Vectorized (PAwV). PAwV is therefore able to scale at
least up to 1024 parallel instances on the supply chain network problem solved.

Title: DeepEnroll: Patient-Trial Matching with Deep Embeddingand Entailment
  Prediction
Authors: Xingyao Zhang, Cao Xiao, Lucas M. Glass, Jimeng Sun
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: accepted by The World Wide Web Conference 2020
DOI: 10.1145/1122445.1122456
\\
  Clinical trials are essential for drug development but often suffer from
expensive, inaccurate and insufficient patient recruitment. The core problem of
patient-trial matching is to find qualified patients for a trial, where patient
information is stored in electronic health records (EHR) while trial
eligibility criteria (EC) are described in text documents available on the web.
How to represent longitudinal patient EHR? How to extract complex logical rules
from EC? Most existing works rely on manual rule-based extraction, which is
time consuming and inflexible for complex inference. To address these
challenges, we proposed DeepEnroll, a cross-modal inference learning model to
jointly encode enrollment criteria (text) and patients records (tabular data)
into a shared latent space for matching inference. DeepEnroll applies a
pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) model
to encode clinical trial information into sentence embedding. And uses a
hierarchical embedding model to represent patient longitudinal EHR. In
addition, DeepEnroll is augmented by a numerical information embedding and
entailment module to reason over numerical information in both EC and EHR.
These encoders are trained jointly to optimize patient-trial matching score. We
evaluated DeepEnroll on the trial-patient matching task with demonstrated on
real world datasets. DeepEnroll outperformed the best baseline by up to 12.4%
in average F1.

  Bridge is a trick-taking card game requiring the ability to evaluate
probabilities since it is a game of incomplete information where each player
only sees its cards. In order to choose a strategy, a player needs to gather
information about the hidden cards in the other players' hand. We present a
methodology allowing us to model a part of card playing in Bridge using
Probabilistic Logic Programming.

Title: Lower Bounds Against Sparse Symmetric Functions of ACC Circuits:
  Expanding the Reach of $\#$SAT Algorithms
Authors: Nikhil Vyas, Ryan Williams
Categories: cs.CC
Comments: To appear in STACS 2020
\\
  We continue the program of proving circuit lower bounds via circuit
satisfiability algorithms. So far, this program has yielded several concrete
results, proving that functions in $\text{Quasi-NP} = \text{NTIME}[n^{(\log
n)^{O(1)}}]$ and $\text{NEXP}$ do not have small circuits from various circuit
classes ${\cal C}$, by showing that ${\cal C}$ admits non-trivial
satisfiability and/or $\#$SAT algorithms which beat exhaustive search by a
minor amount.
  In this paper, we present a new strong lower bound consequence of non-trivial
$\#$SAT algorithm for a circuit class ${\mathcal C}$. Say a symmetric Boolean
function $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is sparse if it outputs $1$ on $O(1)$ values of
$\sum_i x_i$. We show that for every sparse $f$, and for all "typical" ${\cal
C}$, faster $\#$SAT algorithms for ${\cal C}$ circuits actually imply lower
bounds against the circuit class $f \circ {\cal C}$, which may be stronger than
${\cal C}$ itself. In particular:
  $\#$SAT algorithms for $n^k$-size ${\cal C}$-circuits running in $2^n/n^k$
time (for all $k$) imply $\text{NEXP}$ does not have $f \circ {\cal
C}$-circuits of polynomial size.
  $\#$SAT algorithms for $2^{n^{\epsilon}}$-size ${\cal C}$-circuits running in
$2^{n-n^{\epsilon}}$ time (for some $\epsilon > 0$) imply $\text{Quasi-NP}$
does not have $f \circ {\cal C}$-circuits of polynomial size.
  Applying $\#$SAT algorithms from the literature, one immediate corollary of
our results is that $\text{Quasi-NP}$ does not have $\text{EMAJ} \circ
\text{ACC}^0 \circ \text{THR}$ circuits of polynomial size, where $\text{EMAJ}$
is the "exact majority" function, improving previous lower bounds against
$\text{ACC}^0$ [Williams JACM'14] and $\text{ACC}^0 \circ \text{THR}$ [Williams
STOC'14], [Murray-Williams STOC'18]. This is the first nontrivial lower bound
against such a circuit class.

Title: Iterated Type Partitions
Authors: Gennaro Cordasco, Luisa Gargano and Adele Anna Rescigno
Categories: cs.CC cs.DM math.CO
\\
  This paper deals with the complexity of some natural graph problems when
parametrized by {measures that are restrictions of} clique-width, such as
modular-width and neighborhood diversity. The main contribution of this paper
is to introduce a novel parameter, called iterated type partition, that can be
computed in polynomial time and nicely places between modular-width and
neighborhood diversity. We prove that the Equitable Coloring problem is
W[1]-hard when parametrized by the iterated type partition. This result extends
to modular-width, answering an open question about the possibility to have FPT
algorithms for Equitable Coloring when parametrized by modular-width. Moreover,
we show that the Equitable Coloring problem is instead FTP when parameterized
by neighborhood diversity. Furthermore, we present simple and fast FPT
algorithms parameterized by iterated type partition that provide optimal
solutions for several graph problems; in particular, this paper presents
algorithms for the Dominating Set, the Vertex Coloring and the Vertex Cover
problems. While the above problems are already known to be FPT with respect to
modular-width, the novel algorithms are both simpler and more efficient: For
the Dominating set and Vertex Cover problems, our algorithms output an optimal
set in time $O(2^t+poly(n))$, while for the Vertex Coloring problem, our
algorithm outputs an optimal set in time $O(t^{2.5t+o(t)}\log n+poly(n))$,
where $n$ and $t$ are the size and the iterated type partition of the input
graph, respectively.

Title: A Multi-Vector Interface Quasi-Newton Method with Linear Complexity for
  Partitioned Fluid-Structure Interaction
Authors: Thomas Spenke, Norbert Hosters, Marek Behr
Categories: cs.CE
DOI: 10.1016/j.cma.2019.112810
\\
  In recent years, interface quasi-Newton methods have gained growing attention
in the fluid-structure interaction community by significantly improving
partitioned solution schemes: They not only help to control the inherent
added-mass instability, but also prove to substantially speed up the coupling's
convergence. In this work, we present a novel variant: The key idea is to build
on the multi-vector Jacobian update scheme first presented by Bogaers et al.
(2014) and avoid any explicit representation of the (inverse) Jacobian
approximation, since it slows down the solution for large systems. Instead, all
terms involving a quadratic complexity have been systematically eliminated. The
result is a new multi-vector interface quasi-Newton variant whose computational
cost scales linearly with the problem size.

Title: Active Learning over DNN: Automated Engineering Design Optimization for
  Fluid Dynamics Based on Self-Simulated Dataset
Authors: Yang Chen
Categories: cs.CE cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Optimizing fluid-dynamic performance is an important engineering task.
Traditionally, experts design shapes based on empirical estimations and verify
them through expensive experiments. This costly process, both in terms of time
and space, may only explore a limited number of shapes and lead to sub-optimal
designs. In this research, a test-proven deep learning architecture is applied
to predict the performance under various restrictions and search for better
shapes by optimizing the learned prediction function. The major challenge is
the vast amount of data points Deep Neural Network (DNN) demands, which is
improvident to simulate. To remedy this drawback, a Frequentist active learning
is used to explore regions of the output space that DNN predicts promising.
This operation reduces the number of data samples demanded from ~8000 to 625.
The final stage, a user interface, made the model capable of optimizing with
given user input of minimum area and viscosity. Flood fill is used to define a
boundary area function so that the optimal shape does not bypass the minimum
area. Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) is employed to make sure the
ultimate shape is optimized while circumventing the required area. Jointly,
shapes with extremely low drags are found explored by a practical user
interface with no human domain knowledge and modest computation overhead.

Title: Chirotopes of Random Points in Space are Realizable on a Small Integer

Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures
Journal-ref: In Proceedings of the 31st Canadian Conference on Computational

\\
  We prove that with high probability, a uniform sample of $n$ points in a
convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be rounded to points on a grid of step size
proportional to $1/n^{d+1+\epsilon}$ without changing the underlying chirotope
(oriented matroid). Therefore, chirotopes of random point sets can be encoded
with $O(n\log n)$ bits. This is in stark contrast to the worst case, where the
grid may be forced to have step size $1/2^{2^{\Omega(n)}}$ even for $d=2$.
  This result is a high-dimensional generalization of previous results on order
types of random planar point sets due to Fabila-Monroy and Huemer (2017) and
Devillers, Duchon, Glisse, and Goaoc (2018).

  We perform statistical analysis of the phenomenon of neology, the process by
which new words emerge in a language, using large diachronic corpora of
English. We investigate the importance of two factors, semantic sparsity and
frequency growth rates of semantic neighbors, formalized in the distributional
semantics paradigm. We show that both factors are predictive of word emergence
although we find more support for the latter hypothesis. Besides presenting a
new linguistic application of distributional semantics, this study tackles the
linguistic question of the role of language-internal factors (in our case,
sparsity) in language change motivated by language-external factors (reflected
in frequency growth).

Title: Elephant in the Room: An Evaluation Framework for Assessing Adversarial
  Examples in NLP
Authors: Ying Xu, Xu Zhong, Antonio Jose Jimeno Yepes, Jey Han Lau
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  An adversarial example is an input transformed by small perturbations that
machine learning models consistently misclassify. While there are a number of
methods proposed to generate adversarial examples for text data, it is not
trivial to assess the quality of these adversarial examples, as minor
perturbations (such as changing a word in a sentence) can lead to a significant
shift in their meaning, readability and classification label. In this paper, we
propose an evaluation framework to assess the quality of adversarial examples
based on the aforementioned properties. We experiment with five benchmark
attacking methods and an alternative approach based on an auto-encoder, and
found that these methods generate adversarial examples with poor readability
and content preservation. We also learned that there are multiple factors that
can influence the attacking performance, such as the the length of text
examples and the input domain.

Title: Normalization of Input-output Shared Embeddings in Text Generation
  Models
Authors: Jinyang Liu, Yujia Zhai, Zizhong Chen
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Neural Network based models have been state-of-the-art models for various
Natural Language Processing tasks, however, the input and output dimension
problem in the networks has still not been fully resolved, especially in text
generation tasks (e.g. Machine Translation, Text Summarization), in which input
and output both have huge sizes of vocabularies. Therefore, input-output
embedding weight sharing has been introduced and adopted widely, which remains
to be improved. Based on linear algebra and statistical theories, this paper
locates the shortcoming of existed input-output embedding weight sharing
method, then raises methods for improving input-output weight shared embedding,
among which methods of normalization of embedding weight matrices show best
performance. These methods are nearly computational cost-free, can get combined
with other embedding techniques, and show good effectiveness when applied on
state-of-the-art Neural Network models. For Transformer-big models, the
normalization techniques can get at best 0.6 BLEU improvement compared to the
original version of model on WMT'16 En-De dataset, and similar BLEU
improvements on IWSLT 14' datasets. For DynamicConv models, 0.5 BLEU
improvement can be attained on WMT'16 En-De dataset, and 0.41 BLEU improvement
on IWSLT 14' De-En translation task is achieved.

  Nowadays, it is no more needed to do an enormous effort to distribute a lot
of forms to thousands of people and collect them, then convert this from into
electronic format to track people opinion about some subjects. A lot of web
sites can today reach a large spectrum with less effort. The majority of web
sites suggest to their visitors to leave backups about their feeling of the
site or events. So, this makes for us a lot of data which need powerful mean to
exploit. Opinion mining in the web becomes more and more an attracting task,
due the increasing need for individuals and societies to track the mood of
people against several subjects of daily life (sports, politics,
television,...). A lot of works in opinion mining was developed in western
languages especially English, such works in Arabic language still very scarce.
In this paper, we propose our approach, for opinion mining in Arabic Algerian

Title: ManyModalQA: Modality Disambiguation and QA over Diverse Inputs
Authors: Darryl Hannan, Akshay Jain, and Mohit Bansal
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: AAAI 2020 (10 pages)
\\
  We present a new multimodal question answering challenge, ManyModalQA, in
which an agent must answer a question by considering three distinct modalities:
text, images, and tables. We collect our data by scraping Wikipedia and then
utilize crowdsourcing to collect question-answer pairs. Our questions are
ambiguous, in that the modality that contains the answer is not easily
determined based solely upon the question. To demonstrate this ambiguity, we
construct a modality selector (or disambiguator) network, and this model gets
substantially lower accuracy on our challenge set, compared to existing
datasets, indicating that our questions are more ambiguous. By analyzing this
model, we investigate which words in the question are indicative of the
modality. Next, we construct a simple baseline ManyModalQA model, which, based
on the prediction from the modality selector, fires a corresponding pre-trained
state-of-the-art unimodal QA model. We focus on providing the community with a
new manymodal evaluation set and only provide a fine-tuning set, with the
expectation that existing datasets and approaches will be transferred for most
of the training, to encourage low-resource generalization without large,
monolithic training sets for each new task. There is a significant gap between
our baseline models and human performance; therefore, we hope that this
challenge encourages research in end-to-end modality disambiguation and
multimodal QA models, as well as transfer learning. Code and data available at:

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  This paper describes "TLT-school" a corpus of speech utterances collected in
schools of northern Italy for assessing the performance of students learning
both English and German. The corpus was recorded in the years 2017 and 2018
from students aged between nine and sixteen years, attending primary, middle
and high school. All utterances have been scored, in terms of some predefined
proficiency indicators, by human experts. In addition, most of utterances
recorded in 2017 have been manually transcribed carefully. Guidelines and
procedures used for manual transcriptions of utterances will be described in
detail, as well as results achieved by means of an automatic speech recognition
system developed by us. Part of the corpus is going to be freely distributed to
scientific community particularly interested both in non-native speech
recognition and automatic assessment of second language proficiency.

Title: Contextualized Embeddings in Named-Entity Recognition: An Empirical
  Study on Generalization
Authors: Bruno Taill\'e, Vincent Guigue, Patrick Gallinari
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Journal-ref: ECIR 2020
\\
  Contextualized embeddings use unsupervised language model pretraining to
compute word representations depending on their context. This is intuitively
useful for generalization, especially in Named-Entity Recognition where it is
crucial to detect mentions never seen during training. However, standard
English benchmarks overestimate the importance of lexical over contextual
features because of an unrealistic lexical overlap between train and test
mentions. In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of the generalization
capabilities of state-of-the-art contextualized embeddings by separating
mentions by novelty and with out-of-domain evaluation. We show that they are
particularly beneficial for unseen mentions detection, especially
out-of-domain. For models trained on CoNLL03, language model contextualization
leads to a +1.2% maximal relative micro-F1 score increase in-domain against
+13% out-of-domain on the WNUT dataset

Title: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Neural Machine Translation with
  Iterative Back Translation
Authors: Di Jin, Zhijing Jin, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Peter Szolovits
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to IJCAI 2020
\\
  State-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) systems are data-hungry and
perform poorly on domains with little supervised data. As data collection is
expensive and infeasible in many cases, unsupervised domain adaptation methods
are needed. We apply an Iterative Back Translation (IBT) training scheme on
in-domain monolingual data, which repeatedly uses a Transformer-based NMT model
to create in-domain pseudo-parallel sentence pairs in one translation direction
on the fly and then use them to train the model in the other direction.
Evaluated on three domains of German-to-English translation task with no
supervised data, this simple technique alone (without any out-of-domain
parallel data) can already surpass all previous domain adaptation methods---up
to +9.48 BLEU over the strongest previous method, and up to +27.77 BLEU over
the unadapted baseline. Moreover, given available supervised out-of-domain data
on German-to-English and Romanian-to-English language pairs, we can further
enhance the performance and obtain up to +19.31 BLEU improvement over the
strongest baseline, and +47.69 BLEU increment against the unadapted model.

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Work in progress
\\
  This paper demonstrates that multilingual denoising pre-training produces
significant performance gains across a wide variety of machine translation (MT)
tasks. We present mBART -- a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder
pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART
objective. mBART is the first method for pre-training a complete
sequence-to-sequence model by denoising full texts in multiple languages;
previous MT pre-training has focused only on the encoder, decoder, or
reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be
directly fine tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and
unsupervised machine translation, with no task-specific modifications. We
demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all
but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low
resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised
models. We also show it also enables new types of transfer to language pairs
with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present
extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective
pre-training.

Title: GhostImage: Perception Domain Attacks against Vision-based Object
  Classification Systems
Authors: Yanmao Man, Ming Li, Ryan Gerdes
Categories: cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  In vision-based object classification systems, imaging sensors perceive the
environment and then objects are detected and classified for decision-making
purposes. Vulnerabilities in the perception domain enable an attacker to inject
false data into the sensor which could lead to unsafe consequences. In this
work, we focus on camera-based systems and propose GhostImage attacks, with the
goal of either creating a fake perceived object or obfuscating the object's
image that leads to wrong classification results. This is achieved by remotely
projecting adversarial patterns into camera-perceived images, exploiting two
common effects in optical imaging systems, namely lens flare/ghost effects, and
auto-exposure control. To improve the robustness of the attack to channel
perturbations, we generate optimal input patterns by integrating adversarial
machine learning techniques with a trained end-to-end channel model. We realize
GhostImage attacks with a projector, and conducted comprehensive experiments,
using three different image datasets, in indoor and outdoor environments, and
three different cameras. We demonstrate that GhostImage attacks are applicable
to both autonomous driving and security surveillance scenarios. Experiment
results show that, depending on the projector-camera distance, attack success
rates can reach as high as 100%.

  Port Knocking is a method for authenticating clients through a closed stance
firewall, and authorising their requested actions, enabling severs to offer
services to authenticated clients, without opening ports on the firewall.
Advances in port knocking have resulted in an increase in complexity in design,
preventing port knocking solutions from realising their potential. This paper
proposes a novel port knocking solution, named Crucible, which is a secure
method of authentication, with high usability and features of stealth, allowing
servers and services to remain hidden and protected. Crucible is a stateless
solution, only requiring the client memorise a command, the server's IP and a
chosen password. The solution is forwarded as a method for protecting servers
against attacks ranging from port scans, to zero-day exploitation. To act as a
random oracle for both client and server, cryptographic hashes were generated
through chaotic systems.

Title: Preventive and Reactive Cyber Defense Dynamics with Ergodic

Authors: Yujuan Han, Wenlian Lu, Shouhuai Xu
Categories: cs.CR cs.SI math.DS
\\
  Cybersecurity dynamics is a mathematical approach to modeling and analyzing
cyber attack-defense interactions in networks. In this paper, we advance the
state-of-the-art in characterizing one kind of cybersecurity dynamics, known as
preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics, which is a family of highly
nonlinear system models. We prove that this dynamics in its general form with
time-dependent parameters is globally attractive when the time-dependent
parameters are ergodic, and is (almost) periodic when the time-dependent
parameters have the stronger properties of being (almost) periodic. Our results
supersede the state-of-the-art ones, including that the same type of dynamics
but with time-independent parameters is globally convergent.

  We surveyed and presented the state-of-the-art VC systems, security and
privacy architectures and technologies, emphasizing on security and privacy
challenges and their solutions for P2P interactions in VSNs towards
standardization and deployment. We note that beyond safety applications that
have drawn a lot of attention in VC systems, there is significant and rising
interest in vehicle-to-vehicle interaction for a range of transportation
efficiency and infotainment applications, notably LBS as well as a gamut of
services by mobile providers. While this enriches the VC systems and the user
experience, security and privacy concerns are also intensified. This is
especially so, considering (i) the privacy risk from the exposure of the users
to the service providers, and (ii) the security risk from the interaction with
malicious or selfish and thus misbehaving users or infrastructure. We showed
existing solutions can in fact evolve and address the VSN-specific challenges,
and improve or even accelerate the adoption of VSN applications.

\\
  With the development of IoT technologies in the past few years, a wide range
of smart devices are deployed in a variety of environments aiming to improve
the quality of human life in a cost efficient way. Due to the increasingly
serious aging problem around the world, smart homes for elder healthcare have
become an important IoT-based application, which not only enables elders'
health to be properly monitored and taken care of, but also allows them to live
more comfortably and independently in their houses. However, elders' privacy
might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network
communication. To show that elders' privacy could be substantially exposed, in
this paper we develop a Privacy Deduction Scheme (PDS for short) by
eavesdropping sensor traffic from a smart home to identify elders' movement
activities and speculating sensor locations in the smart home based on a series
of deductions from the viewpoint of an attacker. The experimental results based
on sensor datasets from real smart homes demonstrate the effectiveness of PDS
in deducing and disclosing elders' privacy, which might be maliciously
exploited by attackers to endanger elders and their properties.

Title: You foot the bill! Attacking NFC with passive relays
Authors: Yuyi Sun, Swarun Kumar, Shibo He, Jiming Chen, and Zhiguo Shi
Categories: cs.CR eess.SP
\\
  Imagine when you line up in a store, the person in front of you can make you
pay her bill by using a passive wearable device that forces a scan of your
credit card without your awareness. An important assumption of today's
Near-field Communication (NFC) enabled cards is the limited communication range
between the commercial reader and the NFC cards -- a distance below 5~cm.
Previous approaches to attacking this assumption effectively use mobile phones
and active relays to enlarge the communication range, in order to attack the
NFC cards. However, these approaches require a power supply at the adversary
side, and can be easily localized when mobile phones or active relays transmit
NFC signals.
  We propose ReCoil, a system that uses wearable passive relays to attack NFC
cards by expanding the communication range to 49.6 centimeters, a ten-fold
improvement over its intended commercial distance. ReCoil is a magnetically
coupled resonant wireless power transfer system, which optimizes the energy
transfer by searching the optimal geometry parameters. Specifically, we first
narrow down the feasible area reasonably and design the ReCoil-Ant Colony
Algorithm such that the relays absorb the maximum energy from the reader. In
order to reroute the signal to pass over the surface of human body, we then
design a half waist band by carefully analyzing the impact of the distance and
orientation between two coils on the mutual inductance. Then, three more coils
are added to the system to keep enlarging the communication range. Finally,
extensive experiment results validate our analysis, showing that our passive
relays composed of common copper wires and tunable capacitors expand the range
of NFC attacks to 49.6 centimeters.

Title: Anchoring the value of Cryptocurrency

  Engineering. Western University. London, Canada, February 18, 2020
\\
  A decade long thrive of cryptocurrency has shown its potential as a source of
alternative-finance and the security and the robustness of the underpinning
blockchain technology.
  However, most cryptocurrencies fail to show inimitability and their meanings
in the real world. As a result, they usually start off as favourites but
quickly become the outcasts of the digital asset market.
  The blockchain society attempts to anchor the value of cryptocurrency with
real values by employing smart contracts and link it with computation resources
and the digital-productivity that have value and demands in the real world. But
their attempts have some undesirable effects due to a limited number of
practical applications. This limitation is caused by the dilemma between high
performance and decentralisation (universal joinability). The emerging of
blockchain sharding models, however, has offered a possible solution to address
this dilemma.
  In this paper, we explore a financial model for blockchain sharding that will
build an active link between the value of cryptocurrency and computation
resources as well as the market and labour behaviours. Our model can adjust the
price of resources and the compensation for maintaining a system based on those
behaviours. We anchor the value of cryptocurrency by the amount of computation
resources participated in and give the cryptocurrency a meaning as the exchange
between computation resources globally. Finally, we present a working example
which, through financial regularities, regulates the behaviour of anonymous
participants, also incents/discourages participation dynamically.

Title: Live Anomaly Detection based on Machine Learning Techniques SAD-F: Spark
  Based Anomaly Detection Framework
Authors: Awais Ahmed, Sufian Hameed, Muhammad Rafi, Qublai Khan Ali Mirza
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Anomaly detection is a crucial step for preventing malicious activities in
the network and keeping resources available all the time for legitimate users.
It is noticed from various studies that classical anomaly detectors work well
with small and sampled data, but the chances of failures increase with
real-time (non-sampled data) traffic data. In this paper, we will be exploring
security analytic techniques for DDoS anomaly detection using different machine
learning techniques. In this paper, we are proposing a novel approach which
deals with real traffic as input to the system. Further, we study and compare
the performance factor of our proposed framework on three different testbeds
including normal commodity hardware, low-end system, and high-end system.
Hardware details of testbeds are discussed in the respective section. Further
in this paper, we investigate the performance of the classifiers in (near)
real-time detection of anomalies attacks. This study also focused on the
feature selection process that is as important for the anomaly detection
process as it is for general modeling problems. Several techniques have been
studied for feature selection and it is observed that proper feature selection
can increase performance in terms of model's execution time - which totally
depends upon the traffic file or traffic capturing process.

  Weight pruning has been widely acknowledged as a straightforward and
effective method to eliminate redundancy in Deep Neural Networks (DNN), thereby
achieving acceleration on various platforms. However, most of the pruning
techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity
which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration
performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension,
namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity,
and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully
designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently
achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on
different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework
also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and
connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the
new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly
efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first time that mobile devices achieve real-time inference for the
large-scale DNN models thanks to the unique spatial property of pattern-based
sparsity and the help of the code generation capability of compilers.

  The EmoPain 2020 Challenge is the first international competition aimed at
creating a uniform platform for the comparison of machine learning and
multimedia processing methods of automatic chronic pain assessment from human
expressive behaviour, and also the identification of pain-related behaviours.
The objective of the challenge is to promote research in the development of
assistive technologies that help improve the quality of life for people with
chronic pain via real-time monitoring and feedback to help manage their
condition and remain physically active. The challenge also aims to encourage
the use of the relatively underutilised, albeit vital bodily expression signals
for automatic pain and pain-related emotion recognition. This paper presents a
description of the challenge, competition guidelines, bench-marking dataset,
and the baseline systems' architecture and performance on the three sub-tasks:
pain estimation from facial expressions, pain recognition from multimodal
movement, and protective movement behaviour detection.

  In this study, a perceptually hidden object-recognition method is
investigated to generate secure images recognizable by humans but not machines.
Hence, both the perceptual information hiding and the corresponding object
recognition methods should be developed. Block-wise image scrambling is
introduced to hide perceptual information from a third party. In addition, an
adaptation network is proposed to recognize those scrambled images.
Experimental comparisons conducted using CIFAR datasets demonstrated that the
proposed adaptation network performed well in incorporating simple perceptual
information hiding into DNN-based image classification.

Title: Adaptive Loss Function for Super Resolution Neural Networks Using Convex
  Optimization Techniques
Authors: Seyed Mehdi Ayyoubzadeh, Xiaolin Wu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) task refers to learn a mapping from
low-resolution images to the corresponding high-resolution ones. This task is
known to be extremely difficult since it is an ill-posed problem. Recently,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state of the art performance
on SISR. However, the images produced by CNNs do not contain fine details of
the images. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) aim to solve this issue and
recover sharp details. Nevertheless, GANs are notoriously difficult to train.
Besides that, they generate artifacts in the high-resolution images. In this
paper, we have proposed a method in which CNNs try to align images in different
spaces rather than only the pixel space. Such a space is designed using convex
optimization techniques. CNNs are encouraged to learn high-frequency components
of the images as well as low-frequency components. We have shown that the
proposed method can recover fine details of the images and it is stable in the
training process.

\\
  Acquiring large-scale medical image data, necessary for training machine
learning algorithms, is frequently intractable, due to prohibitive
expert-driven annotation costs. Recent datasets extracted from hospital
archives, e.g., DeepLesion, have begun to address this problem. However, these
are often incompletely or noisily labeled, e.g., DeepLesion leaves over 50% of
its lesions unlabeled. Thus, effective methods to harvest missing annotations
are critical for continued progress in medical image analysis. This is the goal
of our work, where we develop a powerful system to harvest missing lesions from
the DeepLesion dataset at high precision. Accepting the need for some degree of
expert labor to achieve high fidelity, we exploit a small fully-labeled subset
of medical image volumes and use it to intelligently mine annotations from the
remainder. To do this, we chain together a highly sensitive lesion proposal
generator and a very selective lesion proposal classifier. While our framework
is generic, we optimize our performance by proposing a 3D contextual lesion
proposal generator and by using a multi-view multi-scale lesion proposal
classifier. These produce harvested and hard-negative proposals, which we then
re-use to finetune our proposal generator by using a novel hard negative
suppression loss, continuing this process until no extra lesions are found.
Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates that our method can harvest an
additional 9,805 lesions while keeping precision above 90%. To demonstrate the
benefits of our approach, we show that lesion detectors trained on our
harvested lesions can significantly outperform the same variants only trained
on the original annotations, with boost of average precision of 7% to 10%. We
open source our code and annotations at

Title: Deep Depth Prior for Multi-View Stereo
Authors: Pallabi Ghosh, Vibhav Vineet, Larry S. Davis, Abhinav Shrivastava,
  Sudipta Sinha, Neel Joshi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  It was recently shown that the structure of convolutional neural networks
induces a strong prior favoring natural color images, a phenomena referred to
as a deep image prior (DIP), which can be an effective regularizer in inverse
problems such as image denoising, inpainting etc. In this paper, we investigate
a similar idea for depth images, which we call a deep depth prior.
Specifically, given a color image and a noisy and incomplete target depth map
from the same viewpoint, we optimize a randomly initialized CNN model to
reconstruct an RGB-D image where the depth channel gets restored by virtue of
using the network structure as a prior. We propose using deep depth priors for
refining and inpainting noisy depth maps within a multi-view stereo pipeline.
We optimize the network parameters to minimize two losses 1) a RGB-D
reconstruction loss based on the noisy depth map and 2) a multi-view
photoconsistency-based loss, which is computed using images from a
geometrically calibrated camera from nearby viewpoints. Our quantitative and
qualitative evaluation shows that our refined depth maps are more accurate and
complete, and after fusion, produces dense 3D models of higher quality.

Title: Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization Using Deep Metric
  Learning
Authors: Ashraful Islam, Richard J. Radke
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: accepted to WACV 2020
\\
  Temporal action localization is an important step towards video
understanding. Most current action localization methods depend on untrimmed
videos with full temporal annotations of action instances. However, it is
expensive and time-consuming to annotate both action labels and temporal
boundaries of videos. To this end, we propose a weakly supervised temporal
action localization method that only requires video-level action instances as
supervision during training. We propose a classification module to generate
action labels for each segment in the video, and a deep metric learning module
to learn the similarity between different action instances. We jointly optimize
a balanced binary cross-entropy loss and a metric loss using a standard
backpropagation algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of both of these components in temporal localization. We evaluate our algorithm
on two challenging untrimmed video datasets: THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2. Our
approach improves the current state-of-the-art result for THUMOS14 by 6.5% mAP
at IoU threshold 0.5, and achieves competitive performance for ActivityNet1.2.

Title: Scientific Image Tampering Detection Based On Noise Inconsistencies: A
  Method And Datasets
Authors: Ziyue Xiang, Daniel Acuna
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Scientific image tampering is a problem that affects not only authors but
also the general perception of the research community. Although previous
researchers have developed methods to identify tampering in natural images,
these methods may not thrive under the scientific setting as scientific images
have different statistics, format, quality, and intentions. Therefore, we
propose a scientific-image specific tampering detection method based on noise
inconsistencies, which is capable of learning and generalizing to different
fields of science. We train and test our method on a new dataset of manipulated
western blot and microscopy imagery, which aims at emulating problematic images
in science. The test results show that our method can detect various types of
image manipulation in different scenarios robustly, and it outperforms existing
general-purpose image tampering detection schemes. We discuss applications
beyond these two types of images and suggest next steps for making detection of
problematic images a systematic step in peer review and science in general.

DOI: 10.1007/s13319-014-0014-7
\\
  We propose a hybrid method for stereo disparity estimation by combining block
and region-based stereo matching approaches. It generates dense depth maps from
disparity measurements of only 18 % image pixels (left or right). The
methodology involves segmenting pixel lightness values using fast K-Means
implementation, refining segment boundaries using morphological filtering and
connected components analysis; then determining boundaries' disparities using
sum of absolute differences (SAD) cost function. Complete disparity maps are
reconstructed from boundaries' disparities. We consider an application of our
method for depth-based selective blurring of non-interest regions of stereo
images, using Gaussian blur to de-focus users' non-interest regions.
Experiments on Middlebury dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms
traditional disparity estimation approaches using SAD and normalized cross
correlation by up to 33.6 % and some recent methods by up to 6.1 %. Further,
our method is highly parallelizable using CPU and GPU framework based on Java
Thread Pool and APARAPI with speed-up of 5.8 for 250 stereo video frames (4,096
x 2,304).

Title: LRF-Net: Learning Local Reference Frames for 3D Local Shape Description
  and Matching
Authors: Angfan Zhu, Jiaqi Yang, Chen Zhao, Ke Xian, Zhiguo Cao and Xin Li
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 7 pages, 9 figures
\\
  The local reference frame (LRF) acts as a critical role in 3D local shape
description and matching. However, most of existing LRFs are hand-crafted and
suffer from limited repeatability and robustness. This paper presents the first
attempt to learn an LRF via a Siamese network that needs weak supervision only.
In particular, we argue that each neighboring point in the local surface gives
a unique contribution to LRF construction and measure such contributions via
learned weights. Extensive analysis and comparative experiments on three public
datasets addressing different application scenarios have demonstrated that
LRF-Net is more repeatable and robust than several state-of-the-art LRF methods
(LRF-Net is only trained on one dataset). In addition, LRF-Net can
significantly boost the local shape description and 6-DoF pose estimation
performance when matching 3D point clouds.

Title: M^2 Deep-ID: A Novel Model for Multi-View Face Identification Using
  Convolutional Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Sara Shahsavarani, Morteza Analoui and Reza Shoja Ghiass
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Despite significant advances in Deep Face Recognition (DFR) systems,
introducing new DFRs under specific constraints such as varying pose still
remains a big challenge. Most particularly, due to the 3D nature of a human
head, facial appearance of the same subject introduces a high intra-class
variability when projected to the camera image plane. In this paper, we propose
a new multi-view Deep Face Recognition (MVDFR) system to address the mentioned
challenge. In this context, multiple 2D images of each subject under different
views are fed into the proposed deep neural network with a unique design to
re-express the facial features in a single and more compact face descriptor,
which in turn, produces a more informative and abstract way for face
identification using convolutional neural networks. To extend the functionality
of our proposed system to multi-view facial images, the golden standard Deep-ID
model is modified in our proposed model. The experimental results indicate that
our proposed method yields a 99.8% accuracy, while the state-of-the-art method
achieves a 97% accuracy. We also gathered the Iran University of Science and
Technology (IUST) face database with 6552 images of 504 subjects to accomplish
our experiments.

Title: Curvature Regularized Surface Reconstruction from Point Cloud
Authors: Yuchen He, Sung Ha Kang, Hao Liu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 22 pages, 15 figures
MSC-class: 65D18
\\
  We propose a variational functional and fast algorithms to reconstruct
implicit surface from point cloud data with a curvature constraint. The
minimizing functional balances the distance function from the point cloud and
the mean curvature term. Only the point location is used, without any local
normal or curvature estimation at each point. With the added curvature
constraint, the computation becomes particularly challenging. To enhance the
computational efficiency, we solve the problem by a novel operator splitting
scheme. It replaces the original high-order PDEs by a decoupled PDE system,
which is solved by a semi-implicit method. We also discuss approach using an
augmented Lagrangian method. The proposed method shows robustness against
noise, and recovers concave features and sharp corners better compared to
models without curvature constraint. Numerical experiments in two and three
dimensional data sets, noisy and sparse data are presented to validate the
model.

Title: Partially-Shared Variational Auto-encoders for Unsupervised Domain
  Adaptation with Target Shift
Authors: Ryuhei Takahashi, Masaaki Iiyama, Atsushi Hashimoto, Motoharu
  Sonogashira
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
with target shift. Target shift is a problem of mismatch in label distribution
between source and target domains. Typically it appears as class-imbalance in
target domain. In practice, this is an important problem in UDA; as we do not
know labels in target domain datasets, we do not know whether or not its
distribution is identical to that in the source domain dataset. Many
traditional approaches achieve UDA with distribution matching by minimizing
mean maximum discrepancy or adversarial training; however these approaches
implicitly assume a coincidence in the distributions and do not work under
situations with target shift. Some recent UDA approaches focus on class
boundary and some of them are robust to target shift, but they are only
applicable to classification and not to regression.
  To overcome the target shift problem in UDA, the proposed method, partially
shared variational autoencoders (PS-VAEs), uses pair-wise feature alignment
instead of feature distribution matching. PS-VAEs inter-convert domain of each
sample by a CycleGAN-based architecture while preserving its label-related
content. To evaluate the performance of PS-VAEs, we carried out two
experiments: UDA with class-unbalanced digits datasets (classification), and
UDA from synthesized data to real observation in human-pose-estimation
(regression). The proposed method presented its robustness against the
class-imbalance in the classification task, and outperformed the other methods
in the regression task with a large margin.

\\
  Statistical shape models (SSMs) are state-of-the-art medical image analysis
tools for extracting and explaining features across a set of biological
structures. However, a principled and robust way to combine shape and pose
features has been illusive due to three main issues: 1) Non-homogeneity of the
data (data with linear and non-linear natural variation across features), 2)
non-optimal representation of the $3D$ motion (rigid transformation
representations that are not proportional to the kinetic energy that move an
object from one position to the other), and 3) artificial discretization of the
models. In this paper, we propose a new framework for dynamic multi-object
statistical modelling framework for the analysis of human joints in a
continuous domain. Specifically, we propose to normalise shape and dynamic
spatial features in the same linearized statistical space permitting the use of
linear statistics; we adopt an optimal 3D motion representation for more
accurate rigid transformation comparisons; and we provide a 3D shape and pose
prediction protocol using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling-based fitting.
The framework affords an efficient generative dynamic multi-object modelling
platform for biological joints. We validate the framework using a controlled
synthetic data. Finally, the framework is applied to an analysis of the human
shoulder joint to compare its performance with standard SSM approaches in
prediction of shape while adding the advantage of determining relative pose
between bones in a complex. Excellent validity is observed and the shoulder
joint shape-pose prediction results suggest that the novel framework may have
utility for a range of medical image analysis applications. Furthermore, the
framework is generic and can be extended to n$>$2 objects, making it suitable
for clinical and diagnostic methods for the management of joint disorders.

Title: Optimized Generic Feature Learning for Few-shot Classification across
  Domains
Authors: Tonmoy Saikia, Thomas Brox, Cordelia Schmid
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  To learn models or features that generalize across tasks and domains is one
of the grand goals of machine learning. In this paper, we propose to use
cross-domain, cross-task data as validation objective for hyper-parameter
optimization (HPO) to improve on this goal. Given a rich enough search space,
optimization of hyper-parameters learn features that maximize validation
performance and, due to the objective, generalize across tasks and domains. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy on few-shot image classification
within and across domains. The learned features outperform all previous
few-shot and meta-learning approaches.

Title: A Fixation-based 360{\deg} Benchmark Dataset for Salient Object
  Detection
Authors: Yi Zhang, Lu Zhang, Wassim Hamidouche, Olivier Deforges
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Fixation prediction (FP) in panoramic contents has been widely investigated
along with the booming trend of virtual reality (VR) applications. However,
another issue within the field of visual saliency, salient object detection
(SOD), has been seldom explored in 360{\deg} (or omnidirectional) images due to
the lack of datasets representative of real scenes with pixel-level
annotations. Toward this end, we collect 107 equirectangular panoramas with
challenging scenes and multiple object classes. Based on the consistency
between FP and explicit saliency judgements, we further manually annotate 1,165
salient objects over the collected images with precise masks under the guidance
of real human eye fixation maps. Six state-of-the-art SOD models are then
benchmarked on the proposed fixation-based 360{\deg} image dataset (F-360iSOD),
by applying a multiple cubic projection-based fine-tuning method. Experimental
results show a limitation of the current methods when used for SOD in panoramic
images, which indicates the proposed dataset is challenging. Key issues for
360{\deg} SOD is also discussed. The proposed dataset is available at
https://github.com/Panorama-Bill/F-360iSOD.

  In this paper, we introduce a new vision-language pre-trained model --

Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Object Classification (MOC), Masked Region
Feature Regression (MRFR), and Image Text Matching (ITM). To further enhance
the pre-training quality, we have collected a Large-scale weAk-supervised
Image-Text (LAIT) dataset from Web. We first pre-train the model on this
dataset, then conduct a second stage pre-training on Conceptual Captions and
SBU Captions. Our experiments show that multi-stage pre-training strategy
outperforms single-stage pre-training. We also fine-tune and evaluate our

achieve new state-of-the-art results on both MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets.

Title: ResDepth: Learned Residual Stereo Reconstruction
Authors: Corinne Stucker and Konrad Schindler
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose an embarrassingly simple, but very effective scheme for
high-quality dense stereo reconstruction: (i) generate an approximate
reconstruction with your favourite stereo matcher; (ii) rewarp the input images
with that approximate model; and (iii) with the initial reconstruction and the
warped images as input, train a deep network to enhance the reconstruction by
regressing a residual correction. The strategy to only learn the residual
greatly simplifies the learning problem. A standard Unet without bells and
whistles is enough to reconstruct even small surface details, like dormers and
roof substructures in satellite images. We also investigate residual
reconstruction with less information and find that even a single image is
enough to greatly improve an approximate reconstruction. Our full model reduces
the mean absolute error of state-of-the-art stereo reconstruction systems by
>50%, both in our target domain of satellite stereo and on stereo pairs from
the ETH3D benchmark.

  Vision based human pose estimation is an non-invasive technology for
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Direct use of the hand as an input device
provides an attractive interaction method, with no need for specialized sensing
equipment, such as exoskeletons, gloves etc, but a camera. Traditionally, HCI

of vision based human pose estimation algorithms can give a breath of
innovation to these applications. In this letter, we present a novel

Title: Depthwise Non-local Module for Fast Salient Object Detection Using a
  Single Thread
Authors: Haofeng Li, Guanbin Li, Binbin Yang, Guanqi Chen, Liang Lin, Yizhou Yu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted as a regular paper in the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics
\\
  Recently deep convolutional neural networks have achieved significant success
in salient object detection. However, existing state-of-the-art methods require
high-end GPUs to achieve real-time performance, which makes them hard to adapt
to low-cost or portable devices. Although generic network architectures have
been proposed to speed up inference on mobile devices, they are tailored to the
task of image classification or semantic segmentation, and struggle to capture
intra-channel and inter-channel correlations that are essential for contrast
modeling in salient object detection. Motivated by the above observations, we
design a new deep learning algorithm for fast salient object detection. The
proposed algorithm for the first time achieves competitive accuracy and high
inference efficiency simultaneously with a single CPU thread. Specifically, we
propose a novel depthwise non-local moudule (DNL), which implicitly models
contrast via harvesting intra-channel and inter-channel correlations in a
self-attention manner. In addition, we introduce a depthwise non-local network
architecture that incorporates both depthwise non-local modules and inverted
residual blocks. Experimental results show that our proposed network attains
very competitive accuracy on a wide range of salient object detection datasets
while achieving state-of-the-art efficiency among all existing deep learning
based algorithms.

Title: UniPose: Unified Human Pose Estimation in Single Images and Videos
Authors: Bruno Artacho and Andreas Savakis
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose UniPose, a unified framework for human pose estimation, based on
our "Waterfall" Atrous Spatial Pooling architecture, that achieves
state-of-art-results on several pose estimation metrics. Current pose
estimation methods utilizing standard CNN architectures heavily rely on
statistical postprocessing or predefined anchor poses for joint localization.
UniPose incorporates contextual segmentation and joint localization to estimate
the human pose in a single stage, with high accuracy, without relying on
statistical postprocessing methods. The Waterfall module in UniPose leverages
the efficiency of progressive filtering in the cascade architecture, while
maintaining multi-scale fields-of-view comparable to spatial pyramid
configurations. Additionally, our method is extended to UniPose-LSTM for
multi-frame processing and achieves state-of-the-art results for temporal pose
estimation in Video. Our results on multiple datasets demonstrate that UniPose,
with a ResNet backbone and Waterfall module, is a robust and efficient
architecture for pose estimation obtaining state-of-the-art results in single
person pose detection for both single images and videos.

  This paper is about reducing the cost of building good large-scale 3D
reconstructions post-hoc. We render 2D views of an existing reconstruction and
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that refines inverse-depth to match
a higher-quality reconstruction. Since the views that we correct are rendered
from the same reconstruction, they share the same geometry, so overlapping
views complement each other. We take advantage of that in two ways. Firstly, we
impose a loss during training which guides predictions on neighbouring views to
have the same geometry and has been shown to improve performance. Secondly, in
contrast to previous work, which corrects each view independently, we also make
predictions on sets of neighbouring views jointly. This is achieved by warping
feature maps between views and thus bypassing memory-intensive 3D computation.
We make the observation that features in the feature maps are
viewpoint-dependent, and propose a method for transforming features with
dynamic filters generated by a multi-layer perceptron from the relative poses
between views. In our experiments we show that this last step is necessary for
successfully fusing feature maps between views.

Title: Are Accelerometers for Activity Recognition a Dead-end?
Authors: Catherine Tong, Shyam A. Tailor, Nicholas D. Lane
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Accelerometer-based (and by extension other inertial sensors) research for
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a dead-end. This sensor does not offer
enough information for us to progress in the core domain of HAR---to recognize
everyday activities from sensor data. Despite continued and prolonged efforts
in improving feature engineering and machine learning models, the activities
that we can recognize reliably have only expanded slightly and many of the same
flaws of early models are still present today. Instead of relying on
acceleration data, we should instead consider modalities with much richer
information---a logical choice are images. With the rapid advance in image
sensing hardware and modelling techniques, we believe that a widespread
adoption of image sensors will open many opportunities for accurate and robust
inference across a wide spectrum of human activities.
  In this paper, we make the case for imagers in place of accelerometers as the
default sensor for human activity recognition. Our review of past works has led
to the observation that progress in HAR had stalled, caused by our reliance on
accelerometers. We further argue for the suitability of images for activity
recognition by illustrating their richness of information and the marked
progress in computer vision. Through a feasibility analysis, we find that
deploying imagers and CNNs on device poses no substantial burden on modern
mobile hardware. Overall, our work highlights the need to move away from
accelerometers and calls for further exploration of using imagers for activity
recognition.

\\
  Human brain development is a complex and dynamic process that is affected by
several factors such as genetics, sex hormones, and environmental changes. A
number of recent studies on brain development have examined functional
connectivity (FC) defined by the temporal correlation between time series of
different brain regions. We propose to add the directional flow of information
during brain maturation. To do so, we extract effective connectivity (EC)
through Granger causality (GC) for two different groups of subjects, i.e.,
children and young adults. The motivation is that the inclusion of causal
interaction may further discriminate brain connections between two age groups
and help to discover new connections between brain regions. The contributions
of this study are threefold. First, there has been a lack of attention to
EC-based feature extraction in the context of brain development. To this end,
we propose a new kernel-based GC (KGC) method to learn nonlinearity of complex
brain network, where a reduced Sine hyperbolic polynomial (RSP) neural network
was used as our proposed learner. Second, we used causality values as the
weight for the directional connectivity between brain regions. Our findings
indicated that the strength of connections was significantly higher in young
adults relative to children. In addition, our new EC-based feature outperformed
FC-based analysis from Philadelphia neurocohort (PNC) study with better
discrimination of the different age groups. Moreover, the fusion of these two
sets of features (FC + EC) improved brain age prediction accuracy by more than
4%, indicating that they should be used together for brain development studies.

Title: Discovering Salient Anatomical Landmarks by Predicting Human Gaze

\\
  Anatomical landmarks are a crucial prerequisite for many medical imaging
tasks. Usually, the set of landmarks for a given task is predefined by experts.
The landmark locations for a given image are then annotated manually or via
machine learning methods trained on manual annotations. In this paper, in
contrast, we present a method to automatically discover and localize anatomical
landmarks in medical images. Specifically, we consider landmarks that attract
the visual attention of humans, which we term visually salient landmarks. We
illustrate the method for fetal neurosonographic images. First, full-length
clinical fetal ultrasound scans are recorded with live sonographer
gaze-tracking. Next, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to predict
the gaze point distribution (saliency map) of the sonographers on scan video
frames. The CNN is then used to predict saliency maps of unseen fetal
neurosonographic images, and the landmarks are extracted as the local maxima of
these saliency maps. Finally, the landmarks are matched across images by
clustering the landmark CNN features. We show that the discovered landmarks can
be used within affine image registration, with average landmark alignment
errors between 4.1% and 10.9% of the fetal head long axis length.

Title: Automatic phantom test pattern classification through transfer learning
  with deep neural networks
Authors: Rafael B. Fricks, Justin Solomon, Ehsan Samei
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE physics.med-ph
\\
  Imaging phantoms are test patterns used to measure image quality in computer
tomography (CT) systems. A new phantom platform (Mercury Phantom, Gammex)
provides test patterns for estimating the task transfer function (TTF) or noise
power spectrum (NPF) and simulates different patient sizes. Determining which
image slices are suitable for analysis currently requires manual annotation of
these patterns by an expert, as subtle defects may make an image unsuitable for
measurement. We propose a method of automatically classifying these test
patterns in a series of phantom images using deep learning techniques. By
adapting a convolutional neural network based on the VGG19 architecture with
weights trained on ImageNet, we use transfer learning to produce a classifier
for this domain. The classifier is trained and evaluated with over 3,500
phantom images acquired at a university medical center. Input channels for
color images are successfully adapted to convey contextual information for
phantom images. A series of ablation studies are employed to verify design
aspects of the classifier and evaluate its performance under varying training
conditions. Our solution makes extensive use of image augmentation to produce a
classifier that accurately classifies typical phantom images with 98% accuracy,
while maintaining as much as 86% accuracy when the phantom is improperly
imaged.

Title: RDAnet: A Deep Learning Based Approach for Synthetic Aperture Radar
  Image Formation

  Southern California Information Sciences Institute, Arlington VA)
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging systems operate by emitting radar
signals from a moving object, such as a satellite, towards the target of
interest. Reflected radar echoes are received and later used by image formation
algorithms to form a SAR image. There is great interest in using SAR images in
computer vision tasks such as automatic target recognition. Today, however, SAR
applications consist of multiple operations: image formation followed by image
processing. In this work, we show that deep learning can be used to train a
neural network able to form SAR images from echo data. Results show that our
neural network, RDAnet, can form SAR images comparable to images formed using a
traditional algorithm. This approach opens the possibility to end-to-end SAR
applications where image formation and image processing are integrated into a
single task. We believe that this work is the first demonstration of deep
learning based SAR image formation using real data.

Title: Fairness Metrics: A Comparative Analysis
Authors: Pratyush Garg, John Villasenor and Virginia Foggo
Categories: cs.CY
Comments: 10 pages. (preprint)
\\
  Algorithmic fairness is receiving significant attention in the academic and
broader literature due to the increasing use of predictive algorithms,
including those based on artificial intelligence. One benefit of this trend is
that algorithm designers and users have a growing set of fairness measures to
choose from. However, this choice comes with the challenge of identifying how
the different fairness measures relate to one another, as well as the extent to
which they are compatible or mutually exclusive. We describe some of the most
widely used fairness metrics using a common mathematical framework and present
new results on the relationships among them. The results presented herein can
help place both specialists and non-specialists in a better position to
identify the metric best suited for their application and goals.

\\
  The abundance of interconnected data has fueled the design and implementation
of graph generators reproducing real-world linking properties, or gauging the
effectiveness of graph algorithms, techniques and applications manipulating
these data. We consider graph generation across multiple subfields, such as
Semantic Web, graph databases, social networks, and community detection, along
with general graphs. Despite the disparate requirements of modern graph
generators throughout these communities, we analyze them under a common
umbrella, reaching out the functionalities, the practical usage, and their
supported operations. We argue that this classification is serving the need of
providing scientists, researchers and practitioners with the right data
generator at hand for their work. This survey provides a comprehensive overview
of the state-of-the-art graph generators by focusing on those that are
pertinent and suitable for several data-intensive tasks. Finally, we discuss
open challenges and missing requirements of current graph generators along with
their future extensions to new emerging fields.

\\
  The growing number of applications for distributed ledger technologies is
driving both industry and academia to solve the limitations of blockchain,
particularly its scalability issues. Recent distributed ledger technologies
have replaced the blockchain linear structure with a more flexible directed
acyclic graph in an attempt to accommodate a higher throughput. Despite the
fast-growing diffusion of directed acyclic graph based distributed ledger
technologies, researchers lack a basic understanding of their behavior. In this
paper we analyze the Tangle, a directed acyclic graph that is used (with
certain modifications) in various protocols such as IOTA, Byteball, Avalanche
or SPECTRE. Our contribution is threefold. First, we run simulations in a
continuous-time model to examine tip count stability and cumulative weight
evolution while varying the rate of incoming transactions. In particular we
confirm analytical predictions on the number of tips with uniform random tip
selection strategy. Second, we show how different tip selection algorithms
affect the growth of the Tangle. Moreover, we explain these differences by
analyzing the spread of exit probabilities of random walks. Our findings
confirm analytically derived predictions and provide novel insights on the
different phases of growth of cumulative weight as well as on the average time
difference for a transaction to receive its first approval when using distinct
tip selection algorithms. Lastly, we analyze simulation overhead and
performance as a function of Tangle size and compare results for different tip
selection algorithms.

  Modern interconnects offer remote direct memory access (RDMA) features. Yet,
most applications rely on explicit message passing for communications albeit
their unwanted overheads. The MPI-3.0 standard defines a programming interface
for exploiting RDMA networks directly, however, it's scalability and
practicability has to be demonstrated in practice. In this work, we develop
scalable bufferless protocols that implement the MPI-3.0 specification. Our
protocols support scaling to millions of cores with negligible memory
consumption while providing highest performance and minimal overheads. To arm
programmers, we provide a spectrum of performance models for all critical
functions and demonstrate the usability of our library and models with several
application studies with up to half a million processes. We show that our
design is comparable to, or better than UPC and Fortran Coarrays in terms of
latency, bandwidth, and message rate. We also demonstrate application
performance improvements with comparable programming complexity.

Title: A Simple and Efficient Binary Byzantine Consensus Algorithm using

Authors: Tyler Crain
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  This paper describes a simple and efficient Binary Byzantine faulty tolerant
consensus algorithm using a weak round coordinator and the partial synchrony
assumption to ensure liveness. In the algorithm, non-faulty nodes perform an
initial broadcast followed by a executing a series of rounds consisting of a
single message broadcast until termination. Each message is accompanied by a
cryptographic proof of its validity. In odd rounds the binary value 1 can be
decided, in even round 0. Up to one third of the nodes can be faulty and
termination is ensured within a number of round of a constant factor of the
number of faults. Experiments show termination can be reached in less than 200
milliseconds with 300 Amazon EC2 instances spread across 5 continents even with
partial initial disagreement.

Title: Tuneful: An Online Significance-Aware Configuration Tuner for Big Data
  Analytics
Authors: Ayat Fekry, Lucian Carata, Thomas Pasquier, Andrew Rice, Andy Hopper
Categories: cs.DC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Distributed analytics engines such as Spark are a common choice for
processing extremely large datasets. However, finding good configurations for
these systems remains challenging, with each workload potentially requiring a
different setup to run optimally. Using suboptimal configurations incurs
significant extra runtime costs. %Furthermore, Spark and similar platforms are
gaining traction within data-scientists communities where awareness of such
issues is relatively low.
  We propose Tuneful, an approach that efficiently tunes the configuration of
in-memory cluster computing systems. Tuneful combines incremental Sensitivity
Analysis and Bayesian optimization to identify near-optimal configurations from
a high-dimensional search space, using a small number of executions. This setup
allows the tuning to be done online, without any previous training. Our
experimental results show that Tuneful reduces the search time for finding
close-to-optimal configurations by 62\% (at the median) when compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques. This means that the amortization of the
tuning cost happens significantly faster, enabling practical tuning for new
classes of workloads.

  Organizations

Categories: cs.DL cs.SI physics.soc-ph
\\
  Understanding the structure of knowledge domains has been one of the
foundational challenges in the science of science. Although there have been a
series of studies on the self-organized structure of knowledge domains and
their relationships, creating rich, coherent, and quantitative representation
frameworks is still an open challenge. Meanwhile, neural embedding methods,
which learn continuous vector representations of entities by using neural
networks and contextual information, are emerging as a powerful representation
framework that can encode nuanced semantic relationships into geometric ones.
Here, we propose a neural embedding technique that leverages the information
contained in the paper citation network to obtain continuous representations of
scientific periodicals. We demonstrate that our embeddings encode nuanced
relationships between periodicals as well as the complex disciplinary structure
of science, even allowing us to make cross-disciplinary analogies between
periodicals. Furthermore, we show that the embeddings capture meaningful "axes"
that encompass all disciplines in the knowledge domains, such as an axis from
"soft" to "hard" sciences or from "social" to "biological" sciences, which
allow us to quantitatively ground a periodical on a given spectrum. Using this
new capacity, we test the hypothesis of the hierarchy of the sciences, showing
that, in most disciplines such as Social Sciences and Life Sciences, most
widely cited papers tend to appear in "harder" periodicals. Our framework may
offer novel quantification methods in science of science, which may in turn
facilitate the study of how knowledge is created and organized.

MSC-class: 90C09

\\
  As a first contribution the mTSP is solved using an exact method and two
heuristics, where the number of nodes per route is balanced. The first
heuristic uses a nearest node approach and the second assigns the closest
vehicle (salesman). A comparison of heuristics with test-instances being in the
Euclidean plane showed similar solution quality and runtime. On average, the
nearest node solutions are approximately one percent better. The closest
vehicle heuristic is especially important when the nodes (customers) are not
known in advance, e.g. for online routing. Whilst the nearest node is
preferable when one vehicle has to be used multiple times to service all
customers. The second contribution is a closed form formula that describes the
mTSP distance dependent on the number of vehicles and customers. Increasing the
number of salesman results in an approximately linear distance growth for
uniformly distributed nodes in a Euclidean grid plane. The distance growth is
almost proportional to the square root of number of customers (nodes). These
two insights are combined in a single formula. The minimum distance of a node
to $n$ uniformly distributed random (real and integer) points was derived and
expressed as functional relationship dependent on the number of vehicles. This
gives theoretical underpinnings and is in agreement with the distances found
via the previous mTSP heuristics. Hence, this allows to compute all expected
mTSP distances without the need of running the heuristics.

Title: Faster and Enhanced Inclusion-Minimal Cograph Completion
Authors: Christophe Crespelle, Daniel Lokshtanov, Thi Ha Duong Phan, Eric
  Thierry
Categories: cs.DS cs.DM
\\
  We design two incremental algorithms for computing an inclusion-minimal
completion of an arbitrary graph into a cograph. The first one is able to do so
while providing an additional property which is crucial in practice to obtain
inclusion-minimal completions using as few edges as possible : it is able to
compute a minimum-cardinality completion of the neighbourhood of the new vertex
introduced at each incremental step. It runs in $O(n+m')$ time, where $m'$ is
the number of edges in the completed graph. This matches the complexity of the
algorithm in [Lokshtanov, Mancini and Papadopoulos 2010] and positively answers
one of their open questions. Our second algorithm improves the complexity of
inclusion-minimal completion to $O(n+m\log^2 n)$ when the additional property
above is not required. Moreover, we prove that many very sparse graphs, having
only $O(n)$ edges, require $\Omega(n^2)$ edges in any of their cograph
completions. For these graphs, which include many of those encountered in
applications, the improvement we obtain on the complexity scales as $O(n/\log^2
n)$.

Title: Scheduling for Weighted Flow and Completion Times in Reconfigurable
  Networks
Authors: Michael Dinitz and Benjamin Moseley
Categories: cs.DS cs.NI
Comments: 10 pages. Appears in INFOCOM 2020
\\
  New optical technologies offer the ability to reconfigure network topologies
dynamically, rather than setting them once and for all. This is true in both
optical wide area networks (optical WANs) and in datacenters, despite the many
differences between these two settings. Because of these new technologies,
there has been a surge of both practical and theoretical research on algorithms
to take advantage of them. In particular, Jia et al. [INFOCOM '17] designed
online scheduling algorithms for dynamically reconfigurable topologies for both
the makespan and sum of completion times objectives. In this paper, we work in
the same setting but study an objective that is more meaningful in an online
setting: the sum of flow times. The flow time of a job is the total amount of
time that it spends in the system, which may be considerably smaller than its
completion time if it is released late. We provide competitive algorithms for
the online setting with speed augmentation, and also give a lower bound proving
that speed augmentation is in fact necessary. As a side effect of our
techniques, we also improve and generalize the results of Jia et al. on

Title: A Pseudopolynomial Algorithm to Minimize Maximum Lateness on Multiple
  Related Machines
Authors: Elbert Du, Stan Zhang
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 6 pages
\\
  In this paper, we will find a pseudopolynomial algorithm to solve $Qm \mid
\mid L_{\max}$ and then we will prove that it is impossible to get any
constant-factor approximation in polynomial time, and thus also impossible to
have a PTAS for this problem. We will also show that the the problem when we
don't assume a fixed number of machines, $P \mid \mid L_{\max}$, is strongly
NP-hard.

  Payments in online ad auctions are typically derived from click-through
rates, so that advertisers do not pay for ineffective ads. But advertisers
often care about more than just clicks. That is, for example, if they aim to
raise brand awareness or visibility. There is thus an opportunity to devise a
more effective ad pricing paradigm, in which ads are paid only if they are
actually noticed. This article contributes a novel auction format based on a
pay-per-attention (PPA) scheme. We show that the PPA auction inherits the
desirable properties (strategy-proofness and efficiency) as its
pay-per-impression and pay-per-click counterparts, and that it also compares
favourably in terms of revenues. To make the PPA format feasible, we also
contribute a scalable diagnostic technology to predict user attention to ads in
sponsored search using raw mouse cursor coordinates only, regardless of the
page content and structure. We use the user attention predictions in numerical
simulations to evaluate the PPA auction scheme. Our results show that, in
relevant economic settings, the PPA revenues would be strictly higher than the
existing auction payment schemes.

\\
  Motivated by uncertain parameters encountered in Markov decision processes
(MDPs) and stochastic games, we study the effect of parameter uncertainty on
Bellman operator-based algorithms under a set-based framework. Specifically, we
first consider a family of MDPs where the cost parameters are in a given
compact set; we then define a Bellman operator acting on a set of value
functions to produce a new set of value functions as the output under all
possible variations in the cost parameter. We prove the existence of a fixed
point of this set-based Bellman operator by showing that it is contractive on a
complete metric space, and explore its relationship with the corresponding
family of MDPs and stochastic games. Additionally, we show that given interval
set bounded cost parameters, we can form exact bounds on the set of optimal
value functions. Finally, we utilize our results to bound the value function
trajectory of a player in a stochastic game.

Title: Joint Wireless and Edge Computing Resource Management with Dynamic
  Network Slice Selection
Authors: Sla{\dj}ana Jo\v{s}ilo, Gy\"orgy D\'an
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Network slicing is a promising approach for enabling low latency computation
offloading in edge computing systems. In this paper, we consider an edge
computing system under network slicing in which the wireless devices generate
latency sensitive computational tasks. We address the problem of joint dynamic
assignment of computational tasks to slices, management of radio resources
across slices and management of radio and computing resources within slices. We
formulate the Joint Slice Selection and Edge Resource Management(JSS-ERM)
problem as a mixed-integer problem with the objective to minimize the
completion time of computational tasks. We show that the JSS-ERM problem is
NP-hard and develop an approximation algorithm with bounded approximation ratio
based on a game theoretic treatment of the problem. We provide extensive
simulation results to show that network slicing can improve the system
performance compared to no slicing and that the proposed solution can achieve
significant gains compared to the equal slicing policy. Our results also show
that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is approximately
linear in the number of devices.

\\
  In multi-objective multi-agent systems (MOMAS), agents explicitly consider
the possible tradeoffs between conflicting objective functions. We argue that
compromises between competing objectives in MOMAS should be analysed on the
basis of the utility that these compromises have for the users of a system,
where an agent's utility function maps their payoff vectors to scalar utility
values. This utility-based approach naturally leads to two different
optimisation criteria for agents in a MOMAS: expected scalarised returns (ESR)
and scalarised expected returns (SER). In this article, we explore the
differences between these two criteria using the framework of multi-objective
normal form games (MONFGs). We demonstrate that the choice of optimisation
criterion (ESR or SER) can radically alter the set of equilibria in a MONFG
when non-linear utility functions are used.

  The modulation of voice properties, such as pitch, volume, and speed, is
crucial for delivering a successful public speech. However, it is challenging
to master different voice modulation skills. Though many guidelines are
available, they are often not practical enough to be applied in different
public speaking situations, especially for novice speakers. We present
VoiceCoach, an interactive evidence-based approach to facilitate the effective
training of voice modulation skills. Specifically, we have analyzed the voice
modulation skills from 2623 high-quality speeches (i.e., TED Talks) and use
them as the benchmark dataset. Given a voice input, VoiceCoach automatically
recommends good voice modulation examples from the dataset based on the
similarity of both sentence structures and voice modulation skills. Immediate
and quantitative visual feedback is provided to guide further improvement. The
expert interviews and the user study provide support for the effectiveness and
usability of VoiceCoach.

  Climbing is a popular and growing sport, especially indoors, where climbers
can train on man-made routes using artificial holds. Both strength and good
technique is required to successfully reach the top of a climb, and often
coaches work to improve technique so less strength is required, enabling a
climber to ascent more difficult climbs.
  Various aspects of adding computer-interaction to climbing have been studied
in recent years, but there is a large space for research into lightweight tools
to aid recreational intermediate climbers, both with trickier climbs and to
improve their own technique.
  In this CS Masters final project, I explored which form of data-capture and
output-features could improve a climber's training, and analysed how climbers
responded to viewing their data throughout a climbing session, then conducted a
user-centred design to build a lightweight mobile application for intermediate
climbers. A variety of hardware and software solutions were explored, tested
and developed through series of surveys, discussions, wizard-of-oz studies and
prototyping, resulting in a system that most closely meets the needs of local
indoor boulderers given the project's time scope.
  This consists of an iteratively developed interactive mobile app that: can
record, graph, and score the acceleration of a climber, as both a training tool
and gamification incentive for good technique; can link a video recording to
the acceleration graph, to enable frame-by-frame inspection of weaknesses; is
fully approved and distributed on the Google play Store and currently being
regularly used by 15 local climbers. Then I conducted a final usability study,
comprising a thematic analysis of forty minutes's worth of interview
transcripts, to gain a deep understanding of the app's impact on the climbers
using it, along with its benefits and limitations.

Title: ClassCode: An Interactive Teaching and Learning Environment for
  Programming Education in Classrooms
Authors: Ryo Suzuki, Jun Kato, Koji Yatani
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Programming education is becoming important as demands on computer literacy
and coding skills are growing. Despite the increasing popularity of interactive
online learning systems, many programming courses in schools have not changed
their teaching format from the conventional classroom setting. We see two
research opportunities here. Students may have diverse expertise and experience
in programming. Thus, particular content and teaching speed can be disengaging
for experienced students or discouraging for novice learners. In a large
classroom, instructors cannot oversee the learning progress of each student,
and have difficulty matching teaching materials with the comprehension level of
individual students. We present ClassCode, a web-based environment tailored to
programming education in classrooms. Students can take online tutorials
prepared by instructors at their own pace. They can then deepen their
understandings by performing interactive coding exercises interleaved within
tutorials. ClassCode tracks all interactions by each student, and summarizes
them to instructors. This serves as a progress report, facilitating the
instructors to provide additional explanations in-situ or revise course
materials. Our user evaluation through a small lecture and expert review by
instructors and teaching assistants confirm the potential of ClassCode by
uncovering how it could address issues in existing programming courses at
universities.

important number of those reviews. Sentiment analysis afford detecting polarity
(positive, negative, neutral) in a expressed opinion and therefore classifying
those reviews. Our purpose is to determine the influence of emotions on the
polarity of books reviews. We define "bag-of-words" representation models of
reviews which use a lexicon containing emotional (anticipation, sadness, fear,
anger, joy, surprise, trust, disgust) and sentimental (positive, negative)
words. This lexicon afford measuring felt emotions types by readers. The
implemented supervised learning used is a Random Forest type. The application
concerns Amazon platform's reviews. Mots-cl{\'e}s : Analyse de sentiments,

Title: On the Performance of Quickest Detection Spectrum Sensing: The Case of
  Cumulative Sum

\\
  Quickest change detection (QCD) is a fundamental problem in many
applications. Given a sequence of measurements that exhibits two different
distributions around a certain flipping point, the goal is to detect the change
in distribution around the flipping point as quickly as possible. The QCD
problem appears in many practical applications, e.g., quality control, power
system line outage detection, spectrum reuse, and resource allocation and
scheduling. In this paper, we focus on spectrum sensing as our application
since it is a critical process for proper functionality of cognitive radio
networks. Relying on the cumulative sum (CUSUM), we derive the probability of
detection and the probability of false alarm of CUSUM based spectrum sensing.
We show the correctness of our derivations using numerical simulations.

Title: Construction of Rate (n-1)/n Non-Binary LDPC Convolutional Codes via
  Difference Triangle Sets
Authors: Gianira N. Alfarano and Julia Lieb and Joachim Rosenthal
Categories: cs.IT math.CO math.IT
Comments: The paper was submitted to ISIT 2020
\\
  This paper provides a construction of non-binary LDPC convolutional codes,
which generalizes the work of Robinson and Bernstein. The sets of integers
forming an $(n-1,w)$-difference triangle set are used as supports of the
columns of rate $(n-1)/n$ convolutional codes. If the field size is large
enough, the Tanner graph associated to the sliding parity-check matrix of the
code is free from $4$ and $6$-cycles not satisfying the full rank condition.
This is important for improving the performance of a code and avoiding the
presence of low-weight codewords and absorbing sets. The parameters of the
convolutional code are shown to be determined by the parameters of the
underlying difference triangle set. In particular, the free distance of the
code is related to $w$ and the degree of the code is linked to the "scope" of
the difference triangle set. Hence, the problem of finding families of
difference triangle set with minimum scope is equivalent to find convolutional
codes with small degree.

Title: Optimal Multistage Group Testing Algorithm for 3 Defectives
Authors: Ilya Vorobyev
Categories: cs.IT math.CO math.IT
Comments: 8 pages
MSC-class: 68R05
\\
  Group testing is a well-known search problem that consists in detecting of
$s$ defective members of a set of $t$ samples by carrying out tests on properly
chosen subsets of samples. In classical group testing the goal is to find all
defective elements by using the minimal possible number of tests in the worst
case. In this work, a multistage group testing problem is considered. Our goal
is to construct a multistage search procedure, having asymptotically the same
number of tests as an adaptive one. We propose a new approach to designing
multistage algorithms, which allows us to construct a 5-stage algorithm for
finding 3 defectives with the optimal number $3\log_2t(1+o(1))$ of tests.

Title: Improving Label Ranking Ensembles using Boosting Techniques
Authors: Lihi Dery and Erez Shmueli
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Label ranking is a prediction task which deals with learning a mapping
between an instance and a ranking (i.e., order) of labels from a finite set,
representing their relevance to the instance. Boosting is a well-known and
reliable ensemble technique that was shown to often outperform other learning
algorithms. While boosting algorithms were developed for a multitude of machine
learning tasks, label ranking tasks were overlooked. In this paper, we propose
a boosting algorithm which was specifically designed for label ranking tasks.
Extensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm on 24 semi-synthetic and
real-world label ranking datasets shows that it significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art label ranking algorithms.

  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly powering high-stakes
applications such as autonomous cars and healthcare; however, DNNs are often
treated as "black boxes" in such applications. Recent research has also
revealed that DNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising
serious concerns over deploying DNNs in the real world. To overcome these
deficiencies, we are developing Massif, an interactive tool for deciphering
adversarial attacks. Massif identifies and interactively visualizes neurons and
their connections inside a DNN that are strongly activated or suppressed by an
adversarial attack. Massif provides both a high-level, interpretable overview
of the effect of an attack on a DNN, and a low-level, detailed description of
the affected neurons. These tightly coupled views in Massif help people better
understand which input features are most vulnerable or important for correct
predictions.

Title: Loss-annealed GAIL for sample efficient and stable Imitation Learning
Authors: Rohit Jena, Katia Sycara
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Imitation learning is the problem of learning a policy from an expert policy
without access to a reward signal. Often, the expert policy is only available
in the form of expert demonstrations. Behavior cloning and GAIL are two
popularly used methods for performing imitation learning in this setting.
Behavior cloning converges in a few training iterations, but doesn't reach peak
performance and suffers from compounding errors due to its supervised training
framework and iid assumption. GAIL attempts to tackle this problem by
accounting for the temporal dependencies between states while matching
occupancy measures of the expert and the policy. Although GAIL has shown
successes in a number of environments, it takes a lot of environment
interactions. Given their complementary benefits, existing methods have
mentioned trying or tried to combine the two methods, without much success. We
look at some of the limitations of existing ideas that try to combine BC and
GAIL, and present an algorithm that combines the best of both worlds to enable
faster and stable training while not compromising on performance. Our algorithm
is embarrassingly simple to implement and seamlessly integrates with different
policy gradient algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm
both in low dimensional control tasks in a limited data setting, and in high
dimensional grid world environments.

\\
  A tensor provides a concise way to codify the interdependence of complex
data. Treating a tensor as a d-way array, each entry records the interaction
between the different indices. Clustering provides a way to parse the
complexity of the data into more readily understandable information. Clustering
methods are heavily dependent on the algorithm of choice, as well as the chosen
hyperparameters of the algorithm. However, their sensitivity to data scales is
largely unknown.
  In this work, we apply the discrete wavelet transform to analyze the effects
of coarse-graining on clustering tensor data. We are particularly interested in
understanding how scale effects clustering of the Earth's climate system. The
discrete wavelet transform allows classification of the Earth's climate across
a multitude of spatial-temporal scales. The discrete wavelet transform is used
to produce an ensemble of classification estimates, as opposed to a single
classification. Using information theory, we discover a sub-collection of the
ensemble that span the majority of the variance observed, allowing for
efficient consensus clustering techniques that can be used to identify climate
biomes.

Title: Convergence Time Optimization for Federated Learning over Wireless
  Networks
Authors: Mingzhe Chen, H. Vincent Poor, Walid Saad, and Shuguang Cui
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NI stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, the convergence time of federated learning (FL), when deployed
over a realistic wireless network, is studied. In particular, a wireless
network is considered in which wireless users transmit their local FL models
(trained using their locally collected data) to a base station (BS). The BS,
acting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received
local FL models and broadcasts it back to all users. Due to the limited number
of resource blocks (RBs) in a wireless network, only a subset of users can be
selected to transmit their local FL model parameters to the BS at each learning
step. Moreover, since each user has unique training data samples, the BS
prefers to include all local user FL models to generate a converged global FL
model. Hence, the FL performance and convergence time will be significantly
affected by the user selection scheme. Therefore, it is necessary to design an
appropriate user selection scheme that enables users of higher importance to be
selected more frequently. This joint learning, wireless resource allocation,
and user selection problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal
is to minimize the FL convergence time while optimizing the FL performance. To
solve this problem, a probabilistic user selection scheme is proposed such that
the BS is connected to the users whose local FL models have significant effects
on its global FL model with high probabilities. Given the user selection
policy, the uplink RB allocation can be determined. To further reduce the FL
convergence time, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to estimate the
local FL models of the users that are not allocated any RBs for local FL model
transmission at each given learning step, which enables the BS to enhance its
global FL model and improve the FL convergence speed and performance.

\\
  We propose a contextual bandit based model to capture the learning and social
welfare goals of a web platform in the presence of myopic users. By using
payments to incentivize these agents to explore different
items/recommendations, we show how the platform can learn the inherent
attributes of items and achieve a sublinear regret while maximizing cumulative
social welfare. We also calculate theoretical bounds on the cumulative costs of
incentivization to the platform. Unlike previous works in this domain, we
consider contexts to be completely adversarial, and the behavior of the
adversary is unknown to the platform. Our approach can improve various
engagement metrics of users on e-commerce stores, recommendation engines and
matching platforms.

  Conditional Generative Models are now acknowledged an essential tool in
Machine Learning. This paper focuses on their control. While many approaches
aim at disentangling the data through the coordinate-wise control of their
latent representations, another direction is explored in this paper. The
proposed CompVAE handles data with a natural multi-ensemblist structure (i.e.
that can naturally be decomposed into elements). Derived from Bayesian
variational principles, CompVAE learns a latent representation leveraging both
observational and symbolic information. A first contribution of the approach is
that this latent representation supports a compositional generative model,
amenable to multi-ensemblist operations (addition or subtraction of elements in
the composition). This compositional ability is enabled by the invariance and
generality of the whole framework w.r.t. respectively, the order and number of
the elements. The second contribution of the paper is a proof of concept on
synthetic 1D and 2D problems, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed
approach.

Title: Get Rid of Suspended Animation Problem: Deep Diffusive Neural Network on
  Graph Semi-Supervised Classification
Authors: Jiawei Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.IT cs.NE math.IT stat.ML
Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Existing graph neural networks may suffer from the "suspended animation
problem" when the model architecture goes deep. Meanwhile, for some graph
learning scenarios, e.g., nodes with text/image attributes or graphs with
long-distance node correlations, deep graph neural networks will be necessary
for effective graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a new
graph neural network, namely DIFNET (Graph Diffusive Neural Network), for graph
representation learning and node classification. DIFNET utilizes both neural
gates and graph residual learning for node hidden state modeling, and includes
an attention mechanism for node neighborhood information diffusion. Extensive
experiments will be done in this paper to compare DIFNET against several
state-of-the-art graph neural network models. The experimental results can
illustrate both the learning performance advantages and effectiveness of
DIFNET, especially in addressing the "suspended animation problem".

Title: CodeReef: an open platform for portable MLOps, reusable automation
  actions and reproducible benchmarking
Authors: Grigori Fursin, Herve Guillou and Nicolas Essayan
Categories: cs.LG cs.SE stat.ML
\\
  We present CodeReef - an open platform to share all the components necessary
to enable cross-platform MLOps (MLSysOps), i.e. automating the deployment of ML
models across diverse systems in the most efficient way. We also introduce the
CodeReef solution - a way to package and share models as non-virtualized,
portable, customizable and reproducible archive files. Such ML packages include
JSON meta description of models with all dependencies, Python APIs, CLI actions
and portable workflows necessary to automatically build, benchmark, test and
customize models across diverse platforms, AI frameworks, libraries, compilers
and datasets. We demonstrate several CodeReef solutions to automatically build,
run and measure object detection based on SSD-Mobilenets, TensorFlow and COCO
dataset from the latest MLPerf inference benchmark across a wide range of
platforms from Raspberry Pi, Android phones and IoT devices to data centers.
Our long-term goal is to help researchers share their new techniques as
production-ready packages along with research papers to participate in
collaborative and reproducible benchmarking, compare the different
ML/software/hardware stacks and select the most efficient ones on a Pareto
frontier using online CodeReef dashboards.

Title: On Solving Cooperative MARL Problems with a Few Good Experiences
Authors: Rajiv Ranjan Kumar, Pradeep Varakantham
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is crucial for
cooperative decentralized decision learning in many domains such as search and
rescue, drone surveillance, package delivery and fire fighting problems. In
these domains, a key challenge is learning with a few good experiences, i.e.,
positive reinforcements are obtained only in a few situations (e.g., on
extinguishing a fire or tracking a crime or delivering a package) and in most
other situations there is zero or negative reinforcement. Learning decisions
with a few good experiences is extremely challenging in cooperative MARL
problems due to three reasons. First, compared to the single agent case,
exploration is harder as multiple agents have to be coordinated to receive a
good experience. Second, environment is not stationary as all the agents are
learning at the same time (and hence change policies). Third, scale of problem
increases significantly with every additional agent.
  Relevant existing work is extensive and has focussed on dealing with a few
good experiences in single-agent RL problems or on scalable approaches for
handling non-stationarity in MARL problems. Unfortunately, neither of these
approaches (or their extensions) are able to address the problem of sparse good
experiences effectively. Therefore, we provide a novel fictitious self
imitation approach that is able to simultaneously handle non-stationarity and
sparse good experiences in a scalable manner. Finally, we provide a thorough
comparison (experimental or descriptive) against relevant cooperative MARL
algorithms to demonstrate the utility of our approach.

Title: Safety Concerns and Mitigation Approaches Regarding the Use of Deep
  Learning in Safety-Critical Perception Tasks
Authors: Oliver Willers, Sebastian Sudholt, Shervin Raafatnia, Stephanie
  Abrecht
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Deep learning methods are widely regarded as indispensable when it comes to
designing perception pipelines for autonomous agents such as robots, drones or
automated vehicles. The main reasons, however, for deep learning not being used
for autonomous agents at large scale already are safety concerns. Deep learning
approaches typically exhibit a black-box behavior which makes it hard for them
to be evaluated with respect to safety-critical aspects. While there have been
some work on safety in deep learning, most papers typically focus on high-level
safety concerns. In this work, we seek to dive into the safety concerns of deep
learning methods and present a concise enumeration on a deeply technical level.
Additionally, we present extensive discussions on possible mitigation methods
and give an outlook regarding what mitigation methods are still missing in
order to facilitate an argumentation for the safety of a deep learning method.

Title: Optimal binning: mathematical programming formulation
Authors: Guillermo Navas-Palencia
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  The optimal binning is the optimal discretization of a variable into bins
given a discrete or continuous numeric target. We present a rigorous and
extensible mathematical programming formulation to solving the optimal binning
problem for a binary, continuous and multi-class target type, incorporating
constraints not previously addressed. For all three target types, we introduce
a convex mixed-integer programming formulation. Several algorithmic
enhancements such as automatic determination of the most suitable monotonic
trend via a Machine-Learning-based classifier and implementation aspects are
thoughtfully discussed. The new mathematical programming formulations are
carefully implemented in the open-source python library OptBinning.

\\
  The goal of this paper is to present a method for simultaneous trajectory and
local stabilizing policy optimization to generate local policies for
trajectory-centric model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). This is motivated
by the fact that global policy optimization for non-linear systems could be a
very challenging problem both algorithmically and numerically. However, a lot
of robotic manipulation tasks are trajectory-centric, and thus do not require a
global model or policy. Due to inaccuracies in the learned model estimates, an
open-loop trajectory optimization process mostly results in very poor
performance when used on the real system. Motivated by these problems, we try
to formulate the problem of trajectory optimization and local policy synthesis
as a single optimization problem. It is then solved simultaneously as an
instance of nonlinear programming. We provide some results for analysis as well
as achieved performance of the proposed technique under some simplifying
assumptions.

Title: Secure and Robust Machine Learning for Healthcare: A Survey
Authors: Adnan Qayyum, Junaid Qadir, Muhammad Bilal, and Ala Al-Fuqaha
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI eess.IV stat.ML
\\
  Recent years have witnessed widespread adoption of machine learning (ML)/deep
learning (DL) techniques due to their superior performance for a variety of
healthcare applications ranging from the prediction of cardiac arrest from
one-dimensional heart signals to computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) using
multi-dimensional medical images. Notwithstanding the impressive performance of
ML/DL, there are still lingering doubts regarding the robustness of ML/DL in
healthcare settings (which is traditionally considered quite challenging due to
the myriad security and privacy issues involved), especially in light of recent
results that have shown that ML/DL are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In
this paper, we present an overview of various application areas in healthcare
that leverage such techniques from security and privacy point of view and
present associated challenges. In addition, we present potential methods to
ensure secure and privacy-preserving ML for healthcare applications. Finally,
we provide insight into the current research challenges and promising
directions for future research.

Title: Q-Learning in enormous action spaces via amortized approximate
  maximization
Authors: Tom Van de Wiele, David Warde-Farley, Andriy Mnih and Volodymyr Mnih
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: A previous version of this work appeared at the Deep Reinforcement
  Learning Workshop, NeurIPS 2018
\\
  Applying Q-learning to high-dimensional or continuous action spaces can be
difficult due to the required maximization over the set of possible actions.
Motivated by techniques from amortized inference, we replace the expensive
maximization over all actions with a maximization over a small subset of
possible actions sampled from a learned proposal distribution. The resulting
approach, which we dub Amortized Q-learning (AQL), is able to handle discrete,
continuous, or hybrid action spaces while maintaining the benefits of
Q-learning. Our experiments on continuous control tasks with up to 21
dimensional actions show that AQL outperforms D3PG (Barth-Maron et al, 2018)
and QT-Opt (Kalashnikov et al, 2018). Experiments on structured discrete action
spaces demonstrate that AQL can efficiently learn good policies in spaces with
thousands of discrete actions.

Title: Pruning CNN's with linear filter ensembles
Authors: Csan\'ad S\'andor, Szabolcs P\'avel, Lehel Csat\'o
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: accepted to ECAI2020
\\
  Despite the promising results of convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
applying them on resource limited devices is still a challenge, mainly due to
the huge memory and computation requirements. To tackle these problems, pruning
can be applied to reduce the network size and number of floating point
operations (FLOPs). Contrary to the \emph{filter norm} method -- that is used
in network pruning and uses the assumption that the smaller this norm, the less
important is the associated component --, we develop a novel filter importance
norm that incorporates the loss caused by the elimination of a component from
the CNN.
  To estimate the importance of a set of architectural components, we measure
the CNN performance as different components are removed. The result is a
collection of filter ensembles -- filter masks -- and associated performance
values. We rank the filters based on a linear and additive model and remove the
least important ones such that the drop in network accuracy is minimal. We
evaluate our method on a fully connected network, as well as on the ResNet
architecture trained on the CIFAR-10 data-set. Using our pruning method, we
managed to remove $60\%$ of the parameters and $64\%$ of the FLOPs from the
ResNet with an accuracy drop of less than $0.6\%$.

Title: GraphGen: A Scalable Approach to Domain-agnostic Labeled Graph
  Generation
Authors: Nikhil Goyal, Harsh Vardhan Jain, Sayan Ranu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: The Web Conference (WWW) 2020
DOI: 10.1145/3366423.3380201
\\
  Graph generative models have been extensively studied in the data mining
literature. While traditional techniques are based on generating structures
that adhere to a pre-decided distribution, recent techniques have shifted
towards learning this distribution directly from the data. While learning-based
approaches have imparted significant improvement in quality, some limitations
remain to be addressed. First, learning graph distributions introduces
additional computational overhead, which limits their scalability to large
graph databases. Second, many techniques only learn the structure and do not
address the need to also learn node and edge labels, which encode important
semantic information and influence the structure itself. Third, existing
techniques often incorporate domain-specific rules and lack generalizability.
Fourth, the experimentation of existing techniques is not comprehensive enough
due to either using weak evaluation metrics or focusing primarily on synthetic
or small datasets. In this work, we develop a domain-agnostic technique called
GraphGen to overcome all of these limitations. GraphGen converts graphs to
sequences using minimum DFS codes. Minimum DFS codes are canonical labels and
capture the graph structure precisely along with the label information. The
complex joint distributions between structure and semantic labels are learned
through a novel LSTM architecture. Extensive experiments on million-sized, real
graph datasets show GraphGen to be 4 times faster on average than
state-of-the-art techniques while being significantly better in quality across
a comprehensive set of 11 different metrics. Our code is released at
https://github.com/idea-iitd/graphgen.

Title: Soundness-preserving composition of synchronously and asynchronously

Authors: Luca Bernardinello, Irina Lomazova, Roman Nesterov, Lucia Pomello
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  In this paper, we propose a compositional approach to construct formal models
of complex distributed systems with several synchronously and asynchronously
interacting components. A system model is obtained from a composition of
individual component models according to requirements on their interaction. We
represent component behavior using workflow nets - a class of Petri nets. We
propose a general approach to model and compose synchronously and
asynchronously interacting workflow nets. Through the use of Petri net
morphisms and their properties, we prove that this composition of workflow nets
preserves component correctness.

Title: AMSNP: a tame fragment of existential second-order logic
Authors: Manuel Bodirsky, Simon Kn\"auer, Florian Starke
Categories: cs.LO cs.CC math.LO
Comments: 10 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Amalgamation monotone SNP (AMSNP) is a fragment of existential second-order
logic that strictly contains the logics (connected) MMSNP of Feder and Vardi
and guarded monotone SNP of Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter; it is a
promising candidate for an expressive subclass of NP that exhibits a complexity
dichotomy. We show that AMSNP has a complexity dichotomy if and only if
Constraint Satisfaction Problems for reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous
structures have a complexity dichotomy. For such CSPs, powerful
universal-algebraic hardness conditions are known that are conjectured to
describe the border between NP-hard and polynomial-time tractable CSPs. The
connection to CSPs also implies that every AMSNP sentence can be evaluated in
polynomial time on classes of finite structures of bounded treewidth. We show
that the syntax of AMSNP is decidable. The proof relies on the following fact,
which we believe is of independent interest in model theory: for classes of
finite structures given by finitely many forbidden substructures, the
amalgamation property is decidable.

Title: Subjective Knowledge and Reasoning about Agents in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Shikha Singh, Deepak Khemani
Categories: cs.MA cs.AI
\\
  Though a lot of work in multi-agent systems is focused on reasoning about
knowledge and beliefs of artificial agents, an explicit representation and
reasoning about the presence/absence of agents, especially in the scenarios
where agents may be unaware of other agents joining in or going offline in a
multi-agent system, leading to partial knowledge/asymmetric knowledge of the
agents is mostly overlooked by the MAS community. Such scenarios lay the
foundations of cases where an agent can influence other agents' mental states
by (mis)informing them about the presence/absence of collaborators or
adversaries. In this paper, we investigate how Kripke structure-based epistemic
models can be extended to express the above notion based on an agent's
subjective knowledge and we discuss the challenges that come along.

Title: Egalitarian Deliberative Decision Making
Authors: Edith Elkind, Davide Grossi, Ehud Shapiro and Nimrod Talmon
Categories: cs.MA
\\
  We study a scenario in which an agent population wishes to identify a
majority-supported proposal to change the status quo, where proposals are
elements of an abstract space. In our deliberation process agents form
coalitions around proposals that they prefer over the status quo, and can then
join forces to create larger coalitions by merging two coalitions around a new
proposal, possibly leaving dissenting agents behind. We identify a class of
metric spaces, which includes all Euclidean spaces, for which the deliberation
process is guaranteed to result in \emph{success}: Deliberation will terminate
with a majority coalition, as long as a majority-supported proposal exists. We
then consider a more general proposal space where deliberation might not be
successful. For such a setting we study sufficient conditions on the type of
deliberation that can again guarantee success. We complement our analysis with
a centralized dynamic programming algorithm to identify the most-supported
proposal.

\\
  Advances in graphics and machine learning algorithms and processes have led
to the general availability of easy-to-use tools for modifying and synthesizing
media. The proliferation of these tools threatens democracies around the world
by enabling wide-spread distribution of false information to billions of
individuals via social media platforms. One approach to thwarting the flow of
fake media is to detect synthesized or modified media via the use of pattern
recognition methods, including statistical classifiers developed via machine
learning. While detection may help in the short-term, we believe that it is
destined to fail as the quality of the fake media generation continues to
improve. Within a short period of time, neither humans nor algorithms will be
able to reliably distinguish fake versus real content. Thus, pipelines for
assuring the source and integrity of media will be required---and will be
increasingly relied upon. We propose AMP, a system that ensures authentication
of a media content's source via provenance. AMP creates one or more manifests
for a media instance uploaded by a content provider. These manifests are stored
in a database allowing fast lookup using the AMP service from applications such
as browsers. For reference, the manifests are also registered and signed by a
permissioned ledger implemented using the Confidential Consortium Framework
(CCF). CCF employs both software and hardware techniques to ensure the
integrity and transparency of all registered manifests. AMP, through its use of
CCF, allows for a consortium of media providers to govern the service while
making all governance operations auditable. The authenticity of the media can
be communicated to the user via an icon or other visual elements in the
browser, indicating that an AMP manifest has been successfully located and
verified.

  In this paper we use the Isogeometric method to solve the Helmholtz equation
with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition over a bounded physical
domain. Starting from the variational formulation of the problem, we show with
details how to apply the isogeometric approach to obtain an approximation of
the solution using biquadratic B-spline functions. To illustrate the power of
the method we solve several difficult problems, which are particular cases of
the Helmholtz equation, where the solution has discontinuous gradient in some
points, or it is highly oscillatory. For these problems we explain how to
select the knots of B-spline quadratic functions and how to insert knew knots
in order to obtain good approximations of the exact solution on regions with
irregular boundary. The results, obtained with our Julia implementation of the
method, prove that isogeometric approach produces approximations with a
relative small error and computational cost.

normalized B-spline-like basis for spline spaces with pieces drawn from
extended Tchebycheff spaces. The extended Tchebycheff spaces and their
dimensions are allowed to change from interval to interval. The approach works
by constructing a matrix that maps a generalized Bernstein-like basis to the
B-spline-like basis of interest. The B-spline-like basis shares many
characterizing properties with classical univariate B-splines and may easily be
incorporated in existing spline codes. This may contribute to the full
exploitation of Tchebycheffian splines in applications, freeing them from the
restricted role of an elegant theoretical extension of polynomial splines.
Numerical examples are provided that illustrate the procedure described.

Title: Nonlocal multicontinua with Representative Volume Elements. Bridging
  separable and non-separable scales
Authors: Eric T. Chung, Y. Efendiev, Wing T. Leung, ans M. Vasilyeva
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Recently, several approaches for multiscale simulations for problems with
high contrast and no scale separation are introduced. Among them is the
nonlocal multicontinua (NLMC) method, which introduces multiple macroscopic
variables in each computational grid. These approaches explore the entire
coarse block resolution and one can obtain optimal convergence results
independent of contrast and scales. However, these approaches are not amenable
to many multiscale simulations, where the subgrid effects are much smaller than
the coarse-mesh resolution. For example, the molecular dynamics of shale gas
occurs in much smaller length scales compared to the coarse-mesh size, which is
of orders of meters. In this case, one can not explore the entire coarse-grid
resolution in evaluating effective properties. In this paper, we merge the
concepts of nonlocal multicontinua methods and Representative Volume Element
(RVE) concepts to explore problems with extreme scale separation. The first
step of this approach is to use sub-grid scale (sub to RVE) to write a
large-scale macroscopic system. We call it intermediate scale macroscale
system. In the next step, we couple this intermediate macroscale system to the
simulation grid model, which are used in simulations. This is done using RVE
concepts, where we relate intermediate macroscale variables to the macroscale
variables defined on our simulation coarse grid. Our intermediate coarse model
allows formulating macroscale variables correctly and coupling them to the
simulation grid. We present the general concept of our approach and present
details of single-phase flow. Some numerical results are presented. For
nonlinear examples, we use machine learning techniques to compute macroscale
parameters.

  We discuss the mathematical modeling and numerical discretization of
transport problems on one-dimensional networks. Suitable coupling conditions
are derived that guarantee conservation of mass across network junctions and
dissipation of a mathematical energy which allows to prove existence of unique
solutions. We then consider the space discretization by a hybrid discontinuous
Galerkin method which provides a suitable upwind mechanism to handle the
transport problem and allows to incorporate the coupling conditions in a
natural manner. In addition, the method inherits mass conservation and
stability of the continuous problem. Order optimal convergence rates are
established and illustrated by numerical tests.

Authors: Noe Caruso, Alessandro Michelangeli
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.FA
\\
  The abstract issue of 'Krylov solvability' is extensively discussed for the
inverse problem $Af = g$ where $A$ is a (possibly unbounded) linear operator on
an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and $g$ is a datum in the range of $A$.
The question consists of whether the solution $f$ can be approximated in the
Hilbert norm by finite linear combinations of $g, Ag, A^2 g, \dots$ , and
whether solutions of this sort exist and are unique. After revisiting the known
picture when $A$ is bounded, we study the general case of a densely defined and
closed $A$. Intrinsic operator-theoretic mechanisms are identified that
guarantee or prevent Krylov solvability, with new features arising due to the
unboundedness. Such mechanisms are checked in the self-adjoint case, where
Krylov solvability is also proved by conjugate-gradient-based techniques.

Title: Lowest-degree polynomial de Rham complex on general quadrilateral grids
Authors: Qimeng Quan, Xia Ji, and Shuo Zhang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 25 pages, 8 figures
\\
  This paper devotes to the construction of finite elements on grids that
consist of general quadrilaterals not limited in parallelograms. Two finite
elements are established for the $H^1$ and $H(\rm rot)$ elliptic problems,
respectively. The two finite element spaces on general quadrilateral grids,
together with the space of piecewise constant functions, formulate a
discretised de Rham complex. First order convergence rate can be proved for
both of them under the asymptotic-parallelogram assumption on the grids.
  The local shape functions of the two spaces are piecewise polynomials, and
the global finite element functions are nonconforming. A rigorous analysis is
given in this paper that it is impossible to construct a practically useful
finite element defined as Ciarlet's triple whose shape functions are always
piecewise polynomials and which can form conforming subspaces on a grid that
consists of arbitrary quadrilaterals.

  Low rank tensor approximations have been employed successfully, for example,
to build surrogate models that can be used to speed up large-scale inference
problems in high dimensions. The success of this depends critically on the rank
that is necessary to represent or approximate the underlying distribution. In
this paper, we develop a-priori rank bounds for approximations in the
functional Tensor-Train representation for the case of a Gaussian (normally
distributed) model. We show that under suitable conditions on the precision
matrix, we can represent the Gaussian density to high accuracy without
suffering from an exponential growth of complexity as the dimension increases.
Our results provide evidence of the suitability and limitations of low rank
tensor methods in a simple but important model case. Numerical experiments
confirm that the rank bounds capture the qualitative behavior of the rank
structure when varying the parameters of the precision matrix and the accuracy
of the approximation.

Title: A Neural Network based Shock Detection and Localization Approach for
  Discontinuous Galerkin Methods
Authors: Andrea D. Beck, Jonas Zeifang, Anna Schwarz, David G. Flad
Categories: math.NA cs.CE cs.NA
\\
  The stable and accurate approximation of discontinuities such as shocks on a
finite computational mesh is a challenging task. Detection of shocks or strong
discontinuities in the flow solution is typically achieved through a priori
troubled cell indicators, which guide the subsequent action of an appropriate
shock capturing mechanism. Arriving at a stable and accurate solution often
requires empirically based parameter tuning and adjustments of the indicator
settings to the discretization and solution at hand. In this work, we propose
to separate the task of shock detection and shock capturing more strongly and
aim to develop a shock indicator that is robust, accurate, requires minimal
user input and is suitable for high order element-based methods like
discontinuous Galerkin and flux reconstruction methods. The novel indicator is
learned from analytical data through a supervised learning strategy; its input
is given by the high order solution field, its output is an element-local map
of the shock position. We use state of the art methods from edge detection in
image analysis based on deep convolutional multiscale networks and deep
supervision to train the indicators. The resulting networks are then used as
black box indicators, showing their robustness and accuracy on well established
canonical testcases. All simulations are run ab initio using the developed
indicators, showing that they provide also stability during the strongly
transient phases. In particular for high order schemes with large cells and
considerable inner-cell resolution capabilities, we demonstrate how the
additional accurate prediction of the position of the shock front can be
exploited to guide inner-element shock capturing strategies.

Title: Composite Quadrature Methods for Weakly Singular Convolution Integrals

\\
  The well-known Caputo fractional derivative and the corresponding Caputo
fractional integral occur naturally in many equations that model physical
phenomena under inhomogeneous media. The relationship between the two
fractional terms can be readily obtained by applying the Laplace transform to a
given equation. We seek to numerically approximate Caputo fractional integrals
using a Taylor series expansion for convolution integrals. This naturally
extends into being able to approximate convolution integrals for a wider class
of convolution integral kernels $K(t-s)$. One of the main advantages under this
approach is the ability to numerically approximate weakly singular kernels,
which fail to converge under traditional quadrature methods. We provide
stability and convergence analysis for these composite quadratures, which offer
optimal convergence for approximating functions in $C^{\gamma}[0,T]$, where
$\alpha \leq \gamma \leq 5$ and $0<\alpha < 1$. For the order $\gamma =
1,2,3,4,5$ scheme, the resulting approximation is $O(\tau^{\gamma})$ accurate,
where $\tau$ is the size of the partition of the time domain. By instead
utilizing a fractional Taylor series expansion, we are able to obtain for
$\gamma \in (0,5)-\{1,2,3,4\}$ order scheme, which yields an approximation of
$O(\tau^{\gamma})$ with a constant dependent on the kernel function which
improves the order of convergence. This allows for a far wider class of
functions to be approximated, and by strengthening the regularity assumption,
we are able to obtain more accurate results. General convolution integrals
exhibit these results up to $\gamma = 2$ without the assumption of $K$ being
decreasing. Finally, some numerical examples are presented, which validate our
findings.

Title: Learning Directed Locomotion in Modular Robots with Evolvable

\\
  We generalize the well-studied problem of gait learning in modular robots in
two dimensions. Firstly, we address locomotion in a given target direction that
goes beyond learning a typical undirected gait. Secondly, rather than studying
one fixed robot morphology we consider a test suite of different modular
robots. This study is based on our interest in evolutionary robot systems where
both morphologies and controllers evolve. In such a system, newborn robots have
to learn to control their own body that is a random combination of the bodies
of the parents. We apply and compare two learning algorithms, Bayesian
optimization and HyperNEAT. The results of the experiments in simulation show
that both methods successfully learn good controllers, but Bayesian
optimization is more effective and efficient. We validate the best learned
controllers by constructing three robots from the test suite in the real world
and observe their fitness and actual trajectories. The obtained results
indicate a reality gap that depends on the controllers and the shape of the
robots, but overall the trajectories are adequate and follow the target
directions successfully.

Title: Performance-Driven Internet Path Selection
Authors: Maria Apostolaki, Ankit Singla, Laurent Vanbever
Categories: cs.NI cs.PF
\\
  Internet routing can often be sub-optimal, with the chosen routes providing
worse performance than other available policy-compliant routes. This stems from
the lack of visibility into route performance at the network layer. While this
is an old problem, we argue that recent advances in programmable hardware
finally open up the possibility of performance-aware routing in a deployable,
BGP-compatible manner. We introduce ROUTESCOUT, a hybrid hardware/software
system supporting performance-based routing at ISP scale. In the data plane,
ROUTESCOUT leverages P4-enabled hardware to monitor performance across
policy-compliant route choices for each destination, at line-rate and with a
small memory footprint. ROUTESCOUT's control plane then asynchronously pulls
aggregated performance metrics to synthesize a performance-aware forwarding
policy. We show that ROUTESCOUT can monitor performance across most of an ISP's
traffic, using only 4 MB of memory. Further, its control can flexibly satisfy a
variety of operator objectives, with sub-second operating times.

\\
  Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a growing area of communication
with a variety of use cases. This paper investigates the problem of
vehicle-cell association in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication networks.
The aim is to maximize the time average rate per vehicular user (VUE) while
ensuring a target minimum rate for all VUEs with low signaling overhead. We
first formulate the user (vehicle) association problem as a discrete non-convex
optimization problem. Then, by leveraging tools from machine learning,
specifically distributed deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) and the
asynchronous actor critic algorithm (A3C), we propose a low complexity
algorithm that approximates the solution of the proposed optimization problem.
The proposed DDRL-based algorithm endows every road side unit (RSU) with a
local RL agent that selects a local action based on the observed input state.
Actions of different RSUs are forwarded to a central entity, that computes a
global reward which is then fed back to RSUs. It is shown that each
independently trained RL performs the vehicle-RSU association action with low
control overhead and less computational complexity compared to running an
online complex algorithm to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Finally,
simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves up to 15\% gains in
terms of sum rate and 20\% reduction in VUE outages compared to several
baseline designs.

  The emerging technology of multi-tenancy network slicing is considered as an
essential feature of 5G cellular networks. It provides network slices as a new
type of public cloud services, and therewith increases the service flexibility
and enhances the network resource efficiency. Meanwhile, it raises new
challenges of network resource management. A number of various methods have
been proposed over the recent past years, in which machine learning and
artificial intelligence techniques are widely deployed. In this article, we
provide a survey to existing approaches of network slicing resource management,
with a highlight on the roles played by machine learning in them.

Title: IoT Content Object Security with OSCORE and NDN: A First Experimental
  Comparison
Authors: Cenk G\"undo\u{g}an, Christian Ams\"uss, Thomas C. Schmidt, Matthias
  W\"ahlisch
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) challenges the end-to-end transport of
the Internet by low power lossy links and gateways that perform protocol
translations. Protocols such as CoAP or MQTT-SN are weakened by the overhead of
DTLS sessions, which in common deployment protect content transfer only up to
the gateway. To preserve end-to-end content security throughout gateways and
proxies, the IETF CoRE working group recently developed OSCORE as an extension
to CoAP, which adds content object security features commonly known from
Information Centric Networks (ICN).
  This paper presents a comparative analysis of protocol stacks that protect
request-response transactions. We measure protocol performances of CoAP over
DTLS, OSCORE, and the information-centric Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol
on a large-scale IoT testbed in single- and multi-hop scenarios. Our findings
indicate that (a) OSCORE improves on CoAP over DTLS in error-prone wireless
regimes due to omitting the overhead of maintaining security sessions at
endpoints, and (b) NDN attains superior robustness and reliability due to its
intrinsic network caches and hop-wise retransmissions.

\\
  Vehicles are increasingly becoming connected and short-range wireless
communications promise to introduce a radical change in the drivers' behaviors.
Among the main use cases, the intersection management is surely one of those
that could mostly impact on both traffic safety and efficiency. In this work,
we consider an intersection collision warning application and exploit an
hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform to verify the impact on the risk of
accidents as well as the average time to travel a given distance. Besides
including real ITS-G5 compliant message exchanges, the platform also includes a
channel emulator with real signals. Results show that the risk of collisions
can be drastically reduced, with an overall trade-off between safety and
traffic efficiency. At the same time, it is shown that the presence of real
channel conditions cannot guarantee the same condition of zero-risk as with
ideal channel propagation, remarking the importance of channel conditions and
signal processing.

  The fifth generation (5G) wireless communication networks are currently being
deployed, and beyond 5G (B5G) networks are expected to be developed over the
next decade. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and, in particular,
machine learning (ML) have the potential to efficiently solve the unstructured
and seemingly intractable problems by involving large amounts of data that need
to be dealt with in B5G. This article studies how AI and ML can be leveraged
for the design and operation of B5G networks. We first provide a comprehensive
survey of recent advances and future challenges that result from bringing AI/ML
technologies into B5G wireless networks. Our survey touches different aspects
of wireless network design and optimization, including channel measurements,
modeling, and estimation, physical-layer research, and network management and
optimization. Then, ML algorithms and applications to B5G networks are
reviewed, followed by an overview of standard developments of applying AI/ML
algorithms to B5G networks. We conclude this study by the future challenges on
applying AI/ML to B5G networks.

\\
  The IEC 61850 standard is being largely used in the Smart Grid (SG) context
mainly due to its ability to address communication, interoperability and
migration issues. IEC 61850 currently aims at internal substation
communication. Nevertheless, there is a demand to generalize its use for
distributed SG systems like Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) and Advanced
Monitoring Infrastructure (AMI) Communication which potentially involves
distributed substations or distributed SG components. IEC 61850- based systems
require constrained timing requirements for communication and the common
approach is to allocate static link bandwidth resources leading in some cases
to over dimensioning. This paper presents the Substation Cognitive
Communication Resource Management (IC2RM), that aims the management of
bandwidth allocation for IEC messages using a cognitive approach for its
provisioning and the SDN/OpenFlow for its deployment. By dynamically deploying
bandwidth for IEC messages, IC2RM optimizes links between SG substations and
systems and potentially reduces the operational costs (OPEX).

Title: Cross Layer Design for Maximizing Network Utility in Multiple Gateways
  Wireless Mesh Networks
Authors: Samaneh Aghashahi, Ghasem Mirjalily, Aliakber Tadaion
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  We investigate the problem of network utility maximization in multiple
gateways wireless mesh networks by considering Signal to Interference plus
Noise Ratio (SINR) as the interference model. The aim is a cross layer design
that considers joint rate control, traffic splitting, routing, scheduling, link
rate allocation and power control to formulate the network utility maximization
problem. As this problem is computationally complex, we propose the Joint
dynamic Gateway selection, link Rate allocation and Power control (JGRP)
algorithm based on the differential backlog as a sub-optimal solution. This
algorithm first constructs the initial network topology, and then in each time
slot, determines the generation rate and destination gateway of each traffic
flow, simultaneously. The other main task of this algorithm is joint routing,
scheduling, links rate allocation and node power allocation in each time slot.
Moreover, for improving the fairness, we propose some new parameters instead of
the differential backlog in JGRP algorithm. Simulation results show that using
the proposed parameters in JGRP algorithm improves fairness from throughput and
delay point of views.

  Acoustic noise has adverse effects on human activities. Aside from hearing
impairment and stress-related illnesses, it can also interfere with spoken
communication, reduce human performance and affect the quality of life. As
urbanization is intensifying, the potential benefits of reducing noise
pollution in smart-city environments are extensive. Noise levels can be
collected and analyzed using a wireless sensor network which can monitor the
noise level by using microphones. However, every wireless system struggles in
terms of the battery requirements needed for continuous data collection and
monitoring. In this paper, the design of a testbed for a smart microphone
system is presented. To save power, a microcontroller and an Analog-to-Digital
Converter (ADC) dynamically switch between high and low power modes in response
to environmental noise. Specifically, the high powered components are triggered
by a spike in the acoustic noise level. Three wireless technologies, WiFi (2.4
GHz), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0 and Zigbee were examined. According to the
results, the power consumption of a node can be lowered by 97% when idle based
on the testbed.

  With the advent of several new Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN)
technologies, todays networking environment is dramatically altered and is
experiencing a rapid transformation. One of the most important is Ethernet
based C-RAN, in support of which many products such as optical Ethernet
switches have recently appeared on the market. This paper presents the
performance analysis of such switches with respect to Packet Loss Ratio (PLR),
Latency and Packet Delay Variation (PDV). We employed the Simula based on
Discrete Event Modelling on Simula (DEMOS), a context class for discrete event
simulation to simulate a cut-through optical Ethernet switch under two types of
traffics: High priority (HP) traffic and Low priority (LP) traffic. In this
way, the paper evaluates the optical Ethernet switch performance
quantitatively. The results obtained from the simulator showed that the high
quality of service was reflected on HP traffic and the low quality of service
in LP traffic. Hence, HP traffic can be used for transporting Radio over
Ethernet (RoE) traffic while LP traffic can used for transporting time
insensitive application. It is also found that HP traffic experiences a PDV
equals to the duration of maximum sized LP traffic in Optical Ethernet switch.

Title: Blockchain as a Service for Multi-Access Edge Computing: A Deep
  Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Dinh C Nguyen, Pubudu N Pathirana, Ming Ding, Aruna Seneviratne

Comments: 9 pages
\\
  Recently, blockchain has gained momentum in the academic community thanks to
its decentralization, immutability, transparency and security. As an emerging
paradigm, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has been widely used to provide
computation and storage resources to mobile user equipments (UE) at the edge of
the network for improving the performance of mobile applications. In this
paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based MEC architecture where UEs can
offload their computation tasks to the MEC servers. In particular, a blockchain
network is deployed and hosted on the MEC platform as Blockchain as a Service
(BaaS) that supports smart contract-based resource trading and transaction
mining services for mobile task offloading. To enhance the performance of the
blockchain-empowered MEC system, we propose a joint scheme of computation
offloading and blockchain mining. Accordingly, an optimization problem is
formulated to maximize edge service revenue and blockchain mining reward while
minimizing the service computation latency with respect to constraints of user
service demands and hash power resource. We then propose a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach using a double deep Q-network (DQN)
algorithm to solve the proposed problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme outperforms the other baseline methods in terms of better
system utility with computational efficiency. Experiment results also verify
that the trading contract design is efficient with low operation cost, showing
the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

  Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless connectivity solutions for
Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, including industrial automation. Among
the several LPWAN technologies, LoRaWAN has been extensively addressed by the
research community and the industry. However, the reliability and scalability
of LoRaWAN are still uncertain. One of the techniques to increase the
reliability of LoRaWAN is message replication, which exploits time diversity.
This paper proposes a novel hybrid coded message replication scheme that
interleaves simple repetition and a recently proposed coded replication method.
We analyze the optimization of the proposed scheme under minimum reliability
requirements and show that it enhances the network performance without
requiring additional transmit power compared to the competing replication
techniques.

  In the coming years, the interconnection of a large number of devices is
expected, which will lead to a new form of interaction between the real and the
virtual world. In this promising scenario, known as the Internet of Things, it
is expected that different objects, such as sensors, industrial robots, cars,
appliances, will be connected to the Internet. One of the main challenges of
the Internet of Things is the interoperability of highly heterogeneous devices,
mainly in terms of the communication capabilities and network protocols used.
As consequence, the interconnection model of the different devices involves an
intermediary device, known as gateway. This gateway is a centralized element
for the management of the devices that make up an IoT application. In addition,
it is essential for the transmission of information to the Internet, especially
when many IoT devices are not IP-based. This paper describes the implementation
of an IoT gateway that allows the exchange of data through different wireless
technologies and forwarding of such data to the Internet. The proposed gateway
has important advantages such as: supporting for multiprotocol
interconnectivity; remote configuration of wireless nodes for sensor and
actuators management; a flexible algorithm to translate the data obtained by
sensors into a uniform format for transmission to a cloud server; low energy
consumption due to efficient data transfer over the MQTT protocol. In order to
demonstrate the usefulness of the developed gateway, a proof-of-concept test
was implemented. The implemented scenario consists of 2 wireless nodes
responsible for sensing environmental variables and transmitting data to the
gateway node through different communication protocols. The obtained results
show the feasibility for simultaneous data transmission from the remote
wireless nodes to the gateway.

\\
  In this work, we propose and experimentally assess the automatic and flexible
NSs configurations of optical OPSquare DCN controlled and orchestrated by an
extended SDN control plane for multi-tenant applications with differentiated
QoS provisioning. Optical Flow Control (OFC) protocol has been developed to
prevent packet losses at switch sides caused by packet contentions.Based on the
collected resource topology of data plane, the optical network slices can be
dynamically provisioned and automatically reconfigured by the SDN control
plane. Meanwhile, experimental results validate that the priority assignment of
application flows supplies dynamic QoS performance to various slices running
applications with specific requirements in terms of packet loss and
transmission latency. In addition, the capability of exposing traffic
statistics information of data plane to SDN control plane enables the
implementation of load balancing algorithms further improving the network
performance with high QoS. No packet loss and less than 4.8 us server-to-server
latency can be guaranteed for the sliced network with highest priority at a
load of 0.5.

  Storage has become a constrained resource on smartphones. Gaming is a popular
activity on mobile devices and the explosive growth in the number of games
coupled with their growing size contributes to the storage crunch. Even where
storage is plentiful, it takes a long time to download and install a heavy app
before it can be launched. This paper presents AppStreamer, a novel technique
for reducing the storage requirements or startup delay of mobile games, and
heavy mobile apps in general. AppStreamer is based on the intuition that most
apps do not need the entirety of its files (images, audio and video clips,
etc.) at any one time. AppStreamer can, therefore, keep only a small part of
the files on the device, akin to a "cache", and download the remainder from a
cloud storage server or a nearby edge server when it predicts that the app will
need them in the near future. AppStreamer continuously predicts file blocks for
the near future as the user uses the app, and fetches them from the storage
server before the user sees a stall due to missing resources. We implement
AppStreamer at the Android file system layer. This ensures that the apps
require no source code or modification, and the approach generalizes across
apps. We evaluate AppStreamer using two popular games: Dead Effect 2, a 3D
first-person shooter, and Fire Emblem Heroes, a 2D turn-based strategy
role-playing game. Through a user study, 75% and 87% of the users respectively
find that AppStreamer provides the same quality of user experience as the
baseline where all files are stored on the device. AppStreamer cuts down the
storage requirement by 87% for Dead Effect 2 and 86% for Fire Emblem Heroes.

  Sparse linear algebra is central to many scientific programs, yet compilers
fail to optimize it well. High-performance libraries are available, but
adoption costs are significant. Moreover, libraries tie programs into
vendor-specific software and hardware ecosystems, creating non-portable code.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach based on our specification Language
for implementers of Linear Algebra Computations (LiLAC). Rather than requiring
the application developer to (re)write every program for a given library, the
burden is shifted to a one-off description by the library implementer. The
LiLAC-enabled compiler uses this to insert appropriate library routines without
source code changes.
  LiLAC provides automatic data marshaling, maintaining state between calls and
minimizing data transfers. Appropriate places for library insertion are
detected in compiler intermediate representation, independent of source
languages.
  We evaluated on large-scale scientific applications written in FORTRAN;
standard C/C++ and FORTRAN benchmarks; and C++ graph analytics kernels. Across
heterogeneous platforms, applications and data sets we show speedups of
1.1$\times$ to over 10$\times$ without user intervention.

Title: Axiomatizing Maximal Progress and Discrete Time
Authors: Mario Bravetti
Categories: cs.PL
\\
  Milner's complete proof system for observational congruence is crucially
based on the possibility to equate $\tau$ divergent expressions to
non-divergent ones by means of the axiom $recX. (\tau.X + E) = recX. \tau. E$.
In the presence of a notion of priority, where, e.g., actions of type $\delta$
have a lower priority than silent $\tau$ actions, this axiom is no longer
sound. Such a form of priority is, however, common in timed process algebra,
where, due to the interpretation of $\delta$ as a time delay, it naturally
arises from the maximal progress assumption. We here present our solution,
based on introducing an auxiliary operator $pri(E)$ defining a "priority
scope", to the long time open problem of axiomatizing priority using standard
observational congruence: we provide a complete axiomatization for a basic
process algebra with priority and (unguarded) recursion. We also show that,
when the setting is extended by considering static operators of a discrete time
calculus, an axiomatization that is complete over (a characterization of)
finite-state terms can be developed by re-using techniques devised in the
context of a cooperation with Prof. Jos Baeten.

Title: Profunctor optics and traversals
Authors: Mario Rom\'an
Categories: cs.PL math.CT
Comments: Submitted as a thesis for MSc Mathematics and Foundations of Computer

  optics, a categorical update" started in this MSc dissertation. 82 pages

\\
  Optics are bidirectional accessors of data structures; they provide a
powerful abstraction of many common data transformations. This abstraction is
compositional thanks to a representation in terms of profunctors endowed with
an algebraic structure called Tambara module. There exists a general definition
of optic in terms of coends that, after some elementary application of the
Yoneda lemma, particularizes in each one of the basic optics. Traversals used
to be the exception; we show an elementary derivation of traversals and discuss
some other new derivations for optics. We relate our characterization of
traversals to the previous ones showing that the coalgebras of a comonad that
represents and split into shape and contents are traversable functors. The
representation of optics in terms of profunctors has many different proofs in
the literature; we discuss two ways of proving it, generalizing both to the
case of mixed optics for an arbitrary action. Categories of optics can be seen
as Eilenberg-Moore categories for a monad described by Pastro and Street. This
gives us two different approaches to composition between profunctor optics of
different families: using distributive laws between the monads defining them,
and using coproducts of monads. The second one is the one implicitly used in
Haskell programming; but we show that a refinement of the notion of optic is
required in order to model it faithfully. We provide experimental
implementations of a library of optics in Haskell and partial Agda
formalizations of the profunctor representation theorem.

Title: TEASER: Fast and Certifiable Point Cloud Registration

\\
  We propose the first fast and certifiable algorithm for the registration of
two sets of 3D points in the presence of large amounts of outlier
correspondences. Towards this goal, we first reformulate the registration
problem using a Truncated Least Squares (TLS) cost that makes the estimation
insensitive to spurious correspondences. Then, we provide a general
graph-theoretic framework to decouple scale, rotation, and translation
estimation, which allows solving in cascade for the three transformations.
Despite the fact that each subproblem is still non-convex and combinatorial in
nature, we show that (i) TLS scale and (component-wise) translation estimation
can be solved in polynomial time via an adaptive voting scheme, (ii) TLS
rotation estimation can be relaxed to a semidefinite program (SDP) and the
relaxation is tight, even in the presence of extreme outlier rates. We name the
resulting algorithm TEASER (Truncated least squares Estimation And SEmidefinite
Relaxation). While solving large SDP relaxations is typically slow, we develop
a second certifiable algorithm, named TEASER++, that circumvents the need to
solve an SDP and runs in milliseconds. For both algorithms, we provide
theoretical bounds on the estimation errors, which are the first of their kind
for robust registration problems. Moreover, we test their performance on
standard benchmarks, object detection datasets, and the 3DMatch scan matching
dataset, and show that (i) both algorithms dominate the state of the art (e.g.,
RANSAC, branch-&-bound, heuristics) and are robust to more than 99% outliers,
(ii) TEASER++ can run in milliseconds and it is currently the fastest robust
registration algorithm, (iii) TEASER++ is so robust it can also solve problems
without correspondences (e.g., hypothesizing all-to-all correspondences) where
it largely outperforms ICP. We release a fast open-source C++ implementation of
TEASER++.

Title: OmBURo: A Novel Unicycle Robot with Active Omnidirectional Wheel
Authors: Junjie Shen and Dennis Hong
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: ICRA 2020 Accepted
\\
  A mobility mechanism for robots to be used in tight spaces shared with people
requires it to have a small footprint, to move omnidirectionally, as well as to
be highly maneuverable. However, currently there exist few such mobility
mechanisms that satisfy all these conditions well. Here we introduce
Omnidirectional Balancing Unicycle Robot (OmBURo), a novel unicycle robot with
active omnidirectional wheel. The effect is that the unicycle robot can drive
in both longitudinal and lateral directions simultaneously. Thus, it can
dynamically balance itself based on the principle of dual-axis wheeled inverted
pendulum. This letter discloses the early development of this novel unicycle
robot involving the overall design, modeling, and control, as well as presents
some preliminary results including station keeping and path following. With its
very compact structure and agile mobility, it might be the ideal locomotion
mechanism for robots to be used in human environments in the future.

Title: Safe Robot Navigation via Multi-Modal Anomaly Detection
Authors: Lorenz Wellhausen, Ren\'e Ranftl, Marco Hutter
Categories: cs.RO
DOI: 10.1109/LRA.2020.2967706
\\
  Navigation in natural outdoor environments requires a robust and reliable
traversability classification method to handle the plethora of situations a
robot can encounter. Binary classification algorithms perform well in their
native domain but tend to provide overconfident predictions when presented with
out-of-distribution samples, which can lead to catastrophic failure when
navigating unknown environments. We propose to overcome this issue by using
anomaly detection on multi-modal images for traversability classification,
which is easily scalable by training in a self-supervised fashion from robot
experience. In this work, we evaluate multiple anomaly detection methods with a
combination of uni- and multi-modal images in their performance on data from
different environmental conditions. Our results show that an approach using a
feature extractor and normalizing flow with an input of RGB, depth and surface
normals performs best. It achieves over 95% area under the ROC curve and is
robust to out-of-distribution samples.

Title: On Simple Reactive Neural Networks for Behaviour-Based Reinforcement
  Learning
Authors: Ameya Pore and Gerardo Aragon-Camarasa
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We present a behaviour-based reinforcement learning approach, inspired by
Brook's subsumption architecture, in which simple fully connected networks are
trained as reactive behaviours. Our working assumption is that a pick and place
robotic task can be simplified by leveraging domain knowledge of a robotics
developer to decompose and train such reactive behaviours; namely, approach,
grasp, and retract. Then the robot autonomously learns how to combine them via
an Actor-Critic architecture. The Actor-Critic policy is to determine the
activation and inhibition mechanisms of the reactive behaviours in a particular
temporal sequence. We validate our approach in a simulated robot environment
where the task is picking a block and taking it to a target position while
orienting the gripper from a top grasp. The latter represents an extra
degree-of-freedom of which current end-to-end reinforcement learning fail to
generalise. Our findings suggest that robotic learning can be more effective if
each behaviour is learnt in isolation and then combined them to accomplish the
task. That is, our approach learns the pick and place task in 8,000 episodes,
which represents a drastic reduction in the number of training episodes
required by an end-to-end approach and the existing state-of-the-art
algorithms.

  Obstacles", IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2020
\\
  Uncertain dynamic obstacles, such as pedestrians or vehicles, pose a major
challenge for optimal robot navigation with safety guarantees. Previous work on
motion planning has followed two main strategies to provide a safe bound on an
obstacle's space: a polyhedron, such as a cuboid, or a nonlinear differentiable
surface, such as an ellipsoid. The former approach relies on disjunctive
programming, which has a relatively high computational cost that grows
exponentially with the number of obstacles. The latter approach needs to be
linearized locally to find a tractable evaluation of the chance constraints,
which dramatically reduces the remaining free space and leads to
over-conservative trajectories or even unfeasibility. In this work, we present
a hybrid approach that eludes the pitfalls of both strategies while maintaining
the original safety guarantees. The key idea consists in obtaining a safe
differentiable approximation for the disjunctive chance constraints bounding
the obstacles. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is free of chance
constraint linearization and disjunctive programming, and therefore, it can be
efficiently solved to meet fast real-time requirements with multiple obstacles.
We validate our approach through mathematical proof, simulation and real
experiments with an aerial robot using nonlinear model predictive control to
avoid pedestrians.

  In this paper, we address efficiently and robustly collecting objects stored
in different trays using a mobile manipulator. A resolution complete method,
based on precomputed reachability database, is proposed to explore
collision-free inverse kinematics (IK) solutions and then a resolution complete
set of feasible base positions can be determined. This method approximates a
set of representative IK solutions that are especially helpful when solving IK
and checking collision are treated separately. For real world applications, we
take into account the base positioning uncertainty and plan a sequence of base
positions that reduce the number of necessary base movements for collecting the
target objects, the base sequence is robust in that the mobile manipulator is
able to complete the part-supply task even there is certain deviation from the
planned base positions. Our experiments demonstrate both the efficiency
compared to regular base sequence and the feasibility in real world
applications.

\\
  E-commerce has evolved with the digital technology revolution over the years.
Last-mile logistics service contributes a significant part of the e-commerce
experience. In contrast to the traditional last-mile logistics services, smart
logistics service with autonomous driving technologies provides a promising
solution to reduce the delivery cost and to improve efficiency. However, the
traffic conditions in complex traffic environments, such as those in China, are
more challenging compared to those in well-developed countries. Many types of
moving objects (such as pedestrians, bicycles, electric bicycles, and
motorcycles, etc.) share the road with autonomous vehicles, and their behaviors
are not easy to track and predict. This paper introduces a technical solution
from JD.com, a leading E-commerce company in China, to the autonomous last-mile
delivery in complex traffic environments. Concretely, the methodologies in each
module of our autonomous vehicles are presented, together with safety guarantee
strategies. Up to this point, JD.com has deployed more than 300 self-driving
vehicles for trial operations in tens of provinces of China, with an
accumulated 715,819 miles and up to millions of on-road testing hours.

Title: Safety Considerations in Deep Control Policies with Probabilistic Safety
  Barrier Certificates
Authors: Tom Hirshberg, Sai Vemprala, Ashish Kapoor
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Recent advances in Deep Machine Learning have shown promise in solving
complex perception and control loops via methods such as reinforcement and
imitation learning. However, guaranteeing safety for such learned deep policies
has been a challenge due to issues such as partial observability and
difficulties in characterizing the behavior of the neural networks. While a lot
of emphasis in safe learning has been placed during training, it is non-trivial
to guarantee safety at deployment or test time. This paper extends the work on
Safety Barrier Certificates to guarantee safety with deep control policies
despite uncertainty arising due to perception and other latent variables. In
particular, the proposed framework wraps around the existing deep control
policy and generates safe actions by dynamically evaluating and modifying the
policy from the embedded network. Our framework utilizes control barrier
functions to create spaces of control actions that are probabilistically safe,
and when the original actions are found to be in violation of the safety
constraint, uses quadratic programming to minimally modify the original actions
to ensure they lie in the safe set. Representations of the environment are
built through Euclidean signed distance fields that are then used to infer the
safety of actions and to guarantee forward invariance. We implement this method
in simulation in a drone-racing environment and show that our method results in
safer actions compared to a baseline that only relies on imitation learning to
generate control actions.

\\
  The main scientific question of this year DCASE challenge, Task 4 - Sound
Event Detection in Domestic Environments, is to investigate the types of data
(strongly labeled synthetic data, weakly labeled data, unlabeled in domain
data) required to achieve the best performing system. In this paper, we
proposed a deep learning model that integrates Non-Negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The key idea of
such integration is to use NMF to provide an approximate strong label to the
weakly labeled data. Such integration was able to achieve a higher event-based
F1-score as compared to the baseline system (Evaluation Dataset: 30.39% vs.
23.7%, Validation Dataset: 31% vs. 25.8%). By comparing the validation results
with other participants, the proposed system was ranked 8th among 19 teams
(inclusive of the baseline system) in this year Task 4 challenge.

management. In this paper, we propose an original study of one such challenge:
the emergence of bloated dependencies.
  Bloated dependencies are libraries that the build tool packages with the
application's compiled code but that are actually not necessary to build and
run the application. This phenomenon artificially grows the size of the built
binary and increases maintenance effort. We propose a tool, called DepClean, to
analyze the presence of bloated dependencies in Maven artifacts. We analyze
9,639 Java artifacts hosted on Maven Central, which include a total of 723,444
dependency relationships. Our key result is that 75.1% of the analyzed
dependency relationships are bloated. In other words, it is feasible to reduce
the number of dependencies of Maven artifacts up to 1/4 of its current count.
We also perform a qualitative study with 30 notable open-source projects. Our
results indicate that developers pay attention to their dependencies and are
willing to remove bloated dependencies: 18/21 answered pull requests were
accepted and merged by developers, removing 131 dependencies in total.

Title: CDST: A Toolkit for Testing Cockpit Display Systems of Avionics
Authors: Hassan Sartaj, Muhammad Zohaib Iqbal and Muhammad Uzair Khan
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Avionics are highly critical systems that require extensive testing governed
by international safety standards. Cockpit Display Systems (CDS) are an
essential component of modern aircraft cockpits and display information from
the user application using various widgets. A significant step in the testing
of avionics is to evaluate whether these CDS are displaying the correct
information. A common industrial practice is to manually test the information
on these CDS by taking the aircraft into different scenarios during the
simulation. Given the large number of scenarios to test, manual testing of such
behavior is a laborious activity. In this paper, we present a CDST toolkit that
automates the testing of Cockpit Display Systems (CDS). We discuss the workflow
and architecture of the tool and also demonstrates the tool on an industrial
case study. The results show that the tool is able to generate, execute, and
evaluate the test cases and identify 3 bugs in the case study.

Title: Model-Based Cloud Resource Provisioning with TOSCA and OCCI
Authors: St\'ephanie Challita, Fabian Korte, Johannes Erbel, Faiez Zalila, Jens
  Grabowski and Philippe Merle
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  With the advent of cloud computing, different cloud providers with
heterogeneous cloud services (compute, storage, network, applications, etc.)
and their related Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have emerged. This
heterogeneity complicates the implementation of an interoperable cloud system.
Several standards have been proposed to address this challenge and provide a
unified interface to cloud resources. The Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI)
thereby focuses on the standardization of a common API for
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers while the Topology and
Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) focuses on the
standardization of a template language to enable the proper definition of the
topology of cloud applications and their orchestrations on top of a cloud
system. TOSCA thereby does not define how the application topologies are
created on the cloud. Therefore, we analyse the conceptual similarities between
the two approaches and we study how we can integrate them to obtain a complete
standard-based approach to manage both cloud infrastructure and cloud
application layers. We propose an automated extensive mapping between the
concepts of the two standards and we provide TOSCA Studio, a model-driven tool
chain for TOSCA that conforms to OCCI. TOSCA Studio allows to graphically
design cloud applications as well as to deploy and manage them at runtime using
a fully model-driven cloud orchestrator based on the two standards. Our
contribution is validated by successfully designing and deploying two cloud
applications: WordPress and Node Cellar.

Title: Adversarial Attack on Community Detection by Hiding Individuals

\\
  It has been demonstrated that adversarial graphs, i.e., graphs with
imperceptible perturbations added, can cause deep graph models to fail on
node/graph classification tasks. In this paper, we extend adversarial graphs to
the problem of community detection which is much more difficult. We focus on
black-box attack and aim to hide targeted individuals from the detection of
deep graph community detection models, which has many applications in
real-world scenarios, for example, protecting personal privacy in social
networks and understanding camouflage patterns in transaction networks. We
propose an iterative learning framework that takes turns to update two modules:
one working as the constrained graph generator and the other as the surrogate
community detection model. We also find that the adversarial graphs generated
by our method can be transferred to other learning based community detection
models.

Title: Simple and Fast Distributed Computation of Betweenness Centrality
Authors: Pierluigi Crescenzi, Pierre Fraigniaud, Ami Paz
Categories: cs.SI cs.DC
\\
  Betweenness centrality is a graph parameter that has been successfully
applied to network analysis. In the context of computer networks, it was
considered for various objectives, ranging from routing to service placement.
However, as observed by Maccari et al. [INFOCOM 2018], research on betweenness
centrality for improving protocols was hampered by the lack of a usable, fully
distributed algorithm for computing this parameter. We resolve this issue by
designing an efficient algorithm for computing betweenness centrality, which
can be implemented by minimal modifications to any distance-vector routing
protocol based on Bellman-Ford. The convergence time of our implementation is
shown to be proportional to the diameter of the network

Title: Impedance Modulation for Negotiating Control Authority in a Haptic
  Shared Control Paradigm
Authors: Vahid Izadi, Akshay Bhardwaj, and Amir H. Ghasemi
Categories: eess.SY cs.RO cs.SY
Comments: Accepted in the 2020 American Control Conference (ACC)
\\
  Communication and cooperation among team members can be enhanced
significantly with physical interaction. Successful collaboration requires the
integration of the individual partners' intentions into a shared action plan,
which may involve a continuous negotiation of intentions and roles. This paper
presents an adaptive haptic shared control framework wherein a human driver and
an automation system are physically connected through a motorized steering
wheel. By the virtue of haptic feedback, the driver and automation system can
monitor each other actions, and can still intuitively express their control
intentions. The objective of this paper is to develop a systematic model for an
automation system that can vary its impedance such that its interaction with a
human partner occurs as smoothly as that same interaction would occur between
two humans. To this end, we defined a cost function that not only ensures the
safety of the collaborative task but also takes account for the assistive
behavior of the automation system. We employed a predictive controller based on
modified non-negative least square to modulate the automation system impedance
such that the cost function is optimized. The results demonstrate the
significance of the proposed approach for negotiating the control authority,
specifically when human and automation are in a non-cooperative mode.
Furthermore, the performance of the adaptive haptic shared control is compared
with the traditional haptic shared control paradigm. Finally, future
experimental plan, its challenges, and our solution for those challenges are
discussed.

Title: Wide Area Measurement System-based Low Frequency Oscillation Damping
  Control through Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yousaf Hashmy, Zhe Yu, Di Shi, Yang Weng
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Ensuring the stability of power systems is gaining more attraction today than
ever before, due to the rapid growth of uncertainties in load and renewable
energy penetration. Lately, wide area measurement system-based centralized
controlling techniques started providing a more flexible and robust control to
keep the system stable. But, such a modernization of control philosophy faces
pressing challenges due to the irregularities in delays of long-distance
communication channels and response of equipment to control actions. Therefore,
we propose an innovative approach that can revolutionize the control strategy
for damping down low frequency oscillations in transmission systems. Proposed
method is enriched with a potential of overcoming the challenges of
communication delays and other non-linearities in wide area damping control by
leveraging the capability of the reinforcement learning technique. Such a
technique has a unique characteristic to learn on diverse scenarios and
operating conditions by exploring the environment and devising an optimal
control action policy by implementing policy gradient method. Our detailed
analysis and systematically designed numerical validation prove the
feasibility, scalability and interpretability of the carefully modelled
low-frequency oscillation damping controller so that stability is ensured even
with the uncertainties of load and generation are on the rise.

Authors: Achin Jain, Francesco Smarra, Enrico Reticcioli, Alessandro
  D'Innocenzo, and Manfred Morari
Categories: eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY
\\
  Model predictive control (MPC) can provide significant energy cost savings in
building operations in the form of energy-efficient control with better
occupant comfort, lower peak demand charges, and risk-free participation in
demand response. However, the engineering effort required to obtain
physics-based models of buildings for MPC is considered to be the biggest
bottleneck in making MPC scalable to real buildings. In this paper, we propose
a data-driven control algorithm based on neural networks to reduce this cost of
model identification. Our approach does not require building domain expertise
or retrofitting of the existing heating and cooling systems. We validate our
learning and control algorithms on a two-story building with 10 independently
controlled zones, located in Italy. We learn dynamical models of energy
consumption and zone temperatures with high accuracy and demonstrate energy
savings and better occupant comfort compared to the default system controller.

Title: Delay and Packet-Drop Tolerant Multi-Stage Distributed Average Tracking
  in Mean Square
Authors: Fei Chen, Changjiang Chen, Ge Guo, Changchun Hua, Guanrong Chen
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper studies the distributed average tracking problem pertaining to a
discrete-time linear time-invariant multi-agent network, which is subject to,
concurrently, input delays, random packet-drops, and reference noise. The
problem amounts to an integrated design of delay and packet-drop tolerant
algorithm and determining the ultimate upper bound of the tracking error
between agents' states and the average of the reference signals. The
investigation is driven by the goal of devising a practically more attainable
average tracking algorithm, thereby extending the existing work in the
literature which largely ignored the aforementioned uncertainties. For this
purpose, a blend of techniques from Kalman filtering, multi-stage consensus
filtering, and predictive control is employed, which gives rise to a simple yet
comepelling distributed average tracking algorithm that is robust to
initialization error and allows the trade-off between communication/computation
cost and stationary-state tracking error. Due to the inherent coupling among
different control components, convergence analysis is significantly
challenging. Nevertheless, it is revealed that the allowable values of the
algorithm parameters rely upon the maximal degree of an expected network, while
the convergence speed depends upon the second smallest eigenvalue of the same
network's topology. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by
a numerical example.

Title: Energy-efficient Runtime Resource Management for Adaptable
  Multi-application Mapping
Authors: Robert Khasanov, Jeronimo Castrillon
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Final version to appear in DATE 2020. 6 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Modern embedded computing platforms consist of a high amount of heterogeneous
resources, which allows executing multiple applications on a single device. The
number of running application on the system varies with time and so does the
amount of available resources. This has considerably increased the complexity
of analysis and optimization algorithms for runtime mapping of firm real-time
applications. To reduce the runtime overhead, researchers have proposed to
pre-compute partial mappings at compile time and have the runtime efficiently
compute the final mapping. However, most existing solutions only compute a
fixed mapping for a given set of running applications, and the mapping is
defined for the entire duration of the workload execution. In this work we
allow applications to adapt to the amount of available resources by using
mapping segments. This way, applications may switch between different
configurations with varied degree of parallelism. We present a runtime manager
for firm real-time applications that generates such mapping segments based on
partial solutions and aims at minimizing the overall energy consumption without
deadline violations. The proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches on the overall energy consumption by up to 13% while incurring an
order of magnitude less scheduling overhead.

  We analyze the performance of the Tukey median estimator under total

additive corruption model, the breakdown point is 1/3 for high-dimensional
halfspace-symmetric distributions. We show that under TV corruptions, the
breakdown point reduces to 1/4 for the same set of distributions. We also show
that a certain projection algorithm can attain the optimal breakdown point of
1/2. Both the Tukey median estimator and the projection algorithm achieve
sample complexity linear in dimension.

  The reach of a submanifold is a crucial regularity parameter for manifold
learning and geometric inference from point clouds. This paper relates the
reach of a submanifold to its convexity defect function. Using the stability
properties of convexity defect functions, along with some new bounds and the
recent submanifold estimator of Aamari and Levrard [Ann. Statist. 47 177-204
(2019)], an estimator for the reach is given. A uniform expected loss bound
over a C^k model is found. Lower bounds for the minimax rate for estimating the
reach over these models are also provided. The estimator almost achieves these
rates in the C^3 and C^4 cases, with a gap given by a logarithmic factor.

Comments: Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational
  Intelligence
\\
  An effective approach for voice conversion (VC) is to disentangle linguistic
content from other components in the speech signal. The effectiveness of
variational autoencoder (VAE) based VC (VAE-VC), for instance, strongly relies
on this principle. In our prior work, we proposed a cross-domain VAE-VC
(CDVAE-VC) framework, which utilized acoustic features of different properties,
to improve the performance of VAE-VC. We believed that the success came from
more disentangled latent representations. In this paper, we extend the CDVAE-VC
framework by incorporating the concept of adversarial learning, in order to
further increase the degree of disentanglement, thereby improving the quality
and similarity of converted speech. More specifically, we first investigate the
effectiveness of incorporating the generative adversarial networks (GANs) with
CDVAE-VC. Then, we consider the concept of domain adversarial training and add
an explicit constraint to the latent representation, realized by a speaker
classifier, to explicitly eliminate the speaker information that resides in the
latent code. Experimental results confirm that the degree of disentanglement of
the learned latent representation can be enhanced by both GANs and the speaker
classifier. Meanwhile, subjective evaluation results in terms of quality and
similarity scores demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Title: Physical Layer Authentication for Non-coherent Massive SIMO-Based
  Industrial IoT Communications
Authors: Zhifang Gu, He Chen, Pingping Xu, Yonghui Li and Branka Vucetic
Categories: eess.SP cs.CR cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Achieving ultra-reliable, low-latency and secure communications is essential
for realizing the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Non-coherent massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has recently been proposed as a promising
methodology to fulfill ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements. In
addition, physical layer authentication (PLA) technology is particularly
suitable for IIoT communications thanks to its low-latency attribute. A PLA
method for non-coherent massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) IIoT
communication systems is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we first
determine the optimal embedding of the authentication information (tag) in the
message information. We then optimize the power allocation between message and
tag signal to characterize the trade-off between message and tag error
performance. Numerical results show that the proposed PLA is more accurate then
traditional methods adopting the uniform tag when the communication reliability
remains at the same level. The proposed PLA method can be effectively applied
to the non-coherent system.

  Preventing the oversight of anomalies in chest X-ray radiographs (CXRs)
during diagnosis is a crucial issue. Deep learning (DL)-based anomaly detection
methods are rapidly growing in popularity, and provide effective solutions to
the problem, but the workload in labeling CXRs during the training procedure
remains heavy. To reduce the workload, a novel anomaly detection method for
CXRs based on weakly supervised DL is presented in this study. The DL is based
on a flow-based deep neural network (DNN) framework with which two normality
metrics (logarithm likelihood and logarithm likelihood ratio) can be
calculated. With this method, only one set of normal CXRs requires labeling to
train the DNN, then the normality of any unknown CXR can be evaluated. The area
under the receiver operation characteristic curve acquired with the logarithm
likelihood ratio metric ($\approx0.783$) was greater than that obtained with
the logarithm likelihood metric, and was a value comparable to those in
previous studies where other weakly supervised DNNs were implemented.

Title: DeepFL-IQA: Weak Supervision for Deep IQA Feature Learning
Authors: Hanhe Lin, Vlad Hosu, Dietmar Saupe
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: dataset url: http://database.mmsp-kn.de
\\
  Multi-level deep-features have been driving state-of-the-art methods for
aesthetics and image quality assessment (IQA). However, most IQA benchmarks are
comprised of artificially distorted images, for which features derived from
ImageNet under-perform. We propose a new IQA dataset and a weakly supervised
feature learning approach to train features more suitable for IQA of
artificially distorted images. The dataset, KADIS-700k, is far more extensive
than similar works, consisting of 140,000 pristine images, 25 distortions
types, totaling 700k distorted versions. Our weakly supervised feature learning
is designed as a multi-task learning type training, using eleven existing
full-reference IQA metrics as proxies for differential mean opinion scores. We
also introduce a benchmark database, KADID-10k, of artificially degraded
images, each subjectively annotated by 30 crowd workers. We make use of our
derived image feature vectors for (no-reference) image quality assessment by
training and testing a shallow regression network on this database and five
other benchmark IQA databases. Our method, termed DeepFL-IQA, performs better
than other feature-based no-reference IQA methods and also better than all
tested full-reference IQA methods on KADID-10k. For the other five benchmark
IQA databases, DeepFL-IQA matches the performance of the best existing
end-to-end deep learning-based methods on average.

Title: Optimizing Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Super Resolution
  via Latent Space Regularization
Authors: Sheng Zhong and Shifu Zhou (Agora.io)
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Natural images can be regarded as residing in a manifold that is embedded in
a higher dimensional Euclidean space. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
try to learn the distribution of the real images in the manifold to generate
samples that look real. But the results of existing methods still exhibit many
unpleasant artifacts and distortions even for the cases where the desired
ground truth target images are available for supervised learning such as in
single image super resolution (SISR). We probe for ways to alleviate these
problems for supervised GANs in this paper. We explicitly apply the Lipschitz
Continuity Condition (LCC) to regularize the GAN. An encoding network that maps
the image space to a new optimal latent space is derived from the LCC, and it
is used to augment the GAN as a coupling component. The LCC is also converted
to new regularization terms in the generator loss function to enforce local
invariance. The GAN is optimized together with the encoding network in an
attempt to make the generator converge to a more ideal and disentangled mapping
that can generate samples more faithful to the target images. When the proposed
models are applied to the single image super resolution problem, the results
outperform the state of the art.

analytical studies mostly consider the simplest case of a network that grows
uniformly in time despite the accelerating growth of many real networks.
Motivated by the observation that the average degree growth of nodes is
time-invariant in empirical network data, we study the degree dynamics in the
relevant class of network models where preferential attachment is combined with
heterogeneous node fitness and aging. We propose a novel analytical framework
based on the time-invariance of the studied systems and show that it is
self-consistent only for two special network growth forms: the uniform and
exponential network growth. Conversely, the breaking of such time-invariance
explains the winner-takes-all effect in some model settings, revealing the
connection between the Bose-Einstein condensation in the Bianconi-Barab\'{a}si
model and similar gelation in superlinear preferential attachment. Aging is
necessary to reproduce realistic node degree growth curves and can prevent the
winner-takes-all effect under weak conditions. Our results are verified by
extensive numerical simulations.

Title: Zeroth-Order Algorithms for Nonconvex Minimax Problems with Improved
  Complexities
Authors: Zhongruo Wang, Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Shiqian Ma, Meisam

\\
  In this paper, we study zeroth-order algorithms for minimax optimization
problems that are nonconvex in one variable and strongly-concave in the other
variable. Such minimax optimization problems have attracted significant
attention lately due to their applications in modern machine learning tasks. We
first design and analyze the Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent Ascent
(\texttt{ZO-GDA}) algorithm, and provide improved results compared to existing
works, in terms of oracle complexity. Next, we propose the Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent Multi-Step Ascent (\texttt{ZO-GDMSA}) algorithm that
significantly improves the oracle complexity of \texttt{ZO-GDA}. We also
provide stochastic version of \texttt{ZO-GDA} and \texttt{ZO-GDMSA} to handle
stochastic nonconvex minimax problems, and provide oracle complexity results.

Title: Optimal estimation of sparse topic models
Authors: Xin Bing and Florentina Bunea and Marten Wegkamp
Categories: stat.ML cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  Topic models have become popular tools for dimension reduction and
exploratory analysis of text data which consists in observed frequencies of a
vocabulary of $p$ words in $n$ documents, stored in a $p\times n$ matrix. The
main premise is that the mean of this data matrix can be factorized into a
product of two non-negative matrices: a $p\times K$ word-topic matrix $A$ and a
$K\times n$ topic-document matrix $W$. This paper studies the estimation of $A$
that is possibly element-wise sparse, and the number of topics $K$ is unknown.
In this under-explored context, we derive a new minimax lower bound for the
estimation of such $A$ and propose a new computationally efficient algorithm
for its recovery. We derive a finite sample upper bound for our estimator, and
show that it matches the minimax lower bound in many scenarios. Our estimate
adapts to the unknown sparsity of $A$ and our analysis is valid for any finite
$n$, $p$, $K$ and document lengths. Empirical results on both synthetic data
and semi-synthetic data show that our proposed estimator is a strong competitor
of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms for both non-sparse $A$ and sparse
$A$, and has superior performance is many scenarios of interest.

Title: Keyword-based Topic Modeling and Keyword Selection
Authors: Xingyu Wang, Lida Zhang, Diego Klabjan
Categories: stat.ML cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  Certain type of documents such as tweets are collected by specifying a set of
keywords. As topics of interest change with time it is beneficial to adjust
keywords dynamically. The challenge is that these need to be specified ahead of
knowing the forthcoming documents and the underlying topics. The future topics
should mimic past topics of interest yet there should be some novelty in them.
We develop a keyword-based topic model that dynamically selects a subset of
keywords to be used to collect future documents. The generative process first
selects keywords and then the underlying documents based on the specified
keywords. The model is trained by using a variational lower bound and
stochastic gradient optimization. The inference consists of finding a subset of
keywords where given a subset the model predicts the underlying topic-word
matrix for the unknown forthcoming documents. We compare the keyword topic
model against a benchmark model using viral predictions of tweets combined with
a topic model. The keyword-based topic model outperforms this sophisticated
baseline model by 67%.

Title: Towards Comparability in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring: On Data and
  Performance Evaluation
Authors: Christoph Klemenjak, Stephen Makonin and Wilfried Elmenreich
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
\\
  Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) comprises of a set of techniques that
provide insights into the energy consumption of households and industrial
facilities. Latest contributions show significant improvements in terms of
accuracy and generalisation abilities. Despite all progress made concerning
disaggregation techniques, performance evaluation and comparability remains an
open research question. The lack of standardisation and consensus on evaluation
procedures makes reproducibility and comparability extremely difficult. In this
paper, we draw attention to comparability in NILM with a focus on highlighting
the considerable differences amongst common energy datasets used to test the
performance of algorithms. We divide discussion on comparability into data
aspects, performance metrics, and give a close view on evaluation processes.
Detailed information on pre-processing as well as data cleaning methods, the
importance of unified performance reporting, and the need for complexity
measures in load disaggregation are found to be the most urgent issues in
NILM-related research. In addition, our evaluation suggests that datasets
should be chosen carefully. We conclude by formulating suggestions for future
work to enhance comparability.

  Traditional online maps, widely used on Internet such as Google map and Baidu
map, are rendered from vector data. Timely updating online maps from vector
data, of which the generating is time-consuming, is a difficult mission. It is
a shortcut to generate online maps in time from remote sensing images, which
can be acquired timely without vector data. However, this mission used to be
challenging or even impossible. Inspired by image-to-image translation
(img2img) techniques based on generative adversarial network (GAN), we propose
a semi-supervised structure-augmented online map GAN (S$^{2}$OMGAN) model to
generate online maps directly from remote sensing images. In this model, we
designed a semi-supervised learning strategy to pre-train S$^{2}$OMGAN on rich
unpaired samples and finetune it on limited paired samples in reality. We also
designed image gradient L1 loss and image gradient structure loss to generate
an online map with global topological relationship and detailed edge curves of
objects, which are important in cartography. Moreover, we propose edge
structural similarity index (ESSI) as a metric to evaluate the quality of
topological consistency between generated online maps and ground truths.
Experimental results present that S$^{2}$OMGAN outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) works according to mean squared error, structural similarity index and
ESSI. Also, S$^{2}$OMGAN wins more approval than SOTA in the human perceptual
test on visual realism of cartography. Our work shows that S$^{2}$OMGAN is
potentially a new paradigm to produce online maps. Our implementation of the
S$^{2}$OMGAN is available at \url{https://github.com/imcsq/S2OMGAN}.

\\
  With the growing demand for data connectivity, network service providers are
faced with the task of reducing their capital and operational expenses while
simultaneously improving network performance and addressing the increased
connectivity demand. Although Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has been
identified as a solution, several challenges must be addressed to ensure its
feasibility. In this paper, we address the Virtual Network Function (VNF)
placement problem by developing a machine learning decision tree model that
learns from the effective placement of the various VNF instances forming a
Service Function Chain (SFC). The model takes several performance-related
features from the network as an input and selects the placement of the various
VNF instances on network servers with the objective of minimizing the delay
between dependent VNF instances. The benefits of using machine learning are
realized by moving away from a complex mathematical modelling of the system and
towards a data-based understanding of the system. Using the Evolved Packet Core
(EPC) as a use case, we evaluate our model on different data center networks
and compare it to the BACON algorithm in terms of the delay between
interconnected components and the total delay across the SFC. Furthermore, a
time complexity analysis is performed to show the effectiveness of the model in
NFV applications.

Title: A Deep Learning Algorithm for High-Dimensional Exploratory Item Factor
  Analysis
Authors: Christopher J. Urban and Daniel J. Bauer
Categories: stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 31 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Deep learning methods are the gold standard for non-linear statistical
modeling in computer vision and in natural language processing but are rarely
used in psychometrics. To bridge this gap, we present a novel deep learning
algorithm for exploratory item factor analysis (IFA). Our approach combines a
deep artificial neural network (ANN) model called a variational autoencoder
(VAE) with recent work that uses regularization for exploratory factor
analysis. We first provide overviews of ANNs and VAEs. We then describe how to
conduct exploratory IFA with a VAE and demonstrate our approach in two
empirical examples and in two simulated examples. Our empirical results were
consistent with existing psychological theory across random starting values.
Our simulations suggest that the VAE consistently recovers the data generating
factor pattern with moderate-sized samples. Secondary loadings were
underestimated with a complex factor structure and intercept parameter
estimates were moderately biased with both simple and complex factor
structures. All models converged in minutes, even with hundreds of thousands of
observations, hundreds of items, and tens of factors. We conclude that the VAE
offers a powerful new approach to fitting complex statistical models in
psychological and educational measurement.

  Connected Drones

  Cavdar
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Enabling cellular connectivity for drones introduces a wide set of challenges
and opportunities. Communication of cellular-connected drones is influenced by
3-dimensional mobility and line-of-sight channel characteristics which results
in higher number of handovers with increasing altitude. Our cell planning
simulations in coexistence of aerial and terrestrial users indicate that the
severe interference from drones to base stations is a major challenge for
uplink communications of terrestrial users. Here, we first present the major
challenges in co-existence of terrestrial and drone communications by
considering real geographical network data for Stockholm. Then, we derive
analytical models for the key performance indicators (KPIs), including
communications delay and interference over cellular networks, and formulate the
handover and radio resource management (H-RRM) optimization problem.
Afterwards, we transform this problem into a machine learning problem, and
propose a deep reinforcement learning solution to solve H-RRM problem. Finally,
using simulation results, we present how the speed and altitude of drones, and
the tolerable level of interference, shape the optimal H-RRM policy in the
network. Especially, the heat-maps of handover decisions in different drone's
altitudes/speeds have been presented, which promote a revision of the legacy
handover schemes and redefining the boundaries of cells in the sky.

Title: On Last-Layer Algorithms for Classification: Decoupling Representation
  from Uncertainty Estimation
Authors: Nicolas Brosse, Carlos Riquelme, Alice Martin, Sylvain Gelly, \'Eric
  Moulines
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Uncertainty quantification for deep learning is a challenging open problem.
Bayesian statistics offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about
uncertainties; however, approximate posteriors for modern neural networks still
require prohibitive computational costs. We propose a family of algorithms
which split the classification task into two stages: representation learning
and uncertainty estimation. We compare four specific instances, where
uncertainty estimation is performed via either an ensemble of Stochastic
Gradient Descent or Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics snapshots, an
ensemble of bootstrapped logistic regressions, or via a number of Monte Carlo
Dropout passes. We evaluate their performance in terms of \emph{selective}
classification (risk-coverage), and their ability to detect out-of-distribution
samples. Our experiments suggest there is limited value in adding multiple
uncertainty layers to deep classifiers, and we observe that these simple
methods strongly outperform a vanilla point-estimate SGD in some complex
benchmarks like ImageNet.

  Computer simulations are invaluable tools for scientific discovery. However,
accurate simulations are often slow to execute, which limits their
applicability to extensive parameter exploration, large-scale data analysis,
and uncertainty quantification. A promising route to accelerate simulations by
building fast emulators with machine learning requires large training datasets,
which can be prohibitively expensive to obtain with slow simulations. Here we
present a method based on neural architecture search to build accurate
emulators even with a limited number of training data. The method successfully
accelerates simulations by up to 2 billion times in 10 scientific cases
including astrophysics, climate science, biogeochemistry, high energy density
physics, fusion energy, and seismology, using the same super-architecture,
algorithm, and hyperparameters. Our approach also inherently provides emulator
uncertainty estimation, adding further confidence in their use. We anticipate
this work will accelerate research involving expensive simulations, allow more
extensive parameters exploration, and enable new, previously unfeasible
computational discovery.

  Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) is a
perceptual-driven approach for single image super resolution that is able to
produce photorealistic images. Despite the visual quality of these generated
images, there is still room for improvement. In this fashion, the model is
extended to further improve the perceptual quality of the images. We have
designed a novel block to replace the one used by the original ESRGAN.
Moreover, we introduce noise inputs to the generator network in order to
exploit stochastic variation. The resulting images present more realistic
textures.

Authors: Shakiba Yaghoubi, Georgios Fainekos, Sriram Sankaranarayanan
Categories: math.OC cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
\\
  Control Barrier Functions (CBF) have been recently utilized in the design of
provably safe feedback control laws for nonlinear systems. These feedback
control methods typically compute the next control input by solving an online
Quadratic Program (QP). Solving QP in real-time can be a computationally
expensive process for resource constraint systems. In this work, we propose to
use imitation learning to learn Neural Network-based feedback controllers which
will satisfy the CBF constraints. In the process, we also develop a new class
of High Order CBF for systems under external disturbances. We demonstrate the
framework on a unicycle model subject to external disturbances, e.g., wind or
currents.

  federated learning

Comments: 13 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Large-scale collections of electronic records constitutes both an opportunity
for the development of more accurate prediction models and a threat for
privacy. To limit privacy exposure new privacy-enhancing techniques are
emerging such as federated learning which enables large-scale data analysis
while avoiding the centralization of records in a unique database that would
represent a critical point of failure. Although promising regarding privacy
protection, federated learning prevents using some data-cleaning algorithms
thus inducing new biases. In this work we focus on the recurrent problem of
duplicated records that, if not handled properly, may cause over-optimistic
estimations of a model's performances. We introduce and discuss stratified
cross-validation, a validation methodology that leverages stratification
techniques to prevent data leakage in federated learning settings without
relying on demanding deduplication algorithms.

\\
  Car-sharing issue is a popular research field in sharing economy. In this
paper, we investigate the car-sharing relocation problem (CSRP) under uncertain
demands. Normally, the real customer demands follow complicating probability
distribution which cannot be described by parametric approaches. In order to
overcome the problem, an innovative framework called Data-Driven Kernel
Stochastic Programming (DDKSP) that integrates a non-parametric approach -
kernel density estimation (KDE) and a two-stage stochastic programming (SP)
model is proposed. Specifically, the probability distributions are derived from
historical data by KDE, which are used as the input uncertain parameters for
SP. Additionally, the CSRP is formulated as a two-stage SP model. Meanwhile, a
Monte Carlo method called sample average approximation (SAA) and Benders
decomposition algorithm are introduced to solve the large-scale optimization
model. Finally, the numerical experimental validations which are based on New
York taxi trip data sets show that the proposed framework outperforms the pure
parametric approaches including Gaussian, Laplace and Poisson distributions
with 3.72% , 4.58% and 11% respectively in terms of overall profits.

setting some of its entries to zero. All solutions are then combined to
represent the result in a parametric form in terms of a matrix whose columns
form a complete system of generators for the solution. We describe the
computational technique proposed to solve the problem, and illustrate this

Title: The Convergence of Finite-Averaging of AIMD for Distributed
  Heterogeneous Resource Allocations
Authors: Syed Eqbal Alam, Fabian Wirth, Jia Yuan Yu, Robert Shorten
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  In several social choice problems, agents collectively make decisions over
the allocation of multiple divisible and heterogeneous resources with capacity
constraints to maximize utilitarian social welfare. The agents are constrained
through computational or communication resources or privacy considerations. In
this paper, we analyze the convergence of a recently proposed distributed
solution that allocates such resources to agents with minimal communication. It
is based on the randomized additive-increase and multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)
algorithm. The agents are not required to exchange information with each other,
but little with a central agent that keeps track of the aggregate resource
allocated at a time. We formulate the time-averaged allocations over finite
window size and model the system as a Markov chain with place-dependent
probabilities. Furthermore, we show that the time-averaged allocations vector
converges to a unique invariant measure, and also, the ergodic property holds.

Title: Mixed-Integer Path-Stable Optimisation, with Applications in
  Model-Predictive Control of Water Systems
Authors: Jorn Baayen and Jakub Marecek
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Many systems exhibit a mixture of continuous and discrete dynamics. We
consider a family of mixed-integer non-convex non-linear optimisation problems
obtained in discretisations of optimal control of such systems. For this
family, a branch-and-bound algorithm solves the discretised problem to global
optimality.
  As an example, we consider water systems, where variations in flow and
variations in water levels are continuous, while decisions related to
fixed-speed pumps and whether gates that may be opened and closed are discrete.
We show that the related optimal-control problems come from the family we
introduce -- and implement deterministic solvers with global convergence
guarantees.
