Title: Towards Multi-perspective conformance checking with fuzzy sets

\\
  Conformance checking techniques are widely adopted to pinpoint possible
discrepancies between process models and the execution of the process in
reality. However, state of the art approaches adopt a crisp evaluation of
deviations, with the result that small violations are considered at the same
level of significant ones. This affects the quality of the provided
diagnostics, especially when there exists some tolerance with respect to
reasonably small violations, and hampers the flexibility of the process. In
this work, we propose a novel approach which allows to represent actors'
tolerance with respect to violations and to account for severity of deviations
when assessing executions compliance. We argue that besides improving the
quality of the provided diagnostics, allowing some tolerance in deviations
assessment also enhances the flexibility of conformance checking techniques
and, indirectly, paves the way for improving the resilience of the overall
process management system.

  The target of this paper is to present an industry-ready prototype software
for general game playing. This software can also be used as the central element
for experimental economics research, interfacing of game-theoretic libraries,
AI-driven software testing, algorithmic trade, human behavior mining and

Title: A New Arc-Routing Algorithm Applied to Winter Road Maintenance
Authors: Ji\v{r}\'i Fink, Martin Loebl, Petra Pelik\'anov\'a
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 15 pages, 2 figures
\\
  This paper studies large scale instances of a fairly general arc-routing
problem as well as incorporate practical constraints in particular coming from
the scheduling problem of the winter road maintenance (e.g. different
priorities for and methods of road maintenance). We develop a new algorithm
based on a bin-packing heuristic which is well-scalable and able to solve road
networks on thousands of crossroads and road segments in few minutes. Since it
is impossible to find an optimal solution for such a large instances to compare
it with a result of our algorithm, we also develop techniques to compute lower
bounds which are based on Integer Linear Programming and Lazy Constraints.

Title: Smart Induction for Isabelle/HOL (System Description)

Categories: cs.AI cs.LO cs.PL cs.SC
Comments: Under submission at IJCAR2020 as a System Description
\\
  Proof assistants offer tactics to facilitate inductive proofs. However, it
still requires human ingenuity to decide what arguments to pass to those
induction tactics. To automate this process, we present smart_induct for
Isabelle/HOL. Given an inductive problem in any problem domain, smart_induct
lists promising arguments for the induct tactic without relying on a search.
Our evaluation demonstrated smart_induct produces valuable recommendations
across problem domains.

Title: Interventions and Counterfactuals in Tractable Probabilistic Models:
  Limitations of Contemporary Transformations
Authors: Ioannis Papantonis, Vaishak Belle
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in studying
causality-related properties in machine learning models generally, and in
generative models in particular. While that is well motivated, it inherits the
fundamental computational hardness of probabilistic inference, making exact
reasoning intractable. Probabilistic tractable models have also recently
emerged, which guarantee that conditional marginals can be computed in time
linear in the size of the model, where the model is usually learned from data.
Although initially limited to low tree-width models, recent tractable models
such as sum product networks (SPNs) and probabilistic sentential decision
diagrams (PSDDs) exploit efficient function representations and also capture
high tree-width models.
  In this paper, we ask the following technical question: can we use the
distributions represented or learned by these models to perform causal queries,
such as reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals? By appealing to some
existing ideas on transforming such models to Bayesian networks, we answer
mostly in the negative. We show that when transforming SPNs to a causal graph
interventional reasoning reduces to computing marginal distributions; in other
words, only trivial causal reasoning is possible. For PSDDs the situation is
only slightly better. We first provide an algorithm for constructing a causal
graph from a PSDD, which introduces augmented variables. Intervening on the
original variables, once again, reduces to marginal distributions, but when
intervening on the augmented variables, a deterministic but nonetheless
causal-semantics can be provided for PSDDs.

Title: Stochastic L-system Inference from Multiple String Sequence Inputs
Authors: Jason Bernard, Ian McQuillan
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 24 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Applied Soft Computing
\\
  Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) are a grammar system that consist of string
rewriting rules. The rules replace every symbol in a string in parallel with a
successor to produce the next string, and this procedure iterates. In a
stochastic context-free L-system (S0L-system), every symbol may have one or
more rewriting rule, each with an associated probability of selection. Properly
constructed rewriting rules have been found to be useful for modeling and
simulating some natural and human engineered processes where each derived
string describes a step in the simulation. Typically, processes are modeled by
experts who meticulously construct the rules based on measurements or domain
knowledge of the process. This paper presents an automated approach to finding
stochastic L-systems, given a set of string sequences as input. The implemented
tool is called the Plant Model Inference Tool for S0L-systems (PMIT-S0L).
PMIT-S0L is evaluated using 960 procedurally generated S0L-systems in a test
suite, which are each used to generate input strings, and PMIT-S0L is then used
to infer the system from only the sequences. The evaluation shows that PMIT-S0L
infers S0L-systems with up to 9 rewriting rules each in under 12 hours.
Additionally, it is found that 3 sequences of strings is sufficient to find the
correct original rewriting rules in 100% of the cases in the test suite, and 6
sequences of strings reduces the difference in the associated probabilities to
approximately 1% or less.

Title: Human Action Performance using Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Recurrent Attention
  Model
Authors: Nihar Bendre, Nima Ebadi and Paul Rad
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures, Under review for IEEE Access Journal
\\
  A great number of computer vision publications have focused on distinguishing
between human action recognition and classification rather than the intensity
of actions performed. Indexing the intensity which determines the performance
of human actions is a challenging task due to the uncertainty and information
deficiency that exists in the video inputs. To remedy this uncertainty, in this
paper, we coupled fuzzy logic rules with the neural-based action recognition
model to index the intensity of the action as intense or mild. In our approach,
we define fuzzy logic rules to detect the intensity index of the performed
action using the weights generated by the Spatio-Temporal LSTM and demonstrate
through experiments that indexing of the action intensity is possible. We
analyzed the integrated model by applying it to videos of human actions with
different action intensities and were able to achieve an accuracy of 89.16% on
our generated dataset for intensity indexing. The integrated model demonstrates
the ability of the fuzzy inference module to effectively estimate the intensity
index of the human action.

Title: On the Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Distributed Ledger
  Technology: A Scoping Review and Future Research Agenda
Authors: Konstantin D. Pandl, Scott Thiebes, Manuel Schmidt-Kraepelin, Ali
  Sunyaev
Categories: cs.AI cs.CR cs.DC
Comments: 21 pages
\\
  Developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Distributed Ledger
Technology (DLT) currently lead lively debates in academia and practice. AI
processes data to perform tasks that were previously thought possible only for
humans to perform. DLT acts in uncertain environments to create consensus over
data among a group of participants. In recent articles, both technologies
complement each other. Examples include the design of secure distributed
ledgers or the creation of allied learning systems distributed across multiple
nodes. This can lead to technological convergence, which in the past, has paved
the way for major IT product innovations. Previous work highlights several
potential benefits of the convergence of AI and DLT but only provides a limited
theoretical framework to describe upcoming real-world integration cases of both
technologies. We aim to contribute by conducting a systematic literature review
on the previous work and by providing rigorously derived future research
opportunities. Our analysis identifies how AI and DLT exchange data, and how to
use these integration principles to build new systems. Based on that, we
present open questions for future research. This work helps researchers active
in AI or DLT to overcome current limitations in their field, and engineers to
develop systems along with the convergence of these technologies.

Title: qBSA: Logic Design of a 32-bit Block-Skewed RSFQ Arithmetic Logic Unit
Authors: Souvik Kundu, Gourav datta, Peter A. Beerel, Massoud Pedram
Categories: cs.AR
Comments: 3 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits are an attractive beyond-CMOS technology
because they promise two orders of magnitude lower power at clock frequencies
exceeding 25 GHz.However, every SFQ gate is clocked creating very deep
gate-level pipelines that are difficult to keep full, particularly for
sequences that include data-dependent operations. This paper proposes to
increase the throughput of SFQ pipelines by re-designing the datapath to accept
and operate on least-significant bits (LSBs) clock cycles earlier than more
significant bits. This skewed datapath approach reduces the latency of the LSB
side which can be feedback earlier for use in subsequent data-dependent
operations increasing their throughput. In particular,we propose to group the
bits into 4-bit blocks that are operatedon concurrently and create block-skewed
datapath units for 32-bit operation. This skewed approach allows a subsequent
data-dependent operation to start evaluating as soon as the first 4-bit block
completes. Using this general approach, we developa block-skewed
MIPS-compatible 32-bit ALU. Our gate-level Verilog design improves the
throughput of 32-bit data dependent operations by 2x and 1.5x compared to
previously proposed 4-bit bit-slice and 32-bit Ladner-Fischer ALUs
respectively.

Title: Pre-defined Sparsity for Low-Complexity Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Souvik Kundu, Mahdi Nazemi, Massoud Pedram, Keith M. Chugg, Peter A.

Categories: cs.CC cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 13 figures
\\
  The high energy cost of processing deep convolutional neural networks impedes
their ubiquitous deployment in energy-constrained platforms such as embedded
systems and IoT devices. This work introduces convolutional layers with
pre-defined sparse 2D kernels that have support sets that repeat periodically
within and across filters. Due to the efficient storage of our periodic sparse
kernels, the parameter savings can translate into considerable improvements in
energy efficiency due to reduced DRAM accesses, thus promising significant
improvements in the trade-off between energy consumption and accuracy for both
training and inference. To evaluate this approach, we performed experiments
with two widely accepted datasets, CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet in sparse
variants of the ResNet18 and VGG16 architectures. Compared to baseline models,
our proposed sparse variants require up to 82% fewer model parameters with
5.6times fewer FLOPs with negligible loss in accuracy for ResNet18 on CIFAR-10.
For VGG16 trained on Tiny ImageNet, our approach requires 5.8times fewer FLOPs
and up to 83.3% fewer model parameters with a drop in top-5 (top-1) accuracy of
only 1.2% (2.1%). We also compared the performance of our proposed
architectures with that of ShuffleNet andMobileNetV2. Using similar
hyperparameters and FLOPs, our ResNet18 variants yield an average accuracy
improvement of 2.8%.

Title: Approximations of Kolmogorov Complexity
Authors: Samuel Epstein
Categories: cs.CC
Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures
\\
  In this paper we show that the approximating the Kolmogorov complexity of a
set of numbers is equivalent to having common information with the halting
sequence. The more precise the approximations are, and the greater the number
of approximations, the more information is shared with the halting sequence. An
encoding of the 2^N unique numbers and their Kolmogorov complexities contains
at least >N mutual information with the halting sequence. We also provide a
generalization of the "Sets have Simple Members" theorem to conditional
complexity.

Authors: Nathan Sime, Cian R. Wilson
Categories: cs.CE cs.NA math.NA
\\
  Imposition of free slip boundary conditions in science and engineering
simulations presents a challenge when the simulation domain is non-trivial.
Inspired by recent progress in symbolic computation of discontinuous Galerkin
finite element methods, we present a symmetric interior penalty form of
Nitsche's method to weakly impose these slip boundary conditions and present
examples of its use in the Stokes subsystem motivated by problems in
geodynamics. We compare numerical results with well established benchmark
problems. We also examine performance of the method with iterative solvers.

Title: Investigation of Numerical Dispersion with Time Step of The FDTD
  Methods: Avoiding Erroneous Conclusions
Authors: Yu Cheng, Guangzhi Chen, Xiang-Hua Wang, and Shunchuan Yang
Categories: cs.CE
\\
  It is widely thought that small time steps lead to small numerical errors in
the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. In this paper, we
investigated how time steps impact on numerical dispersion of two FDTD methods
including the FDTD(2,2) method and the FDTD(2,4) method. Through rigorously
analytical and numerical analysis, it is found that small time steps of the
FDTD methods do not always have small numerical errors. Our findings reveal
that these two FDTD methods present different behaviors with respect to time
steps: (1) for the FDTD(2,2) method, smaller time steps limited by the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition increase numerical dispersion and lead
to larger simulation errors; (2) for the FDTD(2,4) method, as time step
increases, numerical dispersion errors first decrease and then increase. Our
findings are also comprehensively validated from one- to three-dimensional
cases through several numerical examples including wave propagation, resonant
frequencies of cavities and a practical electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
problem.

Title: Interpretable Rumor Detection in Microblogs by Attending to User
  Interactions
Authors: Ling Min Serena Khoo, Hai Leong Chieu, Zhong Qian and Jing Jiang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures, AAAI 2020 Conference
\\
  We address rumor detection by learning to differentiate between the
community's response to real and fake claims in microblogs. Existing
state-of-the-art models are based on tree models that model conversational
trees. However, in social media, a user posting a reply might be replying to
the entire thread rather than to a specific user. We propose a post-level
attention model (PLAN) to model long distance interactions between tweets with
the multi-head attention mechanism in a transformer network. We investigated
variants of this model: (1) a structure aware self-attention model (StA-PLAN)
that incorporates tree structure information in the transformer network, and
(2) a hierarchical token and post-level attention model (StA-HiTPLAN) that
learns a sentence representation with token-level self-attention. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate our models on two rumor
detection data sets: the PHEME data set as well as the Twitter15 and Twitter16
data sets. We show that our best models outperform current state-of-the-art
models for both data sets. Moreover, the attention mechanism allows us to
explain rumor detection predictions at both token-level and post-level.

Title: AMR Similarity Metrics from Principles
Authors: Juri Opitz and Letitia Parcalabescu and Anette Frank
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 13 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Different metrics have been proposed to compare Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) graphs. The canonical Smatch metric (Cai and Knight, 2013)
aligns variables from one graph to another and compares the matching triples.
The recently released SemBleu metric (Song and Gildea, 2019) is based on the
machine-translation metric Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002), increasing
computational efficiency by ablating a variable-alignment step and aiming at
capturing more global graph properties.
  Our aims are threefold: i) we establish criteria that allow us to perform a
principled comparison between metrics of symbolic meaning representations like
AMR; ii) we undertake a thorough analysis of Smatch and SemBleu where we show
that the latter exhibits some undesirable properties. E.g., it violates the
identity of indiscernibles rule and introduces biases that are hard to control;
iii) we propose a novel metric S2match that is more benevolent to only very
slight meaning deviations and targets the fulfilment of all established
criteria. We assess its suitability and show its advantages over Smatch and
SemBleu.

Title: Modeling Global and Local Node Contexts for Text Generation from
  Knowledge Graphs
Authors: Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Yue Zhang, Claire Gardent and Iryna Gurevych
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Recent graph-to-text models generate text from graph-based data using either
global or local aggregation to learn node representations. Global node encoding
allows explicit communication between two distant nodes, thereby neglecting
graph topology as all nodes are connected. In contrast, local node encoding
considers the relations between directly connected nodes capturing the graph
structure, but it can fail to capture long-range relations. In this work, we
gather the best of both encoding strategies, proposing novel models that encode
an input graph combining both global and local node contexts. Our approaches
are able to learn better contextualized node embeddings for text generation. In
our experiments, we demonstrate that our models lead to significant
improvements in KG-to-text generation, achieving BLEU scores of 17.81 on AGENDA
dataset, and 63.10 on the WebNLG dataset for seen categories, outperforming the
state of the art by 3.51 and 2.51 points, respectively.

FLAFOL is the first logic to provide a non-interference guarantee while
supporting all connectives of first-order logic. Furthermore, this guarantee is

Title: RSA and redactable blockchains

Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 5 pages
MSC-class: 94A60
\\
  A blockchain is redactable if a private key holder (e.g. a central authority)
can change any single block without violating integrity of the whole
blockchain, but no other party can do that. In this paper, we offer a simple
method of constructing redactable blockchains inspired by the ideas underlying
the well-known RSA encryption scheme. Notably, our method can be used in
conjunction with any reasonable hash function that is used to build a
blockchain. Public immutability of a blockchain in our construction is based on
the computational hardness of the RSA problem and not on properties of the
underlying hash function. Corruption resistance is based on the computational
hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.

Title: Provably Secure Isolation for Interruptible Enclaved Execution on Small
  Microprocessors: Extended Version
Authors: Matteo Busi, Job Noorman, Jo Van Bulck, Letterio Galletta, Pierpaolo
  Degano, Jan Tobias M\"uhlberg, and Frank Piessens
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: Extended version of the paper "Provably Secure Isolation for
  Interruptible Enclaved Execution on Small Microprocessors"
\\
  Computer systems often provide hardware support for isolation mechanisms like
privilege levels, virtual memory, or enclaved execution. Over the past years,
several successful software-based side-channel attacks have been developed that
break, or at least significantly weaken the isolation that these mechanisms
offer. Extending a processor with new architectural or micro-architectural
features, brings a risk of introducing new such side-channel attacks.
  This paper studies the problem of extending a processor with new features
without weakening the security of the isolation mechanisms that the processor
offers. We propose to use full abstraction as a formal criterion for the
security of a processor extension, and we instantiate that criterion to the
concrete case of extending a microprocessor that supports enclaved execution
with secure interruptibility of these enclaves. This is a very relevant
instantiation as several recent papers have shown that interruptibility of
enclaves leads to a variety of software-based side-channel attacks. We propose
a design for interruptible enclaves, and prove that it satisfies our security
criterion. We also implement the design on an open-source enclave-enabled
microprocessor, and evaluate the cost of our design in terms of performance and
hardware size.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Gaussian Process Regression -- A Modular Approach to
  the Application of Homomorphic Encryption
Authors: Peter Fenner, Edward O. Pyzer-Knapp
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Much of machine learning relies on the use of large amounts of data to train
models to make predictions. When this data comes from multiple sources, for
example when evaluation of data against a machine learning model is offered as
a service, there can be privacy issues and legal concerns over the sharing of
data. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows data to be computed on whilst
encrypted, which can provide a solution to the problem of data privacy.
However, FHE is both slow and restrictive, so existing algorithms must be
manipulated to make them work efficiently under the FHE paradigm. Some commonly
used machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian process regression, are
poorly suited to FHE and cannot be manipulated to work both efficiently and
accurately. In this paper, we show that a modular approach, which applies FHE
to only the sensitive steps of a workflow that need protection, allows one
party to make predictions on their data using a Gaussian process regression
model built from another party's data, without either party gaining access to
the other's data, in a way which is both accurate and efficient. This
construction is, to our knowledge, the first example of an effectively
encrypted Gaussian process.

Title: Interpreting Machine Learning Malware Detectors Which Leverage N-gram
  Analysis
Authors: William Briguglio and Sherif Saad
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 18 pages, The 12th International Symposium on Foundations & Practice
  of Security, 2019
\\
  In cyberattack detection and prevention systems, cybersecurity analysts
always prefer solutions that are as interpretable and understandable as
rule-based or signature-based detection. This is because of the need to tune
and optimize these solutions to mitigate and control the effect of false
positives and false negatives. Interpreting machine learning models is a new
and open challenge. However, it is expected that an interpretable machine
learning solution will be domain-specific. For instance, interpretable
solutions for machine learning models in healthcare are different than
solutions in malware detection. This is because the models are complex, and
most of them work as a black-box. Recently, the increased ability for malware
authors to bypass antimalware systems has forced security specialists to look
to machine learning for creating robust detection systems. If these systems are
to be relied on in the industry, then, among other challenges, they must also
explain their predictions. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the
current state-of-the-art ML models interpretability techniques when applied to
ML-based malware detectors. We demonstrate interpretability techniques in
practice and evaluate the effectiveness of existing interpretability techniques
in the malware analysis domain.

  Efforts by online ad publishers to circumvent traditional ad blockers towards
regaining fiduciary benefits, have been demonstrably successful. As a result,
there have recently emerged a set of adblockers that apply machine learning
instead of manually curated rules and have been shown to be more robust in
blocking ads on websites including social media sites such as Facebook. Among
these, AdGraph is arguably the state-of-the-art learning-based adblocker. In
this paper, we develop A4, a tool that intelligently crafts adversarial samples
of ads to evade AdGraph. Unlike the popular research on adversarial samples
against images or videos that are considered less- to un-restricted, the
samples that A4 generates preserve application semantics of the web page, or
are actionable. Through several experiments we show that A4 can bypass AdGraph
about 60% of the time, which surpasses the state-of-the-art attack by a
significant margin of 84.3%; in addition, changes to the visual layout of the
web page due to these perturbations are imperceptible. We envision the
algorithmic framework proposed in A4 is also promising in improving adversarial
attacks against other learning-based web applications with similar
requirements.

Title: A Review on Object Pose Recovery: from 3D Bounding Box Detectors to Full
  6D Pose Estimators
Authors: Caner Sahin, Guillermo Garcia-Hernando, Juil Sock, Tae-Kyun Kim
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Object pose recovery has gained increasing attention in the computer vision
field as it has become an important problem in rapidly evolving technological
areas related to autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing
review-related studies have addressed the problem at visual level in 2D, going
through the methods which produce 2D bounding boxes of objects of interest in
RGB images. The 2D search space is enlarged either using the geometry
information available in the 3D space along with RGB (Mono/Stereo) images, or
utilizing depth data from LIDAR sensors and/or RGB-D cameras. 3D bounding box
detectors, producing category-level amodal 3D bounding boxes, are evaluated on
gravity aligned images, while full 6D object pose estimators are mostly tested
at instance-level on the images where the alignment constraint is removed.
Recently, 6D object pose estimation is tackled at the level of categories. In
this paper, we present the first comprehensive and most recent review of the
methods on object pose recovery, from 3D bounding box detectors to full 6D pose
estimators. The methods mathematically model the problem as a classification,
regression, classification & regression, template matching, and point-pair
feature matching task. Based on this, a mathematical-model-based categorization
of the methods is established. Datasets used for evaluating the methods are
investigated with respect to the challenges, and evaluation metrics are
studied. Quantitative results of experiments in the literature are analysed to
show which category of methods best performs across what types of challenges.
The analyses are further extended comparing two methods, which are our own
implementations, so that the outcomes from the public results are further
solidified. Current position of the field is summarized regarding object pose
recovery, and possible research directions are identified.

  Accurate real-time pose estimation of spacecraft or object in space is a key
capability necessary for on-orbit spacecraft servicing and assembly tasks. Pose
estimation of objects in space is more challenging than for objects on Earth
due to space images containing widely varying illumination conditions, high
contrast, and poor resolution in addition to power and mass constraints. In
this paper, a convolutional neural network is leveraged to uniquely determine
the translation and rotation of an object of interest relative to the camera.
The main idea of using CNN model is to assist object tracker used in on space
assembly tasks where only feature based method is always not sufficient. The
simulation framework designed for assembly task is used to generate dataset for
training the modified CNN models and, then results of different models are
compared with measure of how accurately models are predicting the pose. Unlike
many current approaches for spacecraft or object in space pose estimation, the
model does not rely on hand-crafted object-specific features which makes this
model more robust and easier to apply to other types of spacecraft. It is shown
that the model performs comparable to the current feature-selection methods and
can therefore be used in conjunction with them to provide more reliable
estimates.

Title: ImVoteNet: Boosting 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds with Image Votes
Authors: Charles R. Qi, Xinlei Chen, Or Litany, Leonidas J. Guibas
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  3D object detection has seen quick progress thanks to advances in deep
learning on point clouds. A few recent works have even shown state-of-the-art
performance with just point clouds input (e.g. VoteNet). However, point cloud
data have inherent limitations. They are sparse, lack color information and
often suffer from sensor noise. Images, on the other hand, have high resolution
and rich texture. Thus they can complement the 3D geometry provided by point
clouds. Yet how to effectively use image information to assist point cloud
based detection is still an open question. In this work, we build on top of
VoteNet and propose a 3D detection architecture called ImVoteNet specialized
for RGB-D scenes. ImVoteNet is based on fusing 2D votes in images and 3D votes
in point clouds. Compared to prior work on multi-modal detection, we explicitly
extract both geometric and semantic features from the 2D images. We leverage
camera parameters to lift these features to 3D. To improve the synergy of 2D-3D
feature fusion, we also propose a multi-tower training scheme. We validate our
model on the challenging SUN RGB-D dataset, advancing state-of-the-art results
by 5.7 mAP. We also provide rich ablation studies to analyze the contribution
of each design choice.

  Loss

\\
  Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) refers to the task of inferring the 3D
semantic segmentation of a scene while simultaneously completing the 3D shapes.
We propose PALNet, a novel hybrid network for SSC based on single depth. PALNet
utilizes a two-stream network to extract both 2D and 3D features from
multi-stages using fine-grained depth information to efficiently captures the
context, as well as the geometric cues of the scene. Current methods for SSC
treat all parts of the scene equally causing unnecessary attention to the
interior of objects. To address this problem, we propose Position Aware
Loss(PA-Loss) which is position importance aware while training the network.
Specifically, PA-Loss considers Local Geometric Anisotropy to determine the
importance of different positions within the scene. It is beneficial for
recovering key details like the boundaries of objects and the corners of the
scene. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method and its superior performance. Models and
Video demo can be found at: https://github.com/UniLauX/PALNet.

\\
  Augmented Reality is used in Image Guided surgery (AR IG) to fuse surgical
landmarks from preoperative images into a video overlay. Physical simulation is
essential to maintaining accurate position of the landmarks as surgery
progresses and ensuring patient safety by avoiding accidental damage to vessels
etc. In liver procedures, AR IG simulation accuracy is hampered by an inability
to model stiffness variations unique to the patients disease. We introduce a
novel method to account for patient specific stiffness variation based on
Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) data. To the best of our knowledge we are
the first to demonstrate the use of in-vivo biomechanical data for AR IG
landmark placement. In this early work, a comparative evaluation of our MRE
data driven simulation and the traditional method shows clinically significant
differences in accuracy during landmark placement and motivates further animal
model trials.

Title: Under the Radar: Learning to Predict Robust Keypoints for Odometry
  Estimation and Metric Localisation in Radar
Authors: Dan Barnes and Ingmar Posner
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO
Comments: Video summary: https://youtu.be/L-PO7nxWpJU
\\
  This paper presents a self-supervised framework for learning to detect robust
keypoints for odometry estimation and metric localisation in radar. By
embedding a differentiable point-based motion estimator inside our
architecture, we learn keypoint locations, scores and descriptors from
localisation error alone. This approach avoids imposing any assumption on what
makes a robust keypoint and crucially allows them to be optimised for our
application. Furthermore the architecture is sensor agnostic and can be applied
to most modalities. We run experiments on 280km of real world driving from the
Oxford Radar RobotCar Dataset and improve on the state-of-the-art in
point-based radar odometry, reducing errors by up to 45% whilst running an
order of magnitude faster, simultaneously solving metric loop closures.
Combining these outputs, we provide a framework capable of full mapping and
localisation with radar in urban environments.

Title: H-OWAN: Multi-distorted Image Restoration with Tensor 1x1 Convolution
Authors: Zihao Huang, Chao Li, Feng Duan, Qibin Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  It is a challenging task to restore images from their variants with combined
distortions. In the existing works, a promising strategy is to apply parallel
"operations" to handle different types of distortion. However, in the feature
fusion phase, a small number of operations would dominate the restoration
result due to the features' heterogeneity by different operations. To this end,
we introduce the tensor 1x1 convolutional layer by imposing high-order tensor
(outer) product, by which we not only harmonize the heterogeneous features but
also take additional non-linearity into account. To avoid the unacceptable
kernel size resulted from the tensor product, we construct the kernels with
tensor network decomposition, which is able to convert the exponential growth
of the dimension to linear growth. Armed with the new layer, we propose
High-order OWAN for multi-distorted image restoration. In the numerical
experiments, the proposed net outperforms the previous state-of-the-art and
shows promising performance even in more difficult tasks.

Title: Evaluating the Progress of Deep Learning for Visual Relational Concepts
Authors: Sebastian Stabinger, Justus Piater, and Antonio Rodr\'iguez-S\'anchez
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the state of the art method
for image classification in the last 7 years, but despite the fact that they
achieve super human performance on many classification datasets, there are
lesser known datasets where they almost fail completely and perform much worse
than humans.
  We will show that these problems correspond to relational concepts as defined
by the field of concept learning. Therefore, we will present current deep
learning research for visual relational concepts.
  Analyzing the current literature, we will hypothesise that iterative
processing of the input, together with shifting attention between the
iterations will be needed to efficiently and reliably solve real world
relational concept learning. In addition, we will conclude that many current
datasets overestimate the performance of tested systems by providing data in an
already pre-attended form.

Comments: accepted by Computer Vision Winter Workshop

\\
  Vehicle detection in aerial and satellite images is still challenging due to
their tiny appearance in pixels compared to the overall size of remote sensing
imagery. Classical methods of object detection very often fail in this scenario
due to violation of implicit assumptions made such as rich texture, small to
moderate ratios between image size and object size. Satellite video is a very
new modality which introduces temporal consistency as inductive bias.
Approaches for vehicle detection in satellite video use either background
subtraction, frame differencing or subspace methods showing moderate
performance (0.26 - 0.82 $F_1$ score). This work proposes to apply recent work
on deep learning for wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) on satellite video. We
show in a first approach comparable results (0.84 $F_1$) on Planet's SkySat-1
LasVegas video with room for further improvement.

Title: Developing a gender classification approach in human face images using
  modified local binary patterns and tani-moto based nearest neighbor algorithm
Authors: Shervan Fekri-Ershad
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 Pages, 5 Figures, 3 Tables, Main publisher is NADIA,

  Pattern Recognition, Vol. 12, No. 4 (2019), pp.1-12
\\
  Human identification is a much attention problem in computer vision. Gender
classification plays an important role in human identification as preprocess
step. So far, various methods have been proposed to solve this problem.
Absolutely, classification accuracy is the main challenge for researchers in
gender classification. But, some challenges such as rotation, gray scale
variations, pose, illumination changes may be occurred in smart phone image
capturing. In this respect, a multi step approach is proposed in this paper to
classify genders in human face images based on improved local binary patters
(MLBP). LBP is a texture descriptor, which extract local contrast and local
spatial structure information. Some issues such as noise sensitivity, rotation
sensitivity and low discriminative features can be considered as disadvantages
of the basic LBP. MLBP handle disadvantages using a new theory to categorize
extracted binary patterns of basic LBP. The proposed approach includes two
stages. First of all, a feature vector is extracted for human face images based
on MLBP. Next, non linear classifiers can be used to classify gender. In this
paper nearest neighborhood classifier is evaluated based on Tani-Moto metric as
distance measure. In the result part, two databases, self-collected and ICPR
are used as human face database. Results are compared by some state-ofthe-art
algorithms in this literature that shows the high quality of the proposed
approach in terms of accuracy rate. Some of other main advantages of the
proposed approach are rotation invariant, low noise sensitivity, size invariant
and low computational complexity. The proposed approach decreases the
computational complexity of smartphone applications because of reducing the
number of database comparisons. It can also improve performance of the
synchronous applications in the smarphones because of memory and CPU usage
reduction.

\\
  With the recent popularity of Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger
Technologies (DLT), blockchain enabled smart contract applications has
attracted increased research focus. However, the immutability of the blocks,
where the smart contracts are stored, causes conflicts with the traditional
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models usually followed by software
engineers. This clearly shows the unsuitability of the application of SDLC in
designing blockchain enabled smart contract based applications. This research
article addresses this current problem by first exploring the six traditional
SDLC models, clearly identifying the conflicts in a table with the application
of smart contracts and advocates that there is an urgent need to develop new
standard model(s) to address the arising issues. The concept of both block
immutability and contract is introduced. This is further set in a historical
context from legacy smart contracts and blockchain enabled smart contracts
extending to the difference between "shallow smart contracts" and "deep smart
contracts". To conclude, the traditional SDLC models are unsuitable for
blockchain enabled smart contract-based applications.

  Nobody knows what one's do in the future and everyone will have had a
different answer to the question : how do you see yourself in five years after
your current job/diploma? In this paper we introduce concepts, large categories
of fields of studies or job domains in order to represent the vision of the
future of the user's trajectory. Then, we show how they can influence the
prediction when proposing him a set of next steps to take.

Title: Indexical Cities: Articulating Personal Models of Urban Preference with
  Geotagged Data
Authors: Diana Alvarez-Marin and Karla Saldana Ochoa
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
Comments: 29 pages 20 figures
\\
  How to assess the potential of liking a city or a neighborhood before ever
having been there. The concept of urban quality has until now pertained to
global city ranking, where cities are evaluated under a grid of given
parameters, or either to empirical and sociological approaches, often
constrained by the amount of available information. Using state of the art
machine learning techniques and thousands of geotagged satellite and
perspective images from diverse urban cultures, this research characterizes
personal preference in urban spaces and predicts a spectrum of unknown likeable
places for a specific observer. Unlike most urban perception studies, our
intention is not by any means to provide an objective measure of urban quality,
but rather to portray personal views of the city or Cities of Indexes.

Title: Systematic Review of Approaches to Improve Peer Assessment at Scale
Authors: Manikandan Ravikiran
Categories: cs.CY cs.CL cs.HC
Comments: This is a review assignment, work on progress. Expected to be updated
  regularly
\\
  Peer Assessment is a task of analysis and commenting on student's writing by
peers, is core of all educational components both in campus and in MOOC's.
However, with the sheer scale of MOOC's & its inherent personalised open ended
learning, automatic grading and tools assisting grading at scale is highly
important. Previously we presented survey on tasks of post classification,
knowledge tracing and ended with brief review on Peer Assessment (PA), with
some initial problems. In this review we shall continue review on PA from
perspective of improving the review process itself. As such rest of this review
focus on three facets of PA namely Auto grading and Peer Assessment Tools (we
shall look only on how peer reviews/auto-grading is carried), strategies to
handle Rogue Reviews, Peer Review Improvement using Natural Language
Processing. The consolidated set of papers and resources so used are released
in https://github.com/manikandan-ravikiran/cs6460-Survey-2.

Title: A Dip Into a Deep Well: Online Political Advertisements, Valence, and
  European Electoral Campaigning
Authors: Jukka Ruohonen
Categories: cs.CY
Comments: Submitted
\\
  Online political advertisements have become an important element in electoral
campaigning throughout the world. At the same time, concepts such as
misinformation and manipulation have emerged as a global concern. Although
these concepts are distinct from online political ads and data-driven electoral
campaigning, they tend to share a similar trait related to valence, the
intrinsic attractiveness or averseness of a message. Given this background, the
paper examines online political ads by using a dataset collected from Google's
transparency reports. The examination is framed to the mid-2019 situation in
Europe, including the European Parliament election in particular. According to
the results based on sentiment analysis of the textual ads displayed via
Google's advertisement machinery, (i) most of the political ads have expressed
positive sentiments, although these vary greatly between (ii) European
countries as well as across (iii) European political parties. In addition to
these results, the paper contributes to the timely discussion about data-driven
electoral campaigning and its relation to politics and democracy.

Title: Query-Sequence Optimization on a Reconfigurable Hardware-Accelerated
  System
Authors: Lekshmi B.G., Andreas Becher, Klaus Meyer-Wegener
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  Hardware acceleration of database query processing can be done with the help
of FPGAs. In particular, they are partially reconfigurable during runtime,
which allows for the runtime adaption of the hardware to a variety of queries.
Reconfiguration itself, however, takes some time. As the affected area of the
FPGA is not available for computations during the reconfiguration, avoiding
some of the reconfigurations can improve overall performance. This paper
presents optimizations based on query sequences, which reduces the impact of
the reconfigurations. Knowledge of coming queries is used to (I) speculatively
start reconfiguration already when a query is still running and (II) avoid
overwriting of reconfigurable regions that will be used again in subsequent
queries. We evaluate our optimizations with a calibrated model and measurements
for various parameter values. Improvements in execution time of up to 21% can
be obtained even with sequences of only two queries

Title: Smart Resource Management for Data Streaming using an Online Bin-packing
  Strategy
Authors: Oliver Stein and Ben Blamey and Johan Karlsson and Alan Sabirsh and
  Ola Spjuth and Andreas Hellander and Salman Toor
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Data stream processing frameworks provide reliable and efficient mechanisms
for executing complex workflows over large datasets. A common challenge for the
majority of currently available streaming frameworks is efficient utilization
of resources. Most frameworks use static or semi-static settings for resource
utilization that work well for established use cases but lead to marginal
improvements for unseen scenarios. Another pressing issue is the efficient
processing of large individual objects such as images and matrices typical for
scientific datasets. HarmonicIO has proven to be a good solution for streams of
relatively large individual objects, as demonstrated in a benchmark comparison
with the Spark and Kafka streaming frameworks. We here present an extension of
the HarmonicIO framework based on the online bin-packing algorithm, to allow
for efficient utilization of resources. Based on a real world use case from
large-scale microscopy pipelines, we compare results of the new system to
Spark's auto-scaling mechanism.

Title: Path Query Data Structures in Practice
Authors: Meng He and Serikzhan Kazi
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Let us be given an ordinal tree, such that each node of it has a certain
associated weight. We design, implement, and evaluate space- and
time-performance of data structures to answer online path queries on such a
tree: path counting, path reporting, and path median queries. These query
problems generalize the problems of $2d$ orthogonal range counting and
reporting in planar point sets, as well as the range median query problem in
arrays, to tree structured data. We propose practical realizations of the
latest theoretical results in path queries. Our data structures, whose
components include tree extraction, heavy-path decomposition, and wavelet
trees, are implemented in both succinct and plain pointer-based form. Our
succinct data structures are further specialized into entropy-compressed and
plain forms. Through a set of experiments on large datasets, we show that
succinct data structures for path queries present a viable alternative to
standard pointer-based realizations in practical scenarios. We compare the
performance of our data structures to naive approaches that encode the tree in
plain pointer-based form and do not preprocess it to speedup the queries, but
rather compute the answer by explicitly traversing the query path and checking
the nodes. Our succinct data structures are several times faster in path median
queries, and perform comparably in path counting and path reporting queries,
while being several times more space-efficient, than such naive approaches.
Plain pointer-based realizations of our data structures, requiring a few times
more space than the naive structures, yield a $30$-$100$-times speedup over
them. In addition, our succinct data structures provide more functionality
within the little space they use than their plain pointer-based counterparts.

Title: Prophet Inequalities with Linear Correlations and Augmentations
Authors: Nicole Immorlica, Sahil Singla, and Bo Waggoner
Categories: cs.DS cs.GT
Comments: 31 pages
\\
  In a classical online decision problem, a decision-maker who is trying to
maximize her value inspects a sequence of arriving items to learn their values
(drawn from known distributions), and decides when to stop the process by
taking the current item. The goal is to prove a "prophet inequality": that she
can do approximately as well as a prophet with foreknowledge of all the values.
In this work, we investigate this problem when the values are allowed to be
correlated. Since non-trivial guarantees are impossible for arbitrary
correlations, we consider a natural "linear" correlation structure introduced
by Bateni et al. \cite{BDHS-ESA15} as a generalization of the common-base value
model of Chawla et al. \cite{CMS-EC10Journal15}.
  A key challenge is that threshold-based algorithms, which are commonly used
for prophet inequalities, no longer guarantee good performance for linear
correlations. We relate this roadblock to another "augmentations" challenge
that might be of independent interest: many existing prophet inequality
algorithms are not robust to slight increase in the values of the arriving
items. We leverage this intuition to prove bounds (matching up to constant
factors) that decay gracefully with the amount of correlation of the arriving
items. We extend these results to the case of selecting multiple items by
designing a new $(1+o(1))$ approximation ratio algorithm that is robust to
augmentations.

Title: New Algorithms and Hardness for Incremental Single-Source Shortest Paths
  in Directed Graphs
Authors: Maximilian Probst Gutenberg, Virginia Vassilevska Williams, Nicole
  Wein
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  In the dynamic Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) problem, we are given a
graph $G=(V,E)$ subject to edge insertions and deletions and a source vertex
$s\in V$, and the goal is to maintain the distance $d(s,t)$ for all $t\in V$.
  Fine-grained complexity has provided strong lower bounds for exact partially
dynamic SSSP and approximate fully dynamic SSSP [ESA'04, FOCS'14, STOC'15].
Thus much focus has been directed towards finding efficient partially dynamic
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate SSSP algorithms [STOC'14, ICALP'15, SODA'14,
FOCS'14, STOC'16, SODA'17, ICALP'17, ICALP'19, STOC'19, SODA'20, SODA'20].
Despite this rich literature, for directed graphs there are no known
deterministic algorithms for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate dynamic SSSP that
perform better than the classic ES-tree [JACM'81]. We present the first such
algorithm.
  We present a \emph{deterministic} data structure for incremental SSSP in
weighted digraphs with total update time $\tilde{O}(n^2 \log W)$ which is
near-optimal for very dense graphs; here $W$ is the ratio of the largest weight
in the graph to the smallest. Our algorithm also improves over the best known
partially dynamic \emph{randomized} algorithm for directed SSSP by Henzinger et
al. [STOC'14, ICALP'15] if $m=\omega(n^{1.1})$.
  We also provide improved conditional lower bounds. Henzinger et al. [STOC'15]
showed that under the OMv Hypothesis, the partially dynamic exact $s$-$t$
Shortest Path problem in undirected graphs requires amortized update or query
time $m^{1/2-o(1)}$, given polynomial preprocessing time. Under a hypothesis
about finding Cliques, we improve the update and query lower bound for
algorithms with polynomial preprocessing time to $m^{0.626-o(1)}$. Further,
under the $k$-Cycle hypothesis, we show that any partially dynamic SSSP
algorithm with $O(m^{2-\epsilon})$ preprocessing time requires amortized update
or query time $m^{1-o(1)}$.

Title: Fully-Dynamic All-Pairs Shortest Paths: Improved Worst-Case Time and
  Space Bounds
Authors: Maximilian Probst Gutenberg, Christian Wulff-Nilsen

Comments: Appeared in SODA'20
DOI: 10.1137/1.9781611975994.156
\\
  Given a directed weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ undergoing vertex insertions
\emph{and} deletions, the All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem asks to
maintain a data structure that processes updates efficiently and returns after
each update the distance matrix to the current version of $G$. In two
breakthrough results, Italiano and Demetrescu [STOC '03] presented an algorithm
that requires $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ \emph{amortized} update time, and Thorup showed
in [STOC '05] that \emph{worst-case} update time $\tilde{O}(n^{2+3/4})$ can be
achieved. In this article, we make substantial progress on the problem. We
present the following new results:
  (1) We present the first deterministic data structure that breaks the
$\tilde{O}(n^{2+3/4})$ worst-case update time bound by Thorup which has been
standing for almost 15 years. We improve the worst-case update time to
$\tilde{O}(n^{2+5/7}) = \tilde{O}(n^{2.71..})$ and to $\tilde{O}(n^{2+3/5}) =
\tilde{O}(n^{2.6})$ for unweighted graphs.
  (2) We present a simple deterministic algorithm with $\tilde{O}(n^{2+3/4})$
worst-case update time ($\tilde{O}(n^{2+2/3})$ for unweighted graphs), and a
simple Las-Vegas algorithm with worst-case update time $\tilde{O}(n^{2+2/3})$
($\tilde{O}(n^{2 + 1/2})$ for unweighted graphs) that works against a
non-oblivious adversary. Both data structures require space $\tilde{O}(n^2)$.
These are the first exact dynamic algorithms with truly-subcubic update time
\emph{and} space usage. This makes significant progress on an open question
posed in multiple articles [COCOON'01, STOC '03, ICALP'04, Encyclopedia of
Algorithms '08] and is critical to algorithms in practice [TALG '06] where
large space usage is prohibitive. Moreover, they match the worst-case update
time of the best previous algorithms and the second algorithm improves upon a
Monte-Carlo algorithm in a weaker adversary model with the same running time
[SODA '17].

Title: Deterministic Algorithms for Decremental Approximate Shortest Paths:
  Faster and Simpler
Authors: Maximilian Probst Gutenberg, Christian Wulff-Nilsen

  In the decremental $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate Single-Source Shortest Path
(SSSP) problem, we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n = |V|, m = |E|$,
undergoing edge deletions, and a distinguished source $s \in V$, and we are
asked to process edge deletions efficiently and answer queries for distance
estimates $\widetilde{\mathbf{dist}}_G(s,v)$ for each $v \in V$, at any stage,
such that $\mathbf{dist}_G(s,v) \leq \widetilde{\mathbf{dist}}_G(s,v) \leq (1+
\epsilon)\mathbf{dist}_G(s,v)$. In the decremental $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem, we are asked to answer queries for
distance estimates $\widetilde{\mathbf{dist}}_G(u,v)$ for every $u,v \in V$. In
this article, we consider the problems for undirected, unweighted graphs.
  We present a new \emph{deterministic} algorithm for the decremental
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate SSSP problem that takes total update time $O(mn^{0.5
+ o(1)})$. Our algorithm improves on the currently best algorithm for dense
graphs by Chechik and Bernstein [STOC 2016] with total update time
$\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and the best existing algorithm for sparse graphs with running
time $\tilde{O}(n^{1.25}\sqrt{m})$ [SODA 2017] whenever $m = O(n^{1.5 -
o(1)})$.
  In order to obtain this new algorithm, we develop several new techniques
including improved decremental cover data structures for graphs, a more
efficient notion of the heavy/light decomposition framework introduced by
Chechik and Bernstein and the first clustering technique to maintain a dynamic
\emph{sparse} emulator in the deterministic setting.
  As a by-product, we also obtain a new simple deterministic algorithm for the
decremental $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate APSP problem with near-optimal total
running time $\tilde{O}(mn /\epsilon)$ matching the time complexity of the
sophisticated but rather involved algorithm by Henzinger, Forster and Nanongkai
[FOCS 2013].

Title: Decremental SSSP in Weighted Digraphs: Faster and Against an Adaptive
  Adversary
Authors: Maximilian Probst Gutenberg, Christian Wulff-Nilsen

\\
  Given a dynamic digraph $G = (V,E)$ undergoing edge deletions and given $s\in
V$ and $\epsilon>0$, we consider the problem of maintaining
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest path distances from $s$ to all vertices in
$G$ over the sequence of deletions. Even and Shiloach (J.~ACM'$81$) give a
deterministic data structure for the exact version of the problem with total
update time $O(mn)$. Henzinger et al. (STOC'$14$, ICALP'$15$) give a Monte
Carlo data structure for the approximate version with improved total update
time $ O(mn^{0.9 + o(1)}\log W)$ where $W$ is the ratio between the largest and
smallest edge weight. A drawback of their data structure is that they only work
against an oblivious adversary, meaning that the sequence of deletions needs to
be fixed in advance. This limits its application as a black box inside
algorithms. We present the following $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate data
structures:
  (1) the first data structure is Las Vegas and works against an adaptive
adversary; it has total expected update time $\tilde O(m^{2/3}n^{4/3})$ for
unweighted graphs and $\tilde O(m^{3/4}n^{5/4}\log W)$ for weighted graphs,
  (2) the second data structure is Las Vegas and assumes an oblivious
adversary; it has total expected update time $\tilde O(\sqrt m n^{3/2})$ for
unweighted graphs and $\tilde O(m^{2/3}n^{4/3}\log W)$ for weighted graphs,
  (3) the third data structure is Monte Carlo and is correct w.h.p.~against an
oblivious adversary; it has total expected update time $\tilde O((mn)^{7/8}\log
W) = \tilde O(mn^{3/4}\log W)$.
  Each of our data structures can be queried at any stage of $G$ in constant
worst-case time; if the adversary is oblivious, a query can be extended to also
report such a path in time proportional to its length. Our update times are
faster than those of Henzinger et al.~for all graph densities.

Title: Algorithms for new types of fair stable matchings
Authors: Frances Cooper and David Manlove
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 12 page paper, 1 page of references, 17 pages of appendices, 7
  figures, 11 tables
\\
  We study the problem of finding "fair" stable matchings in the Stable
Marriage problem with Incomplete lists (SMI). For an instance $I$ of SMI there
may be many stable matchings, providing significantly different outcomes for
the sets of men and women. We introduce two new notions of fairness in SMI.
Firstly, a regret-equal stable matching minimises the difference in ranks of a
worst-off man and a worst-off woman, among all stable matchings. Secondly, a
min-regret sum stable matching minimises the sum of ranks of a worst-off man
and a worst-off woman, among all stable matchings. We present two new efficient
algorithms to find stable matchings of these types: the Regret-Equal Degree
Iteration Algorithm finds a regret-equal stable matching in $O(d_0 n^3)$ time,
where $d_0$ is the absolute difference in ranks between a worst-off man and a
worst-off woman in the man-optimal stable matching, and $n$ is the number of
men or women; and the Min-Regret Sum Algorithm finds a min-regret sum stable
matching in $O(d_s n^2)$ time, where $d_s$ is the difference in the ranks
between a worst-off man in each of the woman-optimal and man-optimal stable
matchings. Experiments to compare several types of fair optimal stable
matchings were conducted and show that the Regret-Equal Degree Iteration
Algorithm produces matchings that are competitive with respect to other
fairness objectives. On the other hand, existing types of "fair" stable
matchings did not provide as close an approximation to regret-equal stable
matchings.

Title: An Automated Approach for the Discovery of Interoperability
Authors: Duygu Sap and Daniel P. Szabo
Categories: cs.GR cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages, 10 figures
\\
  In this article, we present an automated approach that would test for and
discover the interoperability of CAD systems based on the
approximately-invariant shape properties of their models. We further show that
exchanging models in standard format does not guarantee the preservation of
shape properties. Our analysis is based on utilizing queries in deriving the
shape properties and constructing the proxy models of the given CAD models [1].
We generate template files to accommodate the information necessary for the
property computations and proxy model constructions, and implement an
interoperability discovery program called DTest to execute the interoperability
testing. We posit that our method could be extended to interoperability testing
on CAD-to-CAE and/or CAD-to-CAM interactions by modifying the set of property
checks and providing the additional requirements that may emerge in CAE or CAM
applications.

Title: Bounded Incentives in Manipulating the Probabilistic Serial Rule
Authors: Zihe Wang and Zhide Wei and Jie Zhang
Categories: cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA
Comments: To appear in AAAI 2020
\\
  The Probabilistic Serial mechanism is well-known for its desirable fairness
and efficiency properties. It is one of the most prominent protocols for the
random assignment problem. However, Probabilistic Serial is not
incentive-compatible, thereby these desirable properties only hold for the
agents' declared preferences, rather than their genuine preferences. A
substantial utility gain through strategic behaviors would trigger
self-interested agents to manipulate the mechanism and would subvert the very
foundation of adopting the mechanism in practice. In this paper, we
characterize the extent to which an individual agent can increase its utility
by strategic manipulation. We show that the incentive ratio of the mechanism is
$\frac{3}{2}$. That is, no agent can misreport its preferences such that its
utility becomes more than 1.5 times of what it is when reports truthfully. This
ratio is a worst-case guarantee by allowing an agent to have complete
information about other agents' reports and to figure out the best response
strategy even if it is computationally intractable in general. To complement
this worst-case study, we further evaluate an agent's utility gain on average
by experiments. The experiments show that an agent' incentive in manipulating
the rule is very limited. These results shed some light on the robustness of
Probabilistic Serial against strategic manipulation, which is one step further
than knowing that it is not incentive-compatible.

Title: On Maximizing Egalitarian Value in K-coalitional Hedonic Games
Authors: Naftali Waxman, Sarit Kraus and Noam Hazon
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: 6 pages
\\
  This paper considers the problem of dividing agents among coalitions. We
concentrate on Additively Separable Hedonic Games (ASHG's), in which each agent
has a non-negative value for every other agent and her utility is the sum of
the values she assigns to the members of her coalition. Unlike previous work,
we analyze a model where exactly $k$ coalitions must be formed, and the goal is
to maximize the utility of the agent which is worst off, i.e., the egalitarian
social welfare. We show that this problem is hard, even when the number of
agents should be equally divided among the coalitions. We thus propose a
heuristic that maximizes the egalitarian social welfare and maximizes the
average utility of each agent as a secondary goal. Using extensive simulations,
both on synthetic and real data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Specifically, our heuristic provides solutions that are much fairer
than the solutions that maximize the average social welfare, while still
providing a relatively high average social welfare.

  Internet-connected "smart home" IoT devices have rapidly increased in
popularity; however, relatively little is known about how these technologies
are affecting interpersonal relationships in multi-occupant households. In this
study, we conduct 13 semi-structured interviews and survey 508 individuals from
a variety of backgrounds to discover and categorize how home IoT devices have
affected interpersonal relationships. We highlight several themes, providing

Title: ScreenTrack: Using a Visual History of a Computer Screen to Retrieve
  Documents and Web Pages
Authors: Donghan Hu, Sang Won Lee

Comments: CHI 2020, 10 pages, 7 figures
DOI: 10.1145/3313831.3376753
\\
  Computers are used for various purposes, so frequent context switching is
inevitable. In this setting, retrieving the documents, files, and web pages
that have been used for a task can be a challenge. While modern applications
provide a history of recent documents for users to resume work, this is not
sufficient to retrieve all the digital resources relevant to a given primary
document. The histories currently available do not take into account the
complex dependencies among resources across applications. To address this
problem, we tested the idea of using a visual history of a computer screen to
retrieve digital resources within a few days of their use through the
development of ScreenTrack. ScreenTrack is software that captures screenshots
of a computer at regular intervals. It then generates a time-lapse video from
the captured screenshots and lets users retrieve a recently opened document or
web page from a screenshot after recognizing the resource by its appearance. A
controlled user study found that participants were able to retrieve requested
information more quickly with ScreenTrack than under the baseline condition
with existing tools. A follow-up study showed that the participants used
ScreenTrack to retrieve previously used resources and to recover the context
for task resumption.

Title: Aspect-based Academic Search using Domain-specific KB
Authors: Prajna Upadhyay, Srikanta Bedathur, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Maya Ramanath
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  Academic search engines allow scientists to explore related work relevant to
a given query. Often, the user is also aware of the "aspect" to retrieve a
relevant document. In such cases, existing search engines can be used by
expanding the query with terms describing that aspect. However, this approach
does not guarantee good results since plain keyword matches do not always imply
relevance. To address this issue, we define and solve a novel academic search
task, called "aspect-based retrieval", which allows the user to specify the
aspect along with the query to retrieve a ranked list of relevant documents.
The primary idea is to estimate a language model for the aspect as well as the
query using a domain-specific knowledge base and use a mixture of the two to
determine the relevance of the article. Our evaluation of the results over the
Open Research Corpus dataset shows that our method outperforms keyword-based
expansion of query with aspect with and without relevance feedback.

Title: Exit Wavefunction Reconstruction from Single Transmisson Electron
  Micrographs with Deep Learning
Authors: Jeffrey Ede, Jonathan J. P. Peters, Jeremy Sloan, Richard Beanland
Categories: cs.IR
Comments: 14 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Half of wavefunction information is undetected by conventional transmission
electron microscopy (CTEM) as only the intensity, and not the phase, of an
image is recorded. Following successful applications of deep learning to
optical hologram phase recovery, we have developed neural networks to recover
phases from CTEM intensities for new datasets containing 98340 exit
wavefunctions. Wavefunctions were simulated with clTEM multislice propagation
for 12789 materials from the Crystallography Open Database. Our networks can
recover 224x224 wavefunctions in ~25 ms for a large range of physical
hyperparameters and materials, and we demonstrate that performance improves as
the distribution of wavefunctions is restricted. Phase recovery with deep
learning overcomes the limitations of traditional methods: it is live, not
susceptible to distortions, does not require microscope modification or
multiple images, and can be applied to any imaging regime. This paper
introduces multiple approaches to CTEM phase recovery with deep learning, and
is intended to establish starting points to be improved upon by future
research. Source code and links to our new datasets and pre-trained models are
available at https://github.com/Jeffrey-Ede/one-shot

  The recent emergence of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has gained a high cover
in public media and worldwide news. This caused a viral pneumonia in thousands
of people in Wuhan, a central city of China. This short communication gives a
brief introduction on how the demand for information on this new epidemic is
reported through Google Trends. Author draw conclusions on current
infodemiological data on 2019-nCov using three main search queries:
coronavirus, SARS and MERS. Two approaches are set. First is worldwide
perspective, second is Chinese perspective. Chinese perspective reveals that in
China, this disease in the beginning days was more often referred to SARS then
to general coronaviruses, whereas worldwide, since the beginning is more often
referred to coronaviruses.

Title: Sub-Gaussian Matrices on Sets: Optimal Tail Dependence and Applications
Authors: Halyun Jeong, Xiaowei Li, Yaniv Plan, \"Ozg\"ur Y{\i}lmaz
Categories: cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  Random linear mappings are widely used in modern signal processing,
compressed sensing and machine learning. These mappings may be used to embed
the data into a significantly lower dimension while at the same time preserving
useful information. This is done by approximately preserving the distances
between data points, which are assumed to belong to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Thus, the
performance of these mappings is usually captured by how close they are to an
isometry on the data. Random Gaussian linear mappings have been the object of
much study, while the sub-Gaussian settings is not yet fully understood. In the
latter case, the performance depends on the sub-Gaussian norm of the rows. In
many applications, e.g., compressed sensing, this norm may be large, or even
growing with dimension, and thus it is important to characterize this
dependence.
  We study when a sub-Gaussian matrix can become a near isometry on a set, show
that previous best known dependence on the sub-Gaussian norm was sub-optimal,
and present the optimal dependence. Our result not only answers a remaining
question posed by Liaw, Mehrabian, Plan and Vershynin in 2017, but also
generalizes their work. We also develop a new Bernstein type inequality for
sub-exponential random variables, and a new Hanson-Wright inequality for
quadratic forms of sub-Gaussian random variables, in both cases improving the
bounds in the sub-Gaussian regime under moment constraints. Finally, we
illustrate popular applications such as Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings,
randomized sketches and blind demodulation, whose theoretical guarantees can be
improved by our results in the sub-Gaussian case.

Title: Design of Non-orthogonal and Noncoherent Massive MIMO for Scalable URLLC
  Beyond 5G
Authors: He Chen, Zheng Dong, Jian-Kang Zhang, Branka Vucetic
Categories: cs.IT cs.NI math.IT
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1903.01642
\\
  This paper is to design and optimize a non-orthogonal and noncoherent massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) framework towards enabling scalable
ultra-reliable low-latency communications (sURLLC) in wireless systems beyond
5G. In this framework, the huge diversity gain associated with the large-scale
antenna array in massive MIMO systems is leveraged to ensure ultrahigh
reliability. To reduce the overhead and latency induced by the channel
estimation process, we advocate the noncoherent communication technique which
does not need the knowledge of instantaneous channel state information (CSI)
but only depends on the large-scale fading coefficients for information
decoding. To boost the scalability of the system considered, we enable the
non-orthogonal channel access of multiple users by devising a new differential
modulation scheme to assure that each transmitted signal matrix can be uniquely
determined in the noise-free case and be reliably estimated in noisy cases when
the antenna array size is scaled up. The key idea is to make the transmitted
signals from multiple users be superimposed properly over the air such that
when the sum-signal is correctly detected, the signals sent by all users can be
uniquely determined. To further improve the average error performance when the
array antenna number is large, we propose a max-min Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence-based design by jointly optimizing the transmitted powers of all
users and the sub-constellation assignment among them. Simulation results show
that the proposed design significantly outperforms the existing max-min
Euclidean distance-based counterpart in terms of error performance. Moreover,
our proposed approach also has a better error performance than the conventional
coherent zero-forcing (ZF) receiver with orthogonal channel training,
particularly for cell-edge users.

Title: Shifted Pruning for List Decoding of Polar Codes
Authors: Mohammad Rowshan and Emanuele Viterbo
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  In successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding, the tree pruning operation
retains the L best paths with respect to metric at every decoding step.
However, the correct path might be among the L worst paths due to imposed
penalties. In this case, the correct path is pruned and the decoding process
fails. In this work, we propose a scheme for additional decoding attempts when
decoding fails, in which the pruning window does not necessarily select the L
best paths, but this window is shifted between positions 1 and 2L in the sorted
list. In the simplest form, the L worst paths are selected at the decoding step
where the probability of elimination of the correct paths is high.
Additionally, we generalize the scheme and propose a number of variants such as
constrained shifting, nested shifting and shifting under segmented decoding,
aiming to reduce the computational complexity. The numerical results for polar
codes of length 512 with code rates 0.5 and 0.8 and list sizes L=2, 8, 32, show
that the shifted-pruning scheme can provide 0.25-0.5 dB gain in error
correction performance, while the average computational complexity approaches
the conventional list decoding complexity at practical FER ranges.

Title: Exploiting Randomly-located Blockages for Large-Scale Deployment of
  Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Mustafa A. Kishk and Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Categories: cs.IT cs.NI math.IT
\\
  One of the promising technologies for the next generation wireless networks
is the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). This technology provides
planar surfaces the capability to manipulate the reflected waves of impinging
signals, which leads to a more controllable wireless environment. One potential
use case of such technology is providing indirect line-of-sight (LoS) links
between mobile users and base stations (BSs) which do not have direct LoS
channels. Objects that act as blockages for the communication links, such as
buildings or trees, can be equipped with RISs to enhance the coverage
probability of the cellular network through providing extra indirect LoS-links.
In this paper, we use tools from stochastic geometry to study the effect of
large-scale deployment of RISs on the performance of cellular networks. In
particular, we model the blockages using the line Boolean model. For this
setup, we study how equipping a subset of the blockages with RISs will enhance
the performance of the cellular network. We first derive the ratio of the
blind-spots to the total area. Next, we derive the probability that a typical
mobile user associates with a BS using an RIS. Finally, we derive the
probability distribution of the path-loss between the typical user and its
associated BS. We draw multiple useful system-level insights from the proposed
analysis. For instance, we show that deployment of RISs highly improves the
coverage regions of the BSs. Furthermore, we show that to ensure that the ratio
of blind-spots to the total area is below 10^5, the required density of RISs
increases from just 6 RISs/km2 when the density of the blockages is 300
blockage/km^2 to 490 RISs/km^2 when the density of the blockages is 700
blockage/km^2.

Title: Array Codes for Functional PIR and Batch Codes
Authors: Mohammad Nassar and Eitan Yaakobi
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  A functional PIR array code is a coding scheme which encodes some $s$
information bits into a $t\times m$ array such that every linear combination of
the $s$ information bits has $k$ mutually disjoint recovering sets. Every
recovering set consists of some of the array's columns while it is allowed to
read at most $\ell$ encoded bits from every column in order to receive the
requested linear combination of the information bits. Functional batch array
codes impose a stronger property where every multiset request of $k$ linear
combinations has $k$ mutually disjoint recovering sets. Given the values of $s,
k, t, \ell$, the goal of this paper is to study the optimal value of the number
of columns $m$ such that these codes exist. Several lower bounds are presented
as well as explicit constructions for several of these parameters.

  This paper investigates the system spectral efficiency (SE) in reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO)
systems, where RIS can reconfigure the propagation environment via a large
number of controllable and intelligent phase shifters. In order to explore the
system SE performance behavior with user proportional fairness for such a
system, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the SE by jointly
considering the power allocation at the base station (BS) and phase shift at
the RIS, under nonlinear proportional rate fairness constraints. To solve the
nonconvex optimization problem, an effective solution is developed, which
capitalizes on an iterative algorithm with closed-form expressions, i.e.,
alternatively optimizing the transmit power at the BS and the reflecting phase
shift at the RIS. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the
theoretical analysis and assess the performance of the proposed alternative
algorithm.

  Networks With Heterogeneous Energy Coordination
Authors: Yanjie Dong and Md. Jahangir Hossain and Julian Cheng and Victor C. M.

Comments: accepted journal article
\\
  User scheduling, beamforming and energy coordination are investigated in
smart-grid powered cellular networks (SGPCNs), where the base stations are
powered by a smart grid and natural renewable energy sources. Heterogeneous
energy coordination is considered in SGPCNs, namely energy merchandizing with
the smart grid and energy exchanging among the base stations. A long-term
grid-energy expenditure minimization problem with proportional-rate constraints
is formulated for SGPCNs. Since user scheduling is coupled with the beamforming
vectors, the formulated problem is challenging to handle via standard convex
optimization methods. In practice, the beamforming vectors need to be updated
over each slot according to the channel variations. User scheduling needs to be
updated over several slots (frame) since the frequent scheduling of user
equipment can cause reliability issues. Therefore, the Lyapunov optimization
method is used to decouple the problem. A practical two-scale algorithm is
proposed to schedule users at each frame, and obtain the beamforming vectors
and amount of exchanged natural renewable energy at each slot. We prove that
the proposed two-scale algorithm can asymptotically achieve the optimal
solutions via tuning a control parameter. Numerical results verify the
performance of the proposed two-scale algorithm.

Title: Optimal Augmented-Channel Puncturing for Low-Complexity Soft-Output MIMO
  Detectors
Authors: Mohammad M. Mansour
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 8 pages; International Conference on Communications (ICC), 2020
\\
  We propose a computationally-efficient soft-output detector for
multiple-input multiple-output channels based on augmented channel puncturing
in order to reduce tree processing complexity. The proposed detector, dubbed
augmented WL detector (AWLD), employs a punctured channel with a special
structure derived by triangulizing the original channel in augmented form,
followed by Gaussian elimination. We prove that these punctured channels are
optimal in maximizing the lower-bound on the achievable information rate (AIR)
based on a newly proposed mismatched detection model. We show that the AWLD
decomposes into a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) prefilter and channel-gain
compensation stages, followed by a regular unaugmented WL detector (WLD). It
attains the same performance as the existing AIR partial marginalization
(AIR-PM) detector, but with much simpler processing.

  A general class of Bayesian lower bounds when the underlying loss function is
a Bregman divergence is demonstrated. This class can be considered as an
extension of the Weinstein-Weiss family of bounds for the mean squared error
and relies on finding a variational characterization of Bayesian risk. The
approach allows for the derivation of a version of the Cram\'er-Rao bound that
is specific to a given Bregman divergence. The new generalization of the
Cram\'er-Rao bound reduces to the classical one when the loss function is taken
to be the Euclidean norm. The effectiveness of the new bound is evaluated in
the Poisson noise setting.

Title: Partial Updates: Losing Information for Freshness
Authors: Melih Bastopcu and Sennur Ulukus
Categories: cs.IT cs.NI eess.SP math.IT
\\
  We consider an information updating system where a source produces updates as
requested by a transmitter. The transmitter further processes these updates in
order to generate $partial$ $updates$, which have smaller information compared
to the original updates, to be sent to a receiver. We study the problem of
generating partial updates, and finding their corresponding real-valued
codeword lengths, in order to minimize the average age experienced by the
receiver, while maintaining a desired level of mutual information between the
original and partial updates. This problem is NP hard. We relax the problem and
develop an alternating minimization based iterative algorithm that generates a
pmf for the partial updates, and the corresponding age-optimal real-valued
codeword length for each update. We observe that there is a tradeoff between
the attained average age and the mutual information between the original and
partial updates.

Title: The KEEN Universe: An Ecosystem for Knowledge Graph Embeddings with a
  Focus on Reproducibility and Transferability
Authors: Mehdi Ali, Hajira Jabeen, Charles Tapley Hoyt, and Jens Lehman
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  There is an emerging trend of embedding knowledge graphs (KGs) in continuous
vector spaces in order to use those for machine learning tasks. Recently, many
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have been proposed that learn low
dimensional representations while trying to maintain the structural properties
of the KGs such as the similarity of nodes depending on their edges to other
nodes. KGEs can be used to address tasks within KGs such as the prediction of
novel links and the disambiguation of entities. They can also be used for
downstream tasks like question answering and fact-checking. Overall, these
tasks are relevant for the semantic web community. Despite their popularity,
the reproducibility of KGE experiments and the transferability of proposed KGE
models to research fields outside the machine learning community can be a major
challenge. Therefore, we present the KEEN Universe, an ecosystem for knowledge
graph embeddings that we have developed with a strong focus on reproducibility
and transferability. The KEEN Universe currently consists of the Python
packages PyKEEN (Python KnowlEdge EmbeddiNgs), BioKEEN (Biological KnowlEdge
EmbeddiNgs), and the KEEN Model Zoo for sharing trained KGE models with the
community.

Title: Landmark2Vec: An Unsupervised Neural Network-Based Landmark Positioning
  Method
Authors: Alireza Razavi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.IT cs.RO math.IT stat.ML
\\
  A Neural Network-based method for unsupervised landmarks map estimation from
measurements taken from landmarks is introduced. The measurements needed for
training the network are the signals observed/received from landmarks by an
agent. The definition of landmarks, agent, and the measurements taken by agent
from landmarks is rather broad here: landmarks can be visual objects, e.g.,
poles along a road, with measurements being the size of landmark in a visual
sensor mounted on a vehicle (agent), or they can be radio transmitters, e.g.,
WiFi access points inside a building, with measurements being the Received
Signal Strength (RSS) heard from them by a mobile device carried by a person
(agent). The goal of the map estimation is then to find the positions of
landmarks up to a scale, rotation, and shift (i.e., the topological map of the
landmarks). Assuming that there are $L$ landmarks, the measurements will be $L
\times 1$ vectors collected over the area. A shallow network then will be
trained to learn the map without any ground truth information.

Title: Fast Rates for Online Prediction with Abstention
Authors: Gergely Neu and Nikita Zhivotovskiy
Categories: cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
Comments: 19 pages
\\
  In the setting of sequential prediction of individual $\{0, 1\}$-sequences
with expert advice, we show that by allowing the learner to abstain from the
prediction by paying a cost marginally smaller than $\frac 12$ (say, $0.49$),
it is possible to achieve expected regret bounds that are independent of the
time horizon $T$. We exactly characterize the dependence on the abstention cost
$c$ and the number of experts $N$ by providing matching upper and lower bounds
of order $\frac{\log N}{1-2c}$, which is to be contrasted with the best
possible rate of $\sqrt{T\log N}$ that is available without the option to
abstain. We also discuss various extensions of our model, including a setting
where the sequence of abstention costs can change arbitrarily over time, where
we show regret bounds interpolating between the slow and the fast rates
mentioned above, under some natural assumptions on the sequence of abstention
costs.

Title: Modelling and Quantifying Membership Information Leakage in Machine
  Learning
Authors: Farhad Farokhi and Mohamed Ali Kaafar
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.IT math.IT math.OC math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  Machine learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to membership
inference attacks, i.e., inferring whether individuals' data have been used for
training models. The lack of understanding about factors contributing success
of these attacks motivates the need for modelling membership information
leakage using information theory and for investigating properties of machine
learning models and training algorithms that can reduce membership information
leakage. We use conditional mutual information leakage to measure the amount of
information leakage from the trained machine learning model about the presence
of an individual in the training dataset. We devise an upper bound for this
measure of information leakage using Kullback--Leibler divergence that is more
amenable to numerical computation. We prove a direct relationship between the
Kullback--Leibler membership information leakage and the probability of success
for a hypothesis-testing adversary examining whether a particular data record
belongs to the training dataset of a machine learning model. We show that the
mutual information leakage is a decreasing function of the training dataset
size and the regularization weight. We also prove that, if the sensitivity of
the machine learning model (defined in terms of the derivatives of the fitness
with respect to model parameters) is high, more membership information is
potentially leaked. This illustrates that complex models, such as deep neural
networks, are more susceptible to membership inference attacks in comparison to
simpler models with fewer degrees of freedom. We show that the amount of the
membership information leakage is reduced by
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{1/2}(\delta^{-1})\epsilon^{-1})$ when using Gaussian
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially-private additive noises.

Title: Treatment effect estimation with disentangled latent factors
Authors: Weijia Zhang, Lin Liu, Jiuyong Li
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A pressing concern faced by cancer patients is their prognosis under
different treatment options. Considering a binary-treatment, e.g., to receive
radiotherapy or not, the problem can be characterized as estimating the
treatment effect of radiotherapy on the survival outcome of the patients.
Estimating treatment effect from observational studies is a fundamental
problem, yet it is still especially challenging due to the counterfactual and
confounding problems. In this work, we show the importance of differentiating
confounding factors from factors that only affect the treatment or the outcome,
and propose a data-driven approach to learn and disentangle the latent factors
into three disjoint sets for a more accurate estimating treatment estimator.
Empirical validations on semi-synthetic benchmark and real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Regularization Helps with Mitigating Poisoning Attacks:
  Distributionally-Robust Machine Learning Using the Wasserstein Distance
Authors: Farhad Farokhi
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR eess.SP math.OC math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  We use distributionally-robust optimization for machine learning to mitigate
the effect of data poisoning attacks. We provide performance guarantees for the
trained model on the original data (not including the poison records) by
training the model for the worst-case distribution on a neighbourhood around
the empirical distribution (extracted from the training dataset corrupted by a
poisoning attack) defined using the Wasserstein distance. We relax the
distributionally-robust machine learning problem by finding an upper bound for
the worst-case fitness based on the empirical sampled-averaged fitness and the
Lipschitz-constant of the fitness function (on the data for given model
parameters) as regularizer. For regression models, we prove that this
regularizer is equal to the dual norm of the model parameters. We use the Wine
Quality dataset, the Boston Housing Market dataset, and the Adult dataset for
demonstrating the results of this paper.

\\
  This paper introduces the Indian Chefs Process (ICP), a Bayesian
nonparametric prior on the joint space of infinite directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) and orders that generalizes Indian Buffet Processes. As our construction
shows, the proposed distribution relies on a latent Beta Process controlling
both the orders and outgoing connection probabilities of the nodes, and yields
a probability distribution on sparse infinite graphs. The main advantage of the
ICP over previously proposed Bayesian nonparametric priors for DAG structures
is its greater flexibility. To the best of our knowledge, the ICP is the first
Bayesian nonparametric model supporting every possible DAG. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the ICP on learning the structure of deep generative sigmoid
networks as well as convolutional neural networks.

Title: Bayesian Neural Architecture Search using A Training-Free Performance
  Metric
Authors: Andr\'es Camero, Hao Wang, Enrique Alba, Thomas B\"ack
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful approach for time series
prediction. However, their performance is strongly affected by their
architecture and hyperparameter settings. The architecture optimization of RNNs
is a time-consuming task, where the search space is typically a mixture of
real, integer and categorical values. To allow for shrinking and expanding the
size of the network, the representation of architectures often has a variable
length. In this paper, we propose to tackle the architecture optimization
problem with a variant of the Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm. To reduce
the evaluation time of candidate architectures the Mean Absolute Error Random
Sampling (MRS), a training-free method to estimate the network performance, is
adopted as the objective function for BO. Also, we propose three fixed-length
encoding schemes to cope with the variable-length architecture representation.
The result is a new perspective on accurate and efficient design of RNNs, that
we validate on three problems. Our findings show that 1) the BO algorithm can
explore different network architectures using the proposed encoding schemes and
successfully designs well-performing architectures, and 2) the optimization
time is significantly reduced by using MRS, without compromising the
performance as compared to the architectures obtained from the actual training
procedure.

Title: Extreme Algorithm Selection With Dyadic Feature Representation
Authors: Alexander Tornede, Marcel Wever, Eyke H\"ullermeier
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Algorithm selection (AS) deals with selecting an algorithm from a fixed set
of candidate algorithms most suitable for a specific instance of an algorithmic
problem, e.g., choosing solvers for SAT problems. Benchmark suites for AS
usually comprise candidate sets consisting of at most tens of algorithms,
whereas in combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization
problems the number of candidates becomes intractable, impeding to learn
effective meta-models and thus requiring costly online performance evaluations.
Therefore, here we propose the setting of extreme algorithm selection (XAS)
where we consider fixed sets of thousands of candidate algorithms, facilitating
meta learning. We assess the applicability of state-of-the-art AS techniques to
the XAS setting and propose approaches leveraging a dyadic feature
representation in which both problem instances and algorithms are described. We
find the latter to improve significantly over the current state of the art in
various metrics.

Title: Asymptotically Efficient Off-Policy Evaluation for Tabular Reinforcement
  Learning
Authors: Ming Yin and Yu-Xiang Wang (University of California Santa Barbara)
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Includes appendix. Accepted for AISTATS 2020
\\
  We consider the problem of off-policy evaluation for reinforcement learning,
where the goal is to estimate the expected reward of a target policy $\pi$
using offline data collected by running a logging policy $\mu$. Standard
importance-sampling based approaches for this problem suffer from a variance
that scales exponentially with time horizon $H$, which motivates a splurge of
recent interest in alternatives that break the "Curse of Horizon" (Liu et al.
2018, Xie et al. 2019). In particular, it was shown that a marginalized
importance sampling (MIS) approach can be used to achieve an estimation error
of order $O(H^3/ n)$ in mean square error (MSE) under an episodic Markov
Decision Process model with finite states and potentially infinite actions. The
MSE bound however is still a factor of $H$ away from a Cramer-Rao lower bound
of order $\Omega(H^2/n)$. In this paper, we prove that with a simple
modification to the MIS estimator, we can asymptotically attain the Cramer-Rao
lower bound, provided that the action space is finite. We also provide a
general method for constructing MIS estimators with high-probability error
bounds.

Title: Variational Autoencoders for Opponent Modeling in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Georgios Papoudakis, Stefano V. Albrecht
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: AAAI-20 Workshop on Reinforcement Learning in Games
\\
  Multi-agent systems exhibit complex behaviors that emanate from the
interactions of multiple agents in a shared environment. In this work, we are
interested in controlling one agent in a multi-agent system and successfully
learn to interact with the other agents that have fixed policies. Modeling the
behavior of other agents (opponents) is essential in understanding the
interactions of the agents in the system. By taking advantage of recent
advances in unsupervised learning, we propose modeling opponents using
variational autoencoders. Additionally, many existing methods in the literature
assume that the opponent models have access to opponent's observations and
actions during both training and execution. To eliminate this assumption, we
propose a modification that attempts to identify the underlying opponent model
using only local information of our agent, such as its observations, actions,
and rewards. The experiments indicate that our opponent modeling methods
achieve equal or greater episodic returns in reinforcement learning tasks
against another modeling method.

\\
  Obtaining labels for medical (image) data requires scarce and expensive
experts. Moreover, due to ambiguous symptoms, single images rarely suffice to
correctly diagnose a medical condition. Instead, it often requires to take
additional background information such as the patient's medical history or test
results into account. Hence, instead of focusing on uninterpretable black-box
systems delivering an uncertain final diagnosis in an end-to-end-fashion, we
investigate how unsupervised methods trained on images without anomalies can be
used to assist doctors in evaluating X-ray images of hands. Our method
increases the efficiency of making a diagnosis and reduces the risk of missing
important regions. Therefore, we adopt state-of-the-art approaches for
unsupervised learning to detect anomalies and show how the outputs of these
methods can be explained. To reduce the effect of noise, which often can be
mistaken for an anomaly, we introduce a powerful preprocessing pipeline. We
provide an extensive evaluation of different approaches and demonstrate
empirically that even without labels it is possible to achieve satisfying
results on a real-world dataset of X-ray images of hands. We also evaluate the
importance of preprocessing and one of our main findings is that without it,
most of our approaches perform not better than random. To foster
reproducibility and accelerate research we make our code publicly available at

  Recent research developing neural network architectures with external memory
have often used the benchmark bAbI question and answering dataset which
provides a challenging number of tasks requiring reasoning. Here we employed a
classic associative inference task from the memory-based reasoning neuroscience
literature in order to more carefully probe the reasoning capacity of existing
memory-augmented architectures. This task is thought to capture the essence of
reasoning -- the appreciation of distant relationships among elements
distributed across multiple facts or memories. Surprisingly, we found that
current architectures struggle to reason over long distance associations.
Similar results were obtained on a more complex task involving finding the
shortest path between nodes in a path. We therefore developed MEMO, an
architecture endowed with the capacity to reason over longer distances. This
was accomplished with the addition of two novel components. First, it
introduces a separation between memories (facts) stored in external memory and
the items that comprise these facts in external memory. Second, it makes use of
an adaptive retrieval mechanism, allowing a variable number of "memory hops"
before the answer is produced. MEMO is capable of solving our novel reasoning
tasks, as well as match state of the art results in bAbI.

Title: Examining the Benefits of Capsule Neural Networks
Authors: Arjun Punjabi, Jonas Schmid, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Capsule networks are a recently developed class of neural networks that
potentially address some of the deficiencies with traditional convolutional
neural networks. By replacing the standard scalar activations with vectors, and
by connecting the artificial neurons in a new way, capsule networks aim to be
the next great development for computer vision applications. However, in order
to determine whether these networks truly operate differently than traditional
networks, one must look at the differences in the capsule features. To this
end, we perform several analyses with the purpose of elucidating capsule
features and determining whether they perform as described in the initial
publication. First, we perform a deep visualization analysis to visually
compare capsule features and convolutional neural network features. Then, we
look at the ability for capsule features to encode information across the
vector components and address what changes in the capsule architecture provides
the most benefit. Finally, we look at how well the capsule features are able to
encode instantiation parameters of class objects via visual transformations.

Title: The Case for Bayesian Deep Learning
Authors: Andrew Gordon Wilson
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The key distinguishing property of a Bayesian approach is marginalization
instead of optimization, not the prior, or Bayes rule. Bayesian inference is
especially compelling for deep neural networks. (1) Neural networks are
typically underspecified by the data, and can represent many different but high
performing models corresponding to different settings of parameters, which is
exactly when marginalization will make the biggest difference for both
calibration and accuracy. (2) Deep ensembles have been mistaken as competing
approaches to Bayesian methods, but can be seen as approximate Bayesian
marginalization. (3) The structure of neural networks gives rise to a
structured prior in function space, which reflects the inductive biases of
neural networks that help them generalize. (4) The observed correlation between
parameters in flat regions of the loss and a diversity of solutions that
provide good generalization is further conducive to Bayesian marginalization,
as flat regions occupy a large volume in a high dimensional space, and each
different solution will make a good contribution to a Bayesian model average.
(5) Recent practical advances for Bayesian deep learning provide improvements
in accuracy and calibration compared to standard training, while retaining
scalability.

\\
  Nowadays, a huge number of images are available. However, retrieving a
required image for an ordinary user is a challenging task in computer vision
systems. During the past two decades, many types of research have been
introduced to improve the performance of the automatic annotation of images,
which are traditionally focused on content-based image retrieval. Although,
recent research demonstrates that there is a semantic gap between content-based
image retrieval and image semantics understandable by humans. As a result,
existing research in this area has caused to bridge the semantic gap between
low-level image features and high-level semantics. The conventional method of
bridging the semantic gap is through the automatic image annotation (AIA) that
extracts semantic features using machine learning techniques. In this paper, we
propose a novel AIA model based on the deep learning feature extraction method.
The proposed model has three phases, including a feature extractor, a tag
generator, and an image annotator. First, the proposed model extracts
automatically the high and low-level features based on dual-tree continues
wavelet transform (DT-CWT), singular value decomposition, distribution of color
ton, and the deep neural network. Moreover, the tag generator balances the
dictionary of the annotated keywords by a new log-entropy auto-encoder (LEAE)
and then describes these keywords by word embedding. Finally, the annotator
works based on the long-short-term memory (LSTM) network in order to obtain the
importance degree of specific features of the image. The experiments conducted
on two benchmark datasets confirm that the superiority of the proposed model
compared to the previous models in terms of performance criteria.

Title: Reduced-Space Interior Point Methods in Power Grid Problems
Authors: Juraj Kardos and Drosos Kourounis and Olaf Schenk
Categories: cs.MS cs.DC
\\
  Due to critical environmental issues, the power systems have to accommodate a
significant level of penetration of renewable generation which requires smart
approaches to the power grid control. Associated optimal control problems are
large-scale nonlinear optimization problems with up to hundreds of millions of
variables and constraints. The interior point methods become computationally
intractable, mainly due to the solution of large linear systems.
  This document addresses the computational bottlenecks of the interior point
method during the solution of the security constrained optimal power flow
problems by applying reduced space quasi-Newton IPM, which could utilize
high-performance computers due to the inherent parallelism in the adjoint
method. Reduced space IPM approach and the adjoint method is a novel approach
when it comes to solving the (security constrained) optimal power flow
problems. These were previously used in the PDE-constrained optimization. The
presented methodology is suitable for high-performance architectures due to
inherent parallelism in the adjoint method during the gradient evaluation,
since the individual contingency scenarios are modeled by independent set of
the constraints. Preliminary evaluation of the performance and convergence is
performed to study the reduced space approach.

\\
  This paper introduces a constructive method for approximating relative
continuum measurements in two-dimensional electrical impedance tomography based
on data originating from either the point electrode model or the complete
electrode model. The upper bounds for the corresponding approximation errors
explicitly depend on the number (and size) of the employed electrodes as well
as on the regularity of the continuum current that is mimicked. In particular,
if the input current and the object boundary are infinitely smooth, the
discrepancy associated with the point electrode model converges to zero faster
than any negative power of the number of electrodes. The results are first
proven for the unit disk via trigonometric interpolation and quadrature rules,
and they are subsequently extended to more general domains with the help of
conformal mappings.

Title: Constructing a variational quasi-reversibility method for a Cauchy

\\
  In the recent developments of regularization theory for inverse and ill-posed
problems, a variational quasi-reversibility (QR) method has been designed to
solve a class of time-reversed quasi-linear parabolic problems. Known as a
PDE-based approach, this method relies on adding a suitable perturbing operator
to the original problem and consequently, on gaining the corresponding fine
stabilized operator, which leads us to a forward-like problem. In this work, we
establish new conditional estimates for such operators to solve a prototypical
Cauchy problem for elliptic equations. This problem is based on the stationary
case of the inverse heat conduction problem, where one wants to identify the
heat distribution in a certain medium, given the partial boundary data. Using
the new QR method, we obtain a second-order initial value problem for a
wave-type equation, whose weak solvability can be deduced using a priori
estimates and compactness arguments. Weighted by a Carleman-like function, a
new type of energy estimates is explored in a variational setting when we
investigate the H\"older convergence rate of the proposed scheme. Besides, a
linearized version of this scheme is analyzed. Numerical examples are provided
to corroborate our theoretical analysis.

Title: Low-rank quaternion tensor completion for recovering color videos and
  images
Authors: Jifei Miao and Kit Ian Kou and Wankai Liu
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Low-rank quaternion tensor completion method, a novel approach to recovery
color videos and images is proposed in this paper. We respectively reconstruct
a color image and a color video as a quaternion matrix (second-order tensor)
and a third-order quaternion tensor by encoding the red, green, and blue
channel pixel values on the three imaginary parts of a quaternion. Different
from some traditional models which treat color pixel as a scalar and represent
color channels separately, whereas, during the quaternion-based reconstruction,
it is significant that the inherent color structures of color images and color
videos can be completely preserved. Under the definition of Tucker rank, the
global low-rank prior to quaternion tensor is encoded as the nuclear norm of
unfolding quaternion matrices. Then, by applying the ADMM framework, we provide
the tensor completion algorithm for any order quaternion tensors, which
theoretically can be well used to recover missing entries of any
multidimensional data with color structures. Simulation results for color
videos and color images recovery show the superior performance and efficiency
of the proposed method over some state-of-the-art existing ones.

Title: Quaternion matrix regression for color face recognition
Authors: Jifei Miao and Kit Ian Kou
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Regression analysis-based approaches have been widely studied for face
recognition (FR) in the past several years. More recently, to better deal with
some difficult conditions such as occlusions and illumination, nuclear norm
based matrix regression methods have been proposed to characterize the low-rank
structure of the error image, which generalize the one-dimensional, pixel-based
error model to the two-dimensional structure. These methods, however, are
inherently devised for grayscale image based FR and without exploiting the
color information which is proved beneficial for FR of color face images.
Benefiting from quaternion representation, which is capable of encoding the
cross-channel correlation of color images, we propose a novel color FR method
by formulating the color FR problem as a nuclear norm based quaternion matrix
regression (NQMR). We further develop a more robust model called R-NQMR by
using the logarithm of the nuclear norm, instead of the original nuclear norm,
which adaptively assigns weights on different singular values, and then extend
it to deal with the mixed noise. The proposed models, then, are solved using
the effective alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). Experiments on
several public face databases demonstrate the superior performance and efficacy
of the proposed approaches for color FR, especially for some difficult
conditions (occlusion, illumination and mixed noise) over some state-of-the-art
regression analysis-based approaches.

Title: Interplay between diffusion anisotropy and mesh skewness in Hybrid
  High-Order schemes
Authors: Jerome Droniou
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: FVCA9 proceedings (keynote lecture)
\\
  We explore the effects of mesh skewness on the accuracy of standard Hybrid
High-Order (HHO) schemes for anisotropic diffusion equations. After defining a
notion of regular skewed mesh sequences, which allows, e.g., for elements that
become more and more elongated during mesh refinement, we establish an error
estimate in which we precisely track the dependency of the local multiplicative
constants in terms of the diffusion tensor and mesh skewness. This dependency
makes explicit an interplay between the local diffusion properties and the
distortion of the elements. We then provide several numerical results to assess
the practical convergence properties of HHO for highly anisotropic diffusion or
highly distorted meshes. These tests indicate a more robust behaviour than the
theoretical estimate indicates.

Title: Complexity Analysis of a Stochastic Cubic Regularisation Method under
  Inexact Gradient Evaluations and Dynamic Hessian Accuracy
Authors: Stefania Bellavia and Gianmarco Gurioli
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 25 pages
\\
  We here adapt an extended version of the adaptive cubic regularisation method
with dynamic inexact Hessian information for nonconvex optimisation in [2] to
the stochastic optimisation setting. While exact function evaluations are still
considered, this novel variant inherits the innovative use of adaptive accuracy
requirements for Hessian approximations introduced in [2] and additionally
employs inexact computations of the gradient. Without restrictions on the
variance of the errors, we assume that these approximations are available
within a sufficiently large, but fixed, probability and we extend, in the
spirit of [13], the deterministic analysis of the framework to its stochastic
counterpart, showing that the expected number of iterations to reach a
first-order stationary point matches the well known worst-case optimal
complexity. This is, in fact, still given by O(epsilon^(-3/2)), with respect to
the first-order epsilon tolerance.

Title: Uniform error bounds of a time-splitting spectral method for the
  long-time dynamics of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with weak
  nonlinearity
Authors: Weizhu Bao, Yue Feng and Chunmei Su
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 34 pages, 3 figures and 6 tables
MSC-class: 35L70, 65M12, 65M15, 65M70, 81-08
\\
  We establish uniform error bounds of a time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral
(TSFP) method for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with weak cubic
nonlinearity (and $O(1)$ initial data), while the nonlinearity strength is
characterized by $\varepsilon^2$ with $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$ a dimensionless
parameter, for the long-time dynamics up to the time at $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$.
In fact, when $0 < \varepsilon \ll 1$, the problem is equivalent to the
long-time dynamics of NKGE with small initial data (and cubic nonlinearity with
$O(1)$ nonlinearity strength), while the amplitude of the initial data (and the
solution) is at $O(\varepsilon)$. By reformulating the NKGE into a relativistic
nonlinear Sch\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE), we adapt the TSFP method to
discretize it numerically. By using the method of mathematical induction to
bound the numerical solution, we prove uniform error bounds at
$O(h^{m}+\tau^2)$ of the TSFP method with $h$ mesh size, $\tau$ time step and
$m\ge2$ depending on the regularity of the solution, while the error bounds are
independent of $\varepsilon$ and they are uniformly valid for
$\varepsilon\in(0,1]$ and are uniformly accurate for the long-time simulation
up to the time at $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$. Numerical results are reported to
confirm our error bounds and to demonstrate that they are sharp. Finally, the
TSFP method and its error bounds are extended to an oscillatory complex NKGE
which propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ in space and
$O(\varepsilon^{\beta})$ ($0<\beta\le 2$) in time.

Title: The Role of PDE-Based Parameterization Techniques in Gradient-Based IGA
  Shape Optimization Applications
Authors: Jochen Hinz, Andrzej Jaeschke, Matthias M\"oller, Cornelis Vuik
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This paper proposes a shape optimization algorithm based on the principles of
Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) in which the parameterization of the geometry
enters the problem formulation as an additional PDE-constraint. Inspired by the
isoparametric principle of IGA, the parameterization and the governing state
equation are treated using the same numerical technique. This leads to a scheme
that is comparatively easy to differentiate, allowing for a fully symbolic
derivation of the gradient and subsequent gradient-based optimization. To
improve the efficiency and robustness of the scheme, the basis is re-selected
during each optimization iteration and adjusted to the current needs. The
scheme is validated in two test cases.

Title: Finite Element Methods for One Dimensional Elliptic Distributed Optimal
  Control Problems with Pointwise Constraints on the Derivative of the State
Authors: Susanne C. Brenner and Li-Yeng Sung and Winnifried Wollner
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.OC
MSC-class: 49J15, 65N30, 65N15
\\
  We investigate $C^1$ finite element methods for one dimensional elliptic
distributed optimal control problems with pointwise constraints on the
derivative of the state formulated as fourth order variational inequalities for
the state variable. For the problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions, we use
an existing $H^{\frac52-\epsilon}$ regularity result for the optimal state to
derive $O(h^{\frac12-\epsilon})$ convergence for the approximation of the
optimal state in the $H^2$ norm. For the problem with mixed Dirichlet and
Neumann boundary conditions, we show that the optimal state belongs to $H^3$
under appropriate assumptions on the data and obtain $O(h)$ convergence for the
approximation of the optimal state in the $H^2$ norm.

  This work is devoted to the obtaining of a new numerical scheme based in
quadrature formulas for the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral for the approximation
of Stieltjes ordinary differential equations. This novel method allows us to
numerically approximate models based in Stieltjes ordinary differential
equations for which no explicit solution is known. We prove several theoretical
results related to the consistency, convergence and stability of the numerical
method. We also obtain the explicit solution of the Stieltjes linear ordinary
differential equation, and we use it to validate the numerical method. Finally,
we present some numerical results that we have obtained for a realistic
population model based in a Stieltjes differential equation.

Title: Algebraic stabilization of a $\boldsymbol{Q}_1-\boldsymbol{P}_0$
  Lagrangian formulation for frictional contact mechanics with hydraulically
  active fractures
Authors: Andrea Franceschini, Nicola Castelletto, Joshua A. White, Hamdi A.

Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Accurate numerical simulation of coupled fracture/fault deformation and fluid
flow is crucial to the performance and safety assessment of many subsurface
systems. In this work, we consider the discretization and enforcement of
contact conditions at such surfaces. The bulk rock deformation is simulated
using low-order continuous finite elements, while frictional contact conditions
are imposed by means of a Lagrange multiplier method. We employ a cell-centered
finite-volume scheme to solve the fracture fluid mass balance equation. From a
modeling perspective, a convenient choice is to use a single grid for both
mechanical and flow processes, with piecewise-constant interpolation of
Lagrange multipliers, i.e., contact tractions and fluid pressure.
Unfortunately, this combination of displacement and multiplier variables is not
uniformly inf-sup stable, and therefore requires a stabilization technique.
Starting from a macroelement analysis, we develop two algebraic stabilization
approaches and compare them in terms of robustness and convergence rate. The
proposed approaches are validated against challenging analytical two- and
three-dimensional benchmarks to demonstrate accuracy and robustness. These
benchmarks include both pure contact mechanics problems and well as problems
with tightly-coupled fracture flow.

Title: Learning Absolute Sound Source Localisation With Limited Supervisions
Authors: Yang Chu, Wayne Luk, Dan Goodman
Categories: cs.NE q-bio.NC
\\
  An accurate auditory space map can be learned from auditory experience, for
example during development or in response to altered auditory cues such as a
modified pinna. We studied neural network models that learn to localise a
single sound source in the horizontal plane using binaural cues based on
limited supervisions. These supervisions can be unreliable or sparse in real
life. First, a simple model that has unreliable estimation of the sound source
location is built, in order to simulate the unreliable auditory orienting
response of newborns. It is used as a Teacher that acts as a source of
unreliable supervisions. Then we show that it is possible to learn a continuous
auditory space map based only on noisy left or right feedbacks from the
Teacher. Furthermore, reinforcement rewards from the environment are used as a
source of sparse supervision. By combining the unreliable innate response and
the sparse reinforcement rewards, an accurate auditory space map, which is hard
to be achieved by either one of these two kind of supervisions, can eventually
be learned. Our results show that the auditory space mapping can be calibrated
even without explicit supervision. Moreover, this study implies a possibly more
general neural mechanism where multiple sub-modules can be coordinated to
facilitate each other's learning process under limited supervisions.

Title: Spiking Inception Module for Multi-layer Unsupervised Spiking Neural
  Networks

  Neural Networks (IJCNN)
\\
  Spiking Neural Network (SNN), as a brain-inspired approach, is attracting
attentions due to its potential to produce ultra-high-energy-efficient
hardware. Competitive learning based on Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity
(STDP) is a popular method to train unsupervised SNN. However, previous
unsupervised SNNs trained through this method are limited to shallow networks
with only one learnable layer and can't achieve satisfactory results when
compared with multi-layer SNNs. In this paper, we ease this limitation by: 1)We
propose Spiking Inception (Sp-Inception) module, inspired by the Inception
module in Artificial Neural Network (ANN) literature. This module is trained
through STDP- based competitive learning and outperforms baseline modules on
learning capability, learning efficiency, and robustness; 2)We propose
Pooling-Reshape-Activate (PRA) layer to make Sp-Inception module stackable;
3)We stack multiple Sp-Inception modules to construct multi-layer SNNs. Our
method greatly exceeds baseline methods on image classification tasks and
reaches state-of-the-art results on MNIST dataset among existing unsupervised
SNNs.

Title: Exploitation and Exploration Analysis of Elitist Evolutionary
  Algorithms: A Case Study
Authors: Yu Chen and Jun He
Categories: cs.NE
\\
  Known as two cornerstones of problem solving by search, exploitation and
exploration are extensively discussed for implementation and application of
evolutionary algorithms (EAs). However, only a few researches focus on
evaluation and theoretical estimation of exploitation and exploration.
Considering that exploitation and exploration are two issues regarding global
search and local search, this paper proposes to evaluate them via the success
probability and the one-step improvement rate computed in different domains of
integration. Then, case studies are performed by analyzing performances of
(1+1) random univariate search and (1+1) evolutionary programming on the sphere
function and the cheating problem. By rigorous theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that both exploitation and exploration of the investigated elitist
EAs degenerate exponentially with the problem dimension $n$. Meanwhile, it is
also shown that maximization of exploitation and exploration can be achieved by
setting an appropriate value for the standard deviation $\sigma$ of Gaussian
mutation, which is positively related to the distance from the present solution
to the center of the promising region.

Title: IoT Behavioral Monitoring via Network Traffic Analysis
Authors: Arunan Sivanathan
Categories: cs.NI cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Smart homes, enterprises, and cities are increasingly being equipped with a
plethora of Internet of Things (IoT), ranging from smart-lights to security
cameras. While IoT networks have the potential to benefit our lives, they
create privacy and security challenges not seen with traditional IT networks.
Due to the lack of visibility, operators of such smart environments are not
often aware of their IoT assets, let alone whether each IoT device is
functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This thesis is the culmination of
our efforts to develop techniques to profile the network behavioral pattern of
IoTs, automate IoT classification, deduce their operating context, and detect
anomalous behavior indicative of cyber-attacks.
  We begin this thesis by surveying IoT ecosystem, while reviewing current
approaches to vulnerability assessments, intrusion detection, and behavioral
monitoring. For our first contribution, we collect traffic traces and
characterize the network behavior of IoT devices via attributes from traffic
patterns. We develop a robust machine learning-based inference engine trained
with these attributes and demonstrate real-time classification of 28 IoT
devices with over 99% accuracy. Our second contribution enhances the
classification by reducing the cost of attribute extraction while also
identifying IoT device states. Prototype implementation and evaluation
demonstrate the ability of our supervised machine learning method to detect
behavioral changes for five IoT devices. Our third and final contribution
develops a modularized unsupervised inference engine that dynamically
accommodates the addition of new IoT devices and/or updates to existing ones,
without requiring system-wide retraining of the model. We demonstrate via
experiments that our model can automatically detect attacks and firmware
changes in ten IoT devices with over 94% accuracy.

  Virtual Node (VN) method is widely adopted to handle satellite network
topological dynamics. However, conventional VN method is insufficient when
earth rotation and inter-plane phase difference are considered. An improved VN
method based on Celestial Sphere Division is proposed to overcome the defects
of the conventional method. An optimized inter-satellite link connecting mode
is derived to achieve maximal available links. The optimal VN division solution
and addressing scheme are designed to generate a nearly static virtual network
and solve the asynchronous switches caused by inter-plane phase difference.
Comparison results demonstrate the advantages of proposed method.

Title: The Epistemic Landscape: a Computability Perspective
Authors: Fr\'ed\'eric Prost
Categories: cs.OH
\\
  By nature, transmissible human knowledge is enumerable: every sentence,
movie, audio record can be encoded in a sufficiently long string of 0's and
1's. The works of G\"odel, Turing and others showed that there are inherent
limits and properties associated with the fact that language technology is
enumerable. G\"odel's numbering technique is universal for enumerable
structures and shows strong limits of the language technology. Computability
theory is a particular example: programs can be numbered and all sorts of
limits can be studied from there. Computability is also at the heart of science
since any experimental validation of a theory supposes that theoretical results
have been computed, then checked against concrete experiments. It implies that
limitations on what is computable ultimately are also limits of what we
understand as "scientific theory", and more generally to all the transmissible
knowledge. We argue that it is fruitful to look a epistemology from a
computability perspective. We show that it allows to precisely define different
kinds of knowledge acquisition techniques, and helps the study of how they are
related to one another.

Categories: cs.PF
\\
  Binary code analysis is widely used to assess an a program's correctness,
performance, and provenance. Binary analysis applications often construct
control flow graphs, analyze data flow, and use debugging information to
understand how machine code relates to source lines, inlined functions, and
data types. To date, binary analysis has been single-threaded, which is too
slow for applications such as performance analysis and software forensics,
where it is becoming common to analyze binaries that are gigabytes in size and
in large batches that contain thousands of binaries.
  This paper describes our design and implementation for accelerating the
Dyninst binary analysis infrastructure with multithreading. Our goal is to
parallelize a commonly used set of binary analysis capabilities, making it
easier to parallelize different binary analysis applications. New parallel
binary analysis capabilities include constructing control flow graphs,
analyzing loop nesting, parsing debugging information, and performing data flow
analysis such as register liveness analysis and program slicing. We cover 146K
lines of source code in Dyninst and its software dependencies. A systematic
methodology to guide the parallelization is essential: we used data race
detection tools to identify unsafe parallelism and employed performance
profiling tools to pinpoint performance bottlenecks that merit attention. This
methodology guided us to design a new parallel analysis for constructing
control flow graphs and identify thread-safety issues widely spread in the
codebase. We achieved as much as 25X speedup for constructing control flow
graphs and as much as 14Xfor ingesting DWARF on 64 hardware threads. Binary
analysis applications are significantly accelerated with the new parallel
Dyninst: we achieve 8X for a performance analysis tool and 7X for a software
forensic tool with 16 hardware threads.

Title: Concise Read-Only Specifications for Better Synthesis of Programs with
  Pointers -- Extended Version
Authors: Andreea Costea, Amy Zhu, Nadia Polikarpova, Ilya Sergey
Categories: cs.PL cs.LO
\\
  In program synthesis there is a well-known trade-off between concise and
strong specifications: if a specification is too verbose, it might be harder to
write than the program; if it is too weak, the synthesised program might not
match the user's intent. In this work we explore the use of annotations for
restricting memory access permissions in program synthesis, and show that they
can make specifications much stronger while remaining surprisingly concise.
Specifically, we enhance Synthetic Separation Logic (SSL), a framework for
synthesis of heap-manipulating programs, with the logical mechanism of
read-only borrows. We observe that this minimalistic and conservative SSL
extension benefits the synthesis in several ways, making it more (a) expressive
(stronger correctness guarantees are achieved with a modest annotation
overhead), (b) effective (it produces more concise and easier-to-read
programs), (c) efficient (faster synthesis), and (d) robust (synthesis
efficiency is less affected by the choice of the search heuristic). We explain
the intuition and provide formal treatment for read-only borrows. We
substantiate the claims (a)--(d) by describing our quantitative evaluation of
the borrowing-aware synthesis implementation on a series of standard benchmark
specifications for various heap-manipulating programs.

Title: A Type and Scope Safe Universe of Syntaxes with Binding: Their Semantics
  and Proofs
Authors: Guillaume Allais and Robert Atkey and James Chapman and Conor McBride
  and James McKinna
Categories: cs.PL
Comments: Extended version of the ICFP 18 paper
\\
  Almost every programming language's syntax includes a notion of binder and
corresponding bound occurrences, along with the accompanying notions of
$\alpha$-equivalence, capture-avoiding substitution, typing contexts, runtime
environments, and so on. In the past, implementing and reasoning about
programming languages required careful handling to maintain the correct
behaviour of bound variables. Modern programming languages include features
that enable constraints like scope safety to be expressed in types.
Nevertheless, the programmer is still forced to write the same boilerplate over
again for each new implementation of a scope safe operation (e.g., renaming,
substitution, desugaring, printing, etc.), and then again for correctness
proofs.
  We present an expressive universe of syntaxes with binding and demonstrate
how to (1) implement scope safe traversals once and for all by generic
programming; and (2) how to derive properties of these traversals by generic
proving. Our universe description, generic traversals and proofs, and our
examples have all been formalised in Agda and are available in the accompanying
material available online at https://github.com/gallais/generic-syntax.

\\
  This paper presents a pedestrian motion model that includes both low level
trajectory patterns, and high level discrete transitions. The inclusion of both
levels creates a more general predictive model, allowing for more meaningful
prediction and reasoning about pedestrian trajectories, as compared to the
current state of the art. The model uses an iterative clustering algorithm with
(1) Dirichlet Process Gaussian Processes to cluster trajectories into
continuous motion patterns and (2) hypothesis testing to identify discrete
transitions in the data called transition points. The model iteratively splits
full trajectories into sub-trajectory clusters based on transition points,
where pedestrians make discrete decisions. State transition probabilities are
then learned over the transition points and trajectory clusters. The model is
for online prediction of motions, and detection of anomalous trajectories. The
proposed model is validated on the Duke MTMC dataset to demonstrate
identification of low level trajectory clusters and high level transitions, and
the ability to predict pedestrian motion and detect anomalies online with high
accuracy.

Title: Planning for the Unexpected: Explicitly Optimizing Motions for Ground
  Uncertainty in Running
Authors: Kevin Green, Ross L. Hatton, Jonathan Hurst
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Accepted to ICRA 2020
\\
  We propose a method to generate actuation plans for a reduced order, dynamic
model of bipedal running. This method explicitly enforces robustness to ground
uncertainty. The plan generated is not a fixed body trajectory that is
aggressively stabilized: instead, the plan interacts with the passive dynamics
of the reduced order model to create emergent robustness. The goal is to create
plans for legged robots that will be robust to imperfect perception of the
environment, and to work with dynamics that are too complex to optimize in
real-time. Working within this dynamic model of legged locomotion, we optimize
a set of disturbance cases together with the nominal case, all with linked
inputs. The input linking is nontrivial due to the hybrid dynamics of the
running model but our solution is effective and has analytical gradients. The
optimization procedure proposed is significantly slower than a standard

Title: Whole-Body Bilateral Teleoperation of a Redundant Aerial Manipulator
Authors: Andre Coelho, Harsimran Singh, Konstantin Kondak, Christian Ott

Comments: to be published in 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and
  Automation (ICRA)
\\
  Attaching a robotic manipulator to a flying base allows for significant
improvements in the reachability and versatility of manipulation tasks. In
order to explore such systems while taking advantage of human capabilities in
terms of perception and cognition, bilateral teleoperation arises as a
reasonable solution. However, since most telemanipulation tasks require visual
feedback in addition to the haptic one, real-time (task-dependent) positioning
of a video camera, which is usually attached to the flying base, becomes an
additional objective to be fulfilled. Since the flying base is part of the
kinematic structure of the robot, if proper care is not taken, moving the video
camera could undesirably disturb the end-effector motion. For that reason, the
necessity of controlling the base position in the null space of the
manipulation task arises. In order to provide the operator with meaningful
information about the limits of the allowed motions in the null space, this
paper presents a novel haptic concept called Null-Space Wall. In addition, a
framework to allow stable bilateral teleoperation of both tasks is presented.
Numerical simulation data confirm that the proposed framework is able to keep
the system passive while allowing the operator to perform time-delayed
telemanipulation and command the base to a task-dependent optimal pose.

Title: Software Logging for Machine Learning
Authors: Nathan Bosch and Jan Bosch
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  System logs perform a critical function in software-intensive systems as logs
record the state of the system and significant events in the system at
important points in time. Unfortunately, log entries are typically created in
an ad-hoc, unstructured and uncoordinated fashion, limiting their usefulness
for analytics and machine learning. In this paper, we present the main
challenges of contemporary approaches to generating and storing system logs
data for large, complex, software-intensive systems based on an in-depth case
study at a world-leading telecommunications company. Second, we present a
systematic and structured approach for generating log data that does not suffer
from the aforementioned challenges and is optimized for use in machine
learning. Third, we provide validation of the approach based on expert
interviews that confirms that the approach addresses the identified challenges
and problems.

  Quantum computers are becoming more mainstream. As more programmers are
starting to look at writing quantum programs, they face an inevitable task of
debugging their code. How should the programs for quantum computers be
debugged?
  In this paper, we discuss existing debugging tactics, used in developing
programs for classic computers, and show which ones can be readily adopted. We
also highlight quantum-computer-specific debugging issues and list novel
techniques that are needed to address these issues. The practitioners can
readily apply some of these tactics to their process of writing quantum
programs, while researchers can learn about opportunities for future work.

Title: Don't Feed the Troll: Detecting Troll Behavior via Inverse Reinforcement
  Learning
Authors: Luca Luceri, Silvia Giordano, Emilio Ferrara
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  Since the 2016 US Presidential election, social media abuse has been
eliciting massive concern in the academic community and beyond. Preventing and
limiting the malicious activity of users, such as trolls and bots, in their
manipulation campaigns is of paramount importance for the integrity of
democracy, public health, and more. However, the automated detection of troll
accounts is an open challenge. In this work, we propose an approach based on
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to capture troll behavior and identify
troll accounts. We employ IRL to infer a set of online incentives that may
steer user behavior, which in turn highlights behavioral differences between
troll and non-troll accounts, enabling their accurate classification. We report
promising results: the IRL-based approach is able to accurately detect troll
accounts (AUC=89.1%). The differences in the predictive features between the
two classes of accounts enables a principled understanding of the distinctive
behaviors reflecting the incentives trolls and non-trolls respond to.

Title: Facebook Ads Monitor: An Independent Auditing System for Political Ads

\\
  The 2016 United States presidential election was marked by the abuse of
targeted advertising on Facebook. Concerned with the risk of the same kind of
abuse to happen in the 2018 Brazilian elections, we designed and deployed an
independent auditing system to monitor political ads on Facebook in Brazil. To
do that we first adapted a browser plugin to gather ads from the timeline of
volunteers using Facebook. We managed to convince more than 2000 volunteers to
help our project and install our tool. Then, we use a Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) to detect political Facebook ads using word embeddings. To
evaluate our approach, we manually label a data collection of 10k ads as
political or non-political and then we provide an in-depth evaluation of
proposed approach for identifying political ads by comparing it with classic
supervised machine learning methods. Finally, we deployed a real system that
shows the ads identified as related to politics. We noticed that not all
political ads we detected were present in the Facebook Ad Library for political
ads. Our results emphasize the importance of enforcement mechanisms for
declaring political ads and the need for independent auditing platforms.

Categories: cs.SI econ.TH
Comments: 13 pages, 15 figures
\\
  In this work we present a strategic network formation model predicting the
emergence of multigroup structures. Individuals decide to form or remove links
based on the benefits and costs those connections carry; we focus on bilateral
consent for link formation. An exogenous system specifies the frequency of
coordination issues arising among the groups. We are interested in structures
that arise to resolve coordination issues and, specifically, structures in
which groups are linked through bridging, redundant, and co-membership
interconnections. We characterize the conditions under which certain structures
are stable and study their efficiency as well as the convergence of formation
dynamics.

Categories: cs.SI
Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Networks and data supported on graphs have become ubiquitous in the sciences
and engineering. This paper studies the 'blind' community detection problem,
where we seek to infer the community structure of a graph model given the
observation of independent graph signals on a set of nodes whose connections
are unknown. We model each observation as filtered white noise, where the
underlying network structure varies with every observation. These varying
network structures are modeled as independent realizations of a latent planted
partition model (PPM), justifying our assumption of a constant underlying
community structure over all observations. Under certain conditions on the
graph filter and PPM parameters, we propose algorithms for determining (i) the
number of latent communities and (ii) the associated partitions of the PPM. We
then prove statistical guarantees in the asymptotic and non-asymptotic sampling
cases. Numerical experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate the
efficacy of our algorithms.

\\
  Globally, two billion people and more than half of the poorest adults do not
use formal financial services. Consequently, there is increased emphasis on
developing financial technology that can facilitate access to financial
products for the unbanked. In this regard, smartphone-based microlending has
emerged as a potential solution to enhance financial inclusion.
  We propose a methodology to improve the predictive performance of credit
scoring models used by these applications. Our approach is composed of several
steps, where we mostly focus on engineering appropriate features from the user
data. Thereby, we construct pseudo-social networks to identify similar people
and combine complex network analysis with representation learning. Subsequently
we build credit scoring models using advanced machine learning techniques with
the goal of obtaining the most accurate credit scores, while also taking into
consideration ethical and privacy regulations to avoid unfair discrimination. A
successful deployment of our proposed methodology could improve the performance
of microlending smartphone applications and help enhance financial wellbeing
worldwide.

  In this paper we introduce a discrete time competing virus model and the
assumptions necessary for the model to be well posed. We analyze the system
exploring its different equilibria. We provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for the estimation of the model parameters from time series data and
introduce an online estimation algorithm. We employ a dataset of two competing
subsidy programs from the US Department of Agriculture to validate the model by
employing the identification techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this
work is the first to study competing virus models in discrete-time, online
identification of spread parameters from time series data, and validation of
said models using real data. These new contributions are important for
applications since real data is naturally sampled.

Title: PIRK: Scalable Interval Reachability Analysis for High-Dimensional
  Nonlinear Systems

\\
  Reachability analysis is a critical tool for the formal verification of
dynamical systems and the synthesis of controllers for them. Due to their
computational complexity, many reachability analysis methods are restricted to
systems with relatively small dimensions. One significant reason for such
limitation is that those approaches, and their implementations, are not
designed to leverage parallelism. They use algorithms that are designed to run
serially within one compute unit and they can not utilize widely-available
high-performance computing (HPC) platforms such as many-core CPUs, GPUs and
Cloud-computing services.
  This paper presents PIRK, a tool to efficiently compute reachable sets for
general nonlinear systems of extremely high dimensions. PIRK has been tested on
several systems, with state dimensions ranging from ten up to 4 billion. The
scalability of PIRK's parallel implementations is found to be highly favorable.

Title: An Improved Quadrature Voltage-Controlled Oscillator with

Authors: Dawei Li, Madhava Sarma Vemuri, Umamaheswara Rao Tida
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY

ACM-class: B.7.1
\\
  Low-power quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (QVCO) design utilizing
transformer-feedback and current-reuse techniques with increased frequency
range is proposed in this paper. With increasing demand for QVCOs in on-chip
applications, the conventional spiral inductor based approaches for QVCOs has
become a major bottleneck due to their large size. To address this concern, we
propose to replace the conventional spiral inductor based approaches with
through-silicon-via (TSV) inductor based approach in three-dimensional
integrated circuits (3D ICs). In addition, the proposed QVCO circuit can
provide higher frequency range of operation compared with conventional designs.
Experimental results show by replacing conventional spiral transformers with
TSV transformers, up to 3.9x reduction in metal resource consumption. The
proposed QVCOs achieves a phase noise of -114 $dBc/Hz$@1 $MHz$ and -111.2
$dBc/Hz$@1 $MHz$ at the carrier of 2.5 $GHz$ for toroidal TSV transformed
based-QVCO and vertical spiral transformer based-QVCO respectively. The power
consumption is only 1.5 $mW$ and 1.7 $mW$ for toroidal TSV transformed
based-QVCO and vertical spiral transformer based-QVCO respectively, under the
supply voltage of 0.7 $V$.

Title: Toward Automated Calibration of Data Center Digital Twins: A Neural
  Surrogate Approach
Authors: Ruihang Wang, Yuanlong Li, Linsen Dong, Xin Zhou, Yonggang Wen, Rui
  Tan, Li Chen, Guan Wang, Feng Zeng
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Evolving the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to high fidelity
digital twin is desirable for industrial data center management. However,
existing CFD model calibration approaches to improve the model accuracy require
either excessive manual tuning or intensive computation, rendering them
non-scalable with system size and complexity. This paper presents a
surrogate-based approach to automate the calibration of CFD models built for
industrial data centers. Specifically, a knowledge-based graph neural net (GNN)
is trained to approximate a CFD model as a surrogate model that captures the
key thermal variables and their causal relationships in a given data hall. By
integrating prior knowledge as constraints, the GNN has reduced demand on the
amount of training data. After rounds of the training processes, the neural
surrogate can recommend the optimal configurations for the CFD model parameters
that are hard to obtain, such that the temperatures predicted by the CFD are
most consistent with the actual measurements. Experiments of applying the
proposed approach to calibrate two CFD models built for two production data
halls hosting thousands of servers achieve temperature prediction errors of
$0.81^\circ$C and $0.75^\circ$C with about $30$ hours of computation on a
quad-core virtual machine in the cloud.

Title: Linear State Estimation and Bad Data Detection for Power Systems with
  RTU and PMU Measurements
Authors: Aleksandar Jovicic, Gabriela Hug
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In this paper, a novel linear algorithm is proposed for state estimation
including bad data detection of power systems that are monitored both by
conventional and synchrophasor measurements. Both types of data are treated
simultaneously and the states are estimated in rectangular coordinates. The
proposed estimator is based on the linear weighted least square method. To
enable the derivation of linear measurement functions, the network is modelled
in terms of voltages and currents in rectangular form and pseudo-measurements
are used to represent conventional measurements. Furthermore, the largest
normalized residual test is used to detect bad data. To validate the accuracy
and robustness of the proposed algorithm, several test cases of different sizes
are solved and the results are presented and discussed.

Title: The Voltage Regulation of Boost Converters Using Dual Heuristic
  Programming

Categories: eess.SY cs.AI cs.SY
Comments: Accepted paper in: 2020 IEEE 10th Annual Computing and Communication
  Workshop and Conference (CCWC), 2020
\\
  In this paper, a dual heuristic programming controller is proposed to control
a boost converter. Conventional controllers such as proportional integral
derivative (PID) or proportional integral (PI) are designed based on the
linearized small-signal model near the operating point. Therefore, the
performance of the controller during start up, load change, or input voltage
variation is not optimal since the system model changes by varying the
operating point. The dual heuristic programming controller optimally controls
the boost converter by following the approximate dynamic programming. The
advantage of the DHP is that the neural network based characteristic of the
proposed controller enables boost converters to easily cope with large
disturbances. A DHP with a well trained critic and action networks can perform
as an optimal controller for the boost converter. To compare the effectiveness
of the traditional PI based and the DHP boost converter, the simulation results
are provided.

  Distributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) requires to aggregate outputs
of distributed deep neural network (DNN)-based models. This work studies the
use of submodular functions to design a rank aggregation on score-based
permutations, which can be used for distributed ASR systems in both supervised
and unsupervised modes. Specifically, we compose an aggregation rank function
based on the Lovasz Bregman divergence for setting up linear structured convex
and nested structured concave functions. The algorithm is based on stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) and can obtain well-trained aggregation models. Our
experiments on the distributed ASR system show that the submodular rank
aggregation can obtain higher speech recognition accuracy than traditional
aggregation methods like Adaboost. Code is available

  Automatic speech transcription and speaker recognition are usually treated as
separate tasks even though they are interdependent. In this study, we
investigate training a single network to perform both tasks jointly. We train
the network in a supervised multi-task learning setup, where the speech
transcription branch of the network is trained to minimise a phonetic
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss while the speaker recognition
branch of the network is trained to label the input sequence with the correct
label for the speaker. We present a large-scale empirical study where the model
is trained using several thousand hours of labelled training data for each
task. We evaluate the speech transcription branch of the network on a voice
trigger detection task while the speaker recognition branch is evaluated on a
speaker verification task. Results demonstrate that the network is able to
encode both phonetic \emph{and} speaker information in its learnt
representations while yielding accuracies at least as good as the baseline
models for each task, with the same number of parameters as the independent
models.

  Voice-triggered smart assistants often rely on detection of a trigger-phrase
before they start listening for the user request. Mitigation of false triggers
is an important aspect of building a privacy-centric non-intrusive smart
assistant. In this paper, we address the task of false trigger mitigation (FTM)
using a novel approach based on analyzing automatic speech recognition (ASR)
lattices using graph neural networks (GNN). The proposed approach uses the fact
that decoding lattice of a falsely triggered audio exhibits uncertainties in
terms of many alternative paths and unexpected words on the lattice arcs as
compared to the lattice of a correctly triggered audio. A pure trigger-phrase
detector model doesn't fully utilize the intent of the user speech whereas by
using the complete decoding lattice of user audio, we can effectively mitigate
speech not intended for the smart assistant. We deploy two variants of GNNs in
this paper based on 1) graph convolution layers and 2) self-attention mechanism
respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that GNNs are highly accurate in FTM
task by mitigating ~87% of false triggers at 99% true positive rate (TPR).
Furthermore, the proposed models are fast to train and efficient in parameter
requirements.

segmentation. We summarized the latest DL-based methods for medical image
segmentation and applications. These methods were classified into six
categories according to their network design. For each category, we listed the
surveyed works, highlighted important contributions and identified specific
challenges. Following the detailed review of each category, we briefly
discussed its achievements, shortcomings and future potentials. We provided a
comprehensive comparison among DL-based methods for thoracic and head & neck
multiorgan segmentation using benchmark datasets, including the 2017 AAPM
Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge datasets and 2015 MICCAI Head Neck
Auto-Segmentation Challenge datasets.

\\
  We present a computational live bacteria detection system that periodically
captures coherent microscopy images of bacterial growth inside a 60 mm diameter
agar-plate and analyzes these time-lapsed holograms using deep neural networks
for rapid detection of bacterial growth and classification of the corresponding
species. The performance of our system was demonstrated by rapid detection of
Escherichia coli and total coliform bacteria (i.e., Klebsiella aerogenes and
Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae) in water samples. These results were
confirmed against gold-standard culture-based results, shortening the detection
time of bacterial growth by >12 h as compared to the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)-approved analytical methods. Our experiments further confirmed
that this method successfully detects 90% of bacterial colonies within 7-10 h
(and >95% within 12 h) with a precision of 99.2-100%, and correctly identifies
their species in 7.6-12 h with 80% accuracy. Using pre-incubation of samples in
growth media, our system achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of ~1 colony
forming unit (CFU)/L within 9 h of total test time. This computational bacteria
detection and classification platform is highly cost-effective (~$0.6 per test)
and high-throughput with a scanning speed of 24 cm2/min over the entire plate
surface, making it highly suitable for integration with the existing analytical
methods currently used for bacteria detection on agar plates. Powered by deep
learning, this automated and cost-effective live bacteria detection platform
can be transformative for a wide range of applications in microbiology by
significantly reducing the detection time, also automating the identification
of colonies, without labeling or the need for an expert.

Title: Intel Quantum Simulator: A cloud-ready high-performance simulator of
  quantum circuits
Authors: Gian Giacomo Guerreschi, Justin Hogaboam, Fabio Baruffa, Nicolas
  Sawaya
Categories: quant-ph cs.DC physics.comp-ph
\\
  Classical simulation of quantum computers will continue to play an essential
role in the progress of quantum information science, both for numerical studies
of quantum algorithms and for modelings noise and errors. Here we introduce the
latest release of the Intel Quantum Simulator (IQS), formerly known as
qHiPSTER. The high-performance computing (HPC) capability of the software
allows users to leverage the available hardware resources provided by
supercomputers, as well as available public cloud computing infrastructure. To
take advantage of the latter platform, together with the distributed simulation
of each separate quantum state, IQS offers the possibility of simulating a pool
of related circuits in parallel. We highlight the technical implementation of
the distributed algorithm and details about the new pool functionality. We also
include some basic benchmarks (up to 42 qubits) and performance results
obtained using HPC infrastructure. Finally, we use IQS to emulate a scenario in
which many quantum devices are running in parallel to implement the quantum
approximate optimization algorithm, using particle swarm optimization as the
classical subroutine. The results demonstrate that the hyperparameters of this
classical optimization algorithm depends on the total number of quantum circuit
simulations one has the bandwidth to perform. The Intel Quantum Simulator has
been released open-source with permissive licensing and is designed to simulate
a large number of qubits, to emulate multiple quantum devices running in
parallel, and/or to study the effects of decoherence and other hardware errors
on calculation results.

Title: Analytical Modeling of the Path-Loss for Reconfigurable Intelligent
  Surfaces -- Anomalous Mirror or Scatterer ?
Authors: Marco Di Renzo, Fadil Habibi Danufane, Xiaojun Xi, Julien de Rosny,
  and Sergei Tretyakov
Categories: physics.class-ph cs.ET eess.SP physics.optics
\\
  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are an emerging field of research
in wireless communications. A fundamental component for analyzing and
optimizing RIS-empowered wireless networks is the development of simple but
sufficiently accurate models for the power scattered by an RIS. By leveraging
the general scalar theory of diffraction and the Huygens-Fresnel principle, we
introduce simple formulas for the electric field scattered by an RIS that is
modeled as a sheet of electromagnetic material of negligible thickness. The
proposed approach allows us to identify the conditions under which an RIS of
finite size can or cannot be approximated as an anomalous mirror. Numerical
results are illustrated to confirm the proposed approach.

Title: Flexible Multiple Access Enabling Low-Latency Communications:
  Introducing NOMA-R
Authors: Mouktar Bello, Wenjuan Yu, Mylene Pischella, Arsenia Chorti, Inbar
  Fijalkow, Leila Musavian
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Various verticals in 5G and beyond (B5G) networks require very stringent
latency guarantees, while at the same time envisioning massive connectivity. As
a result, choosing the optimal multiple access (MA) technique to achieve low
latency is a key enabler of B5G. In particular, this issue is more acute in
uplink transmissions due to the potentially high number of collisions. On this
premise, in the present contribution we discuss the issue of delay-sensitive
uplink connectivity using optimized MA techniques; to this end, we perform a
comparative analysis of various MA approaches with respect to the achievable
effective capacity (EC). As opposed to standard rate (PHY) or throughput (MAC)
analyses, we propose the concept of the effective capacity as a suitable metric
for characterizing jointly PHY-MAC layer delays. The palette of investigated MA
approaches includes standard orthogonal MA (OMA) and power domain non
orthogonal MA (NOMA) in uplink scenarios, both considering random pairing and
optimized pairing alternatives. It further extends to encompass a recently
proposed third alternative, referred to as NOMA-Relevant (NOMA-R), which
extends OMA and NOMA approaches by flexibly selecting the MA technique. We show
that optimizing both user pairing and MA selection increases the network EC,
especially when stringent delay constraints are in place; thus a flexible MA is
a potentially preferable strategy for future low latency applications

Title: Low Complexity Iterative Rake Detector for Orthogonal Time Frequency
  Space Modulation
Authors: Tharaj Thaj, Emanuele Viterbo
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Accepted in IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference
  (WCNC), 2020
\\
  This paper presents a linear complexity iterative rake detector for the
recently proposed orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme. The
basic idea is to extract and combine the received multipath components of the
transmitted symbols in the delay-Doppler grid using linear diversity combining
schemes like maximal ratio combining (MRC), equal gain combining and selection
combining to improve the SNR of the combined signal. We reformulate the OTFS
input-output relation in the vector form by placing some null symbols in the
delay-Doppler grid thereby exploiting the block circulant property of the
channel matrix. Using the new input-output relation we propose a low complexity
iterative detector based on the MRC scheme. The bit error rate (BER)
performance of the proposed detector will be compared with the state of the art
message passing detector and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
scheme employing a single tap minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer. We
also show that the frame error rate (FER) performance of the MRC detector can
be improved by employing error correcting codes operating in the form of a
turbo decision feedback equalizer (DFE).

Title: On Newton Screening
Authors: Jian Huang, Yuling Jiao, Lican Kang, Jin Liu, Yanyan Liu, Xiliang Lu,
  and Yuanyuan Yang
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.OC stat.ME
\\
  Screening and working set techniques are important approaches to reducing the
size of an optimization problem. They have been widely used in accelerating
first-order methods for solving large-scale sparse learning problems. In this
paper, we develop a new screening method called Newton screening (NS) which is
a generalized Newton method with a built-in screening mechanism. We derive an
equivalent KKT system for the Lasso and utilize a generalized Newton method to
solve the KKT equations. Based on this KKT system, a built-in working set with
a relatively small size is first determined using the sum of primal and dual
variables generated from the previous iteration, then the primal variable is
updated by solving a least-squares problem on the working set and the dual
variable updated based on a closed-form expression. Moreover, we consider a
sequential version of Newton screening (SNS) with a warm-start strategy. We
show that NS possesses an optimal convergence property in the sense that it
achieves one-step local convergence. Under certain regularity conditions on the
feature matrix, we show that SNS hits a solution with the same signs as the
underlying true target and achieves a sharp estimation error bound with high
probability. Simulation studies and real data analysis support our theoretical
results and demonstrate that SNS is faster and more accurate than several
state-of-the-art methods in our comparative studies.

Title: Binary Classification from Positive Data with Skewed Confidence
Authors: Kazuhiko Shinoda, Hirotaka Kaji, Masashi Sugiyama
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Positive-confidence (Pconf) classification [Ishida et al., 2018] is a
promising weakly-supervised learning method which trains a binary classifier
only from positive data equipped with confidence. However, in practice, the
confidence may be skewed by bias arising in an annotation process. The Pconf
classifier cannot be properly learned with skewed confidence, and consequently,
the classification performance might be deteriorated. In this paper, we
introduce the parameterized model of the skewed confidence, and propose the
method for selecting the hyperparameter which cancels out the negative impact
of skewed confidence under the assumption that we have the misclassification
rate of positive samples as a prior knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method through a synthetic experiment with simple linear models
and benchmark problems with neural network models. We also apply our method to
drivers' drowsiness prediction to show that it works well with a real-world
problem where confidence is obtained based on manual annotation.

Title: Masked cross self-attention encoding for deep speaker embedding
Authors: Soonshin Seo, Daniel Jun Rim, Junseok Oh, Ji-Hwan Kim
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML
Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables
\\
  In general, speaker verification tasks require the extraction of speaker
embedding from a deep neural network. As speaker embedding may contain
additional information such as noise besides speaker information, its
variability controlling is needed. Our previous model have used multiple
pooling based on shortcut connections to amplify speaker information by
deepening the dimension; however, the problem of variability remains. In this
paper, we propose a masked cross self-attention encoding (MCSAE) for deep
speaker embedding. This method controls the variability of speaker embedding by
focusing on each masked output of multiple pooling on each other. The output of
the MCSAE is used to construct the deep speaker embedding. Experimental results
on VoxCeleb data set demonstrate that the proposed approach improves
performance as compared with previous state-of-the-art models.

Title: Convergence Guarantees for Gaussian Process Approximations Under Several
  Observation Models
Authors: George Wynne, Fran\c{c}ois-Xavier Briol and Mark Girolami
Categories: math.ST cs.LG cs.NA math.NA stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  Gaussian processes are ubiquitous in statistical analysis, machine learning
and applied mathematics. They provide a flexible modelling framework for
approximating functions, whilst simultaneously quantifying our uncertainty
about this task in a computationally tractable manner. An important question is
whether these approximations will be accurate, and if so how accurate, given
our various modelling choices and the difficulty of the problem. This is of
practical relevance, since the answer informs our choice of model and sampling
distribution for a given application.
  Our paper provides novel approximation guarantees for Gaussian process models
based on covariance functions with finite smoothness, such as the Mat\'ern and
Wendland covariance functions. They are derived from a sampling inequality
which facilitates a systematic approach to obtaining upper bounds on Sobolev
norms in terms of properties of the design used to collect data. This approach
allows us to refine some existing results which apply in the misspecified
smoothness setting and which allow for adaptive selection of hyperparameters.
However, the main novelty in this paper is that our results cover a wide range
of observation models including interpolation, approximation with deterministic
corruption and regression with Gaussian noise.

Title: Medical image reconstruction with image-adaptive priors learned by use
  of generative adversarial networks
Authors: Sayantan Bhadra, Weimin Zhou, and Mark A. Anastasio
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: SPIE Medical Imaging 2020
\\
  Medical image reconstruction is typically an ill-posed inverse problem. In
order to address such ill-posed problems, the prior distribution of the sought
after object property is usually incorporated by means of some
sparsity-promoting regularization. Recently, prior distributions for images
estimated using generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great promise
in regularizing some of these image reconstruction problems. In this work, we
apply an image-adaptive GAN-based reconstruction method (IAGAN) to reconstruct
high fidelity images from incomplete medical imaging data. It is observed that
the IAGAN method can potentially recover fine structures in the object that are
relevant for medical diagnosis but may be oversmoothed in reconstructions with
traditional sparsity-promoting regularization.

  Under noisy conditions, speech recognition systems suffer from high Word
Error Rates (WER). In such cases, information from the visual modality
comprising the speaker lip movements can help improve the performance. In this
work, we propose novel methods to fuse information from audio and visual
modalities at inference time. This enables us to train the acoustic and visual
models independently. First, we train separate RNN-HMM based acoustic and
visual models. A common WFST generated by taking a special union of the HMM
components is used for decoding using a modified Viterbi algorithm. Second, we
train separate seq2seq acoustic and visual models. The decoding step is
performed simultaneously for both modalities using shallow fusion while
maintaining a common hypothesis beam. We also present results for a novel
seq2seq fusion without the weighing parameter. We present results at varying
SNR and show that our methods give significant improvements over acoustic-only
WER.

  We introduce a notion of "effective dimension" of a statistical model based
on the number of cubes of size $1/\sqrt{n}$ needed to cover the model space
when endowed with the Fisher Information Matrix as metric, $n$ being the number
of observations. The number of observations fixes a natural scale or
resolution. The effective dimension is then measured via the spectrum of the
Fisher Information Matrix regularized using this natural scale.

  Outdoor acoustic events detection is an exciting research field but
challenged by the need for complex algorithms and deep learning techniques,
typically requiring many computational, memory, and energy resources. This
challenge discourages IoT implementation, where an efficient use of resources
is required. However, current embedded technologies and microcontrollers have
increased their capabilities without penalizing energy efficiency. This paper
addresses the application of sound event detection at the edge, by optimizing
deep learning techniques on resource-constrained embedded platforms for the
IoT. The contribution is two-fold: firstly, a two-stage student-teacher
approach is presented to make state-of-the-art neural networks for sound event
detection fit on current microcontrollers; secondly, we test our approach on an
ARM Cortex M4, particularly focusing on issues related to 8-bits quantization.
Our embedded implementation can achieve 68% accuracy in recognition on
Urbansound8k, not far from state-of-the-art performance, with an inference time
of 125 ms for each second of the audio stream, and power consumption of 5.5 mW
in just 34.3 kB of RAM.

Title: An Upper Bound of the Bias of Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression under
  Lipschitz Assumptions
Authors: Samuele Tosatto, Riad Akrour, Jan Peters
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  The Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator is among the most popular nonparameteric
regression technique thanks to its simplicity. Its asymptotic bias has been
studied by Rosenblatt in 1969 and has been reported in a number of related
literature. However, Rosenblatt's analysis is only valid for infinitesimal
bandwidth. In contrast, we propose in this paper an upper bound of the bias
which holds for finite bandwidths. Moreover, contrarily to the classic analysis
we allow for discontinuous first order derivative of the regression function,
we extend our bounds for multidimensional domains and we include the knowledge
of the bound of the regression function when it exists and if it is known, to
obtain a tighter bound. We believe that this work has potential applications in
those fields where some hard guarantees on the error are needed

\\
  Background: Elderly patients with MODS have high risk of death and poor
prognosis. The performance of current scoring systems assessing the severity of
MODS and its mortality remains unsatisfactory. This study aims to develop an
interpretable and generalizable model for early mortality prediction in elderly
patients with MODS. Methods: The MIMIC-III, eICU-CRD and PLAGH-S databases were
employed for model generation and evaluation. We used the eXtreme Gradient
Boosting model with the SHapley Additive exPlanations method to conduct early
and interpretable predictions of patients' hospital outcome. Three types of
data source combinations and five typical evaluation indexes were adopted to
develop a generalizable model. Findings: The interpretable model, with optimal
performance developed by using MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD datasets, was separately
validated in MIMIC-III, eICU-CRD and PLAGH-S datasets (no overlapping with
training set). The performances of the model in predicting hospital mortality
as validated by the three datasets were: AUC of 0.858, sensitivity of 0.834 and
specificity of 0.705; AUC of 0.849, sensitivity of 0.763 and specificity of
0.784; and AUC of 0.838, sensitivity of 0.882 and specificity of 0.691,
respectively. Comparisons of AUC between this model and baseline models with
MIMIC-III dataset validation showed superior performances of this model; In
addition, comparisons in AUC between this model and commonly used clinical
scores showed significantly better performance of this model. Interpretation:
The interpretable machine learning model developed in this study using fused
datasets with large sample sizes was robust and generalizable. This model
outperformed the baseline models and several clinical scores for early
prediction of mortality in elderly ICU patients. The interpretative nature of
this model provided clinicians with the ranking of mortality risk features.

conditional expectation, the decision maker targets the treatment which
maximizes a general functional of the conditional potential outcome

functional such as an inequality, welfare or poverty measure. We develop
expected regret lower bounds for this problem, and construct a near minimax

\\
  Spoken language identification (LID) technologies have improved in recent
years from discriminating largely distinct languages to discriminating highly
similar languages or even dialects of the same language. One aspect that has
been mostly neglected, however, is discrimination of languages for multilingual
speakers, despite being a primary target audience of many systems that utilize
LID technologies. As we show in this work, LID systems can have a high average
accuracy for most combinations of languages while greatly underperforming for
others when accented speech is present. We address this by using
coarser-grained targets for the acoustic LID model and integrating its outputs
with interaction context signals in a context-aware model to tailor the system
to each user. This combined system achieves an average 97% accuracy across all
language combinations while improving worst-case accuracy by over 60% relative
to our baseline.

Title: Constructing subgradients from directional derivatives for functions of
  two variables
Authors: Kamil A. Khan and Yingwei Yuan
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 17 pages, 3 figures
MSC-class: 49J52
\\
  For any bivariate function that is locally Lipschitz continuous and
directionally differentiable, it is shown that subgradients may always be
constructed from the function's directional derivatives in the four compass
directions, arranged in a so-called "compass difference". When the original
function is nonconvex, the obtained subgradient is an element of Clarke's
generalized gradient, but the result appears to be novel even for convex
functions. The function is not required to be represented in any particular
form, and no further assumptions are required, though the result is
strengthened when the function is additionally L-smooth in the sense of
Nesterov. For certain optimal-value functions and certain parametric solutions
of differential equation systems, these new results appear to provide the only
known way to compute subgradients. These results also imply that centered
finite differences approximate subgradients well for bivariate nonsmooth
functions. As a dual result, we find that any compact convex set in two
dimensions contains the midpoint of its interval hull. Examples are included
for illustration, and it is argued that these results do not extend directly to
functions of more than two variables or sets in higher dimensions.

\\
  We formulate the two-dimensional gravity-capillary water wave equations in a
spatially quasi-periodic setting and present a numerical study of traveling
waves and more general solutions of the initial value problem. The former are a
generalization of the classical Wilton ripple problem. We adopt a conformal
mapping formulation and employ a quasi-periodic version of the Hilbert
transform to determine the normal velocity of the free surface. We compute
traveling waves in a nonlinear least-squares framework using a variant of the
Levenberg-Marquardt method. We propose four methods for timestepping the
initial value problem, two explicit Runge-Kutta (ERK) methods and two
exponential time-differencing (ETD) schemes. The latter approach makes use of
the small-scale decomposition to eliminate stiffness due to surface tension. We
investigate various properties of quasi-periodic traveling waves, including
Fourier resonances and the dependence of wave speed and surface tension on the
amplitude parameters that describe a two-parameter family of waves. We also
present an example of a periodic wave profile containing vertical tangent lines
that is set in motion with a quasi-periodic velocity potential that causes some
of the waves to overturn and others to flatten out as time evolves.

Title: Stochastic approximation for optimization in shape spaces
Authors: Caroline Geiersbach, Estefania Loayza-Romero and Kathrin Welker
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
\\
  In this work, we present a novel approach for solving stochastic shape
optimization problems. Our method is the extension of the classical stochastic
gradient method to infinite-dimensional shape manifolds. We prove convergence
of the method on Riemannian manifolds and then make the connection to shape
spaces. The method is demonstrated on a model shape optimization problem from
interface identification. Uncertainty arises in the form of a random partial
differential equation, where underlying probability distributions of the random
coefficients and inputs are assumed to be known. We verify some conditions for
convergence for the model problem and demonstrate the method numerically.

Title: About Convergence and Order of Convergence of some Fractional
  Derivatives
Authors: Sabrina Roscani and Lucas Venturato

MSC-class: 26A33, 41A25, 47G20
\\
  In this paper we establish some convergence results for Riemann-Liouville,
Caputo, and Caputo-Fabrizio fractional operators when the order of
differentiation approaches one. We consider some errors given by $\left|\left|
D^{1-\al}f -f'\right|\right|_p$ for p=1 and $p=\infty$ and we prove that for
both Caputo and Caputo Fabrizio operators the order of convergence is a
positive real r, 0<r<1. Finally, we compare the speed of convergence between
Caputo and Caputo-Fabrizio operators obtaining that they a related by the
Digamma function.

Title: Maximum likelihood estimation and uncertainty quantification for
  Gaussian process approximation of deterministic functions
Authors: Toni Karvonen, George Wynne, Filip Tronarp, Chris J. Oates, Simo
  S\"arkk\"a
Categories: math.ST cs.NA math.NA stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  Despite the ubiquity of the Gaussian process regression model, few
theoretical results are available that account for the fact that parameters of
the covariance kernel typically need to be estimated from the dataset. This
article provides one of the first theoretical analyses in the context of
Gaussian process regression with a noiseless dataset. Specifically, we consider
the scenario where the scale parameter of a Sobolev kernel (such as a Mat\'ern
kernel) is estimated by maximum likelihood. We show that the maximum likelihood
estimation of the scale parameter alone provides significant adaptation against
misspecification of the Gaussian process model in the sense that the model can
become "slowly" overconfident at worst, regardless of the difference between
the smoothness of the data-generating function and that expected by the model.
The analysis is based on a combination of techniques from nonparametric
regression and scattered data interpolation. Empirical results are provided in
support of the theoretical findings.

Title: Domain decomposition for entropy regularized optimal transport
Authors: Mauro Bonafini and Bernhard Schmitzer
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
\\
  We study Benamou's domain decomposition algorithm for optimal transport in
the entropy regularized setting. The key observation is that the regularized
variant converges to the globally optimal solution under very mild assumptions.
We prove linear convergence of the algorithm with respect to the
Kullback--Leibler divergence and illustrate the (potentially very slow) rates
with numerical examples.
  On problems with sufficient geometric structure (such as Wasserstein
distances between images) we expect much faster convergence. We then discuss
important aspects of a computationally efficient implementation, such as
adaptive sparsity, a coarse-to-fine scheme and parallelization, paving the way
to numerically solving large-scale optimal transport problems. We demonstrate
efficient numerical performance for computing the Wasserstein-2 distance
between 2D images and observe that, even without parallelization, domain
decomposition compares favorably to applying a single efficient implementation
of the Sinkhorn algorithm in terms of runtime, memory and solution quality.

  We investigate the Hilbert complex of elasticity involving spaces of
symmetric tensor fields. For the involved tensor fields and operators we show
closed ranges, Friedrichs/Poincare type estimates, Helmholtz type
decompositions, regular decompositions, regular potentials, finite cohomology
groups, and, most importantly, new compact embedding results. Our results hold
for general bounded strong Lipschitz domains of arbitrary topology and rely on
a general functional analysis framework (FA-ToolBox).

Title: Weighted Speech Distortion Losses for Neural-network-based Real-time
  Speech Enhancement
Authors: Yangyang Xia, Sebastian Braun, Chandan K. A. Reddy, Harishchandra
  Dubey, Ross Cutler, Ivan Tashev
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
\\
  This paper investigates several aspects of training a RNN (recurrent neural
network) that impact the objective and subjective quality of enhanced speech
for real-time single-channel speech enhancement. Specifically, we focus on a
RNN that enhances short-time speech spectra on a single-frame-in,
single-frame-out basis, a framework adopted by most classical signal processing
methods. We propose two novel mean-squared-error-based learning objectives that
enable separate control over the importance of speech distortion versus noise
reduction. The proposed loss functions are evaluated by widely accepted
objective quality and intelligibility measures and compared to other
competitive online methods. In addition, we study the impact of feature
normalization and varying batch sequence lengths on the objective quality of
enhanced speech. Finally, we show subjective ratings for the proposed approach
and a state-of-the-art real-time RNN-based method.

Title: Unsupervised Pre-training of Bidirectional Speech Encoders via Masked
  Reconstruction
Authors: Weiran Wang, Qingming Tang, Karen Livescu
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: To appear in ICASSP 2020
\\
  We propose an approach for pre-training speech representations via a masked
reconstruction loss. Our pre-trained encoder networks are bidirectional and can
therefore be used directly in typical bidirectional speech recognition models.
The pre-trained networks can then be fine-tuned on a smaller amount of
supervised data for speech recognition. Experiments with this approach on the
LibriSpeech and Wall Street Journal corpora show promising results. We find
that the main factors that lead to speech recognition improvements are: masking
segments of sufficient width in both time and frequency, pre-training on a much
larger amount of unlabeled data than the labeled data, and domain adaptation
when the unlabeled and labeled data come from different domains. The gain from
pre-training is additive to that of supervised data augmentation.

Title: Environment-aware Reconfigurable Noise Suppression
Authors: Jun Yang and Joshua Bingham
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD eess.SP
Comments: 5 pages, ICASSP 2020 publication
Journal-ref: ICASSP 2020, May 4-8, 2020, Barcelona, Spain
\\
  The paper proposes an efficient, robust, and reconfigurable technique to
suppress various types of noises for any sampling rate. The theoretical
analyses, subjective and objective test results show that the proposed noise
suppression (NS) solution significantly enhances the speech transmission index
(STI), speech intelligibility (SI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and subjective
listening experience. The STI and SI consists of 5 levels, i.e., bad, poor,
fair, good, and excellent. The most common noisy condition is of SNR ranging
from -5 to 8 dB. For the input SNR between -5 and 2.5 dB, the proposed NS
improves the STI and SI from "fair" to "good". For the input SNR between 2.5 to
8 dB, the STI and SI are improved from "good" to "excellent" by the proposed
NS. The proposed NS can be adopted in both capture and playback paths for voice
over internet protocol, voice-trigger, and automatic speech recognition
applications.
