TECHNICAL RESEARCH TRACK

This track provides a quality forum for researchers and practitioners from =
academia, industry, and government to present and discuss new results, nega=
tive results, and replications in program comprehension. Specifically:
New results because they advance our knowledge of program comprehension, wh=
ich then serves as a basis to improve the practice and to understand furthe=
r how developers=92 understand software artefacts, processes, and evolution=
. "The measure of greatness in a scientific idea is the extent to which it =
stimulates thought and opens up new lines of research.=94 wrote Paul Dirac =
(1968).
Negative results because they allow us to constantly evaluate the hypothese=
s space and understand the state of the practice. As Walter Tichy (2000) wr=
ites, =93Negative results, if trustworthy, are extremely important for narr=
owing down the search space. They eliminate useless hypotheses and thus reo=
rient and speed up the search for better approaches.=94
Replications because they solidify our knowledge, allow generalisations, an=
d application in different situations. =93If you=92re going to start a new =
project=85 the first thing you should do is get up to the cutting edge of t=
he field, and by far the best way to do that is to take the best article an=
d to replicate it.=94 recalls Gary King (2011).

Submissions must not be longer than 10 pages for the main text, inclusive o=
f figures, tables, appendices. References only may be included on up to 2 a=
dditional pages.

* Title and abstract submission deadline: January 20, 2020
* Paper submission deadline:  January 24, 2020
* Acceptance/rejection notification:  March 02, 2020
* Camera-ready version due: March 16, 2020

The best Technical Research Track papers at ICPC 2020 will be invited to be=
 revised and extended for consideration in Empirical Software Engineering (=
EMSE) journal.

INDUSTRY TRACK

The ICPC Industry Track is the premier venue for researchers and practition=
ers to discuss innovations and solutions to concrete software engineering p=
roblems. The objective of the Industry Track is to provide a unique forum f=
or a meaningful dialogue among software practitioners and software engineer=
ing researchers on the results, obstacles, and lessons learnt while applyin=
g program comprehension practices and tools in various environments.
We seek submissions on industrially relevant topics in technology, tools, a=
nd practices related to program comprehension, including both the human act=
ivity of comprehending software, as well as the processes, techniques and t=
ools for supporting it. We hope that the discussion-based format of the ind=
ustry track will contribute to stimulating synergies between industry and a=
cademia for addressing the most interesting and realistic program comprehen=
sion research directions.
Submissions can be in one of three forms:
Industrial full paper: 8 pages for the main text, inclusive of figures, tab=
les, and appendices plus 2 additional pages for references (for a total of =
maximum 10 pages).

Industrial short paper: 4 pages for the main text, inclusive of figures, ta=
bles, and appendices plus 1 additional page for references (for a total of =
maximum 5 pages).

Industrial talk: 2 pages abstract describing the problem definition, import=
ance, solutions, and results / lessons learnt.
* Paper submission deadline:  February 09, 2020
* Acceptance/rejection notification:  March 02, 2020
* Camera-ready version due: March 16, 2020

PROGRAMMING EDUCATION TRACK

The goal of this new ICPC track is to provide researchers and practitioners=
 with a unique forum to present their work in the field of programming educ=
ation in various institutions including universities, colleges, company tra=
ining centers, etc.
Submissions are welcome on a variety of topics, but the overall questions t=
hat the track attempts to address revolve around the role of program compre=
hension in programming education. Examples of questions include: What aspec=
ts of program comprehension have a direct impact on programming education? =
What works and what does not? What knowledge do programming education learn=
ers require? How are programming comprehension models different between nov=
ices and experts and how can this gap be bridged? What techniques, methodol=
ogies, and tools for educators and learners can be used to facilitate the l=
earning of programming languages? How we can improve programming education =
curricula and courses based on the many years of research in program compre=
hension?
Submissions can be in two forms:

Regular papers must not be longer than 10 pages for the main text, inclusiv=
e of figures, tables, appendices; references only may be included on up to =
2 additional pages.
Short papers must not be longer than 4 pages for the main text and 2 additi=
onal pages for references.

* Title and abstract submission deadline: February 07, 2020
* Paper submission deadline:  February  14, 2020
* Acceptance/rejection notification:  March 02, 2020
* Camera-ready version due: March 16, 2020

EARLY RESEARCH ACHIEVEMENTS TRACK

The goal of the Early Research Achievements (ERA) track is to provide resea=
rchers and practitioners with a forum for presenting great, promising ideas=
 in early stages of research. Ideally, the ICPC ERA track seeks papers chal=
lenging the status quo of program comprehension with new research direction=
s and provocative ideas. ERA track is the perfect place for a paper that ai=
ms at setting the agenda for a new line of research and a series of future =
papers!
In principle, the track addresses the same topics of interest as those of t=
he technical research paper track. ERA submissions are intended to describe=
 a single and well-defined idea at an early stage of investigation. As oppo=
sed to regular research papers, ERA papers are not intended to serve as a v=
ehicle for the dissemination of research results. Submissions to the ERA tr=
ack should describe research in progress. Authors of contributions to other=
 tracks are welcome to also submit a paper to the ERA track if a specific a=
spect of their research meets the goal of the track. Ideally, ERA authors w=
ill combine research topics in new ways, establish connections to other fie=
lds outside of classical program comprehension, as well as argue for the im=
portance of program comprehension research in areas not explicitly listed.
The submissions should clearly focus on the newly proposed ideas or the eme=
rging results, their impact on the field at large, and future research dire=
ctions. An ERA paper is not expected to have a solid and complete evaluatio=
n as in the main research track. Naturally, preliminary results that provid=
e initial support for the proposed ideas claimed are welcome.

ERA track submissions must not be longer than 4 pages for the main text, in=
clusive of figures, tables, and appendices where references may optionally =
continue on 1 additional page.

* Title and abstract submission deadline: February 07, 2020
* Paper submission deadline:  February  14, 2020
* Acceptance/rejection notification:  March 02, 2020
* Camera-ready version due: March 16, 2020

TOOL DEMO TRACK
We would like to invite you to submit a tool demonstration paper for the 20=
20 ICPC Tool Demo Track. This track provides a valuable opportunity for liv=
e presentations of prototypes and industry-strength tools.
Tool demonstration papers are expected to describe tools that implement a r=
esearch approach. The tools are expected to be either mature prototypes or =
fully developed products ready for commercialization. We also encourage too=
l demonstration proposals complementing full technical papers. While a tech=
nical paper is intended to give the background information and point out th=
e scientific contribution of a new program comprehension approach, the tool=
 demonstration submission provides a unique opportunity to show how the sci=
entific approach has been transferred into a working prototype. Potential a=
uthors of the research papers are highly encouraged to submit the correspon=
ding tools in this track. Any of the conference topics of interest are appr=
opriate areas for tool demonstrations.
Each submission will be reviewed by three members of the Tool Demo Program =
Committee. The committee will review each submission to assess the relevanc=
e and quality of the proposed tool demonstration. Submissions should descri=
be the tool (including snapshot and technical details), explain its relevan=
ce to program comprehension and the foundations upon which it is based, dis=
cuss its level of maturity and the (expected) adoption and impact.
The Tool Demo Track will provide a Best Tool Award to the accepted submissi=
on that presents the most impressive and promising tool.

Tool demonstration submissions must not be longer than 4 pages for the main=
 text, inclusive of figures, tables, appendices, and references. Optionally=
, they can include in the abstract the URL of a 3-to-5 minute video screenc=
ast, either with annotations or voice-over, that provides a concise version=
 of the tool demo scenario. The video should be posted on YouTube, or hoste=
d on the tool=92s website.

* Title and abstract submission deadline: February 03, 2020
* Paper submission deadline:  February  10, 2020
* Acceptance/rejection notification:  March 02, 2020
* Camera-ready version due: March 16, 2020

More information and submission link will be available at https://conf.rese=
archr.org/track/icpc-2020/icpc-2020-tool-demonstration
