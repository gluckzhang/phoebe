Title: Policy-Aware Model Learning for Policy Gradient Methods
Authors: Romina Abachi, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Amir-massoud Farahmand
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  This paper considers the problem of learning a model in model-based
reinforcement learning (MBRL). We examine how the planning module of an MBRL
algorithm uses the model, and propose that the model learning module should
incorporate the way the planner is going to use the model. This is in contrast
to conventional model learning approaches, such as those based on maximum
likelihood estimate, that learn a predictive model of the environment without
explicitly considering the interaction of the model and the planner. We focus
on policy gradient type of planning algorithms and derive new loss functions
for model learning that incorporate how the planner uses the model. We call
this approach Policy-Aware Model Learning (PAML). We theoretically analyze a
generic model-based policy gradient algorithm and provide a convergence
guarantee for the optimized policy. We also empirically evaluate PAML on some
benchmark problems, showing promising results.

Title: Scaling up Hybrid Probabilistic Inference with Logical and Arithmetic
  Constraints via Message Passing
Authors: Zhe Zeng, Paolo Morettin, Fanqi Yan, Antonio Vergari, Guy Van den
  Broeck
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Weighted model integration (WMI) is a very appealing framework for
probabilistic inference: it allows to express the complex dependencies of
real-world problems where variables are both continuous and discrete, via the
language of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), as well as to compute
probabilistic queries with complex logical and arithmetic constraints. Yet,
existing WMI solvers are not ready to scale to these problems. They either
ignore the intrinsic dependency structure of the problem at all, or they are
limited to too restrictive structures. To narrow this gap, we derive a
factorized formalism of WMI enabling us to devise a scalable WMI solver based
on message passing, MP-WMI. Namely, MP-WMI is the first WMI solver which allows
to: 1) perform exact inference on the full class of tree-structured WMI
problems; 2) compute all marginal densities in linear time; 3) amortize
inference inter query. Experimental results show that our solver dramatically
outperforms the existing WMI solvers on a large set of benchmarks.

Title: Entity Profiling in Knowledge Graphs
Authors: Xiang Zhang, Qingqing Yang, Jinru Ding and Ziyue Wang
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures

\\
  Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are graph-structured knowledge bases storing factual
information about real-world entities. Understanding the uniqueness of each
entity is crucial to the analyzing, sharing, and reusing of KGs. Traditional
profiling technologies encompass a vast array of methods to find distinctive
features in various applications, which can help to differentiate entities in
the process of human understanding of KGs. In this work, we present a novel
profiling approach to identify distinctive entity features. The distinctiveness
of features is carefully measured by a HAS model, which is a scalable
representation learning model to produce a multi-pattern entity embedding. We
fully evaluate the quality of entity profiles generated from real KGs. The
results show that our approach facilitates human understanding of entities in
KGs.

Title: What Emotions Make One or Five Stars? Understanding Ratings of Online
  Product Reviews by Sentiment Analysis and XAI
Authors: Chaehan So

  Part of HCI International 2020, Kopenhagen, Denmark, July 19-24, Springer
\\
  When people buy products online, they primarily base their decisions on the
recommendations of others given in online reviews. The current work analyzed
these online reviews by sentiment analysis and used the extracted sentiments as
features to predict the product ratings by several machine learning algorithms.
These predictions were disentangled by various meth-ods of explainable AI (XAI)
to understand whether the model showed any bias during prediction. Study 1
benchmarked these algorithms (knn, support vector machines, random forests,
gradient boosting machines, XGBoost) and identified random forests and XGBoost
as best algorithms for predicting the product ratings. In Study 2, the analysis
of global feature importance identified the sentiment joy and the emotional
valence negative as most predictive features. Two XAI visualization methods,
local feature attributions and partial dependency plots, revealed several
incorrect prediction mechanisms on the instance-level. Performing the
benchmarking as classification, Study 3 identified a high no-information rate
of 64.4% that indicated high class imbalance as underlying reason for the
identified problems. In conclusion, good performance by machine learning
algorithms must be taken with caution because the dataset, as encountered in
this work, could be biased towards certain predictions. This work demonstrates
how XAI methods reveal such prediction bias.

Title: A Finite State Transducer Based Morphological Analyzer of Maithili
  Language
Authors: Raza Rahi, Sumant Pushp, Arif Khan, Smriti Kumar Sinha
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Morphological analyzers are the essential milestones for many linguistic
applications like; machine translation, word sense disambiguation, spells
checkers, and search engines etc. Therefore, development of an effective
morphological analyzer has a greater impact on the computational recognition of
a language. In this paper, we present a finite state transducer based
inflectional morphological analyzer for a resource poor language of India,
known as Maithili. Maithili is an eastern Indo-Aryan language spoken in the
eastern and northern regions of Bihar in India and the southeastern plains,
known as tarai of Nepal. This work can be recognized as the first work towards
the computational development of Maithili which may attract researchers around
the country to up-rise the language to establish in computational world.

Title: On Safety Assessment of Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Jens Braband and Hendrik Sch\"abe
Categories: cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 16 pages, 7 figures
\\
  In this paper we discuss how systems with Artificial Intelligence (AI) can
undergo safety assessment. This is relevant, if AI is used in safety related
applications. Taking a deeper look into AI models, we show, that many models of
artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning, are statistical
models. Safety assessment would then have t o concentrate on the model that is
used in AI, besides the normal assessment procedure. Part of the budget of
dangerous random failures for the relevant safety integrity level needs to be
used for the probabilistic faulty behavior of the AI system. We demonstrate our
thoughts with a simple example and propose a research challenge that may be
decisive for the use of AI in safety related systems.

  Corvids, apes, and children solve The Crow and The Pitcher task (from Aesop's
Fables) indicating a causal understanding of the task. By cumulatively
interacting with different objects, how can cognitive agents abstract the
underlying cause-effect relations to predict affordances of novel objects? We
address this question by re-enacting the Aesop's Fable task on a robot and
present a) a brain-guided neural model of semantic-episodic memory; with b)
four task-agnostic learning rules that compare expectations from recalled past
episodes with the current scenario to progressively extract the hidden causal
relations. The ensuing robot behaviours illustrate causal learning; and
predictions for novel objects converge to Archimedes' principle, independent of
both the objects explored during learning and the order of their cumulative
exploration.

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Neural-symbolic computing has now become the subject of interest of both
academic and industry research laboratories. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have
been widely used in relational and symbolic domains, with widespread
application of GNNs in combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction,
relational reasoning and other scientific domains. The need for improved
explainability, interpretability and trust of AI systems in general demands
principled methodologies, as suggested by neural-symbolic computing. In this
paper, we review the state-of-the-art on the use of GNNs as a model of
neural-symbolic computing. This includes the application of GNNs in several
domains as well as its relationship to current developments in neural-symbolic
computing.

Title: An Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Autonomous Driving Data:
  Experience and Practice
Authors: Ruwan Wickramarachchi, Cory Henson, Amit Sheth

\\
  The autonomous driving (AD) industry is exploring the use of knowledge graphs
(KGs) to manage the vast amount of heterogeneous data generated from vehicular
sensors. The various types of equipped sensors include video, LIDAR and RADAR.
Scene understanding is an important topic in AD which requires consideration of
various aspects of a scene, such as detected objects, events, time and
location. Recent work on knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) - an approach that
facilitates neuro-symbolic fusion - has shown to improve the predictive
performance of machine learning models. With the expectation that
neuro-symbolic fusion through KGEs will improve scene understanding, this
research explores the generation and evaluation of KGEs for autonomous driving
data. We also present an investigation of the relationship between the level of
informational detail in a KG and the quality of its derivative embeddings. By
systematically evaluating KGEs along four dimensions -- i.e. quality metrics,
KG informational detail, algorithms, and datasets -- we show that (1) higher
levels of informational detail in KGs lead to higher quality embeddings, (2)
type and relation semantics are better captured by the semantic transitional
distance-based TransE algorithm, and (3) some metrics, such as coherence
measure, may not be suitable for intrinsically evaluating KGEs in this domain.
Additionally, we also present an (early) investigation of the usefulness of
KGEs for two use-cases in the AD domain.

Title: Data Pre-Processing and Evaluating the Performance of Several Data
  Mining Methods for Predicting Irrigation Water Requirement
Authors: Mahmood A. Khan, Md Zahidul Islam, Mohsin Hafeez
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: This 13-page paper is a slightly modified version of our original
  conference paper published in the 10th Australasian Data Mining Conference
  2012. We then submitted the paper to the Journal of Research and Practice in

\\
  Recent drought and population growth are planting unprecedented demand for
the use of available limited water resources. Irrigated agriculture is one of
the major consumers of freshwater. A large amount of water in irrigated
agriculture is wasted due to poor water management practices. To improve water
management in irrigated areas, models for estimation of future water
requirements are needed. Developing a model for forecasting irrigation water
demand can improve water management practices and maximise water productivity.
Data mining can be used effectively to build such models.
  In this study, we prepare a dataset containing information on suitable
attributes for forecasting irrigation water demand. The data is obtained from
three different sources namely meteorological data, remote sensing images and
water delivery statements. In order to make the prepared dataset useful for
demand forecasting and pattern extraction, we pre-process the dataset using a
novel approach based on a combination of irrigation and data mining knowledge.
We then apply and compare the effectiveness of different data mining methods
namely decision tree (DT), artificial neural networks (ANNs), systematically
developed forest (SysFor) for multiple trees, support vector machine (SVM),
logistic regression, and the traditional Evapotranspiration (ETc) methods and
evaluate the performance of these models to predict irrigation water demand.
Our experimental results indicate the usefulness of data pre-processing and the
effectiveness of different classifiers. Among the six methods we used, SysFor
produces the best prediction with 97.5% accuracy followed by a decision tree
with 96% and ANN with 95% respectively by closely matching the predictions with
actual water usage. Therefore, we recommend using SysFor and DT models for
irrigation water demand forecasting.

  Explainability and interpretability of AI models is an essential factor
affecting the safety of AI. While various explainable AI (XAI) approaches aim
at mitigating the lack of transparency in deep networks, the evidence of the
effectiveness of these approaches in improving usability, trust, and
understanding of AI systems are still missing. We evaluate multimodal
explanations in the setting of a Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, by
asking users to predict the response accuracy of a VQA agent with and without
explanations. We use between-subjects and within-subjects experiments to probe
explanation effectiveness in terms of improving user prediction accuracy,
confidence, and reliance, among other factors. The results indicate that the
explanations help improve human prediction accuracy, especially in trials when
the VQA system's answer is inaccurate. Furthermore, we introduce active
attention, a novel method for evaluating causal attentional effects through
intervention by editing attention maps. User explanation ratings are strongly
correlated with human prediction accuracy and suggest the efficacy of these
explanations in human-machine AI collaboration tasks.

Title: Differential Evolution with Individuals Redistribution for Real
  Parameter Single Objective Optimization
Authors: Chengjun Li and Yang Li
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Differential Evolution (DE) is quite powerful for real parameter single
objective optimization. However, the ability of extending or changing search
area when falling into a local optimum is still required to be developed in DE
for accommodating extremely complicated fitness landscapes with a huge number
of local optima. We propose a new flow of DE, termed DE with individuals
redistribution, in which a process of individuals redistribution will be called
when progress on fitness is low for generations. In such a process, mutation
and crossover are standardized, while trial vectors are all kept in selection.
Once diversity exceeds a predetermined threshold, our opposition replacement is
executed, then algorithm behavior returns to original mode. In our experiments
based on two benchmark test suites, we apply individuals redistribution in ten
DE algorithms. Versions of the ten DE algorithms based on individuals
redistribution are compared with not only original version but also version
based on complete restart, where individuals redistribution and complete
restart are based on the same entry criterion. Experimental results indicate
that, for most of the DE algorithms, version based on individuals
redistribution performs better than both original version and version based on
complete restart.

Title: Environment-agnostic Multitask Learning for Natural Language Grounded
  Navigation
Authors: Xin Wang, Vihan Jain, Eugene Ie, William Yang Wang, Zornitsa Kozareva,
  Sujith Ravi
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Recent research efforts enable study for natural language grounded navigation
in photo-realistic environments, e.g., following natural language instructions
or dialog. However, existing methods tend to overfit training data in seen
environments and fail to generalize well in previously unseen environments. In
order to close the gap between seen and unseen environments, we aim at learning
a generalized navigation model from two novel perspectives: (1) we introduce a
multitask navigation model that can be seamlessly trained on both
Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog History (NDH)
tasks, which benefits from richer natural language guidance and effectively
transfers knowledge across tasks; (2) we propose to learn environment-agnostic
representations for the navigation policy that are invariant among the
environments seen during training, thus generalizing better on unseen
environments. Extensive experiments show that our navigation model trained
using environment-agnostic multitask learning significantly reduces the
performance gap between seen and unseen environments and outperforms the
baselines on unseen environments by 16% (relative measure on success rate) on
VLN and 120% (goal progress) on NDH, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
the NDH task. The code for training the navigation model using
environment-agnostic multitask learning is available at

Title: GPM: A Generic Probabilistic Model to Recover Annotator's Behavior and
  Ground Truth Labeling
Authors: Jing Li, Suiyi Ling, Junle Wang, Zhi Li, Patrick Le Callet
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In the big data era, data labeling can be obtained through crowdsourcing.
Nevertheless, the obtained labels are generally noisy, unreliable or even
adversarial. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical annotation
model to infer the underlying ground truth and annotator's behavior. To
accommodate both discrete and continuous application scenarios (e.g.,
classifying scenes vs. rating videos on a Likert scale), the underlying ground
truth is considered following a distribution rather than a single value. In
this way, the reliable but potentially divergent opinions from "good"
annotators can be recovered. The proposed model is able to identify whether an
annotator has worked diligently towards the task during the labeling procedure,
which could be used for further selection of qualified annotators. Our model
has been tested on both simulated data and real-world data, where it always
shows superior performance than the other state-of-the-art models in terms of
accuracy and robustness.

Title: How Do We Move: Learning to Simulate with System Dynamics
Authors: Hua Wei, Zhenhui Li
Categories: cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 9 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Modeling how human moves on the space is useful for policy-making in
transportation, public safety, and public health. The human movements can be
viewed as a dynamic process that human transits between states (e.g.,
locations) over time. In the human world where both intelligent agents like
humans or vehicles with human drivers play an important role, the states of
agents mostly describe human activities, and the state transition is influenced
by both the human decisions and physical constraints from the real-world system
(e.g., agents need to spend time to move over a certain distance). Therefore,
the modeling of state transition should include the modeling of the agent's
decision process and the physical system dynamics. In this paper, we propose to
model state transition in human movement through learning decision model and
integrating system dynamics. In experiments on real-world datasets, we
demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance against
the state-of-the-art methods in predicting the next state and generating
long-term future states.

Title: Permutohedral-GCN: Graph Convolutional Networks with Global Attention
Authors: Hesham Mostafa, Marcel Nassar
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) update a node's feature vector by
aggregating features from its neighbors in the graph. This ignores potentially
useful contributions from distant nodes. Identifying such useful distant
contributions is challenging due to scalability issues (too many nodes can
potentially contribute) and oversmoothing (aggregating features from too many
nodes risks swamping out relevant information and may result in nodes having
different labels but indistinguishable features). We introduce a global
attention mechanism where a node can selectively attend to, and aggregate
features from, any other node in the graph. The attention coefficients depend
on the Euclidean distance between learnable node embeddings, and we show that
the resulting attention-based global aggregation scheme is analogous to
high-dimensional Gaussian filtering. This makes it possible to use efficient
approximate Gaussian filtering techniques to implement our attention-based
global aggregation scheme. By employing an approximate filtering method based
on the permutohedral lattice, the time complexity of our proposed global
aggregation scheme only grows linearly with the number of nodes. The resulting
GCNs, which we term permutohedral-GCNs, are differentiable and trained
end-to-end, and they achieve state of the art performance on several node
classification benchmarks.

Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Unbiased data collection is essential to guaranteeing fairness in artificial
intelligence models. Implicit bias, a form of behavioral conditioning that
leads us to attribute predetermined characteristics to members of certain
groups and informs the data collection process. This paper quantifies implicit
bias in viewer ratings of TEDTalks, a diverse social platform assessing social
and professional performance, in order to present the correlations of different
kinds of bias across sensitive attributes. Although the viewer ratings of these
videos should purely reflect the speaker's competence and skill, our analysis
of the ratings demonstrates the presence of overwhelming and predominant
implicit bias with respect to race and gender. In our paper, we present

Title: UFTR: A Unified Framework for Ticket Routing
Authors: Jianglei Han, Jing Li, Aixin Sun
Categories: cs.AI cs.SI
\\
  Corporations today face increasing demands for the timely and effective
delivery of customer service. This creates the need for a robust and accurate
automated solution to what is formally known as the ticket routing problem.
This task is to match each unresolved service incident, or "ticket", to the
right group of service experts. Existing studies divide the task into two
independent subproblems - initial group assignment and inter-group transfer.
However, our study addresses both subproblems jointly using an end-to-end
modeling approach. We first performed a preliminary analysis of half a million
archived tickets to uncover relevant features. Then, we devised the UFTR, a
Unified Framework for Ticket Routing using four types of features (derived from
tickets, groups, and their interactions). In our experiments, we implemented
two ranking models with the UFTR. Our models outperform baselines on three
routing metrics. Furthermore, a post-hoc analysis reveals that this superior
performance can largely be attributed to the features that capture the
associations between ticket assignment and group assignment. In short, our
results demonstrate that the UFTR is a superior solution to the ticket routing
problem because it takes into account previously unexploited interrelationships
between the group assignment and group transfer problems.

\\
  Knowledge Graphs are an emerging form of knowledge representation. While
Google coined the term Knowledge Graph first and promoted it as a means to
improve their search results, they are used in many applications today. In a
knowledge graph, entities in the real world and/or a business domain (e.g.,
people, places, or events) are represented as nodes, which are connected by
edges representing the relations between those entities. While companies such
as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have their own, non-public knowledge graphs,
there is also a larger body of publicly available knowledge graphs, such as
DBpedia or Wikidata. In this chapter, we provide an overview and comparison of
those publicly available knowledge graphs, and give insights into their
contents, size, coverage, and overlap.

Title: A general framework for scientifically inspired explanations in AI
Authors: David Tuckey, Alessandra Russo, Krysia Broda
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Explainability in AI is gaining attention in the computer science community
in response to the increasing success of deep learning and the important need
of justifying how such systems make predictions in life-critical applications.
The focus of explainability in AI has predominantly been on trying to gain
insights into how machine learning systems function by exploring relationships
between input data and predicted outcomes or by extracting simpler
interpretable models. Through literature surveys of philosophy and social
science, authors have highlighted the sharp difference between these generated
explanations and human-made explanations and claimed that current explanations
in AI do not take into account the complexity of human interaction to allow for
effective information passing to not-expert users. In this paper we instantiate
the concept of structure of scientific explanation as the theoretical
underpinning for a general framework in which explanations for AI systems can
be implemented. This framework aims to provide the tools to build a
"mental-model" of any AI system so that the interaction with the user can
provide information on demand and be closer to the nature of human-made
explanations. We illustrate how we can utilize this framework through two very
different examples: an artificial neural network and a Prolog solver and we
provide a possible implementation for both examples.

  Given the large variety of existing logical formalisms it is of utmost
importance to select the most adequate one for a specific purpose, e.g. for
representing the knowledge relevant for a particular application or for using
the formalism as a modeling tool for problem solving. Awareness of the nature
of a logical formalism, in other words, of its fundamental intrinsic

Title: Causal Transfer for Imitation Learning and Decision Making under
  Sensor-shift
Authors: Jalal Etesami and Philipp Geiger
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: It appears in AAAI-2020
\\
  Learning from demonstrations (LfD) is an efficient paradigm to train AI
agents. But major issues arise when there are differences between (a) the
demonstrator's own sensory input, (b) our sensors that observe the demonstrator
and (c) the sensory input of the agent we train. In this paper, we propose a
causal model-based framework for transfer learning under such "sensor-shifts",
for two common LfD tasks: (1) inferring the effect of the demonstrator's
actions and (2) imitation learning. First we rigorously analyze, on the
population-level, to what extent the relevant underlying mechanisms (the action
effects and the demonstrator policy) can be identified and transferred from the
available observations together with prior knowledge of sensor characteristics.
And we device an algorithm to infer these mechanisms. Then we introduce several
proxy methods which are easier to calculate, estimate from finite data and
interpret than the exact solutions, alongside theoretical bounds on their
closeness to the exact ones. We validate our two main methods on simulated and
semi-real world data.

Authors: Hao Wang, Bin Guo, Wei Wu, Zhiwen Yu
Categories: cs.AI cs.HC
Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Text generation system has made massive promising progress contributed by
deep learning techniques and has been widely applied in our life. However,
existing end-to-end neural models suffer from the problem of tending to
generate uninformative and generic text because they cannot ground input
context with background knowledge. In order to solve this problem, many
researchers begin to consider combining external knowledge in text generation
systems, namely knowledge-enhanced text generation. The challenges of knowledge
enhanced text generation including how to select the appropriate knowledge from
large-scale knowledge bases, how to read and understand extracted knowledge,
and how to integrate knowledge into generation process. This survey gives a
comprehensive review of knowledge-enhanced text generation systems, summarizes
research progress to solving these challenges and proposes some open issues and
research directions.

Title: RiskOracle: A Minute-level Citywide Traffic Accident Forecasting
  Framework
Authors: Zhengyang Zhou, Yang Wang, Xike Xie, Lianliang Chen, Hengchang Liu
Categories: cs.AI eess.SP
Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures. Conference paper accepted by AAAI 2020
\\
  Real-time traffic accident forecasting is increasingly important for public
safety and urban management (e.g., real-time safe route planning and emergency
response deployment). Previous works on accident forecasting are often
performed on hour levels, utilizing existed neural networks with static
region-wise correlations taken into account. However, it is still challenging
when the granularity of forecasting step improves as the highly dynamic nature
of road network and inherent rareness of accident records in one training
sample, which leads to biased results and zero-inflated issue. In this work, we
propose a novel framework RiskOracle, to improve the prediction granularity to
minute levels. Specifically, we first transform the zero-risk values in labels
to fit the training network. Then, we propose the Differential Time-varying
Graph neural network (DTGN) to capture the immediate changes of traffic status
and dynamic inter-subregion correlations. Furthermore, we adopt multi-task and
region selection schemes to highlight citywide most-likely accident subregions,
bridging the gap between biased risk values and sporadic accident distribution.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and scalability of our RiskOracle framework.

Title: Learning and Solving Regular Decision Processes
Authors: Eden Abadi, Ronen I. Brafman
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Regular Decision Processes (RDPs) are a recently introduced model that
extends MDPs with non-Markovian dynamics and rewards. The non-Markovian
behavior is restricted to depend on regular properties of the history. These
can be specified using regular expressions or formulas in linear dynamic logic
over finite traces. Fully specified RDPs can be solved by compiling them into
an appropriate MDP. Learning RDPs from data is a challenging problem that has
yet to be addressed, on which we focus in this paper. Our approach rests on a
new representation for RDPs using Mealy Machines that emit a distribution and
an expected reward for each state-action pair. Building on this representation,
we combine automata learning techniques with history clustering to learn such a
Mealy machine and solve it by adapting MCTS to it. We empirically evaluate this
approach, demonstrating its feasibility.

Title: V2I Connectivity-Based Dynamic Queue-Jumper Lane for Emergency Vehicles:
  An Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach
Authors: Haoran Su, Joseph Y.J. Chow, Li Jin
Categories: cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 14 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Emergency vehicle (EV) service is a key function of cities and is exceedingly
challenging due to urban traffic congestion. A key contributor to EV service
delay is the lack of communication and cooperation between vehicles blocking
EVs. In this paper, we study the improvement of EV service using
vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity. We consider the establishment of dynamic queue
jumper lanes (DQJLs) based on real-time coordination of connected vehicles. We
develop a novel stochastic dynamic programming formulation for the DQJL
problem, which explicitly account for the uncertainty of drivers' reaction to
approaching EVs. We propose a deep neural network-based approximate dynamic
programming (ADP) algorithm that efficiently computes the optimal coordination
instructions. We also validate our approach on a micro-simulation testbed using
Simulation On Urban Mobility (SUMO).

Title: Hardness of Sparse Sets and Minimal Circuit Size Problem
Authors: Bin Fu
Categories: cs.CC
\\
  We develop a polynomial method on finite fields to amplify the hardness of
spare sets in nondeterministic time complexity classes on a randomized
streaming model. One of our results shows that if there exists a
$2^{n^{o(1)}}$-sparse set in $NTIME(2^{n^{o(1)}})$ that does not have any
randomized streaming algorithm with $n^{o(1)}$ updating time, and $n^{o(1)}$
space, then $NEXP\not=BPP$, where a $f(n)$-sparse set is a language that has at
most $f(n)$ strings of length $n$.
  The class $Tally(d(n), g(n))$ defines the class of all those tally sets
$T\subseteq \{1\}^*$ such that $d(n)$ gives an upper bound for the number of
elements of in $T^{\le n}$, and $g(n)$ gives the gap between a string $1^n\in
T$ and the next string $1^m$ in $T$ with $n<m$ and $g(n)<m$ (there is no string
$1^k\in T$ with $n<k<m$). We identify a class of function pairs $d(n)$ and
$g(n)$ (for example, $d(n)=\log \log n$ and $g(n)=2^{2^{2n}}$) such that if
MCSP~is $ZPP\cap Tally(d(n), g(n))$-hard under polynomial time truth-table
reductions, then $EXP\not=ZPP$. This indicates that proving $MCSP$ to be
$ZPP$-hard under polynomial time truth-table reductions implies separating
$EXP$ from $ZPP$.

Title: Imposing minimum and maximum member size, minimum cavity size, and
  minimum separation distance between solid members in topology optimization
Authors: Eduardo Fern\'andez, Kai-ke Yang, Stijn Koppen, Pablo Alarc\'on, Simon
  Bauduin, Pierre Duysinx
Categories: cs.CE
\\
  This paper focuses on density-based topology optimization and proposes a
combined method to simultaneously impose Minimum length scale in the Solid
phase (MinSolid), Minimum length scale in the Void phase (MinVoid) and Maximum
length scale in the Solid phase (MaxSolid). MinSolid and MinVoid mean that the
size of solid parts and cavities must be greater than the size of a prescribed
circle or sphere. This is ensured through the robust design approach based on
eroded, intermediate and dilated designs. MaxSolid seeks to restrict the
formation of solid parts larger than a prescribed size, which is imposed
through local volume restrictions. In the first part of this article, we show
that by proportionally restricting the maximum size of the eroded, intermediate
and dilated designs, it is possible to obtain optimized designs satisfying,
simultaneously, MinSolid, MinVoid and MaxSolid. However, in spite of obtaining
designs with crisp boundaries, some results can be difficult to manufacture due
to the presence of multiple rounded cavities, which are introduced by the
maximum size restriction with the sole purpose of avoiding thick solid members
in the structure. To address this issue, in the second part of this article we
propose a new geometric constraint that seeks to control the minimum separation
distance between two solid members, also called the Minimum Gap (MinGap).
Differently from MinVoid, MinGap introduces large void areas that do not
necessarily have to be round. 2D and 3D test cases show that simultaneous
control of MinSolid, MinVoid, MaxSolid and MinGap can be useful to improve the
manufacturability of maximum size constrained designs.

Title: Data Normalization for Bilinear Structures in High-Frequency Financial
  Time-series
Authors: Dat Thanh Tran, Juho Kanniainen, Moncef Gabbouj, Alexandros Iosifidis
Categories: cs.CE q-fin.ST
Comments: 5 pages, 2 tables
\\
  Financial time-series analysis and forecasting have been extensively studied
over the past decades, yet still remain as a very challenging research topic.
Since financial market is inherently noisy and stochastic, a majority of
financial time-series of interests are non-stationary, and often obtained from
different modalities. This property presents great challenges and can
significantly affect the performance of the subsequent analysis/forecasting
steps. Recently, the Temporal Attention augmented Bilinear Layer (TABL) has
shown great performances in tackling financial forecasting problems. In this
paper, by taking into account the nature of bilinear projections in TABL
networks, we propose Bilinear Normalization (BiN), a simple, yet efficient
normalization layer to be incorporated into TABL networks to tackle potential
problems posed by non-stationarity and multimodalities in the input series. Our
experiments using a large scale Limit Order Book (LOB) consisting of more than
4 millions order events show that BiN-TABL outperforms TABL networks using
other state-of-the-arts normalization schemes by a large margin.

Title: Dynamic geometric set cover and hitting set
Authors: Pankaj K. Agarwal, Hsien-Chih Chang, Subhash Suri, Allen Xiao, Jie Xue
Categories: cs.CG
Comments: A preliminary version will appear in SoCG'20
\\
  We investigate dynamic versions of geometric set cover and hitting set where
points and ranges may be inserted or deleted, and we want to efficiently
maintain an (approximately) optimal solution for the current problem instance.
While their static versions have been extensively studied in the past,
surprisingly little is known about dynamic geometric set cover and hitting set.
For instance, even for the most basic case of one-dimensional interval set
cover and hitting set, no nontrivial results were known. The main contribution
of our paper are two frameworks that lead to efficient data structures for
dynamically maintaining set covers and hitting sets in $\mathbb{R}^1$ and
$\mathbb{R}^2$. The first framework uses bootstrapping and gives a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate data structure for dynamic interval set cover in
$\mathbb{R}^1$ with $O(n^\alpha/\varepsilon)$ amortized update time for any
constant $\alpha > 0$; in $\mathbb{R}^2$, this method gives $O(1)$-approximate
data structures for unit-square (and quadrant) set cover and hitting set with
$O(n^{1/2+\alpha})$ amortized update time. The second framework uses local
modification, and leads to a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate data structure for
dynamic interval hitting set in $\mathbb{R}^1$ with
$\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ amortized update time; in $\mathbb{R}^2$, it
gives $O(1)$-approximate data structures for unit-square (and quadrant) set
cover and hitting set in the \textit{partially} dynamic settings with
$\widetilde{O}(1)$ amortized update time.

Title: The Maximum-Level Vertex in an Arrangement of Lines
Authors: Dan Halperin, Sariel Har-Peled, Kurt Mehlhorn, Eunjin Oh, Micha Sharir
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  Let $L$ be a set of $n$ lines in the plane, not necessarily in general
position. We present an efficient algorithm for finding all the vertices of the
arrangement $A(L)$ of maximum level, where the level of a vertex $v$ is the
number of lines of $L$ that pass strictly below $v$. The problem, posed in
Exercise~8.13 in de Berg etal [BCKO08], appears to be much harder than it
seems, as this vertex might not be on the upper envelope of the lines.
  We first assume that all the lines of $L$ are distinct, and distinguish
between two cases, depending on whether or not the upper envelope of $L$
contains a bounded edge. In the former case, we show that the number of lines
of $L$ that pass above any maximum level vertex $v_0$ is only $O(\log n)$. In
the latter case, we establish a similar property that holds after we remove
some of the lines that are incident to the single vertex of the upper envelope.
We present algorithms that run, in both cases, in optimal $O(n\log n)$ time.
  We then consider the case where the lines of $L$ are not necessarily
distinct. This setup is more challenging, and the best we have is an algorithm
that computes all the maximum-level vertices in time $O(n^{4/3}\log^{3}n)$.
  Finally, we consider a related combinatorial question for degenerate
arrangements, where many lines may intersect in a single point, but all the
lines are distinct: We bound the complexity of the weighted $k$-level in such
an arrangement, where the weight of a vertex is the number of lines that pass
through the vertex. We show that the bound in this case is $O(n^{4/3})$, which
matches the corresponding bound for non-degenerate arrangements, and we use
this bound in the analysis of one of our algorithms.

Title: On the Area Requirements of Planar Greedy Drawings of Triconnected
  Planar Graphs
Authors: Giordano Da Lozzo, Anthony D'Angelo, and Fabrizio Frati
Categories: cs.CG cs.DM cs.DS math.CO
\\
  In this paper we study the area requirements of planar greedy drawings of
triconnected planar graphs. Cao, Strelzoff, and Sun exhibited a family $\cal H$
of subdivisions of triconnected plane graphs and claimed that every planar
greedy drawing of the graphs in $\mathcal H$ respecting the prescribed plane
embedding requires exponential area. However, we show that every $n$-vertex
graph in $\cal H$ actually has a planar greedy drawing respecting the
prescribed plane embedding on an $O(n)\times O(n)$ grid. This reopens the
question whether triconnected planar graphs admit planar greedy drawings on a
polynomial-size grid. Further, we provide evidence for a positive answer to the
above question by proving that every $n$-vertex Halin graph admits a planar
greedy drawing on an $O(n)\times O(n)$ grid. Both such results are obtained by
actually constructing drawings that are convex and angle-monotone. Finally, we
show that there exist planar triangulations for which every $\alpha$-Schnyder
drawing with a fixed $\alpha<60^\circ$ requires exponential area for any
resolution rule.

\\
  The Arabic language is a morphologically rich and complex language with
relatively little resources and a less explored syntax compared to English.
Given these limitations, tasks like Sentiment Analysis (SA), Named Entity
Recognition (NER), and Question Answering (QA), have proven to be very
challenging to tackle. Recently, with the surge of transformers based models,
language-specific BERT based models proved to have a very efficient
understanding of languages, provided they are pre-trained on a very large
corpus. Such models were able to set new standards and achieve state-of-the-art
results for most NLP tasks. In this paper, we pre-trained BERT specifically for
the Arabic language in the pursuit of achieving the same success that BERT did
for the English language. We then compare the performance of AraBERT with
multilingual BERT provided by Google and other state-of-the-art approaches. The
results of the conducted experiments show that the newly developed AraBERT
achieved state-of-the-art results on most tested tasks. The pretrained araBERT
models are publicly available on hoping to encourage research and applications
for Arabic NLP.

Title: Depth-Adaptive Graph Recurrent Network for Text Classification
Authors: Yijin Liu, Fandong Meng, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu and Jie Zhou
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Code at: https://github.com/Adaxry/Depth-Adaptive-GRN
\\
  The Sentence-State LSTM (S-LSTM) is a powerful and high efficient graph
recurrent network, which views words as nodes and performs layer-wise recurrent
steps between them simultaneously. Despite its successes on text
representations, the S-LSTM still suffers from two drawbacks. Firstly, given a
sentence, certain words are usually more ambiguous than others, and thus more
computation steps need to be taken for these difficult words and vice versa.
However, the S-LSTM takes fixed computation steps for all words, irrespective
of their hardness. The secondary one comes from the lack of sequential
information (e.g., word order) that is inherently important for natural
language. In this paper, we try to address these issues and propose a
depth-adaptive mechanism for the S-LSTM, which allows the model to learn how
many computational steps to conduct for different words as required. In
addition, we integrate an extra RNN layer to inject sequential information,
which also serves as an input feature for the decision of adaptive depths.
Results on the classic text classification task (24 datasets in various sizes
and domains) show that our model brings significant improvements against the
conventional S-LSTM and other high-performance models (e.g., the Transformer),
meanwhile achieving a good accuracy-speed trade off.

  We propose a method to reduce false voice triggers of a speech-enabled
personal assistant by post-processing the hypothesis lattice of a server-side
large-vocabulary continuous speech recognizer (LVCSR) via a neural network. We
first discuss how an estimate of the posterior probability of the trigger
phrase can be obtained from the hypothesis lattice using known techniques to
perform detection, then investigate a statistical model that processes the
lattice in a more explicitly data-driven, discriminative manner. We propose
using a Bidirectional Lattice Recurrent Neural Network (LatticeRNN) for the
task, and show that it can significantly improve detection accuracy over using
the 1-best result or the posterior.

Title: Clinical Text Summarization with Syntax-Based Negation and Semantic
  Concept Identification
Authors: Wei-Hung Weng, Yu-An Chung, Schrasing Tong
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  In the era of clinical information explosion, a good strategy for clinical
text summarization is helpful to improve the clinical workflow. The ideal
summarization strategy can preserve important information in the informative
but less organized, ill-structured clinical narrative texts. Instead of using
pure statistical learning approaches, which are difficult to interpret and
explain, we utilized knowledge of computational linguistics with human
experts-curated biomedical knowledge base to achieve the interpretable and
meaningful clinical text summarization. Our research objective is to use the
biomedical ontology with semantic information, and take the advantage from the
language hierarchical structure, the constituency tree, in order to identify
the correct clinical concepts and the corresponding negation information, which
is critical for summarizing clinical concepts from narrative text. We achieved
the clinically acceptable performance for both negation detection and concept
identification, and the clinical concepts with common negated patterns can be
identified and negated by the proposed method.

Title: StructSum: Incorporating Latent and Explicit Sentence Dependencies for
  Single Document Summarization
Authors: Vidhisha Balachandran, Artidoro Pagnoni, Jay Yoon Lee, Dheeraj

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Traditional preneural approaches to single document summarization relied on
modeling the intermediate structure of a document before generating the
summary. In contrast, the current state of the art neural summarization models
do not preserve any intermediate structure, resorting to encoding the document
as a sequence of tokens. The goal of this work is two-fold: to improve the
quality of generated summaries and to learn interpretable document
representations for summarization. To this end, we propose incorporating latent
and explicit sentence dependencies into single-document summarization models.
We use structure-aware encoders to induce latent sentence relations, and inject
explicit coreferring mention graph across sentences to incorporate explicit
structure. On the CNN/DM dataset, our model outperforms standard baselines and
provides intermediate latent structures for analysis. We present an extensive
analysis of our summaries and show that modeling document structure reduces
copying long sequences and incorporates richer content from the source document
while maintaining comparable summary lengths and an increased degree of
abstraction.

Title: Learning from Easy to Complex: Adaptive Multi-curricula Learning for
  Neural Dialogue Generation
Authors: Hengyi Cai, Hongshen Chen, Cheng Zhang, Yonghao Song, Xiaofang Zhao,

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  Current state-of-the-art neural dialogue systems are mainly data-driven and
are trained on human-generated responses. However, due to the subjectivity and
open-ended nature of human conversations, the complexity of training dialogues
varies greatly. The noise and uneven complexity of query-response pairs impede
the learning efficiency and effects of the neural dialogue generation models.
What is more, so far, there are no unified dialogue complexity measurements,
and the dialogue complexity embodies multiple aspects of
attributes---specificity, repetitiveness, relevance, etc. Inspired by human
behaviors of learning to converse, where children learn from easy dialogues to
complex ones and dynamically adjust their learning progress, in this paper, we
first analyze five dialogue attributes to measure the dialogue complexity in
multiple perspectives on three publicly available corpora. Then, we propose an
adaptive multi-curricula learning framework to schedule a committee of the
organized curricula. The framework is established upon the reinforcement
learning paradigm, which automatically chooses different curricula at the
evolving learning process according to the learning status of the neural
dialogue generation model. Extensive experiments conducted on five
state-of-the-art models demonstrate its learning efficiency and effectiveness
with respect to 13 automatic evaluation metrics and human judgments.

Title: Style Example-Guided Text Generation using Generative Adversarial
  Transformers
Authors: Kuo-Hao Zeng and Mohammad Shoeybi and Ming-Yu Liu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  We introduce a language generative model framework for generating a styled
paragraph based on a context sentence and a style reference example. The
framework consists of a style encoder and a texts decoder. The style encoder
extracts a style code from the reference example, and the text decoder
generates texts based on the style code and the context. We propose a novel
objective function to train our framework. We also investigate different
network design choices. We conduct extensive experimental validation with
comparison to strong baselines to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework using a newly collected dataset with diverse text styles. Both code
and dataset will be released upon publication.

  Learning to navigate in a visual environment following natural language
instructions is a challenging task because natural language instructions are
highly variable, ambiguous, and under-specified. In this paper, we present a
novel training paradigm, Learn from EveryOne (LEO), which leverages multiple
instructions (as different views) for the same trajectory to resolve language
ambiguity and improve generalization. By sharing parameters across
instructions, our approach learns more effectively from limited training data
and generalizes better in unseen environments. On the recent Room-to-Room (R2R)
benchmark dataset, LEO achieves 16% improvement (absolute) over a greedy agent
as the base agent (25.3% $\rightarrow$ 41.4%) in Success Rate weighted by Path
Length (SPL). Further, LEO is complementary to most existing models for
vision-and-language navigation, allowing for easy integration with the existing
techniques, leading to LEO+, which creates the new state of the art, pushing
the R2R benchmark to 62% (9% absolute improvement).

Comments: To be published in LREC 2020
\\
  Disfluent speech has been previously addressed from two main perspectives:
the clinical perspective focusing on diagnostic, and the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) perspective aiming at modeling these events and detect them
for downstream tasks. In addition, previous works often used different metrics
depending on whether the input features are text or speech, making it difficult
to compare the different contributions. Here, we introduce a new evaluation
framework for disfluency detection inspired by the clinical and NLP perspective
together with the theory of performance from \cite{clark1996using} which
distinguishes between primary and collateral tracks. We introduce a novel
forced-aligned disfluency dataset from a corpus of semi-directed interviews,
and present baseline results directly comparing the performance of text-based
features (word and span information) and speech-based (acoustic-prosodic
information). Finally, we introduce new audio features inspired by the
word-based span features. We show experimentally that using these features
outperformed the baselines for speech-based predictions on the present dataset.

Title: Gated Mechanism for Attention Based Multimodal Sentiment Analysis
Authors: Ayush Kumar, Jithendra Vepa
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted to appear in ICASSP 2020
\\
  Multimodal sentiment analysis has recently gained popularity because of its
relevance to social media posts, customer service calls and video blogs. In
this paper, we address three aspects of multimodal sentiment analysis; 1. Cross
modal interaction learning, i.e. how multiple modalities contribute to the
sentiment, 2. Learning long-term dependencies in multimodal interactions and 3.
Fusion of unimodal and cross modal cues. Out of these three, we find that
learning cross modal interactions is beneficial for this problem. We perform
experiments on two benchmark datasets, CMU Multimodal Opinion level Sentiment
Intensity (CMU-MOSI) and CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity
(CMU-MOSEI) corpus. Our approach on both these tasks yields accuracies of 83.9%
and 81.1% respectively, which is 1.6% and 1.34% absolute improvement over
current state-of-the-art.

Title: Toward Active and Passive Confidentiality Attacks On Cryptocurrency
  Off-Chain Networks
Authors: Utz Nisslmueller, Klaus-Tycho Foerster, Stefan Schmid, Christian
  Decker
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Cryptocurrency off-chain networks such as Lightning (e.g., Bitcoin) or Raiden
(e.g., Ethereum) aim to increase the scalability of traditional on-chain
transactions. To support nodes in learning about possible paths to route their
transactions, these networks need to provide gossip and probing mechanisms.
This paper explores whether these mechanisms may be exploited to infer
sensitive information about the flow of transactions, and eventually harm
privacy. In particular, we identify two threats, related to an active and a
passive adversary. The first is a probing attack: here the adversary aims to
detect the maximum amount which is transferable in a given direction over a
target channel by actively probing it and differentiating the response messages
it receives. The second is a timing attack: the adversary discovers how close
the destination of a routed payment actually is, by acting as a passive
man-in-the middle and analyzing the time deltas between sent messages and their
corresponding responses. We then analyze the limitations of these attacks and
propose remediations for scenarios in which they are able to produce accurate
results.

Categories: cs.CR cs.CY cs.NI
\\
  Blockchain technology has drawn attention fromvarious communities. The
underlying consensus mechanism inBlockchain enables a myriad of applications
for the integrityassurance of stored data. In this paper, we utilize
Blockchaintechnology to verify the authenticity of a video captured by
astreaming IoT device for forensic investigation purposes. Theproposed approach
computes the hash of video frames beforethey leave the IoT device and are
transferred to a remote basestation. To guarantee the transmission, we ensure
that this hashis sent through a TCP-based connection. The hash is then storedon
multiple nodes on a permissioned blockchain platform. Incase the video is
modified, the discrepancy will be detected byinvestigating the previously
stored hash on the blockchain andcomparing it with the hash of the existing
frame in question.In this work, we present the prototype as proof-of-concept
withexperiment results. The system has been tested on a RaspberryPi with
different quality of videos to evaluate performance. Theresults show that the
concept can be implemented with moderatevideo resolutions.

Title: DangKiller: Eliminating Dangling Pointers Efficiently via Implicit
  Identifier
Authors: Daliang Xu and Dongwei Chen and Chun Yang and KangSun and Xu Cheng and
  Dong Tong
Categories: cs.CR cs.PL
\\
  Use-After-Free vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to access unintended
memory via dangling pointers, are more threatening. However, most detection
schemes can only detect dangling pointers and invalid them, but not provide a
tolerance mechanism to repair the errors at runtime. Also, these techniques
obtain and manage the metadata inefficiently with complex structures and too
much scan (sweep). The goal of this paper is to use compiler instrumentation to
eliminate dangling pointers automatically and efficiently. In this paper, we
observe that most techniques lack accurate efficient pointer graph metadata
maintaining methods, so they need to scan the log to reduce the redundancy and
sweep the whole address space to find dangling pointers. Also, they lack a
direct, efficiently obtaining metadata approach. The key insight of this paper
is that a unique identifier can be used as a key to a hash or direct-map
algorithm. Thus, this paper maintains the same implicit identifier with each
memory object and its corresponding referent. Associating the unique ID with
metadata for memory objects, obtaining and managing the pointer graph metadata
can be efficiently. Therefore, with the delayed free technique adopted into
C/C++, we present the DangKiller as a novel and lightweight dangling pointer
elimination solution. We first demonstrate the MinFat Pointer, which can
calculate unique implicit ID for each object and pointer quickly, and use hash
algorithm to obtain metadata. Secondly, we propose the Log Cache and Log
Compression mechanism based on the ID to decrease the redundancy of dangling
pointer candidates. Coupled with the Address Tagging architecture on an ARM64
system, our experiments show that the DangKiller can eliminate use-after-free
vulnerabilities at only 11% and 3% runtime overheads for the SPEC CPU2006 and
2017 benchmarks respectively, except for unique cases.

Title: Improving Sustainability of Cryptocurrency Payment Networks for IoT
  Applications
Authors: Suat Mercan, Enes Erdin, and Kemal Akkaya
Categories: cs.CR cs.DC cs.NI
\\
  Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies received a lot of attention recently for
their applications in many domains. IoT domain is one of such applications,
which can utilize cryptocur-rencies for micro payments without compromising
their payment privacy. However, long confirmation times of transactions and
relatively high fees hinder the adoption of cryptoccurency based
micro-payments. The payment channel networks is one of the proposed solutions
to address these issue where nodes establish payment channels among themselves
without writing on blockchain. IoT devices can benefit from such payment
networks as long as they are capable of sustaining their overhead. Payment
channel networks pose unique characteristics as far as the routing problem is
concerned. Specifically, they should stay balanced to have a sustainable
network for maintaining payments for longer times, which is crucial for IoT
devices once they are deployed.In this paper, we present a payment channel
network design that aims to keep the channels balanced by using a common weight
policy across the network. We additionally propose using multi-point
connections to nodes for each IoT device for unbalanced payment scenarios. The
experiment results show that we can keep the channels in the network more
equally balanced compared to the minimal fee approach. In addition, multiple
connections from IoT devices to nodes increase the success ratio significantly.

Title: Renegotiation and recursion in Bitcoin contracts
Authors: Massimo Bartoletti and Maurizio Murgia and Roberto Zunino
Categories: cs.CR cs.PL
\\
  BitML is a process calculus to express smart contracts that can be run on
Bitcoin. One of its current limitations is that, once a contract has been
stipulated, the participants cannot renegotiate its terms: this prevents
expressing common financial contracts, where funds have to be added by
participants at run-time. In this paper, we extend BitML with a new primitive
for contract renegotiation. At the same time, the new primitive can be used to
write recursive contracts, which was not possible in the original BitML. We
show that, despite the increased expressiveness, it is still possible to
execute BitML on standard Bitcoin, preserving the security guarantees of BitML.

  Fog computing is an emerging computing paradigm that has come into
consideration for the deployment of IoT applications amongst researchers and
technology industries over the last few years. Fog is highly distributed and
consists of a wide number of autonomous end devices, which contribute to the
processing. However, the variety of devices offered across different users are
not audited. Hence, the security of Fog devices is a major concern in the Fog
computing environment. Furthermore, mitigating and preventing those security
measures is a research issue. Therefore, to provide the necessary security for
Fog devices, we need to understand what the security concerns are with regards
to Fog. All aspects of Fog security, which have not been covered by other
literature works needs to be identified and need to be aggregate all issues in
Fog security. It needs to be noted that computation devices consist of many
ordinary users, and are not managed by any central entity or managing body.
Therefore, trust and privacy is also a key challenge to gain market adoption
for Fog. To provide the required trust and privacy, we need to also focus on
authentication, threats and access control mechanisms as well as techniques in
Fog computing. In this paper, we perform a survey and propose a taxonomy, which
presents an overview of existing security concerns in the context of the Fog
computing paradigm. We discuss the Blockchain-based solutions towards a secure
Fog computing environment and presented various research challenges and
directions for future research.

  Network intrusion detection systems and antivirus software are essential in
detecting malicious network traffic and attacks such as denial-of-service and
malwares. Each attack, worm or virus has its own distinctive signature.
Signature-based intrusion detection and antivirus systems depend on pattern
matching to look for possible attack signatures. Pattern matching is a very
complex task, which requires a lot of time, memory and computing resources.
Software-based intrusion detection is not fast enough to match high network
speeds and the increasing number of attacks. In this paper, we propose special
purpose hardware for Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. FPGAs form an
excellent choice because of their massively parallel structure, reprogrammable
logic and memory resources. The hardware is designed in Verilog and implemented
using Xilinx ISE. For evaluation, we dope network traffic traces collected
using Wireshark with 2500 signatures from the ClamAV virus definitions
database. Experimental results show high speed that reaches up to 216 Mbps. In
addition, we evaluate time, device usage, and power consumption.

  Intrusion detection system (IDS) plays an essential role in computer networks
protecting computing resources and data from outside attacks. Recent IDS faces
challenges improving flexibility and efficiency of the IDS for unexpected and
unpredictable attacks. Deep neural network (DNN) is considered popularly for
complex systems to abstract features and learn as a machine learning technique.
In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for developing the efficient
and flexible IDS using one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN).
Two-dimensional CNN methods have shown remarkable performance in detecting
objects of images in computer vision area. Meanwhile, the 1D-CNN can be used
for supervised learning on time-series data. We establish a machine learning
model based on the 1D-CNN by serializing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) packets in a predetermined time range as an invasion Internet
traffic model for the IDS, where normal and abnormal network traffics are
categorized and labeled for supervised learning in the 1D-CNN. We evaluated our
model on UNSW\_NB15 IDS dataset to show the effectiveness of our method. For
comparison study in performance, machine learning-based Random Forest (RF) and
Support Vector Machine (SVM) models in addition to the 1D-CNN with various
network parameters and architecture are exploited. In each experiment, the
models are run up to 200 epochs with a learning rate in 0.0001 on imbalanced
and balanced data. 1D-CNN and its variant architectures have outperformed
compared to the classical machine learning classifiers. This is mainly due to
the reason that CNN has the capability to extract high-level feature
representations that represent the abstract form of low-level feature sets of
network traffic connections.

\\
  The recent decade has witnessed phenomenal growth in communication
technology. Development of user-friendly software platforms, such as Facebook,
WhatsApp etc. have facilitated ease of communication and thereby people have
started freely sharing messages and multimedia over the Internet. Further,
there is a shift in trends with services being accessed from smartphones over
personal computers. To protect the security and privacy of the smartphone
users, most of the applications use encryption that encapsulates communications
over the Internet. However, research has shown that the statistical information
present in a traffic can be used to identify the application, and further, the
activity performed by the user inside that application. In this paper, we
extend the scope of analysis by proposing a learning framework to leverage
application and activity data to profile smartphone users in terms of their
gender, profession age group etc. This will greatly help the authoritative
agencies to conduct their investigations related to national security and other
purposes.

  Firefox and other major browsers rely on dozens of third-party libraries to
render audio, video, images, and other content. These libraries are a frequent
source of vulnerabilities. To mitigate this threat, we are migrating Firefox to
an architecture that isolates these libraries in lightweight sandboxes,
dramatically reducing the impact of a compromise.
  Retrofitting isolation can be labor-intensive, very prone to security bugs,
and requires critical attention to performance. To help, we developed RLBox, a
framework that minimizes the burden of converting Firefox to securely and
efficiently use untrusted code. To enable this, RLBox employs static
information flow enforcement, and lightweight dynamic checks, expressed
directly in the C++ type system.
  RLBox supports efficient sandboxing through either software-based-fault
isolation or multi-core process isolation. Performance overheads are modest and
transient, and have only minor impact on page latency. We demonstrate this by
sandboxing performance-sensitive image decoding libraries ( libjpeg and libpng
), video decoding libraries ( libtheora and libvpx ), the libvorbis audio
decoding library, and the zlib decompression library.
  RLBox, using a WebAssembly sandbox, has been integrated into production
Firefox to sandbox the libGraphite font shaping library.

Title: Make Quantum Indistinguishability Great Again
Authors: Tommaso Gagliardoni, Juliane Kr\"amer, and Patrick Struck
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  In this work we study the (superposition-based, or QS2) quantum security of
public key encryption schemes, originally initiated by Boneh and Zhandry
(CRYPTO 2013, for a classical challenge indistinguishability phase) and
imprioved by Gagliardoni et al. (CRYPTO 2016, for the symmetric key case). For
public key encryption schemes, no notion of quantum security with a quantum
indistinguishability phase exists. In this work we close this gap by using
so-called type-2 operators for encrypting the challenge message. This brings
non-trivial obstacles: On the one hand, public key encryption schemes typically
cannot recover the randomness during decryption. On the other hand, many
real-world schemes suffer from a small probability of decryption failures.
Nevertheless, we identify a class of encryption schemes, which we call
recoverable, that allow to avoid decryption failures given knowledge of the
original encryption randomness, and we show that for these schemes the type-2
operator can be efficiently implemented even without knowledge of the secret
key. This means that, for the public key case, type-2 operators are actually
very natural. We also observe that many real-world quantum-resistant schemes,
including many NIST candidates, are of this type. Equipped with these results,
we (1) give the first quantum security notion (qINDqCPA) for public key
encryption with a quantum indistinguishability phase, (2) prove that the
canonical LWE-based encryption scheme achieves our security notion, (3) show
that our notion is strictly stronger than existing security notions, (4) study
the general classification of quantum-resistant public key encryption schemes,
and (5) compare our results to a concurrent and independent work by Chevalier
et al. (2020).

Title: BitcoinF: Achieving Fairness for Bitcoin in Transaction-Fee-Only Model
Authors: Shoeb Siddiqui, Ganesh Vanahalli, Sujit Gujar
Categories: cs.CR cs.GT
\\
  A blockchain, such as Bitcoin, is an append-only, secure, transparent,
distributed ledger. A fair blockchain is expected to have healthy metrics; high
honest mining power, low processing latency, i.e., low wait times for
transactions and stable price of consumption, i.e., the minimum transaction fee
required to have a transaction processed. As Bitcoin matures, the influx of
transactions increases and the block rewards become insignificant. We show that
under these conditions, it becomes hard to maintain the health of the
blockchain. In Bitcoin, under these mature operating conditions (MOC), the
miners would find it challenging to cover their mining costs as there would be
no more revenue from merely mining a block. It may cause miners not to continue
mining, threatening the blockchain's security. Further, as we show in this
paper using simulations, the cost of acting in favor of the health of the
blockchain, under MOC, is very high in Bitcoin, causing all miners to process
transactions greedily. It leads to stranded transactions, i.e., transactions
offering low transaction fees, experiencing unreasonably high processing
latency. To make matters worse, a compounding effect of these stranded
transactions is the rising price of consumption. Such phenomena not only induce
unfairness as experienced by the miners and the users but also deteriorate the
health of the blockchain.
  We propose BitcoinF transaction processing protocol, a simple, yet highly
effective modification to the existing Bitcoin protocol to fix these issues of
unfairness. BitcoinF resolves these issues of unfairness while preserving the
ability of the users to express urgency and have their transactions
prioritized.

\\
  With recent advances in reverse engineering, attackers can reconstruct a
netlist to counterfeit chips by opening the die and scanning all layers of
authentic chips. This relatively easy counterfeiting is made possible by the
use of the standard simple clocking scheme, where all combinational blocks
function within one clock period, so that a netlist of combinational logic
gates and flip-flops is sufficient to duplicate a design. In this paper, we
propose to invalidate the assumption that a netlist completely represents the
function of a circuit with unconventional timing. With the introduced
wave-pipelining paths, attackers have to capture gate and interconnect delays
during reverse engineering, or to test a huge number of combinational paths to
identify the wave-pipelining paths. To hinder the test-based attack, we
construct false paths with wave-pipelining to increase the counterfeiting
challenge. Experimental results confirm that wave-pipelining true paths and
false paths can be constructed in benchmark circuits successfully with only a
negligible cost, thus thwarting the potential attack techniques.

  Atomic Crosschain Transaction technology allows composable programming across
private Ethereum blockchains. It allows for inter-contract and inter-blockchain
function calls that are both synchronous and atomic: if one part fails, the
whole call graph of function calls is rolled back. It is not based on existing
techniques such as Hash Time Locked Contracts, relay chains, block header
transfer, or trusted intermediaries. BLS Threshold Signatures are used to prove
to validators on one blockchain that information came from another blockchain
and that a majority of the validators of that blockchain agree on the
information. Coordination Contracts are used to manage the state of a
Crosschain Transaction and as a repository of Blockchain Public Keys. Dynamic
code analysis and signed nested transactions are used together with live
argument checking to ensure execution only occurs if the execution results in
valid state changes. Contract Locking and Lockability enable atomic updates.

\\
  Software protection aims at safeguarding assets embedded in software by
preventing and delaying reverse engineering and tampering attacks. This paper
presents an architecture and supporting tool flow to renew parts of native
applications dynamically. Renewed and diversified code and data belonging to
either the original application or to linked-in protections are delivered from
a secure server to a client on demand. This results in frequent changes to the
software components when they are under attack, thus making attacks harder. By
supporting various forms of diversification and renewability, novel protection
combinations become available, and existing combinations become stronger. The
prototype implementation is evaluated on a number of industrial use cases.

  The hypothesis for the study was that the relationship based on referrer
links and the number of hops to a malicious site could indicate the risk to
another website. We chose Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis as
the method of comparing true positive and false positive rates for captured web
traffic to test the predictive capabilities of our model. Known threat
indicators were used as designators, and the Neo4j graph database was leveraged
to map the relationships between other websites based on referring links. Using
the referring traffic, we mapped user visits across websites with a known
relationship to track the rate at which users progressed from a non-malicious
website to a known threat. The results were grouped by the hop distance from
the known threat to calculate the predictive rate. The results of the model
produced true positive rates between 58.59% and 63.45% and false positive rates
between 7.42% to 37.50%, respectively. The true and false positive rates
suggest an improved performance based on the closer proximity from the known
threat, while an increased referring distance from the threat resulted in
higher rates of false positives.

\\
  The calibration of noise for a privacy-preserving mechanism depends on the
sensitivity of the query and the prescribed privacy level. A data steward must
make the non-trivial choice of a privacy level that balances the requirements
of users and the monetary constraints of the business entity. We analyse roles
of the sources of randomness, namely the explicit randomness induced by the
noise distribution and the implicit randomness induced by the data-generation
distribution, that are involved in the design of a privacy-preserving
mechanism. The finer analysis enables us to provide stronger privacy guarantees
with quantifiable risks. Thus, we propose privacy at risk that is a
probabilistic calibration of privacy-preserving mechanisms. We provide a
composition theorem that leverages privacy at risk. We instantiate the
probabilistic calibration for the Laplace mechanism by providing analytical
results. We also propose a cost model that bridges the gap between the privacy
level and the compensation budget estimated by a GDPR compliant business
entity. The convexity of the proposed cost model leads to a unique fine-tuning
of privacy level that minimises the compensation budget. We show its
effectiveness by illustrating a realistic scenario that avoids overestimation
of the compensation budget by using privacy at risk for the Laplace mechanism.
We quantitatively show that composition using the cost optimal privacy at risk
provides stronger privacy guarantee than the classical advanced composition.

Title: Exploring Backdoor Poisoning Attacks Against Malware Classifiers
Authors: Giorgio Severi, Jim Meyer, Scott Coull, Alina Oprea
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
Comments: 19 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Current training pipelines for machine learning (ML) based malware
classification rely on crowdsourced threat feeds, exposing a natural attack
injection point. We study for the first time the susceptibility of ML malware
classifiers to backdoor poisoning attacks, specifically focusing on challenging
"clean label" attacks where attackers do not control the sample labeling
process. We propose the use of techniques from explainable machine learning to
guide the selection of relevant features and their values to create a watermark
in a model-agnostic fashion. Using a dataset of 800,000 Windows binaries, we
demonstrate effective attacks against gradient boosting decision trees and a
neural network model for malware classification under various constraints
imposed on the attacker. For example, an attacker injecting just 1% poison
samples in the training process can achieve a success rate greater than 97% by
crafting a watermark of 8 features out of more than 2,300 available features.
To demonstrate the feasibility of our backdoor attacks in practice, we create a
watermarking utility for Windows PE files that preserves the binary's
functionality. Finally, we experiment with potential defensive strategies and
show the difficulties of completely defending against these powerful attacks,
especially when the attacks blend in with the legitimate sample distribution.

Title: Learning Nonparametric Human Mesh Reconstruction from a Single Image
  without Ground Truth Meshes
Authors: Kevin Lin, Lijuan Wang, Ying Jin, Zicheng Liu, Ming-Ting Sun
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Nonparametric approaches have shown promising results on reconstructing 3D
human mesh from a single monocular image. Unlike previous approaches that use a
parametric human model like skinned multi-person linear model (SMPL), and
attempt to regress the model parameters, nonparametric approaches relax the
heavy reliance on the parametric space. However, existing nonparametric methods
require ground truth meshes as their regression target for each vertex, and
obtaining ground truth mesh labels is very expensive. In this paper, we propose
a novel approach to learn human mesh reconstruction without any ground truth
meshes. This is made possible by introducing two new terms into the loss
function of a graph convolutional neural network (Graph CNN). The first term is
the Laplacian prior that acts as a regularizer on the reconstructed mesh. The
second term is the part segmentation loss that forces the projected region of
the reconstructed mesh to match the part segmentation. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that without using 3D ground truth meshes, the
proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches that
require ground truth meshes for training.

  Human beings have developed fantastic abilities to integrate information from
various sensory sources exploring their inherent complementarity. Perceptual
capabilities are therefore heightened enabling, for instance, the well known
"cocktail party" and McGurk effects, i.e. speech disambiguation from a panoply
of sound signals. This fusion ability is also key in refining the perception of
sound source location, as in distinguishing whose voice is being heard in a
group conversation. Furthermore, Neuroscience has successfully identified the
superior colliculus region in the brain as the one responsible for this
modality fusion, with a handful of biological models having been proposed to
approach its underlying neurophysiological process. Deriving inspiration from
one of these models, this paper presents a methodology for effectively fusing
correlated auditory and visual information for active speaker detection. Such
an ability can have a wide range of applications, from teleconferencing systems
to social robotics. The detection approach initially routes auditory and visual
information through two specialized neural network structures. The resulting
embeddings are fused via a novel layer based on the superior colliculus, whose
topological structure emulates spatial neuron cross-mapping of unimodal
perceptual fields. The validation process employed two publicly available
datasets, with achieved results confirming and greatly surpassing initial
expectations.

\\
  Recent contributions have demonstrated that it is possible to recognize the
pose of humans densely and accurately given a large dataset of poses annotated
in detail. In principle, the same approach could be extended to any animal
class, but the effort required for collecting new annotations for each case
makes this strategy impractical, despite important applications in natural
conservation, science and business. We show that, at least for proximal animal
classes such as chimpanzees, it is possible to transfer the knowledge existing
in dense pose recognition for humans, as well as in more general object
detectors and segmenters, to the problem of dense pose recognition in other
classes. We do this by (1) establishing a DensePose model for the new animal
which is also geometrically aligned to humans (2) introducing a multi-head
R-CNN architecture that facilitates transfer of multiple recognition tasks
between classes, (3) finding which combination of known classes can be
transferred most effectively to the new animal and (4) using self-calibrated
uncertainty heads to generate pseudo-labels graded by quality for training a
model for this class. We also introduce two benchmark datasets labelled in the
manner of DensePose for the class chimpanzee and use them to evaluate our
approach, showing excellent transfer learning performance.

  Recent advances in deep learning have achieved promising performance for
medical image analysis, while in most cases ground-truth annotations from human
experts are necessary to train the deep model. In practice, such annotations
are expensive to collect and can be scarce for medical imaging applications.
Therefore, there is significant interest in learning representations from
unlabelled raw data. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning
approach to learn meaningful and transferable representations from medical
imaging video without any type of human annotation. We assume that in order to
learn such a representation, the model should identify anatomical structures
from the unlabelled data. Therefore we force the model to address anatomy-aware
tasks with free supervision from the data itself. Specifically, the model is
designed to correct the order of a reshuffled video clip and at the same time
predict the geometric transformation applied to the video clip. Experiments on
fetal ultrasound video show that the proposed approach can effectively learn
meaningful and strong representations, which transfer well to downstream tasks
like standard plane detection and saliency prediction.

Title: Towards Using Count-level Weak Supervision for Crowd Counting
Authors: Yinjie Lei, Yan Liu, Pingping Zhang, Lingqiao Liu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Most existing crowd counting methods require object location-level
annotation, i.e., placing a dot at the center of an object. While being simpler
than the bounding-box or pixel-level annotation, obtaining this annotation is
still labor-intensive and time-consuming especially for images with highly
crowded scenes. On the other hand, weaker annotations that only know the total
count of objects can be almost effortless in many practical scenarios. Thus, it
is desirable to develop a learning method that can effectively train models
from count-level annotations. To this end, this paper studies the problem of
weakly-supervised crowd counting which learns a model from only a small amount
of location-level annotations (fully-supervised) but a large amount of
count-level annotations (weakly-supervised). To perform effective training in
this scenario, we observe that the direct solution of regressing the integral
of density map to the object count is not sufficient and it is beneficial to
introduce stronger regularizations on the predicted density map of
weakly-annotated images. We devise a simple-yet-effective training strategy,
namely Multiple Auxiliary Tasks Training (MATT), to construct regularizes for
restricting the freedom of the generated density maps. Through extensive
experiments on existing datasets and a newly proposed dataset, we validate the
effectiveness of the proposed weakly-supervised method and demonstrate its
superior performance over existing solutions.

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO
Comments: accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  We present Hybrid Voxel Network (HVNet), a novel one-stage unified network
for point cloud based 3D object detection for autonomous driving. Recent
studies show that 2D voxelization with per voxel PointNet style feature
extractor leads to accurate and efficient detector for large 3D scenes. Since
the size of the feature map determines the computation and memory cost, the
size of the voxel becomes a parameter that is hard to balance. A smaller voxel
size gives a better performance, especially for small objects, but a longer
inference time. A larger voxel can cover the same area with a smaller feature
map, but fails to capture intricate features and accurate location for smaller
objects. We present a Hybrid Voxel network that solves this problem by fusing
voxel feature encoder (VFE) of different scales at point-wise level and project
into multiple pseudo-image feature maps. We further propose an attentive voxel
feature encoding that outperforms plain VFE and a feature fusion pyramid
network to aggregate multi-scale information at feature map level. Experiments
on the KITTI benchmark show that a single HVNet achieves the best mAP among all
existing methods with a real time inference speed of 31Hz.

Title: Augmented Cyclic Consistency Regularization for Unpaired Image-to-Image

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation has received considerable attention
in pattern recognition and computer vision because of recent advancements in
generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, due to the lack of explicit
supervision, unpaired I2I models often fail to generate realistic images,
especially in challenging datasets with different backgrounds and poses. Hence,
stabilization is indispensable for real-world applications and GANs. Herein, we
propose Augmented Cyclic Consistency Regularization (ACCR), a novel
regularization method for unpaired I2I translation. Our main idea is to enforce
consistency regularization originating from semi-supervised learning on the
discriminators leveraging real, fake, reconstructed, and augmented samples. We
regularize the discriminators to output similar predictions when fed pairs of
original and perturbed images. We qualitatively clarify the generation property
between unpaired I2I models and standard GANs, and explain why consistency
regularization on fake and reconstructed samples works well. Quantitatively,
our method outperforms the consistency regularized GAN (CR-GAN) in digit
translations and demonstrates efficacy against several data augmentation
variants and cycle-consistent constraints.

  Accurate 6D object pose estimation is fundamental to robotic manipulation and

the distance between closest point pairs to handle the rotation ambiguity of
symmetric objects. In this work, we propose a novel discrete-continuous
formulation for rotation regression to resolve this local-optimum problem. We
uniformly sample rotation anchors in SO(3), and predict a constrained deviation
from each anchor to the target, as well as uncertainty scores for selecting the
best prediction. Additionally, the object location is detected by aggregating
point-wise vectors pointing to the 3D center. Experiments on two benchmarks:
LINEMOD and YCB-Video, show that the proposed method outperforms

  Image animation consists of generating a video sequence so that an object in
a source image is animated according to the motion of a driving video. Our
framework addresses this problem without using any annotation or prior
information about the specific object to animate. Once trained on a set of
videos depicting objects of the same category (\eg \ faces, human bodies), our
method can be applied to any object of this class. To achieve this, we decouple
appearance and motion information using a self-supervised formulation. To
support complex motions, we use a representation consisting of a set of learned
keypoints along with their local affine transformations. A generator network
models occlusions arising during target motions and combines the appearance
extracted from the source image and the motion derived from the driving video.
Our framework scores best on diverse benchmarks and on a variety of object
categories. Our source code is publicly available.

Title: VideoSSL: Semi-Supervised Learning for Video Classification
Authors: Longlong Jing, Toufiq Parag, Zhe Wu, Yingli Tian, Hongcheng Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose a semi-supervised learning approach for video classification,
VideoSSL, using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Like other computer vision
tasks, existing supervised video classification methods demand a large amount
of labeled data to attain good performance. However, annotation of a large
dataset is expensive and time consuming. To minimize the dependence on a large
annotated dataset, our proposed semi-supervised method trains from a small
number of labeled examples and exploits two regulatory signals from unlabeled
data. The first signal is the pseudo-labels of unlabeled examples computed from
the confidences of the CNN being trained. The other is the normalized
probabilities, as predicted by an image classifier CNN, that captures the
information about appearances of the interesting objects in the video. We show
that, under the supervision of these guiding signals from unlabeled examples, a
video classification CNN can achieve impressive performances utilizing a small
fraction of annotated examples on three publicly available datasets: UCF101,
HMDB51 and Kinetics.

Title: Learning to Compare Relation: Semantic Alignment for Few-Shot Learning
Authors: Congqi Cao and Yanning Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Few-shot learning is a fundamental and challenging problem since it requires
recognizing novel categories from only a few examples. The objects for
recognition have multiple variants and can locate anywhere in images. Directly
comparing query images with example images can not handle content misalignment.
The representation and metric for comparison are critical but challenging to
learn due to the scarcity and wide variation of the samples in few-shot
learning. In this paper, we present a novel semantic alignment model to compare
relations, which is robust to content misalignment. We propose to add two key
ingredients to existing few-shot learning frameworks for better feature and
metric learning ability. First, we introduce a semantic alignment loss to align
the relation statistics of the features from samples that belong to the same
category. And second, local and global mutual information maximization is
introduced, allowing for representations that contain locally-consistent and
intra-class shared information across structural locations in an image.
Thirdly, we introduce a principled approach to weigh multiple loss functions by
considering the homoscedastic uncertainty of each stream. We conduct extensive
experiments on several few-shot learning datasets. Experimental results show
that the proposed method is capable of comparing relations with semantic
alignment strategies, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Cross-Spectrum Dual-Subspace Pairing for RGB-infrared Cross-Modality
  Person Re-Identification
Authors: Xing Fan, Hao Luo, Chi Zhang, Wei Jiang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Due to its potential wide applications in video surveillance and other
computer vision tasks like tracking, person re-identification (ReID) has become
popular and been widely investigated. However, conventional person
re-identification can only handle RGB color images, which will fail at dark
conditions. Thus RGB-infrared ReID (also known as Infrared-Visible ReID or
Visible-Thermal ReID) is proposed. Apart from appearance discrepancy in
traditional ReID caused by illumination, pose variations and viewpoint changes,
modality discrepancy produced by cameras of the different spectrum also exists,
which makes RGB-infrared ReID more difficult. To address this problem, we focus
on extracting the shared cross-spectrum features of different modalities. In
this paper, a novel multi-spectrum image generation method is proposed and the
generated samples are utilized to help the network to find discriminative
information for re-identifying the same person across modalities. Another
challenge of RGB-infrared ReID is that the intra-person (images from the same
person) discrepancy is often larger than the inter-person (images from
different persons) discrepancy, so a dual-subspace pairing strategy is proposed
to alleviate this problem. Combining those two parts together, we also design a
one-stream neural network combining the aforementioned methods to extract
compact representations of person images, called Cross-spectrum Dual-subspace
Pairing (CDP) model. Furthermore, during the training process, we also propose
a Dynamic Hard Spectrum Mining method to automatically mine more hard samples
from hard spectrum based on the current model state to further boost the
performance. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets, SYSU-MM01
with RGB + near-infrared images and RegDB with RGB + far-infrared images, have
demonstrated the efficiency and generality of our proposed method.

\\
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically constructed by stacking
multiple building blocks, each of which contains a normalization layer such as
batch normalization (BN) and a rectified linear function such as ReLU. However,
this work shows that the combination of normalization and rectified linear
function leads to inhibited channels, which have small magnitude and contribute
little to the learned feature representation, impeding the generalization
ability of CNNs. Unlike prior arts that simply removed the inhibited channels,
we propose to "wake them up" during training by designing a novel neural
building block, termed Channel Equilibrium (CE) block, which enables channels
at the same layer to contribute equally to the learned representation. We show
that CE is able to prevent inhibited channels both empirically and
theoretically. CE has several appealing benefits. (1) It can be integrated into
many advanced CNN architectures such as ResNet and MobileNet, outperforming
their original networks. (2) CE has an interesting connection with the Nash
Equilibrium, a well-known solution of a non-cooperative game. (3) Extensive
experiments show that CE achieves state-of-the-art performance on various
challenging benchmarks such as ImageNet and COCO.

Title: NAS-Count: Counting-by-Density with Neural Architecture Search
Authors: Yutao Hu, Xiaolong Jiang, Xuhui Liu, Baochang Zhang, Jungong Han,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Most of the recent advances in crowd counting have evolved from hand-designed
density estimation networks, where multi-scale features are leveraged to
address scale variation, but at the expense of demanding design efforts. In
this work, we automate the design of counting models with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) and introduce an end-to-end searched encoder-decoder architecture,
Automatic Multi-Scale Network (AMSNet). The encoder and decoder in AMSNet are
composed of different cells discovered from counting-specific search spaces,
each dedicated to extracting and aggregating multi-scale features adaptively.
To resolve the pixel-level isolation issue in training density estimation
models, AMSNet is optimized with a novel Scale Pyramid Pooling Loss (SPPLoss),
which exploits a pyramidal architecture to achieve structural supervision at
multiple scales. During training time, AMSNet and SPPLoss are searched
end-to-end efficiently with differentiable NAS techniques. When testing, AMSNet
produces state-of-the-art results that are considerably better than
hand-designed models on four challenging datasets, fully demonstrating the
efficacy of NAS-Count.

Title: Joint Face Completion and Super-resolution using Multi-scale Feature
  Relation Learning
Authors: Zhilei Liu, Yunpeng Wu, Le Li, Cuicui Zhang, Baoyuan Wu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Previous research on face restoration often focused on repairing a specific
type of low-quality facial images such as low-resolution (LR) or occluded
facial images. However, in the real world, both the above-mentioned forms of
image degradation often coexist. Therefore, it is important to design a model
that can repair LR occluded images simultaneously. This paper proposes a
multi-scale feature graph generative adversarial network (MFG-GAN) to implement
the face restoration of images in which both degradation modes coexist, and
also to repair images with a single type of degradation. Based on the GAN, the
MFG-GAN integrates the graph convolution and feature pyramid network to restore
occluded low-resolution face images to non-occluded high-resolution face
images. The MFG-GAN uses a set of customized losses to ensure that high-quality
images are generated. In addition, we designed the network in an end-to-end
format. Experimental results on the public-domain CelebA and Helen databases
show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
performing face super-resolution (up to 4x or 8x) and face completion
simultaneously. Cross-database testing also revealed that the proposed approach
has good generalizability.

Title: Reusing Discriminators for Encoding Towards Unsupervised Image-to-Image
  Translation
Authors: Runfa Chen, Wenbing Huang, Binghui Huang, Fuchun Sun, Bin Fang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  Unsupervised image-to-image translation is a central task in computer vision.
Current translation frameworks will abandon the discriminator once the training
process is completed. This paper contends a novel role of the discriminator by
reusing it for encoding the images of the target domain. The proposed
architecture, termed as NICE-GAN, exhibits two advantageous patterns over
previous approaches: First, it is more compact since no independent encoding
component is required; Second, this plug-in encoder is directly trained by the
adversary loss, making it more informative and trained more effectively if a
multi-scale discriminator is applied. The main issue in NICE-GAN is the
coupling of translation with discrimination along the encoder, which could
incur training inconsistency when we play the min-max game via GAN. To tackle
this issue, we develop a decoupled training strategy by which the encoder is
only trained when maximizing the adversary loss while keeping frozen otherwise.
Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate the superior
performance of NICE-GAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of FID, KID, and
also human preference. Comprehensive ablation studies are also carried out to
isolate the validity of each proposed component.

Title: Augmenting Visual Place Recognition with Structural Cues
Authors: Amadeus Oertel, Titus Cieslewski and Davide Scaramuzza
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  In this paper, we propose to augment image-based place recognition with
structural cues. Specifically, these structural cues are obtained using
structure-from-motion, such that no additional sensors are needed for place
recognition. This is achieved by augmenting the 2D convolutional neural network
(CNN) typically used for image-based place recognition with a 3D CNN that takes
as input a voxel grid derived from the structure-from-motion point cloud. We
evaluate different methods for fusing the 2D and 3D features and obtain best
performance with global average pooling and simple concatenation. The resulting
descriptor exhibits superior recognition performance compared to descriptors
extracted from only one of the input modalities, including state-of-the-art
image-based descriptors. Especially at low descriptor dimensionalities, we
outperform state-of-the-art descriptors by up to 90%.

Title: Representations, Metrics and Statistics For Shape Analysis of Elastic
  Graphs
Authors: Xiaoyang Guo, Anuj Srivastava
Categories: cs.CV cs.CG stat.ME
\\
  Past approaches for statistical shape analysis of objects have focused mainly
on objects within the same topological classes, e.g., scalar functions,
Euclidean curves, or surfaces, etc. For objects that differ in more complex
ways, the current literature offers only topological methods. This paper
introduces a far-reaching geometric approach for analyzing shapes of graphical
objects, such as road networks, blood vessels, brain fiber tracts, etc. It
represents such objects, exhibiting differences in both geometries and
topologies, as graphs made of curves with arbitrary shapes (edges) and
connected at arbitrary junctions (nodes). To perform statistical analyses, one
needs mathematical representations, metrics and other geometrical tools, such
as geodesics, means, and covariances. This paper utilizes a quotient structure
to develop efficient algorithms for computing these quantities, leading to
useful statistical tools, including principal component analysis and analytical
statistical testing and modeling of graphical shapes. The efficacy of this
framework is demonstrated using various simulated as well as the real data from
neurons and brain arterial networks.

Title: Grounded and Controllable Image Completion by Incorporating Lexical
  Semantics

\\
  In this paper, we present an approach, namely Lexical Semantic Image
Completion (LSIC), that may have potential applications in art, design, and
heritage conservation, among several others. Existing image completion
procedure is highly subjective by considering only visual context, which may
trigger unpredictable results which are plausible but not faithful to a
grounded knowledge. To permit both grounded and controllable completion
process, we advocate generating results faithful to both visual and lexical
semantic context, i.e., the description of leaving holes or blank regions in
the image (e.g., hole description). One major challenge for LSIC comes from
modeling and aligning the structure of visual-semantic context and translating
across different modalities. We term this process as structure completion,
which is realized by multi-grained reasoning blocks in our model. Another
challenge relates to the unimodal biases, which occurs when the model generates
plausible results without using the textual description. This can be true since
the annotated captions for an image are often semantically equivalent in
existing datasets, and thus there is only one paired text for a masked image in
training. We devise an unsupervised unpaired-creation learning path besides the
over-explored paired-reconstruction path, as well as a multi-stage training
strategy to mitigate the insufficiency of labeled data. We conduct extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments as well as ablation studies, which
reveal the efficacy of our proposed LSIC.

Title: Learning Cross-domain Generalizable Features by Representation
  Disentanglement
Authors: Qingjie Meng and Daniel Rueckert and Bernhard Kainz
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep learning models exhibit limited generalizability across different
domains. Specifically, transferring knowledge from available entangled domain
features(source/target domain) and categorical features to new unseen
categorical features in a target domain is an interesting and difficult problem
that is rarely discussed in the current literature. This problem is essential
for many real-world applications such as improving diagnostic classification or
prediction in medical imaging. To address this problem, we propose
Mutual-Information-based Disentangled Neural Networks (MIDNet) to extract
generalizable features that enable transferring knowledge to unseen categorical
features in target domains. The proposed MIDNet is developed as a
semi-supervised learning paradigm to alleviate the dependency on labeled data.
This is important for practical applications where data annotation requires
rare expertise as well as intense time and labor. We demonstrate our method on
handwritten digits datasets and a fetal ultrasound dataset for image
classification tasks. Experiments show that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art and achieve expected performance with sparsely labeled data.

\\
  Emotion recognition has become an important field of research in the
human-computer interactions domain. The latest advancements in the field show
that combining visual with audio information lead to better results if compared
to the case of using a single source of information separately. From a visual
point of view, a human emotion can be recognized by analyzing the facial
expression of the person. More precisely, the human emotion can be described
through a combination of several Facial Action Units. In this paper, we propose
a system that is able to recognize emotions with a high accuracy rate and in
real time, based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks. In order to increase
the accuracy of the recognition system, we analyze also the speech data and
fuse the information coming from both sources, i.e., visual and audio.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for emotion
recognition and the importance of combining visual with audio data.

Title: Say As You Wish: Fine-grained Control of Image Caption Generation with
  Abstract Scene Graphs
Authors: Shizhe Chen, Qin Jin, Peng Wang, Qi Wu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: To be appeared in CVPR 2020
\\
  Humans are able to describe image contents with coarse to fine details as
they wish. However, most image captioning models are intention-agnostic which
can not generate diverse descriptions according to different user intentions
initiatively. In this work, we propose the Abstract Scene Graph (ASG) structure
to represent user intention in fine-grained level and control what and how
detailed the generated description should be. The ASG is a directed graph
consisting of three types of \textbf{abstract nodes} (object, attribute,
relationship) grounded in the image without any concrete semantic labels. Thus
it is easy to obtain either manually or automatically. From the ASG, we propose
a novel ASG2Caption model, which is able to recognise user intentions and
semantics in the graph, and therefore generate desired captions according to
the graph structure. Our model achieves better controllability conditioning on
ASGs than carefully designed baselines on both VisualGenome and MSCOCO
datasets. It also significantly improves the caption diversity via
automatically sampling diverse ASGs as control signals.

\\
  Joint distribution matching (JDM) problem, which aims to learn bidirectional
mappings to match joint distributions of two domains, occurs in many machine
learning and computer vision applications. This problem, however, is very
difficult due to two critical challenges: (i) it is often difficult to exploit
sufficient information from the joint distribution to conduct the matching;
(ii) this problem is hard to formulate and optimize. In this paper, relying on
optimal transport theory, we propose to address JDM problem by minimizing the
Wasserstein distance of the joint distributions in two domains. However, the
resultant optimization problem is still intractable. We then propose an
important theorem to reduce the intractable problem into a simple optimization
problem, and develop a novel method (called Joint Wasserstein Distribution
Matching (JWDM)) to solve it. In the experiments, we apply our method to
unsupervised image translation and cross-domain video synthesis. Both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superior performance
of our method over several state-of-the-arts.

Title: Fine-grained Video-Text Retrieval with Hierarchical Graph Reasoning
Authors: Shizhe Chen, Yida Zhao, Qin Jin, Qi Wu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: To be appeared in CVPR 2020
\\
  Cross-modal retrieval between videos and texts has attracted growing
attentions due to the rapid emergence of videos on the web. The current
dominant approach for this problem is to learn a joint embedding space to
measure cross-modal similarities. However, simple joint embeddings are
insufficient to represent complicated visual and textual details, such as
scenes, objects, actions and their compositions. To improve fine-grained
video-text retrieval, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Reasoning (HGR) model,
which decomposes video-text matching into global-to-local levels. To be
specific, the model disentangles texts into hierarchical semantic graph
including three levels of events, actions, entities and relationships across
levels. Attention-based graph reasoning is utilized to generate hierarchical
textual embeddings, which can guide the learning of diverse and hierarchical
video representations. The HGR model aggregates matchings from different
video-text levels to capture both global and local details. Experimental
results on three video-text datasets demonstrate the advantages of our model.
Such hierarchical decomposition also enables better generalization across
datasets and improves the ability to distinguish fine-grained semantic
differences.

\\
  Active learning (AL) aims to minimize labeling efforts for data-demanding
deep neural networks (DNNs) by selecting the most representative data points
for annotation. However, currently used methods are ill-equipped to deal with
biased data. The main motivation of this paper is to consider a realistic
setting for pool-based semi-supervised AL, where the unlabeled collection of
train data is biased. We theoretically derive an optimal acquisition function
for AL in this setting. It can be formulated as distribution shift minimization
between unlabeled train data and weakly-labeled validation dataset. To
implement such acquisition function, we propose a low-complexity method for
feature density matching using self-supervised Fisher kernel (FK) as well as
several novel pseudo-label estimators. Our FK-based method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on MNIST, SVHN, and ImageNet classification while
requiring only 1/10th of processing. The conducted experiments show at least
40% drop in labeling efforts for the biased class-imbalanced data compared to
existing methods.

  Home design is a complex task that normally requires architects to finish
with their professional skills and tools. It will be fascinating that if one
can produce a house plan intuitively without knowing much knowledge about home
design and experience of using complex designing tools, for example, via
natural language. In this paper, we formulate it as a language conditioned
visual content generation problem that is further divided into a floor plan
generation and an interior texture (such as floor and wall) synthesis task. The
only control signal of the generation process is the linguistic expression
given by users that describe the house details. To this end, we propose a House
Plan Generative Model (HPGM) that first translates the language input to a
structural graph representation and then predicts the layout of rooms with a
Graph Conditioned Layout Prediction Network (GC LPN) and generates the interior
texture with a Language Conditioned Texture GAN (LCT-GAN). With some
post-processing, the final product of this task is a 3D house model. To train
and evaluate our model, we build the first Text-to-3D House Model dataset.

  Comprehension

Comments: To appear in CVPR2020
\\
  Referring expression comprehension (REF) aims at identifying a particular
object in a scene by a natural language expression. It requires joint reasoning
over the textual and visual domains to solve the problem. Some popular
referring expression datasets, however, fail to provide an ideal test bed for
evaluating the reasoning ability of the models, mainly because 1) their
expressions typically describe only some simple distinctive properties of the
object and 2) their images contain limited distracting information. To bridge
the gap, we propose a new dataset for visual reasoning in context of referring
expression comprehension with two main features. First, we design a novel
expression engine rendering various reasoning logics that can be flexibly
combined with rich visual properties to generate expressions with varying
compositionality. Second, to better exploit the full reasoning chain embodied
in an expression, we propose a new test setting by adding additional
distracting images containing objects sharing similar properties with the
referent, thus minimising the success rate of reasoning-free cross-domain
alignment. We evaluate several state-of-the-art REF models, but find none of
them can achieve promising performance. A proposed modular hard mining strategy
performs the best but still leaves substantial room for improvement. We hope
this new dataset and task can serve as a benchmark for deeper visual reasoning
analysis and foster the research on referring expression comprehension.

Unlike existing point cloud completion networks, which generate the overall

existing points and encounter noise and geometrical loss, PF-Net preserves the
spatial arrangements of the incomplete point cloud and can figure out the
detailed geometrical structure of the missing region(s) in the prediction. To
succeed at this task, PF-Net estimates the missing point cloud hierarchically
by utilizing a feature-points-based multi-scale generating network. Further, we
add up multi-stage completion loss and adversarial loss to generate more
realistic missing region(s). The adversarial loss can better tackle multiple
modes in the prediction. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method for several challenging point cloud completion tasks.

  In light of the recent breakthroughs in automatic machine translation
systems, we propose a novel approach that we term as "Face-to-Face
Translation". As today's digital communication becomes increasingly visual, we
argue that there is a need for systems that can automatically translate a video
of a person speaking in language A into a target language B with realistic lip
synchronization. In this work, we create an automatic pipeline for this problem
and demonstrate its impact on multiple real-world applications. First, we build
a working speech-to-speech translation system by bringing together multiple
existing modules from speech and language. We then move towards "Face-to-Face
Translation" by incorporating a novel visual module, LipGAN for generating
realistic talking faces from the translated audio. Quantitative evaluation of
LipGAN on the standard LRW test set shows that it significantly outperforms
existing approaches across all standard metrics. We also subject our
Face-to-Face Translation pipeline, to multiple human evaluations and show that
it can significantly improve the overall user experience for consuming and
interacting with multimodal content across languages. Code, models and demo
video are made publicly available.

Title: Learning When and Where to Zoom with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Burak Uzkent, Stefano Ermon
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  While high resolution images contain semantically more useful information
than their lower resolution counterparts, processing them is computationally
more expensive, and in some applications, e.g. remote sensing, they can be much
more expensive to acquire. For these reasons, it is desirable to develop an
automatic method to selectively use high resolution data when necessary while
maintaining accuracy and reducing acquisition/run-time cost. In this direction,
we propose PatchDrop a reinforcement learning approach to dynamically identify
when and where to use/acquire high resolution data conditioned on the paired,
cheap, low resolution images. We conduct experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100,
ImageNet and fMoW datasets where we use significantly less high resolution data
while maintaining similar accuracy to models which use full high resolution
images.

  In this paper, the problem of head movement prediction for virtual reality

introduced to leverage position data as well as video frame content to predict
future head movement. For optimizing data input into this neural network, data
sample rate, reduced data, and long-period prediction length are also explored

Authors: Xiaolin Song, Yuyang Zhao, Jingyu Yang, Cuiling Lan, Wenjun Zeng, and

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal contextual network, STC-Flow, for
optical flow estimation. Unlike previous optical flow estimation approaches
with local pyramid feature extraction and multi-level correlation, we propose a
contextual relation exploration architecture by capturing rich long-range
dependencies in spatial and temporal dimensions. Specifically, STC-Flow
contains three key context modules - pyramidal spatial context module, temporal
context correlation module and recurrent residual contextual upsampling module,
to build the relationship in each stage of feature extraction, correlation, and
flow reconstruction, respectively. Experimental results indicate that the
proposed scheme achieves the state-of-the-art performance of two-frame based
methods on the Sintel dataset and the KITTI 2012/2015 datasets.

Title: State-Aware Tracker for Real-Time Video Object Segmentation
Authors: Xi Chen, Zuoxin Li, Ye Yuan, Gang Yu, Jianxin Shen, Donglian Qi
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR2020
\\
  In this work, we address the task of semi-supervised video object
segmentation(VOS) and explore how to make efficient use of video property to
tackle the challenge of semi-supervision. We propose a novel pipeline called
State-Aware Tracker(SAT), which can produce accurate segmentation results with
real-time speed. For higher efficiency, SAT takes advantage of the inter-frame
consistency and deals with each target object as a tracklet. For more stable
and robust performance over video sequences, SAT gets awareness for each state
and makes self-adaptation via two feedback loops. One loop assists SAT in
generating more stable tracklets. The other loop helps to construct a more
robust and holistic target representation. SAT achieves a promising result of
72.3% J&F mean with 39 FPS on DAVIS2017-Val dataset, which shows a decent
trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Code will be released at

Title: PointASNL: Robust Point Clouds Processing using Nonlocal Neural Networks
  with Adaptive Sampling
Authors: Xu Yan, Chaoda Zheng, Zhen Li, Sheng Wang and Shuguang Cui
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To appear in CVPR 2020
\\
  Raw point clouds data inevitably contains outliers or noise through
acquisition from 3D sensors or reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we
present a novel end-to-end network for robust point clouds processing, named
PointASNL, which can deal with point clouds with noise effectively. The key
component in our approach is the adaptive sampling (AS) module. It first
re-weights the neighbors around the initial sampled points from farthest point
sampling (FPS), and then adaptively adjusts the sampled points beyond the
entire point cloud. Our AS module can not only benefit the feature learning of
point clouds, but also ease the biased effect of outliers. To further capture
the neighbor and long-range dependencies of the sampled point, we proposed a
local-nonlocal (L-NL) module inspired by the nonlocal operation. Such L-NL
module enables the learning process insensitive to noise. Extensive experiments
verify the robustness and superiority of our approach in point clouds
processing tasks regardless of synthesis data, indoor data, and outdoor data
with or without noise. Specifically, PointASNL achieves state-of-the-art robust
performance for classification and segmentation tasks on all datasets, and
significantly outperforms previous methods on real-world outdoor SemanticKITTI
dataset with considerate noise. Our code is released through

Title: MonoPair: Monocular 3D Object Detection Using Pairwise Spatial
  Relationships
Authors: Yongjian Chen and Lei Tai and Kai Sun and Mingyang Li
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO
Comments: CVPR 2020 accepted
\\
  Monocular 3D object detection is an essential component in autonomous driving
while challenging to solve, especially for those occluded samples which are
only partially visible. Most detectors consider each 3D object as an
independent training target, inevitably resulting in a lack of useful
information for occluded samples. To this end, we propose a novel method to
improve the monocular 3D object detection by considering the relationship of
paired samples. This allows us to encode spatial constraints for
partially-occluded objects from their adjacent neighbors. Specifically, the
proposed detector computes uncertainty-aware predictions for object locations
and 3D distances for the adjacent object pairs, which are subsequently jointly
optimized by nonlinear least squares. Finally, the one-stage uncertainty-aware
prediction structure and the post-optimization module are dedicatedly
integrated for ensuring the run-time efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that
our method yields the best performance on KITTI 3D detection benchmark, by
outperforming state-of-the-art competitors by wide margins, especially for the
hard samples.

Title: Deep Attention Aware Feature Learning for Person Re-Identification
Authors: Yifan Chen, Han Wang, Xiaolu Sun, Bin Fan, Chu Tang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Visual attention has proven to be effective in improving the performance of
person re-identification. Most existing methods apply visual attention
heuristically by learning an additional attention map to re-weight the feature
maps for person re-identification. However, this kind of methods inevitably
increase the model complexity and inference time. In this paper, we propose to
incorporate the attention learning as additional objectives in a person ReID
network without changing the original structure, thus maintain the same
inference time and model size. Two kinds of attentions have been considered to
make the learned feature maps being aware of the person and related body parts
respectively. Globally, a holistic attention branch (HAB) makes the feature
maps obtained by backbone focus on persons so as to alleviate the influence of
background. Locally, a partial attention branch (PAB) makes the extracted
features be decoupled into several groups and be separately responsible for
different body parts (i.e., keypoints), thus increasing the robustness to pose
variation and partial occlusion. These two kinds of attentions are universal
and can be incorporated into existing ReID networks. We have tested its
performance on two typical networks (TriNet and Bag of Tricks) and observed
significant performance improvement on five widely used datasets.

\\
  3D object detection is an essential task in autonomous driving and robotics.
Though great progress has been made, challenges remain in estimating 3D pose
for distant and occluded objects. In this paper, we present a novel framework
named ZoomNet for stereo imagery-based 3D detection. The pipeline of ZoomNet
begins with an ordinary 2D object detection model which is used to obtain pairs
of left-right bounding boxes. To further exploit the abundant texture cues in
RGB images for more accurate disparity estimation, we introduce a conceptually
straight-forward module -- adaptive zooming, which simultaneously resizes 2D
instance bounding boxes to a unified resolution and adjusts the camera
intrinsic parameters accordingly. In this way, we are able to estimate
higher-quality disparity maps from the resized box images then construct dense
point clouds for both nearby and distant objects. Moreover, we introduce to
learn part locations as complementary features to improve the resistance
against occlusion and put forward the 3D fitting score to better estimate the
3D detection quality. Extensive experiments on the popular KITTI 3D detection
dataset indicate ZoomNet surpasses all previous state-of-the-art methods by
large margins (improved by 9.4% on APbv (IoU=0.7) over pseudo-LiDAR). Ablation
study also demonstrates that our adaptive zooming strategy brings an
improvement of over 10% on AP3d (IoU=0.7). In addition, since the official
KITTI benchmark lacks fine-grained annotations like pixel-wise part locations,
we also present our KFG dataset by augmenting KITTI with detailed instance-wise
annotations including pixel-wise part location, pixel-wise disparity, etc..
Both the KFG dataset and our codes will be publicly available at

Title: Soft-Root-Sign Activation Function
Authors: Yuan Zhou, Dandan Li, Shuwei Huo, and Sun-Yuan Kung
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The choice of activation function in deep networks has a significant effect
on the training dynamics and task performance. At present, the most effective
and widely-used activation function is ReLU. However, because of the non-zero
mean, negative missing and unbounded output, ReLU is at a potential
disadvantage during optimization. To this end, we introduce a novel activation
function to manage to overcome the above three challenges. The proposed
nonlinearity, namely "Soft-Root-Sign" (SRS), is smooth, non-monotonic, and
bounded. Notably, the bounded property of SRS distinguishes itself from most
state-of-the-art activation functions. In contrast to ReLU, SRS can adaptively
adjust the output by a pair of independent trainable parameters to capture
negative information and provide zero-mean property, which leading not only to
better generalization performance, but also to faster learning speed. It also
avoids and rectifies the output distribution to be scattered in the
non-negative real number space, making it more compatible with batch
normalization (BN) and less sensitive to initialization. In experiments, we
evaluated SRS on deep networks applied to a variety of tasks, including image
classification, machine translation and generative modelling. Our SRS matches
or exceeds models with ReLU and other state-of-the-art nonlinearities, showing
that the proposed activation function is generalized and can achieve high
performance across tasks. Ablation study further verified the compatibility
with BN and self-adaptability for different initialization.

requires very shallow networks to produce superior recognition results. Results
suggest that relevance feedback, which enables Sloop's high-recall performance
may also be essential for deep learning approaches to individual identification
to deliver comparable results.

Title: Fast Lidar Clustering by Density and Connectivity
Authors: Frederik Hasecke and Lukas Hahn and Anton Kummert
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: 6 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IV 2020
\\
  Lidar sensors are widely used in various applications, ranging from
scientific fields over industrial use to integration in consumer products. With
an ever growing number of different driver assistance systems, they have been
introduced to automotive series production in recent years and are considered
an important building block for the practical realisation of autonomous
driving. However, due to the potentially large amount of Lidar points per scan,
tailored algorithms are required to identify objects (e.g. pedestrians or
vehicles) with high precision in a very short time. In this work, we propose an
algorithmic approach for real-time instance segmentation of Lidar sensor data.
We show how our method leverages the properties of the Euclidean distance to
retain three-dimensional measurement information, while being narrowed down to
a two-dimensional representation for fast computation. We further introduce
what we call skip connections, to make our approach robust against
over-segmentation and improve assignment in cases of partial occlusion. Through
detailed evaluation on public data and comparison with established methods, we
show how these aspects enable state-of-the-art performance and runtime on a
single CPU core.

Title: Rethinking Fully Convolutional Networks for the Analysis of
  Photoluminescence Wafer Images
Authors: Maike Lorena Stern, Hans Lindberg, Klaus Meyer-Wegener
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  The manufacturing of light-emitting diodes is a complex
semiconductor-manufacturing process, interspersed with different measurements.
Among the employed measurements, photoluminescence imaging has several
advantages, namely being a non-destructive, fast and thus cost-effective
measurement. On a photoluminescence measurement image of an LED wafer, every
pixel corresponds to an LED chip's brightness after photo-excitation, revealing
chip performance information. However, generating a chip-fine defect map of the
LED wafer, based on photoluminescence images, proves challenging for multiple
reasons: on the one hand, the measured brightness values vary from image to
image, in addition to local spots of differing brightness. On the other hand,
certain defect structures may assume multiple shapes, sizes and brightness
gradients, where salient brightness values may correspond to defective LED
chips, measurement artefacts or non-defective structures. In this work, we
revisit the creation of chip-fine defect maps using fully convolutional
networks and show that the problem of segmenting objects at multiple scales can
be improved by the incorporation of densely connected convolutional blocks and
atrous spatial pyramid pooling modules. We also share implementation details
and our experiences with training networks with small datasets of measurement
images. The proposed architecture significantly improves the segmentation
accuracy of highly variable defect structures over our previous version.

detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors collect 3D point clouds that precisely
record the external surfaces of objects and scenes. The tools for 3D point

number of researchers have recognized the importance and significance of LiDAR
in autonomous driving and have proposed processing and learning algorithms to
exploit 3D point clouds. We review the recent progress in this research area

autonomous vehicles. We also offer perspectives on open issues that are needed

\\
  High-quality 3D reconstructions from endoscopy video play an important role
in many clinical applications, including surgical navigation where they enable
direct video-CT registration. While many methods exist for general multi-view
3D reconstruction, these methods often fail to deliver satisfactory performance
on endoscopic video. Part of the reason is that local descriptors that
establish pair-wise point correspondences, and thus drive reconstruction,
struggle when confronted with the texture-scarce surface of anatomy.
Learning-based dense descriptors usually have larger receptive fields enabling
the encoding of global information, which can be used to disambiguate matches.
In this work, we present an effective self-supervised training scheme and novel
loss design for dense descriptor learning. In direct comparison to recent local
and dense descriptors on an in-house sinus endoscopy dataset, we demonstrate
that our proposed dense descriptor can generalize to unseen patients and
scopes, thereby largely improving the performance of Structure from Motion
(SfM) in terms of model density and completeness. We also evaluate our method
on a public dense optical flow dataset and a small-scale SfM public dataset to
further demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. The source

Title: Matching Neuromorphic Events and Color Images via Adversarial Learning
Authors: Fang Xu, Shijie Lin, Wen Yang, Lei Yu, Dengxin Dai, Gui-song Xia
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  The event camera has appealing properties: high dynamic range, low latency,
low power consumption and low memory usage, and thus provides complementariness
to conventional frame-based cameras. It only captures the dynamics of a scene
and is able to capture almost "continuous" motion. However, different from
frame-based camera that reflects the whole appearance as scenes are, the event
camera casts away the detailed characteristics of objects, such as texture and
color. To take advantages of both modalities, the event camera and frame-based
camera are combined together for various machine vision tasks. Then the
cross-modal matching between neuromorphic events and color images plays a vital
and essential role. In this paper, we propose the Event-Based Image Retrieval
(EBIR) problem to exploit the cross-modal matching task. Given an event stream
depicting a particular object as query, the aim is to retrieve color images
containing the same object. This problem is challenging because there exists a
large modality gap between neuromorphic events and color images. We address the
EBIR problem by proposing neuromorphic Events-Color image Feature Learning
(ECFL). Particularly, the adversarial learning is employed to jointly model
neuromorphic events and color images into a common embedding space. We also
contribute to the community N-UKbench and EC180 dataset to promote the
development of EBIR problem. Extensive experiments on our datasets show that
the proposed method is superior in learning effective modality-invariant
representation to link two different modalities.

Title: A Novel Recurrent Encoder-Decoder Structure for Large-Scale Multi-view
  Stereo Reconstruction from An Open Aerial Dataset
Authors: Jin Liu and Shunping Ji
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  A great deal of research has demonstrated recently that multi-view stereo
(MVS) matching can be solved with deep learning methods. However, these efforts
were focused on close-range objects and only a very few of the deep
learning-based methods were specifically designed for large-scale 3D urban
reconstruction due to the lack of multi-view aerial image benchmarks. In this
paper, we present a synthetic aerial dataset, called the WHU dataset, we
created for MVS tasks, which, to our knowledge, is the first large-scale
multi-view aerial dataset. It was generated from a highly accurate 3D digital
surface model produced from thousands of real aerial images with precise camera
parameters. We also introduce in this paper a novel network, called RED-Net,
for wide-range depth inference, which we developed from a recurrent
encoder-decoder structure to regularize cost maps across depths and a 2D fully
convolutional network as framework. RED-Net's low memory requirements and high
performance make it suitable for large-scale and highly accurate 3D Earth
surface reconstruction. Our experiments confirmed that not only did our method
exceed the current state-of-the-art MVS methods by more than 50% mean absolute
error (MAE) with less memory and computational cost, but its efficiency as
well. It outperformed one of the best commercial software programs based on
conventional methods, improving their efficiency 16 times over. Moreover, we
proved that our RED-Net model pre-trained on the synthetic WHU dataset can be
efficiently transferred to very different multi-view aerial image datasets
without any fine-tuning. Dataset are available at http://gpcv.whu.edu.cn/data.

such as head pose, can still be recovered. Extensive experimental validation on
synthetic and real human-face image datasets performed under 3 threat scenarios
confirms the ability of the proposed network to preserve head pose of the input
image, mask the input identity, and synthesize a good-quality realistic face
image of a desired identity. We also show that our network can be used to
perform pose-preserving identity morphing and identity-preserving pose
morphing. The proposed method improves over a recent state-of-the-art method in
terms of quantitative metrics as well as synthesized image quality.

Title: Global Context-Aware Progressive Aggregation Network for Salient Object
  Detection
Authors: Zuyao Chen, Qianqian Xu, Runmin Cong, Qingming Huang
Categories: cs.CV
Journal-ref: AAAI 2020
\\
  Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved competitive performance in
salient object detection, in which how to learn effective and comprehensive
features plays a critical role. Most of the previous works mainly adopted
multiple level feature integration yet ignored the gap between different
features. Besides, there also exists a dilution process of high-level features
as they passed on the top-down pathway. To remedy these issues, we propose a
novel network named GCPANet to effectively integrate low-level appearance
features, high-level semantic features, and global context features through
some progressive context-aware Feature Interweaved Aggregation (FIA) modules
and generate the saliency map in a supervised way. Moreover, a Head Attention
(HA) module is used to reduce information redundancy and enhance the top layers
features by leveraging the spatial and channel-wise attention, and the Self
Refinement (SR) module is utilized to further refine and heighten the input
features. Furthermore, we design the Global Context Flow (GCF) module to
generate the global context information at different stages, which aims to
learn the relationship among different salient regions and alleviate the
dilution effect of high-level features. Experimental results on six benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Title: SketchGCN: Semantic Sketch Segmentation with Graph Convolutional
  Networks
Authors: Lumin Yang, Jiajie Zhuang, Hongbo Fu, Kun Zhou and Youyi Zheng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We introduce SketchGCN, a graph convolutional neural network for semantic
segmentation and labeling of free-hand sketches. We treat an input sketch as a
2D pointset, and encode the stroke structure information into graph node/edge
representations. To predict the per-point labels, our SketchGCN uses graph
convolution and a global-local branching network architecture to extract both
intra-stroke and inter-stroke features. SketchGCN significantly improves the
accuracy of the state-of-the-art methods for semantic sketch segmentation (by
11.4% in the pixel-basedmetric and 18.2% in the component-based metric over a
large-scale challenging SPG dataset) and has magnitudes fewer parameters than
both image-based and sequence-based methods.

Title: Deep Image Spatial Transformation for Person Image Generation
Authors: Yurui Ren, Xiaoming Yu, Junming Chen, Thomas H. Li, Ge Li
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Pose-guided person image generation is to transform a source person image to
a target pose. This task requires spatial manipulations of source data.
However, Convolutional Neural Networks are limited by lacking the ability to
spatially transform the inputs. In this paper, we propose a differentiable
global-flow local-attention framework to reassemble the inputs at the feature
level. Specifically, our model first calculates the global correlations between
sources and targets to predict flow fields. Then, the flowed local patch pairs
are extracted from the feature maps to calculate the local attention
coefficients. Finally, we warp the source features using a content-aware
sampling method with the obtained local attention coefficients. The results of
both subjective and objective experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
model. Besides, additional results in video animation and view synthesis show
that our model is applicable to other tasks requiring spatial transformation.

Title: Relational Deep Feature Learning for Heterogeneous Face Recognition
Authors: MyeongAh Cho, Taeoh Kim, Ig-Jae Kim, and Sangyoun Lee
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) is a task that matches faces across two
different domains such as VIS (visible light), NIR (near-infrared), or the
sketch domain. In contrast to face recognition in visual spectrum, because of
the domain discrepancy, this task requires to extract domain-invariant feature
or common space projection learning. To bridge this domain gap, we propose a
graph-structured module that focuses on facial relational information to reduce
the fundamental differences in domain characteristics. Since relational
information is domain independent, our Relational Graph Module (RGM) performs
relation modeling from node vectors that represent facial components such as
lips, nose, and chin. Propagation of the generated relational graph then
reduces the domain difference by transitioning from spatially correlated CNN
(convolutional neural network) features to inter-dependent relational features.
In addition, we propose a Node Attention Unit (NAU) that performs node-wise
recalibration to focus on the more informative nodes arising from the
relation-based propagation. Furthermore, we suggest a novel conditional-margin
loss function (C-Softmax) for efficient projection learning on the common
latent space of the embedding vector. Our module can be plugged into any
pre-trained face recognition network to help overcome the limitations of a
small HFR database.
  The proposed method shows superior performance on three different HFR
databases CAISA NIR-VIS 2.0, IIIT-D Sketch, and BUAA-VisNir in various
pre-trained networks. Furthermore, we explore our C-Softmax loss boosts HFR
performance and also apply our loss to the large-scale visual face database
LFW(Labeled Faces in Wild) by learning inter-class margins adaptively.

  An estimated 60% of smartphones sold in 2018 were equipped with multiple rear
cameras, enabling a wide variety of 3D-enabled applications such as 3D Photos.
The success of 3D Photo platforms (Facebook 3D Photo, Holopix, etc) depend on a
steady influx of user generated content. These platforms must provide simple
image manipulation tools to facilitate content creation, akin to traditional
photo platforms. Artistic neural style transfer, propelled by recent
advancements in GPU technology, is one such tool for enhancing traditional
photos. However, naively extrapolating single-view neural style transfer to the
multi-view scenario produces visually inconsistent results and is prohibitively
slow on mobile devices. We present a GPU-accelerated multi-view style transfer
pipeline which enforces style consistency between views with on-demand
performance on mobile platforms. Our pipeline is modular and creates high
quality depth and parallax effects from a stereoscopic image pair.

Title: Unbiased Mean Teacher for Cross Domain Object Detection
Authors: Jinhong Deng, Wen Li, Yuhua Chen, Lixin Duan
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 4 figures, 4 tables
\\
  Cross domain object detection is challenging, because object detection model
is often vulnerable to data variance, especially to the considerable domain
shift in cross domain scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new approach
called Unbiased Mean Teacher (UMT) for cross domain object detection. While the
simple mean teacher (MT) model exhibits good robustness to small data variance,
it can also become easily biased in cross domain scenarios. We thus improve it
with several simple yet highly effective strategies. In particular, we firstly
propose a novel cross domain distillation for MT to maximally exploit the
expertise of the teacher model. Then, we further alleviate the bias in the
student model by augmenting training samples with pixel-level adaptation. The
feature level adversarial training is also incorporated to learn
domain-invariant representation. Those strategies can be implemented easily
into MT and leads to our unbiased MT model. Our model surpasses the existing
state-of-the-art models in large margins on benchmark datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

\\
  In the past decade, there has been substantial progress at training
increasingly deep neural networks. Recent advances within the teacher--student
training paradigm have established that information about past training updates
show promise as a source of guidance during subsequent training steps. Based on
this notion, in this paper, we propose Long Short-Term Sample Distillation, a
novel training policy that simultaneously leverages multiple phases of the
previous training process to guide the later training updates to a neural
network, while efficiently proceeding in just one single generation pass. With
Long Short-Term Sample Distillation, the supervision signal for each sample is
decomposed into two parts: a long-term signal and a short-term one. The
long-term teacher draws on snapshots from several epochs ago in order to
provide steadfast guidance and to guarantee teacher--student differences, while
the short-term one yields more up-to-date cues with the goal of enabling
higher-quality updates. Moreover, the teachers for each sample are unique, such
that, overall, the model learns from a very diverse set of teachers.
Comprehensive experimental results across a range of vision and NLP tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of this new training method.

Title: Learning Depth via Interaction
Authors: Antonio Loquercio, Alexey Dosovitskiy and Davide Scaramuzza
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Motivated by the astonishing capabilities of natural intelligent agents and
inspired by theories from psychology, this paper explores the idea that
perception gets coupled to 3D properties of the world via interaction with the
environment. Existing works for depth estimation require either massive amounts
of annotated training data or some form of hard-coded geometrical constraint.
This paper explores a new approach to learning depth perception requiring
neither of those. Specifically, we train a specialized global-local network
architecture with what would be available to a robot interacting with the
environment: from extremely sparse depth measurements down to even a single
pixel per image. From a pair of consecutive images, our proposed network
outputs a latent representation of the observer's motion between the images and
a dense depth map. Experiments on several datasets show that, when ground truth
is available even for just one of the image pixels, the proposed network can
learn monocular dense depth estimation up to 22.5% more accurately than
state-of-the-art approaches. We believe that this work, despite its scientific
interest, lays the foundations to learn depth from extremely sparse
supervision, which can be valuable to all robotic systems acting under severe
bandwidth or sensing constraints.

Title: Unsupervised Learning of Depth, Optical Flow and Pose with Occlusion

\\
  In autonomous driving, monocular sequences contain lots of information.
Monocular depth estimation, camera ego-motion estimation and optical flow
estimation in consecutive frames are high-profile concerns recently. By
analyzing tasks above, pixels in the first frame are modeled into three parts:
the rigid region, the non-rigid region, and the occluded region. In joint
unsupervised training of depth and pose, we can segment the occluded region
explicitly. The occlusion information is used in unsupervised learning of
depth, pose and optical flow, as the image reconstructed by depth, pose and
flow will be invalid in occluded regions. A less-than-mean mask is designed to
further exclude the mismatched pixels which are interfered with motion or
illumination change in the training of depth and pose networks. This method is
also used to exclude some trivial mismatched pixels in the training of the flow
net. Maximum normalization is proposed for smoothness term of depth-pose
networks to restrain degradation in textureless regions. In the occluded
region, as depth and camera motion can provide more reliable motion estimation,
they can be used to instruct unsupervised learning of flow. Our experiments in
KITTI dataset demonstrate that the model based on three regions, full and
explicit segmentation of occlusion, rigid region and non-rigid region with
corresponding unsupervised losses can improve performance on three tasks
significantly.

  Identity recognition in a car cabin is a critical task nowadays and offers a
great field of applications ranging from personalizing intelligent cars to suit
drivers physical and behavioral needs to increasing safety and security.
However, the performance and applicability of published approaches are still
not suitable for use in series cars and need to be improved. In this paper, we
investigate Human Identity Recognition in a car cabin with Time Series
Classification (TSC) and deep neural networks. We use gas and brake pedal
pressure as input to our models. This data is easily collectable during driving
in everyday situations. Since our classifiers have very little memory
requirements and do not require any input data preproccesing, we were able to
train on one Intel i5-3210M processor only. Our classification approach is
based on a combination of LSTM and ResNet. The network trained on a subset of
NUDrive outperforms the ResNet and LSTM models trained solely by 35.9 % and
53.85 % accuracy respectively. We reach a final accuracy of 79.49 % on a
10-drivers subset of NUDrive and 96.90 % on a 5-drivers subset of UTDrive.

Title: Preventing Clean Label Poisoning using Gaussian Mixture Loss
Authors: Muhammad Yaseen, Muneeb Aadil, Maria Sargsyan
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Preliminary v1
\\
  Since 2014 when Szegedy et al. showed that carefully designed perturbations
of the input can lead Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to wrongly classify its
label, there has been an ongoing research to make DNNs more robust to such
malicious perturbations. In this work, we consider a poisoning attack called
Clean Labeling poisoning attack (CLPA). The goal of CLPA is to inject seemingly
benign instances which can drastically change decision boundary of the DNNs due
to which subsequent queries at test time can be mis-classified. We argue that a
strong defense against CLPA can be embedded into the model during the training
by imposing features of the network to follow a Large Margin Gaussian Mixture
distribution in the penultimate layer. By having such a prior knowledge, we can
systematically evaluate how unusual the example is, given the label it is
claiming to be. We demonstrate our builtin defense via experiments on MNIST and
CIFAR datasets. We train two models on each dataset: one trained via softmax,
another via LGM. We show that using LGM can substantially reduce the
effectiveness of CLPA while having no additional overhead of data sanitization.
The code to reproduce our results is available online.

Authors: Przemys{\l}aw Spurek, Sebastian Winczowski, Jacek Tabor, Maciej
  Zamorski, Maciej Zi\k{e}ba, Tomasz Trzci\'nski
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this work, we propose a novel method for generating 3D point clouds that
leverage properties of hyper networks. Contrary to the existing methods that
learn only the representation of a 3D object, our approach simultaneously finds
a representation of the object and its 3D surface. The main idea of our
HyperCloud method is to build a hyper network that returns weights of a
particular neural network (target network) trained to map points from a uniform
unit ball distribution into a 3D shape. As a consequence, a particular 3D shape
can be generated using point-by-point sampling from the assumed prior
distribution and transforming sampled points with the target network. Since the
hyper network is based on an auto-encoder architecture trained to reconstruct
realistic 3D shapes, the target network weights can be considered a
parametrization of the surface of a 3D shape, and not a standard representation
of point cloud usually returned by competitive approaches. The proposed
architecture allows finding mesh-based representation of 3D objects in a
generative manner while providing point clouds en pair in quality with the
state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Task Augmentation by Rotating for Meta-Learning
Authors: Jialin Liu, Fei Chao, Chih-Min Lin
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  Data augmentation is one of the most effective approaches for improving the
accuracy of modern machine learning models, and it is also indispensable to
train a deep model for meta-learning. In this paper, we introduce a task
augmentation method by rotating, which increases the number of classes by
rotating the original images 90, 180 and 270 degrees, different from
traditional augmentation methods which increase the number of images. With a
larger amount of classes, we can sample more diverse task instances during
training. Therefore, task augmentation by rotating allows us to train a deep
network by meta-learning methods with little over-fitting. Experimental results
show that our approach is better than the rotation for increasing the number of
images and achieves state-of-the-art performance on miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and
FC100 few-shot learning benchmarks. The code is available on

  In recent years we have seen an upsurge in terror attacks around the world.
Such attacks usually happen in public places with large crowds to cause the
most damage possible and get the most attention. Even though surveillance
cameras are assumed to be a powerful tool, their effect in preventing crime is
far from clear due to either limitation in the ability of humans to vigilantly
monitor video surveillance or for the simple reason that they are operating
passively. In this paper, we present a weapon detection system based on an
ensemble of semantic Convolutional Neural Networks that decomposes the problem
of detecting and locating a weapon into a set of smaller problems concerned
with the individual component parts of a weapon. This approach has
computational and practical advantages: a set of simpler neural networks
dedicated to specific tasks requires less computational resources and can be
trained in parallel; the overall output of the system given by the aggregation
of the outputs of individual networks can be tuned by a user to trade-off false
positives and false negatives; finally, according to ensemble theory, the
output of the overall system will be robust and reliable even in the presence
of weak individual models. We evaluated our system running simulations aimed at
assessing the accuracy of individual networks and the whole system. The results
on synthetic data and real-world data are promising, and they suggest that our
approach may have advantages compared to the monolithic approach based on a

\\
  Classical person re-identification approaches assume that a person of
interest has appeared across different cameras and can be queried by one of the
existing images. However, in real-world surveillance scenarios, frequently no
visual information will be available about the queried person. In such
scenarios, a natural language description of the person by a witness will
provide the only source of information for retrieval. In this work, person
re-identification using both vision and language information is addressed under
all possible gallery and query scenarios. A two stream deep convolutional
neural network framework supervised by cross entropy loss is presented. The
weights connecting the second last layer to the last layer with class
probabilities, i.e., logits of softmax layer are shared in both networks.
Canonical Correlation Analysis is performed to enhance the correlation between
the two modalities in a joint latent embedding space. To investigate the
benefits of the proposed approach, a new testing protocol under a multi modal
ReID setting is proposed for the test split of the CUHK-PEDES and CUHK-SYSU
benchmarks. The experimental results verify the merits of the proposed system.
The learnt visual representations are more robust and perform 22\% better
during retrieval as compared to a single modality system. The retrieval with a
multi modal query greatly enhances the re-identification capability of the
system quantitatively as well as qualitatively.

Title: Vision based body gesture meta features for Affective Computing
Authors: Indigo J. D. Orton
Categories: cs.CV cs.HC
Comments: MPhil thesis; 74 pages
\\
  Early detection of psychological distress is key to effective treatment.
Automatic detection of distress, such as depression, is an active area of
research. Current approaches utilise vocal, facial, and bodily modalities. Of
these, the bodily modality is the least investigated, partially due to the
difficulty in extracting bodily representations from videos, and partially due
to the lack of viable datasets. Existing body modality approaches use automatic
categorization of expressions to represent body language as a series of
specific expressions, much like words within natural language. In this
dissertation I present a new type of feature, within the body modality, that
represents meta information of gestures, such as speed, and use it to predict a
non-clinical depression label. This differs to existing work by representing
overall behaviour as a small set of aggregated meta features derived from a
person's movement. In my method I extract pose estimation from videos, detect
gestures within body parts, extract meta information from individual gestures,
and finally aggregate these features to generate a small feature vector for use
in prediction tasks. I introduce a new dataset of 65 video recordings of
interviews with self-evaluated distress, personality, and demographic labels.
This dataset enables the development of features utilising the whole body in
distress detection tasks. I evaluate my newly introduced meta-features for
predicting depression, anxiety, perceived stress, somatic stress, five standard
personality measures, and gender. A linear regression based classifier using
these features achieves a 82.70% F1 score for predicting depression within my
novel dataset.

Title: Medicine Strip Identification using 2-D Cepstral Feature Extraction and
  Multiclass Classification Methods

\\
  Misclassification of medicine is perilous to the health of a patient, more so
if the said patient is visually impaired or simply did not recognize the color,
shape or type of medicine strip. This paper proposes a method for
identification of medicine strips by 2-D cepstral analysis of their images
followed by performing classification that has been done using the K-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR)
Classifiers. The 2-D cepstral features extracted are extremely distinct to a
medicine strip and consequently make identifying them exceptionally accurate.
This paper also proposes the Color Gradient and Pill shape Feature (CGPF)
extraction procedure and discusses the Binary Robust Invariant Scalable
Keypoints (BRISK) algorithm as well. The mentioned algorithms were implemented
and their identification results have been compared.

Title: Deepfakes for Medical Video De-Identification: Privacy Protection and
  Diagnostic Information Preservation
Authors: Bingquan Zhu, Hao Fang, Yanan Sui, Luming Li
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI

  Intelligence, Ethics, and Society (AIES) 2020

\\
  Data sharing for medical research has been difficult as open-sourcing
clinical data may violate patient privacy. Traditional methods for face
de-identification wipe out facial information entirely, making it impossible to
analyze facial behavior. Recent advancements on whole-body keypoints detection
also rely on facial input to estimate body keypoints. Both facial and body
keypoints are critical in some medical diagnoses, and keypoints invariability
after de-identification is of great importance. Here, we propose a solution
using deepfake technology, the face swapping technique. While this swapping
method has been criticized for invading privacy and portraiture right, it could
conversely protect privacy in medical video: patients' faces could be swapped
to a proper target face and become unrecognizable. However, it remained an open
question that to what extent the swapping de-identification method could affect
the automatic detection of body keypoints. In this study, we apply deepfake
technology to Parkinson's disease examination videos to de-identify subjects,
and quantitatively show that: face-swapping as a de-identification approach is
reliable, and it keeps the keypoints almost invariant, significantly better
than traditional methods. This study proposes a pipeline for video
de-identification and keypoint preservation, clearing up some ethical
restrictions for medical data sharing. This work could make open-source high
quality medical video datasets more feasible and promote future medical
research that benefits our society.

Title: Recognizing Handwritten Mathematical Expressions as LaTex Sequences
  Using a Multiscale Robust Neural Network
Authors: Hongyu Wang, Guangcun Shan
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: 6 figures, 5 tables, 20 pages
\\
  In this paper, a robust multiscale neural network is proposed to recognize
handwritten mathematical expressions and output LaTeX sequences, which can
effectively and correctly focus on where each step of output should be
concerned and has a positive effect on analyzing the two-dimensional structure
of handwritten mathematical expressions and identifying different mathematical
symbols in a long expression. With the addition of visualization, the model's
recognition process is shown in detail. In addition, our model achieved 49.459%
and 46.062% ExpRate on the public CROHME 2014 and CROHME 2016 datasets. The
present model results suggest that the state-of-the-art model has better
robustness, fewer errors, and higher accuracy.

Title: MADAN: Multi-source Adversarial Domain Aggregation Network for Domain
  Adaptation
Authors: Sicheng Zhao, Bo Li, Xiangyu Yue, Pengfei Xu, Kurt Keutzer
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Extension of our previous NeurIPS 2019 paper arXiv:1910.12181 on
  multi-source domain adaptation
\\
  Domain adaptation aims to learn a transferable model to bridge the domain
shift between one labeled source domain and another sparsely labeled or
unlabeled target domain. Since the labeled data may be collected from multiple
sources, multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) has attracted increasing
attention. Recent MDA methods do not consider the pixel-level alignment between
sources and target or the misalignment across different sources. In this paper,
we propose a novel MDA framework to address these challenges. Specifically, we
design an end-to-end Multi-source Adversarial Domain Aggregation Network
(MADAN). First, an adapted domain is generated for each source with dynamic
semantic consistency while aligning towards the target at the pixel-level
cycle-consistently. Second, sub-domain aggregation discriminator and
cross-domain cycle discriminator are proposed to make different adapted domains
more closely aggregated. Finally, feature-level alignment is performed between
the aggregated domain and the target domain while training the task network.
For the segmentation adaptation, we further enforce category-level alignment
and incorporate context-aware generation, which constitutes MADAN+. We conduct
extensive MDA experiments on digit recognition, object classification, and
simulation-to-real semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate that the
proposed MADAN and MANDA+ models outperform state-of-the-art approaches by a
large margin.

  Breast cancer has the highest mortality among cancers in women.
Computer-aided pathology to analyze microscopic histopathology images for
diagnosis with an increasing number of breast cancer patients can bring the
cost and delays of diagnosis down. Deep learning in histopathology has
attracted attention over the last decade of achieving state-of-the-art
performance in classification and localization tasks. The convolutional neural
network, a deep learning framework, provides remarkable results in tissue
images analysis, but lacks in providing interpretation and reasoning behind the
decisions. We aim to provide a better interpretation of classification results
by providing localization on microscopic histopathology images. We frame the
image classification problem as weakly supervised multiple instance learning
problem where an image is collection of patches i.e. instances. Attention-based
multiple instance learning (A-MIL) learns attention on the patches from the
image to localize the malignant and normal regions in an image and use them to
classify the image. We present classification and localization results on two
publicly available BreakHIS and BACH dataset. The classification and
visualization results are compared with other recent techniques. The proposed
method achieves better localization results without compromising classification
accuracy.

\\
  Unsupervised text encoding models have recently fueled substantial progress
in NLP. The key idea is to use neural networks to convert words in texts to
vector space representations based on word positions in a sentence and their
contexts, which are suitable for end-to-end training of downstream tasks. We
see a strikingly similar situation in spatial analysis, which focuses on
incorporating both absolute positions and spatial contexts of geographic
objects such as POIs into models. A general-purpose representation model for
space is valuable for a multitude of tasks. However, no such general model
exists to date beyond simply applying discretization or feed-forward nets to
coordinates, and little effort has been put into jointly modeling distributions
with vastly different characteristics, which commonly emerges from GIS data.
Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning Neuroscience research shows that grid cells in
mammals provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a
metric for location encoding and is critical for recognizing places and for
path-integration. Therefore, we propose a representation learning model called
Space2Vec to encode the absolute positions and spatial relationships of places.
We conduct experiments on two real-world geographic data for two different
tasks: 1) predicting types of POIs given their positions and context, 2) image
classification leveraging their geo-locations. Results show that because of its
multi-scale representations, Space2Vec outperforms well-established ML
approaches such as RBF kernels, multi-layer feed-forward nets, and tile
embedding approaches for location modeling and image classification tasks.
Detailed analysis shows that all baselines can at most well handle distribution
at one scale but show poor performances in other scales. In contrast,
Space2Vec's multi-scale representation can handle distributions at different
scales.

Title: SIP-SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Network for Joint
  Semantic Segmentation and Extraction of Sclera, Iris and Pupil based on
  Periocular Region Suppression
Authors: Bilal Hassan, Ramsha Ahmed, Taimur Hassan, and Naoufel Werghi
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  The current developments in the field of machine vision have opened new
vistas towards deploying multimodal biometric recognition systems in various
real-world applications. These systems have the ability to deal with the
limitations of unimodal biometric systems which are vulnerable to spoofing,
noise, non-universality and intra-class variations. In addition, the ocular
traits among various biometric traits are preferably used in these recognition
systems. Such systems possess high distinctiveness, permanence, and performance
while, technologies based on other biometric traits (fingerprints, voice etc.)
can be easily compromised. This work presents a novel deep learning framework
called SIP-SegNet, which performs the joint semantic segmentation of ocular
traits (sclera, iris and pupil) in unconstrained scenarios with greater
accuracy. The acquired images under these scenarios exhibit purkinje reflexes,
specular reflections, eye gaze, off-angle shots, low resolution, and various
occlusions particularly by eyelids and eyelashes. To address these issues,
SIP-SegNet begins with denoising the pristine image using denoising
convolutional neural network (DnCNN), followed by reflection removal and image
enhancement based on contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE).
Our proposed framework then extracts the periocular information using adaptive
thresholding and employs the fuzzy filtering technique to suppress this
information. Finally, the semantic segmentation of sclera, iris and pupil is
achieved using the densely connected fully convolutional encoder-decoder
network. We used five CASIA datasets to evaluate the performance of SIP-SegNet
based on various evaluation metrics. The simulation results validate the
optimal segmentation of the proposed SIP-SegNet, with the mean f1 scores of
93.35, 95.11 and 96.69 for the sclera, iris and pupil classes respectively.

Title: Realistic River Image Synthesis using Deep Generative Adversarial
  Networks
Authors: Akshat Gautam, Muhammed Sit and Ibrahim Demir
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we investigate an application of image generation for river
satellite imagery. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial network
(GAN) model capable of generating high-resolution and realistic river images
that can be used to support models in surface water estimation, river
meandering, wetland loss and other hydrological research studies. First, we
summarized an augmented, diverse repository of overhead river images to be used
in training. Second, we incorporate the Progressive Growing GAN (PGGAN), a
network architecture that iteratively trains smaller-resolution GANs to
gradually build up to a very high resolution, to generate 256x256 river
satellite imagery. With conventional GAN architectures, difficulties soon arise
in terms of exponential increase of training time and vanishing/exploding
gradient issues, which the PGGAN implementation seems to significantly reduce.
Our preliminary results show great promise in capturing the detail of river
flow and green areas present in river satellite images that can be used for
supporting hydroinformatics studies.

\\
  Machine learning systems have received much attention recently for their
ability to achieve expert-level performance on clinical tasks, particularly in
medical imaging. Here, we examine the extent to which state-of-the-art deep
learning classifiers trained to yield diagnostic labels from X-ray images are
biased with respect to protected attributes. We train convolution neural
networks to predict 14 diagnostic labels in three prominent public chest X-ray
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, Chest-Xray8, and CheXpert. We then evaluate the TPR
disparity - the difference in true positive rates (TPR) and - underdiagnosis
rate - the false positive rate of a non-diagnosis - among different protected
attributes such as patient sex, age, race, and insurance type. We demonstrate
that TPR disparities exist in the state-of-the-art classifiers in all datasets,
for all clinical tasks, and all subgroups. We find that TPR disparities are
most commonly not significantly correlated with a subgroup's proportional
disease burden; further, we find that some subgroups and subsection of the
population are chronically underdiagnosed. Such performance disparities have
real consequences as models move from papers to products, and should be
carefully audited prior to deployment.

Comments: accepted at ESANN 2020

  Neural networks with high performance can still be biased towards
non-relevant features. However, reliability and robustness is especially
important for high-risk fields such as clinical pain treatment. We therefore
propose a verification pipeline, which consists of three steps. First, we
classify facial expressions with a neural network. Next, we apply layer-wise
relevance propagation to create pixel-based explanations. Finally, we quantify
these visual explanations based on a bounding-box method with respect to facial
regions. Although our results show that the neural network achieves
state-of-the-art results, the evaluation of the visual explanations reveals
that relevant facial regions may not be considered.

Title: GSANet: Semantic Segmentation with Global and Selective Attention
Authors: Qingfeng Liu, Mostafa El-Khamy, Dongwoon Bai, Jungwon Lee
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML
\\
  This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture for semantic
segmentation. The proposed Global and Selective Attention Network (GSANet)
features Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) with a novel sparsemax global
attention and a novel selective attention that deploys a condensation and
diffusion mechanism to aggregate the multi-scale contextual information from
the extracted deep features. A selective attention decoder is also proposed to
process the GSA-ASPP outputs for optimizing the softmax volume. We are the
first to benchmark the performance of semantic segmentation networks with the
low-complexity feature extraction network (FXN) MobileNetEdge, that is
optimized for low latency on edge devices. We show that GSANet can result in
more accurate segmentation with MobileNetEdge, as well as with strong FXNs,
such as Xception. GSANet improves the state-of-art semantic segmentation
accuracy on both the ADE20k and the Cityscapes datasets.

Title: Character Segmentation in Asian Collector's Seal Imprints: An Attempt to
  Retrieval Based on Ancient Character Typeface
Authors: Kangying Li, Biligsaikhan Batjargal, Akira Maeda
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Collector's seals provide important clues about the ownership of a book. They
contain much information pertaining to the essential elements of ancient
materials and also show the details of possession, its relation to the book,
the identity of the collectors and their social status and wealth, amongst
others. Asian collectors have typically used artistic ancient characters rather
than modern ones to make their seals. In addition to the owner's name, several
other words are used to express more profound meanings. A system that
automatically recognizes these characters can help enthusiasts and
professionals better understand the background information of these seals.
However, there is a lack of training data and labelled images, as samples of
some seals are scarce and most of them are degraded images. It is necessary to
find new ways to make full use of such scarce data. While these data are
available online, they do not contain information on the characters'position.
The goal of this research is to provide retrieval tools assist in obtaining
more information from Asian collector's seals imprints without consuming a lot
of computational resources. In this paper, a character segmentation method is
proposed to predict the candidate characters'area without any labelled training
data that contain character coordinate information. A retrieval-based
recognition system that focuses on a single character is also proposed to
support seal retrieval and matching. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed character segmentation method performs well on Asian collector's
seals, with 92% of the test data being correctly segmented.

  Emotion recognition in user-generated videos plays an important role in
human-centered computing. Existing methods mainly employ traditional two-stage
shallow pipeline, i.e. extracting visual and/or audio features and training
classifiers. In this paper, we propose to recognize video emotions in an
end-to-end manner based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically,
we develop a deep Visual-Audio Attention Network (VAANet), a novel architecture
that integrates spatial, channel-wise, and temporal attentions into a visual 3D
CNN and temporal attentions into an audio 2D CNN. Further, we design a special
classification loss, i.e. polarity-consistent cross-entropy loss, based on the
polarity-emotion hierarchy constraint to guide the attention generation.
Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging VideoEmotion-8 and Ekman-6
datasets demonstrate that the proposed VAANet outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches for video emotion recognition. Our source code is released at:

  The iris pattern has significantly improved the biometric recognition field
due to its high level of stability and uniqueness. Such physical feature has
played an important role in security and other related areas. However,
presentation attacks, also known as spoofing techniques, can be used to bypass
the biometric system with artifacts such as printed images, artificial eyes,
and textured contact lenses. To improve the security of these systems, many
liveness detection methods have been proposed, and the first Internacional Iris
Liveness Detection competition was launched in 2013 to evaluate their
effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a hyperparameter tuning of the CASIA
algorithm, submitted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the third
competition of Iris Liveness Detection, in 2017. The modifications proposed
promoted an overall improvement, with an 8.48% Attack Presentation
Classification Error Rate (APCER) and 0.18% Bonafide Presentation
Classification Error Rate (BPCER) for the evaluation of the combined datasets.
Other threshold values were evaluated in an attempt to reduce the trade-off
between the APCER and the BPCER on the evaluated datasets and worked out
successfully.

\\
  In this paper we present CALVIS, a method to calculate $\textbf{C}$hest,
w$\textbf{A}$ist and pe$\textbf{LVIS}$ circumference from 3D human body meshes.
Our motivation is to use this data as ground truth for training convolutional
neural networks (CNN). Previous work had used the large scale CAESAR dataset or
determined these anthropometrical measurements $\textit{manually}$ from a
person or human 3D body meshes. Unfortunately, acquiring these data is a cost
and time consuming endeavor. In contrast, our method can be used on 3D meshes
automatically. We synthesize eight human body meshes and apply CALVIS to
calculate chest, waist and pelvis circumference. We evaluate the results
qualitatively and observe that the measurements can indeed be used to estimate
the shape of a person. We then asses the plausibility of our approach by
generating ground truth with CALVIS to train a small CNN. After having trained
the network with our data, we achieve competitive validation error.
Furthermore, we make the implementation of CALVIS publicly available to advance
the field.

Title: Deep Variational Luenberger-type Observer for Stochastic Video
  Prediction
Authors: Dong Wang, Feng Zhou, Zheng Yan, Guang Yao, Zongxuan Liu, Wennan Ma
  and Cewu Lu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Considering the inherent stochasticity and uncertainty, predicting future
video frames is exceptionally challenging. In this work, we study the problem
of video prediction by combining interpretability of stochastic state space
models and representation learning of deep neural networks. Our model builds
upon an variational encoder which transforms the input video into a latent
feature space and a Luenberger-type observer which captures the dynamic
evolution of the latent features. This enables the decomposition of videos into
static features and dynamics in an unsupervised manner. By deriving the
stability theory of the nonlinear Luenberger-type observer, the hidden states
in the feature space become insensitive with respect to the initial values,
which improves the robustness of the overall model. Furthermore, the
variational lower bound on the data log-likelihood can be derived to obtain the
tractable posterior prediction distribution based on the variational principle.
Finally, the experiments such as the Bouncing Balls dataset and the Pendulum
dataset are provided to demonstrate the proposed model outperforms concurrent
works.

detects fish in camera images. The data is sampled from a submerged data
station at Fulehuk in Norway. We implement You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 3

also investigate intermediate results within YOLO, gaining insight into how it
performs object detection.

Title: On Parameter Tuning in Meta-learning for Computer Vision
Authors: Farid Ghareh Mohammadi, M. Hadi Amini, and Hamid R. Arabnia

\\
  Learning to learn plays a pivotal role in meta-learning (MTL) to obtain an
optimal learning model. In this paper, we investigate mage recognition for
unseen categories of a given dataset with limited training information. We
deploy a zero-shot learning (ZSL) algorithm to achieve this goal. We also
explore the effect of parameter tuning on performance of semantic auto-encoder
(SAE). We further address the parameter tuning problem for meta-learning,
especially focusing on zero-shot learning. By combining different embedded
parameters, we improved the accuracy of tuned-SAE. Advantages and disadvantages
of parameter tuning and its application in image classification are also
explored.

Title: FPGA Implementation of Minimum Mean Brightness Error Bi-Histogram
  Equalization
Authors: Abhishek Saroha, Avichal Rakesh, Rajiv Kumar Tripathi
Categories: cs.CV cs.AR eess.IV
\\
  Histogram Equalization (HE) is a popular method for contrast enhancement.
Generally, mean brightness is not conserved in Histogram Equalization.
Initially, Bi-Histogram Equalization (BBHE) was proposed to enhance contrast
while maintaining a the mean brightness. However, when mean brightness is
primary concern, Minimum Mean Brightness Error Bi-Histogram Equalization
(MMBEBHE) is the best technique. There are several implementations of Histogram
Equalization on FPGA, however to our knowledge MMBEBHE has not been implemented
on FPGAs before. Therefore, we present an implementation of MMBEBHE on FPGA.

Title: Learning to Deblur and Generate High Frame Rate Video with an Event
  Camera
Authors: Chen Haoyu, Teng Minggui, Shi Boxin, Wang YIzhou and Huang Tiejun
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Event cameras are bio-inspired cameras which can measure the change of
intensity asynchronously with high temporal resolution. One of the event
cameras' advantages is that they do not suffer from motion blur when recording
high-speed scenes. In this paper, we formulate the deblurring task on
traditional cameras directed by events to be a residual learning one, and we
propose corresponding network architectures for effective learning of
deblurring and high frame rate video generation tasks. We first train a
modified U-Net network to restore a sharp image from a blurry image using
corresponding events. Then we train another similar network with different
downsampling blocks to generate high frame rate video using the restored sharp
image and events. Experiment results show that our method can restore sharper
images and videos than state-of-the-art methods.

\\
  Even though many existing 3D object detection algorithms rely mostly on
camera and LiDAR, camera and LiDAR are prone to be affected by harsh weather
and lighting conditions. On the other hand, radar is resistant to such
conditions. However, research has found only recently to apply deep neural
networks on radar data. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning approach to
3D object detection with radar only. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first ones to demonstrate a deep learning-based 3D object detection model with
radar only that was trained on the public radar dataset. To overcome the lack
of radar labeled data, we propose a novel way of making use of abundant LiDAR
data by transforming it into radar-like point cloud data and aggressive radar
augmentation techniques.

Title: Triangle-Net: Towards Robustness in Point Cloud Classification
Authors: Chenxi Xiao and Juan Wachs
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Submitted to ICIP 2020
\\
  3D object recognition is becoming a key desired capability for many computer
vision systems such as autonomous vehicles, service robots and surveillance
drones to operate more effectively in unstructured environments. These
real-time systems require effective classification methods that are robust to
sampling resolution, measurement noise, and pose configuration of the objects.
Previous research has shown that sparsity, rotation and positional variance of
points can lead to a significant drop in the performance of point cloud based
classification techniques. In this regard, we propose a novel approach for 3D
classification that takes sparse point clouds as input and learns a model that
is robust to rotational and positional variance as well as point sparsity. To
this end, we introduce new feature descriptors which are fed as an input to our
proposed neural network in order to learn a robust latent representation of the
3D object. We show that such latent representations can significantly improve
the performance of object classification and retrieval. Further, we show that
our approach outperforms PointNet and 3DmFV by 34.4% and 27.4% respectively in
classification tasks using sparse point clouds of only 16 points under
arbitrary SO(3) rotation.

Title: Exposing Backdoors in Robust Machine Learning Models
Authors: Ezekiel Soremekun, Sakshi Udeshi, Sudipta Chattopadhyay and Andreas
  Zeller
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The introduction of robust optimisation has pushed the state-of-the-art in
defending against adversarial attacks. However, the behaviour of such
optimisation has not been studied in the light of a fundamentally different
class of attacks called backdoors. In this paper, we demonstrate that
adversarially robust models are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Subsequently,
we observe that backdoors are reflected in the feature representation of such
models. Then, this is leveraged to detect backdoor-infected models.
Specifically, we use feature clustering to effectively detect backdoor-infected
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
  In our evaluation of major classification tasks, our approach effectively
detects robust DNNs infected with backdoors. Our investigation reveals that
salient features of adversarially robust DNNs break the stealthy nature of
backdoor attacks.

Title: Learning Texture Invariant Representation for Domain Adaptation of
  Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Myeongjin Kim, Hyeran Byun
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 2020 CVPR
\\
  Since annotating pixel-level labels for semantic segmentation is laborious,
leveraging synthetic data is an attractive solution. However, due to the domain
gap between synthetic domain and real domain, it is challenging for a model
trained with synthetic data to generalize to real data. In this paper,
considering the fundamental difference between the two domains as the texture,
we propose a method to adapt to the texture of the target domain. First, we
diversity the texture of synthetic images using a style transfer algorithm. The
various textures of generated images prevent a segmentation model from
overfitting to one specific (synthetic) texture. Then, we fine-tune the model
with self-training to get direct supervision of the target texture. Our results
achieve state-of-the-art performance and we analyze the properties of the model
trained on the stylized dataset with extensive experiments.

Title: AlignSeg: Feature-Aligned Segmentation Networks
Authors: Zilong Huang and Yunchao Wei and Xinggang Wang and Honghui Shi and
  Wenyu Liu and Thomas S. Huang
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: In Submission
\\
  Aggregating features in terms of different convolutional blocks or contextual
embeddings has been proven to be an effective way to strengthen feature
representations for semantic segmentation. However, most of the current popular
network architectures tend to ignore the misalignment issues during the feature
aggregation process caused by 1) step-by-step downsampling operations, and 2)
indiscriminate contextual information fusion. In this paper, we explore the
principles in addressing such feature misalignment issues and inventively
propose Feature-Aligned Segmentation Networks (AlignSeg). AlignSeg consists of
two primary modules, i.e., the Aligned Feature Aggregation (AlignFA) module and
the Aligned Context Modeling (AlignCM) module. First, AlignFA adopts a simple
learnable interpolation strategy to learn transformation offsets of pixels,
which can effectively relieve the feature misalignment issue caused by
multiresolution feature aggregation. Second, with the contextual embeddings in
hand, AlignCM enables each pixel to choose private custom contextual
information in an adaptive manner, making the contextual embeddings aligned
better to provide appropriate guidance. We validate the effectiveness of our
AlignSeg network with extensive experiments on Cityscapes and ADE20K, achieving
new state-of-the-art mIoU scores of 82.6% and 45.95%, respectively. Our source
code will be made available.

Title: Few-shot Learning with Weakly-supervised Object Localization

\\
  Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to learn novel visual categories from very few
samples, which is a challenging problem in real-world applications. Many data
generation methods have improved the performance of FSL models, but require
lots of annotated images to train a specialized network (e.g., GAN) dedicated
to hallucinate new samples. We argue that localization is a more efficient
approach because it provides the most discriminative regions without using
extra samples. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address the FSL task
by achieving weakly-supervised object localization within performing few-shot
classification. To this end, we design (i) a triplet-input module to obtain the
initial object seeds and (ii) an Image-To-Class-Distance (ITCD) based localizer
to activate the deep descriptors of the key objects, thus obtaining the more
discriminative representations used to perform few-shot classification.
Extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
on benchmark datasets under various settings. Besides, our method achieves
superior performance over previous methods when training the model on
miniImageNet and evaluating it on the different datasets (e.g., Stanford Dogs),
demonstrating its superior generalization capacity. Extra visualization shows
the proposed method can localize the key objects accurately.

Title: Predicting TUG score from gait characteristics based on video analysis
  and machine learning
Authors: Jian Ma
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV q-bio.QM stat.ML
\\
  Fall is a leading cause of death which suffers the elderly and society. Timed
Up and Go (TUG) test is a common tool for fall risk assessment. In this paper,
we propose a method for predicting TUG score from gait characteristics
extracted from video based on computer vision and machine learning
technologies. First, 3D pose is estimated from video captured with 2D and 3D
cameras during human motion and then a group of gait characteristics are
computed from 3D pose series. After that, copula entropy is used to select
those characteristics which are mostly associated with TUG score. Finally, the
selected characteristics are fed into the predictive models to predict TUG
score. Experiments on real world data demonstrated the effectiveness of the
proposed method. As a byproduct, the associations between TUG score and several
gait characteristics are discovered, which laid the scientific foundation of
the proposed method and make the predictive models such built interpretable to
clinical users.

Title: A Multi-view Perspective of Self-supervised Learning
Authors: Chuanxing Geng, Zhenghao Tan, Songcan Chen
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  As a newly emerging unsupervised learning paradigm, self-supervised learning
(SSL) recently gained widespread attention, which usually introduces a pretext
task without manual annotation of data. With its help, SSL effectively learns
the feature representation beneficial for downstream tasks. Thus the pretext
task plays a key role. However, the study of its design, especially its essence
currently is still open. In this paper, we borrow a multi-view perspective to
decouple a class of popular pretext tasks into a combination of view data
augmentation (VDA) and view label classification (VLC), where we attempt to
explore the essence of such pretext task while providing some insights into its
design. Specifically, a simple multi-view learning framework is specially
designed (SSL-MV), which assists the feature learning of downstream tasks
(original view) through the same tasks on the augmented views. SSL-MV focuses
on VDA while abandons VLC, empirically uncovering that it is VDA rather than
generally considered VLC that dominates the performance of such SSL.
Additionally, thanks to replacing VLC with VDA tasks, SSL-MV also enables an
integrated inference combining the predictions from the augmented views,
further improving the performance. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
demonstrate its advantages.

Title: Estimating a Null Model of Scientific Image Reuse to Support Research
  Integrity Investigations
Authors: Daniel E. Acuna and Ziyue Xiang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  When there is a suspicious figure reuse case in science, research integrity
investigators often find it difficult to rebut authors claiming that "it
happened by chance". In other words, when there is a "collision" of image
features, it is difficult to justify whether it appears rarely or not. In this
article, we provide a method to predict the rarity of an image feature by
statistically estimating the chance of it randomly occurring across all
scientific imagery. Our method is based on high-dimensional density estimation
of ORB features using 7+ million images in the PubMed Open Access Subset
dataset. We show that this method can lead to meaningful feedback during
research integrity investigations by providing a null hypothesis for scientific
image reuse and thus a p-value during deliberations. We apply the model to a
sample of increasingly complex imagery and confirm that it produces
decreasingly smaller p-values as expected. We discuss applications to research
integrity investigations as well as future work.

\\
  Many state-of-the-art technologies developed in recent years have been
influenced by machine learning to some extent. Most popular at the time of this
writing are artificial intelligence methodologies that fall under the umbrella
of deep learning. Deep learning has been shown across many applications to be
extremely powerful and capable of handling problems that possess great
complexity and difficulty. In this work, we introduce a new layer to deep
learning: the fuzzy layer. Traditionally, the network architecture of neural
networks is composed of an input layer, some combination of hidden layers, and
an output layer. We propose the introduction of fuzzy layers into the deep
learning architecture to exploit the powerful aggregation properties expressed
through fuzzy methodologies, such as the Choquet and Sugueno fuzzy integrals.
To date, fuzzy approaches taken to deep learning have been through the
application of various fusion strategies at the decision level to aggregate
outputs from state-of-the-art pre-trained models, e.g., AlexNet, VGG16,
GoogLeNet, Inception-v3, ResNet-18, etc. While these strategies have been shown
to improve accuracy performance for image classification tasks, none have
explored the use of fuzzified intermediate, or hidden, layers. Herein, we
present a new deep learning strategy that incorporates fuzzy strategies into
the deep learning architecture focused on the application of semantic
segmentation using per-pixel classification. Experiments are conducted on a
benchmark data set as well as a data set collected via an unmanned aerial
system at a U.S. Army test site for the task of automatic road segmentation,
and preliminary results are promising.

Title: The perceptual boost of visual attention is task-dependent in
  naturalistic settings
Authors: Freddie Bickford Smith, Xiaoliang Luo, Brett D. Roads, Bradley C. Love
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Attentional modulation of neural representations is known to enhance
processing of task-relevant visual information. Is the resulting perceptual
boost task-dependent in naturalistic settings? We aim to answer this with a
large-scale computational experiment. First we design a series of visual tasks,
each consisting of classifying images from a particular task set (group of
image categories). The nature of a given task is determined by which categories
are included in the task set. Then on each task we compare the accuracy of an
attention-augmented neural network to that of an attention-free counterpart. We
show that, all else being equal, the performance impact of attention is
stronger with increasing task-set difficulty, weaker with increasing task-set
size, and weaker with increasing perceptual similarity within a task set.

Title: Adversarial Perturbations Prevail in the Y-Channel of the YCbCr Color
  Space
Authors: Camilo Pestana, Naveed Akhtar, Wei Liu, David Glance, Ajmal Mian
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep learning offers state of the art solutions for image recognition.
However, deep models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in images that
are subtle but significantly change the model's prediction. In a white-box
attack, these perturbations are generally learned for deep models that operate
on RGB images and, hence, the perturbations are equally distributed in the RGB
color space. In this paper, we show that the adversarial perturbations prevail
in the Y-channel of the YCbCr space. Our finding is motivated from the fact
that the human vision and deep models are more responsive to shape and texture
rather than color. Based on our finding, we propose a defense against
adversarial images. Our defence, coined ResUpNet, removes perturbations only
from the Y-channel by exploiting ResNet features in an upsampling framework
without the need for a bottleneck. At the final stage, the untouched
CbCr-channels are combined with the refined Y-channel to restore the clean
image. Note that ResUpNet is model agnostic as it does not modify the DNN
structure. ResUpNet is trained end-to-end in Pytorch and the results are
compared to existing defence techniques in the input transformation category.
Our results show that our approach achieves the best balance between defence
against adversarial attacks such as FGSM, PGD and DDN and maintaining the
original accuracies of VGG-16, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 on clean images. We
perform another experiment to show that learning adversarial perturbations only
for the Y-channel results in higher fooling rates for the same perturbation
magnitude.

\\
  This paper presents a new approach to 3D object detection that leverages the
properties of the data obtained by a LiDAR sensor. State-of-the-art detectors
use neural network architectures based on assumptions valid for camera images.
However, point clouds obtained from LiDAR are fundamentally different. Most
detectors use shared filter kernels to extract features which do not take into
account the range dependent nature of the point cloud features. To show this,
different detectors are trained on two splits of the KITTI dataset: close range
(points up to 25 meters from LiDAR) and long-range. Top view images are
generated from point clouds as input for the networks. Combined results
outperform the baseline network trained on the full dataset with a single
backbone. Additional research compares the effect of using different input
features when converting the point cloud to image. The results indicate that
the network focuses on the shape and structure of the objects, rather than
exact values of the input. This work proposes an improvement for 3D object
detectors by taking into account the properties of LiDAR point clouds over
distance. Results show that training separate networks for close-range and
long-range objects boosts performance for all KITTI benchmark difficulties.

\\
  Single image super resolution aims to enhance image quality with respect to
spatial content, which is a fundamental task in computer vision. In this work,
we address the task of single frame super resolution with the presence of image
degradation, e.g., blur, haze, or rain streaks. Due to the limitations of frame
capturing and formation processes, image degradation is inevitable, and the
artifacts would be exacerbated by super resolution methods. To address this
problem, we propose a dual-branch convolutional neural network to extract base
features and recovered features separately. The base features contain local and
global information of the input image. On the other hand, the recovered
features focus on the degraded regions and are used to remove the degradation.
Those features are then fused through a recursive gate module to obtain sharp
features for super resolution. By decomposing the feature extraction step into
two task-independent streams, the dual-branch model can facilitate the training
process by avoiding learning the mixed degradation all-in-one and thus enhance
the final high-resolution prediction results. We evaluate the proposed method
in three degradation scenarios. Experiments on these scenarios demonstrate that
the proposed method performs more efficiently and favorably against the
state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets.

Title: Revisiting Convolutional Neural Networks for Urban Flow Analytics
Authors: Yuxuan Liang, Kun Ouyang, Junbo Zhang, Yu Zheng, David S. Rosenblum
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted in raster-based
urban flow analytics by virtue of their capability in capturing nearby spatial
context. By revisiting CNN-based methods for different analytics tasks, we
expose two common critical drawbacks in the existing uses: 1) inefficiency in
learning global context, and 2) overlooking latent region functions. To tackle
these challenges, in this paper we present a novel framework entitled DeepLGR
that can be easily generalized to address various urban flow analytics
problems. This framework consists of three major parts: 1) a local context
module to learn local representations of each region; 2) a global context

  The authors present a visual instrument developed as part of the creation of
the artwork Learning to See. The artwork explores bias in artificial neural
networks and provides mechanisms for the manipulation of specifically trained
for real-world representations. The exploration of these representations acts
as a metaphor for the process of developing a visual understanding and/or
visual vocabulary of the world. These representations can be explored and
manipulated in real time, and have been produced in such a way so as to reflect
specific creative perspectives that call into question the relationship between
how both artificial neural networks and humans may construct meaning.

\\
  Video object segmentation (VOS) is a highly challenging problem since the
initial mask, defining the target object, is only given at test-time. The main
difficulty is to effectively handle appearance changes and similar background
objects, while maintaining accurate segmentation. Most previous approaches
fine-tune segmentation networks on the first frame, resulting in impractical
frame-rates and risk of overfitting. More recent methods integrate generative
target appearance models, but either achieve limited robustness or require
large amounts of training data. We propose a novel VOS architecture consisting
of two network components. The target appearance model consists of a
light-weight module, learned during the inference stage using fast optimization
techniques to predict a coarse but robust target segmentation. The segmentation
model is exclusively trained offline, designed to process the coarse scores
into high quality segmentation masks. Our method is fast, easily trainable and
remains is highly effective in cases of limited training data. We perform
extensive experiments on the challenging YouTube-VOS and DAVIS datasets. Our
network achieves favorable performance, while operating at significantly higher
frame-rates compared to state-of-the-art. Code is available at
https://github.com/andr345/frtm-vos.

Title: Deep Meditations: Controlled navigation of latent space
Authors: Memo Akten, Rebecca Fiebrink, Mick Grierson
Categories: cs.CV cs.HC cs.LG
Comments: Presented at the 2nd Workshop on Machine Learning for Creativity and
  Design at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2018 conference
  in Montreal
\\
  We introduce a method which allows users to creatively explore and navigate
the vast latent spaces of deep generative models. Specifically, our method
enables users to \textit{discover} and \textit{design} \textit{trajectories} in
these high dimensional spaces, to construct stories, and produce time-based
media such as videos---\textit{with meaningful control over narrative}. Our
goal is to encourage and aid the use of deep generative models as a medium for
creative expression and story telling with meaningful human control. Our method
is analogous to traditional video production pipelines in that we use a
conventional non-linear video editor with proxy clips, and conform with arrays
of latent space vectors. Examples can be seen at

Title: Always Look on the Bright Side of the Field: Merging Pose and Contextual
  Data to Estimate Orientation of Soccer Players
Authors: Adri\`a Arbu\'es-Sang\"uesa, Adri\'an Mart\'in, Javier Fern\'andez,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Although orientation has proven to be a key skill of soccer players in order
to succeed in a broad spectrum of plays, body orientation is a
yet-little-explored area in sports analytics' research. Despite being an
inherently ambiguous concept, player orientation can be defined as the
projection (2D) of the normal vector placed in the center of the upper-torso of
players (3D). This research presents a novel technique to obtain player
orientation from monocular video recordings by mapping pose parts (shoulders
and hips) in a 2D field by combining OpenPose with a super-resolution network,
and merging the obtained estimation with contextual information (ball
position). Results have been validated with players-held EPTS devices,
obtaining a median error of 27 degrees/player. Moreover, three novel types of
orientation maps are proposed in order to make raw orientation data easy to
visualize and understand, thus allowing further analysis at team- or
player-level.

Title: DriverMHG: A Multi-Modal Dataset for Dynamic Recognition of Driver Micro
  Hand Gestures and a Real-Time Recognition Framework
Authors: Okan K\"op\"ukl\"u, Thomas Ledwon, Yao Rong, Neslihan Kose, Gerhard

Comments: Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and
  Gesture Recognition (FG 2020)
\\
  The use of hand gestures provides a natural alternative to cumbersome
interface devices for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems. However,
real-time recognition of dynamic micro hand gestures from video streams is
challenging for in-vehicle scenarios since (i) the gestures should be performed
naturally without distracting the driver, (ii) micro hand gestures occur within
very short time intervals at spatially constrained areas, (iii) the performed
gesture should be recognized only once, and (iv) the entire architecture should
be designed lightweight as it will be deployed to an embedded system. In this
work, we propose an HCI system for dynamic recognition of driver micro hand
gestures, which can have a crucial impact in automotive sector especially for
safety related issues. For this purpose, we initially collected a dataset named
Driver Micro Hand Gestures (DriverMHG), which consists of RGB, depth and
infrared modalities. The challenges for dynamic recognition of micro hand
gestures have been addressed by proposing a lightweight convolutional neural
network (CNN) based architecture which operates online efficiently with a
sliding window approach. For the CNN model, several 3-dimensional resource
efficient networks are applied and their performances are analyzed. Online
recognition of gestures has been performed with 3D-MobileNetV2, which provided
the best offline accuracy among the applied networks with similar computational
complexities. The final architecture is deployed on a driver simulator
operating in real-time. We make DriverMHG dataset and our source code publicly
available.

Title: Plug & Play Convolutional Regression Tracker for Video Object Detection
Authors: Ye Lyu, Michael Ying Yang, George Vosselman, Gui-Song Xia
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Video object detection targets to simultaneously localize the bounding boxes
of the objects and identify their classes in a given video. One challenge for
video object detection is to consistently detect all objects across the whole
video. As the appearance of objects may deteriorate in some frames, features or
detections from the other frames are commonly used to enhance the prediction.
In this paper, we propose a Plug & Play scale-adaptive convolutional regression
tracker for the video object detection task, which could be easily and
compatibly implanted into the current state-of-the-art detection networks. As
the tracker reuses the features from the detector, it is a very light-weighted
increment to the detection network. The whole network performs at the speed
close to a standard object detector. With our new video object detection
pipeline design, image object detectors can be easily turned into efficient
video object detectors without modifying any parameters. The performance is
evaluated on the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset. Our Plug & Play design
improves mAP score for the image detector by around 5% with only little speed
drop.

Title: D3VO: Deep Depth, Deep Pose and Deep Uncertainty for Monocular Visual
  Odometry
Authors: Nan Yang and Lukas von Stumberg and Rui Wang and Daniel Cremers
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: To appear in CVPR 2020. It is yet final and will be updated to the
  camera ready version upon completion
\\
  We propose D3VO as a novel framework for monocular visual odometry that
exploits deep networks on three levels -- deep depth, pose and uncertainty
estimation. We first propose a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation
network trained on stereo videos without any external supervision. In
particular, it aligns the training image pairs into similar lighting condition
with predictive brightness transformation parameters. Besides, we model the
photometric uncertainties of pixels on the input images, which improves the
depth estimation accuracy and provides a learned weighting function for the
photometric residuals in direct (feature-less) visual odometry. Evaluation
results show that the proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art
self-supervised depth estimation networks. D3VO tightly incorporates the
predicted depth, pose and uncertainty into a direct visual odometry method to
boost both the front-end tracking as well as the back-end non-linear
optimization. We evaluate D3VO in terms of monocular visual odometry on both
the KITTI odometry benchmark and the EuRoC MAV dataset. The results show that
D3VO outperforms state-of-the-art traditional monocular VO methods by a large
margin. It also achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art stereo/LiDAR
odometry on KITTI and to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry on EuRoC
MAV, while using only a single camera.

  Adversarial Robustness
Authors: Ahmadreza Jeddi, Mohammad Javad Shafiee, Michelle Karg, Christian

\\
  While deep neural networks have been achieving state-of-the-art performance
across a wide variety of applications, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks limits their widespread deployment for safety-critical applications.
Alongside other adversarial defense approaches being investigated, there has
been a very recent interest in improving adversarial robustness in deep neural
networks through the introduction of perturbations during the training process.
However, such methods leverage fixed, pre-defined perturbations and require
significant hyper-parameter tuning that makes them very difficult to leverage
in a general fashion. In this study, we introduce Learn2Perturb, an end-to-end
feature perturbation learning approach for improving the adversarial robustness
of deep neural networks. More specifically, we introduce novel
perturbation-injection modules that are incorporated at each layer to perturb
the feature space and increase uncertainty in the network. This feature
perturbation is performed at both the training and the inference stages.
Furthermore, inspired by the Expectation-Maximization, an alternating
back-propagation training algorithm is introduced to train the network and
noise parameters consecutively. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets show that the proposed Learn2Perturb method can result in deep neural
networks which are $4-7\%$ more robust on $l_{\infty}$ FGSM and PDG adversarial
attacks and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art against $l_2$ $C\&W$
attack and a wide range of well-known black-box attacks.

  Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple Inc. engineer, died on March 23, 2018,
after his Tesla Model X crashed into a highway barrier in Mountain View,
California. Tesla immediately disavowed responsibility for the accident. "The
fundamental premise of both moral and legal liability is a broken promise, and
there was none here: [Mr. Huang] was well aware that the Autopilot was not
perfect [and the] only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang
was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple
warnings to do so." This is the standard response from Tesla and Uber, the
manufacturers of the automated vehicles involved in the six fatal accidents to
date: the automated vehicle isn't perfect, the driver knew it wasn't perfect,
and if only the driver had been paying attention and heeded the vehicle's
warnings, the accident would never have occurred.
  However, as researchers focused on human-automation interaction in aviation
and military operations, we cannot help but wonder if there really are no
broken promises and no legal liabilities. Science has a critical role in
determining legal liability, and courts appropriately rely on scientists and
engineers to determine whether an accident, or harm, was foreseeable.
Specifically, a designer could be found liable if, at the time of the accident,
scientists knew there was a systematic relationship between the accident and
the designer's untaken precaution.
  Nearly 70 years of research provides an undeniable answer: It is
insufficient, inappropriate, and dangerous to automate everything you can and
leave the rest to the human. There is a systematic relationship between the
design of automated vehicles and the types of accidents that are occurring now
and will inevitably continue to occur in the future. These accidents were not
unforeseeable and the drivers were not exclusively to blame.

Title: Toward equipping Artificial Moral Agents with multiple ethical theories
Authors: George Rautenbach and C. Maria Keet

Comments: technical report; 33 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, 4 code listings
ACM-class: H.1.0; I.2.0; I.6.5; K.m
\\
  Artificial Moral Agents (AMA's) is a field in computer science with the
purpose of creating autonomous machines that can make moral decisions akin to
how humans do. Researchers have proposed theoretical means of creating such
machines, while philosophers have made arguments as to how these machines ought
to behave, or whether they should even exist. Of the currently theorised AMA's,
all research and design has been done with either none or at most one specified
normative ethical theory as basis. This is problematic because it narrows down
the AMA's functional ability and versatility which in turn causes moral
outcomes that a limited number of people agree with (thereby undermining an
AMA's ability to be moral in a human sense). As solution we design a
three-layer model for general normative ethical theories that can be used to
serialise the ethical views of people and businesses for an AMA to use during
reasoning. Four specific ethical norms (Kantianism, divine command theory,
utilitarianism, and egoism) were modelled and evaluated as proof of concept for
normative modelling. Furthermore, all models were serialised to XML/XSD as
proof of support for computerisation.

Title: Dynamic Skyline Queries on Encrypted Data Using Result Materialization
Authors: Sepanta Zeighami, Gabriel Ghinita, Cyrus Shahabi
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  Skyline computation is an increasingly popular query, with broad
applicability in domains such as healthcare, travel and finance. Given the
recent trend to outsource databases and query evaluation, and due to the
proprietary and sometimes highly sensitivity nature of the data (e.g., in
healthcare), it is essential to evaluate skylines on encrypted datasets.
Several research efforts acknowledged the importance of secure skyline
computation, but existing solutions suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: (i) they only provide ad-hoc security; (ii) they are
prohibitively expensive; or (iii) they rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as
the presence of multiple non-colluding parties in the protocol.
  Inspired from solutions for secure nearest-neighbors (NN) computation, we
conjecture that the most secure and efficient way to compute skylines is
through result materialization. However, this approach is significantly more
challenging for skylines than for NN queries. We exhaustively study and provide
algorithms for pre-computation of skyline results, and we perform an in-depth
theoretical analysis of this process. We show that pre-computing results while
minimizing storage overhead is NP-hard, and we provide dynamic programming and
greedy heuristics that solve the problem more efficiently, while maintaining
storage at reasonable levels. Our algorithms are novel and applicable to
plain-text skyline computation, but we focus on the encrypted setting where
materialization reduces the cost of skyline computation from hours to seconds.
Extensive experiments show that we clearly outperform existing work in terms of
performance, and our security analysis proves that we obtain a smaller (and
quantifiable) data leakage than competitors.

practice in data modeling for NoSQL data stores. Further, we analyze the entire
project history, and with it, the evolution history of the NoSQL database
schema. In doing so, we conduct the so far largest empirical study on NoSQL

  Recently, the impressive accuracy of deep neural networks (DNNs) has created
great demands on practical analytics over video data. Although efficient and
accurate, the latest video analytics systems have not supported analytics
beyond selection and aggregation yet. In data analytics, Top-K is a very
important analytical operation that enables analysts to focus on the most
important entities. In this paper, we present Everest, the first system that
supports efficient and accurate Top-K video analytics. Everest can help rank
and identify the most interesting frames/moments from videos with theoretical
accuracy guarantees. Everest is built on a careful synthesis of machine
learning, computer vision, and Top-K query processing. Evaluations on six

Title: Evaluating Temporal Queries Over Video Feeds
Authors: Yueting Chen and Xiaohui Yu and Nick Koudas
Categories: cs.DB cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Recent advances in Computer Vision and Deep Learning made possible the
efficient extraction of a schema from frames of streaming video. As such, a
stream of objects and their associated classes along with unique object
identifiers derived via object tracking can be generated, providing unique
objects as they are captured across frames. In this paper we initiate a study
of temporal queries involving objects and their co-occurrences in video feeds.
For example, queries that identify video segments during which the same two red
cars and the same two humans appear jointly for five minutes are of interest to
many applications ranging from law enforcement to security and safety. We take
the first step and define such queries in a way that they incorporate certain
physical aspects of video capture such as object occlusion. We present an
architecture consisting of three layers, namely object detection/tracking,
intermediate data generation and query evaluation. We propose two
techniques,MFS and SSG, to organize all detected objects in the intermediate
data generation layer, which effectively, given the queries, minimizes the
number of objects and frames that have to be considered during query
evaluation. We also introduce an algorithm called State Traversal (ST) that
processes incoming frames against the SSG and efficiently prunes objects and
frames unrelated to query evaluation, while maintaining all states required for
succinct query evaluation. We present the results of a thorough experimental
evaluation utilizing both real and synthetic data establishing the trade-offs
between MFS and SSG. We stress various parameters of interest in our evaluation
and demonstrate that the proposed query evaluation methodology coupled with the
proposed algorithms is capable to evaluate temporal queries over video feeds
efficiently, achieving orders of magnitude performance benefits.

Title: Distribution Constraints: The Chase for Distributed Data
Authors: Gaetano Geck, Frank Neven, Thomas Schwentick
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  This paper introduces a declarative framework to specify and reason about
distributions of data over computing nodes in a distributed setting. More
specifically, it proposes distribution constraints which are tuple and equality
generating dependencies (tgds and egds) extended with node variables ranging
over computing nodes. In particular, they can express co-partitioning
constraints and constraints about range-based data distributions by using
comparison atoms. The main technical contribution is the study of the
implication problem of distribution constraints. While implication is
undecidable in general, relevant fragments of so-called data-full constraints
are exhibited for which the corresponding implication problems are complete for
EXPTIME, PSPACE and NP. These results yield bounds on deciding
parallel-correctness for conjunctive queries in the presence of distribution
constraints.

Title: Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice on Insertion-Intensive
  Database
Authors: Sepanta Zeighami, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  With the prevalence of online platforms, today, data is being generated and
accessed by users at a very high rate. Besides, applications such as stock
trading or high frequency trading require guaranteed low delays for performing
an operation on a database. It is consequential to design databases that
guarantee data insertion and query at a consistently high rate without
introducing any long delay during insertion. In this paper, we propose Nested
B-trees (NB-trees), an index that can achieve a consistently high insertion
rate on large volumes of data, while providing asymptotically optimal query
performance that is very efficient in practice. Nested B-trees support
insertions at rates higher than LSM-trees, the state-of-the-art index for
insertion-intensive workloads, while avoiding their long insertion delays and
improving on their query performance. They approach the query performance of
B-trees when complemented with Bloom filters. In our experiments, NB-trees had
worst-case delays up to 1000 smaller than LevelDB, RocksDB and bLSM, commonly
used LSM-tree data-stores, could perform queries more than 4 times faster than
LevelDB and 1.5 times faster than bLSM and RocksDB, while also outperforming
them in terms of average insertion rate.

\\
  Marx (STOC~2010, J.~ACM 2013) introduced the notion of submodular width of a
conjunctive query (CQ) and showed that for any class $\Phi$ of Boolean CQs of
bounded submodular width, the model-checking problem for $\Phi$ on the class of
all finite structures is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). Note that for
non-Boolean queries, the size of the query result may be far too large to be
computed entirely within FPT time. We investigate the free-connex variant of
submodular width and generalise Marx's result to non-Boolean queries as
follows: For every class $\Phi$ of CQs of bounded free-connex submodular width,
within FPT-preprocessing time we can build a data structure that allows to
enumerate, without repetition and with constant delay, all tuples of the query
result. Our proof builds upon Marx's splitting routine to decompose the query
result into a union of results; but we have to tackle the additional technical
difficulty to ensure that these can be enumerated efficiently.

  Over the past years, there has been an increasing number of key-value (KV)
store designs, each optimizing for a different set of requirements.
Furthermore, with the advancements of storage technology the design space of KV
stores has become even more complex. More recent KV-store designs target fast
storage devices, such as SSDs and NVM. Most of these designs aim to reduce
amplification during data reorganization by taking advantage of device
characteristics. However, until today most analysis of KV-store designs is
experimental and limited to specific design points. This makes it difficult to
compare tradeoffs across different designs, find optimal configurations and
guide future KV-store design. In this paper, we introduce the Variable
Amplification- Throughput analysis (VAT) to calculate insert-path amplification
and its impact on multi-level KV-store performance.We use VAT to express the
behavior of several existing design points and to explore tradeoffs that are
not possible or easy to measure experimentally. VAT indicates that by inserting
randomness in the insert-path, KV stores can reduce amplification by more than
10x for fast storage devices. Techniques, such as key-value separation and
tiering compaction, reduce amplification by 10x and 5x, respectively.
Additionally, VAT predicts that the advancements in device technology towards
NVM, reduces the benefits from both using key-value separation and tiering.

Title: A Note on Latency Variability of Deep Neural Networks for Mobile
  Inference
Authors: Luting Yang, Bingqian Lu and Shaolei Ren
Categories: cs.DC cs.AI
\\
  Running deep neural network (DNN) inference on mobile devices, i.e., mobile
inference, has become a growing trend, making inference less dependent on
network connections and keeping private data locally. The prior studies on
optimizing DNNs for mobile inference typically focus on the metric of average
inference latency, thus implicitly assuming that mobile inference exhibits
little latency variability. In this note, we conduct a preliminary measurement
study on the latency variability of DNNs for mobile inference. We show that the
inference latency variability can become quite significant in the presence of
CPU resource contention. More interestingly, unlike the common belief that the
relative performance superiority of DNNs on one device can carry over to
another device and/or another level of resource contention, we highlight that a
DNN model with a better latency performance than another model can become
outperformed by the other model when resource contention be more severe or
running on another device. Thus, when optimizing DNN models for mobile
inference, only measuring the average latency may not be adequate; instead,
latency variability under various conditions should be accounted for, including
but not limited to different devices and different levels of CPU resource
contention considered in this note.

Title: Enumerating Hardware-Software Splits with Program Rewriting
Authors: Gus Smith, Zachary Tatlock and Luis Ceze (University of Washington)

Comments: Accepted in the Second Young Architect Workshop, in conjunction with
  ASPLOS 2020
\\
  A core problem in hardware-software codesign is in the sheer size of the
design space. Without a set ISA to constrain the hardware-software interface,
the design space explodes. This work presents a strategy for managing the
massive hardware-software design space within the domain of machine learning
inference workloads and accelerators. We first propose EngineIR, a new language
for representing machine learning hardware and software in a single program.
Then, using equality graphs -- a data structure from the compilers literature
-- we suggest a method for efficiently enumerating the design space by
performing rewrites over our representation.

Title: Bipartisan Paxos: A Modular State Machine Replication Protocol
Authors: Michael Whittaker, Neil Giridharan, Adriana Szekeres, Joseph M.

Categories: cs.DC
\\
  There is no shortage of state machine replication protocols. From Generalized
Paxos to EPaxos, a huge number of replication protocols have been proposed that
achieve high throughput and low latency. However, these protocols all have two
problems. First, they do not scale. Many protocols actually slow down when you
scale them, instead of speeding up. For example, increasing the number of
MultiPaxos acceptors increases quorum sizes and slows down the protocol.
Second, they are too complicated. This is not a secret; state machine
replication is notoriously difficult to understand.
  In this paper, we tackle both problems with a single solution: modularity. We
present Bipartisan Paxos (BPaxos), a modular state machine replication
protocol. Modularity yields high throughput via scaling. We note that while
many replication protocol components do not scale, some do. By modularizing
BPaxos, we are able to disentangle the two and scale the bottleneck components
to increase the protocol's throughput. Modularity also yields simplicity.
BPaxos is divided into a number of independent modules that can be understood
and proven correct in isolation.

  Applications like Big Data, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and even other
Engineering and Scientific research requires a lot of computing power; making
High-Performance Computing (HPC) an important field. But access to
Supercomputers is out of range from the majority. Nowadays Supercomputers are
actually clusters of computers usually made-up of commodity hardware. Such
clusters are called Beowulf Clusters. The history of which goes back to 1994
when NASA built a Supercomputer by creating a cluster of commodity hardware. In
recent times a lot of effort has been done in making HPC Clusters of even
single board computers (SBCs). Although the creation of clusters of commodity
hardware is possible but is a cumbersome task. Moreover, the maintenance of
such systems is also difficult and requires special expertise and time. The
concept of cloud is to provide on-demand resources that can be services,
platform or even infrastructure and this is done by sharing a big resource
pool. Cloud computing has resolved problems like maintenance of hardware and
requirement of having expertise in networking etc. An effort is made of
bringing concepts from cloud computing to HPC in order to get benefits of
cloud. The main target is to create a system which can develop a capability of
providing computing power as a service which to further be referred to as
Supercomputer as a service. A prototype was made using Raspberry Pi (RPi) 3B
and 3B+ Single Board Computers. The reason for using RPi boards was increasing
popularity of ARM processors in the field of HPC

Title: AutoPhase: Juggling HLS Phase Orderings in Random Forests with Deep
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Qijing Huang, Ameer Haj-Ali, William Moses, John Xiang, Ion Stoica,
  Krste Asanovic, John Wawrzynek
Categories: cs.DC cs.LG cs.PL
\\
  The performance of the code a compiler generates depends on the order in
which it applies the optimization passes. Choosing a good order--often referred
to as the phase-ordering problem, is an NP-hard problem. As a result, existing
solutions rely on a variety of heuristics. In this paper, we evaluate a new
technique to address the phase-ordering problem: deep reinforcement learning.
To this end, we implement AutoPhase: a framework that takes a program and uses
deep reinforcement learning to find a sequence of compilation passes that
minimizes its execution time. Without loss of generality, we construct this
framework in the context of the LLVM compiler toolchain and target high-level
synthesis programs. We use random forests to quantify the correlation between
the effectiveness of a given pass and the program's features. This helps us
reduce the search space by avoiding phase orderings that are unlikely to
improve the performance of a given program. We compare the performance of
AutoPhase to state-of-the-art algorithms that address the phase-ordering
problem. In our evaluation, we show that AutoPhase improves circuit performance
by 28% when compared to using the -O3 compiler flag, and achieves competitive
results compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, while requiring fewer
samples. Furthermore, unlike existing state-of-the-art solutions, our deep
reinforcement learning solution shows promising result in generalizing to real
benchmarks and 12,874 different randomly generated programs, after training on
a hundred randomly generated programs.

Title: Graph3S: A Simple, Speedy and Scalable Distributed Graph Processing
  System
Authors: Xubo Wang, Lu Qin, Lijun Chang, Ying Zhang, Dong Wen, Xuemin Lin
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Graph is a ubiquitous structure in many domains. The rapidly increasing data
volume calls for efficient and scalable graph data processing. In recent years,
designing distributed graph processing systems has been an increasingly
important area to fulfil the demands of processing big graphs in a distributed
environment. Though a variety of distributed graph processing systems have been
developed, very little attention has been paid to achieving a good
combinational system performance in terms of usage simplicity, efficiency and
scalability. To contribute to the study of distributed graph processing system,
this work tries to fill this gap by designing a simple, speedy and scalable
system. Our observation is that enforcing the communication flexibility of a
system leads to the gains of both system efficiency and scalability as well as
simple usage. We realize our idea in a system Graph3S and conduct extensive
experiments with diverse algorithms over big graphs from different domains to
test its performance. The results show that, besides simple usage, our system
has outstanding performance over various graph algorithms and can even reach up
to two orders of magnitude speedup over existing in-memory systems when
applying to some algorithms. Also, its scalability is competitive to disk-based
systems and even better when less machines are used.

Categories: cs.DC cs.AI
\\
  This paper introduces CAAI, a novel cognitive architecture for artificial
intelligence in cyber-physical production systems. The goal of the architecture
is to reduce the implementation effort for the usage of artificial intelligence
algorithms. The core of the CAAI is a cognitive module that processes
declarative goals of the user, selects suitable models and algorithms, and
creates a configuration for the execution of a processing pipeline on a big
data platform. Constant observation and evaluation against performance criteria
assess the performance of pipelines for many and varying use cases. Based on
these evaluations, the pipelines are automatically adapted if necessary. The
modular design with well-defined interfaces enables the reusability and
extensibility of pipeline components. A big data platform implements this
modular design supported by technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Kafka
for virtualization and orchestration of the individual components and their
communication. The implementation of the architecture is evaluated using a
real-world use case.

  Audio, animations and video belong to a class of data known as delay
sensitive because they are sensitive to delays in presentation to the users.
Also, because of huge data in such items, disk is an important device in
managing them. In order to have an acceptable presentation, disk requests
deadlines must be met, and a real-time scheduling approach should be used to
guarantee the timing requirements for such environment. However, some disk
scheduling algorithms have been proposed since now to optimize scheduling
real-time disk requests, but improving the results is a challenge yet. In this
paper, we propose a new disk scheduling method based on Ant Colony Optimization
(ACO) approach. In this approach, ACO models the tasks and finds the best
sequence to minimize number of missed tasks and maximize throughput.
Experimental results showed that the proposed method worked very well and
excelled other related ones in terms of miss ratio and throughput in most
cases.

Title: On-the-fly Optimization of Parallel Computation of Symbolic Symplectic
  Invariants
Authors: Joseph Ben Geloun, Camille Coti, Allen D. Malony
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Group invariants are used in high energy physics to define quantum field
theory interactions. In this paper, we are presenting the parallel algebraic
computation of special invariants called symplectic and even focusing on one
particular invariant that finds recent interest in physics. Our results will
export to other invariants. The cost of performing basic computations on the
multivariate polynomials involved evolves during the computation, as the
polynomials get larger or with an increasing number of terms. However, in some
cases, they stay small. Traditionally, high-performance software is optimized
by running it on a smaller data set in order to use profiling information to
set some tuning parameters. Since the (communication and computation) costs
evolve during the computation, the first iterations of the computation might
not be representative of the rest of the computation and this approach cannot
be applied in this case. To cope with this evolution, we are presenting an
approach to get performance data and tune the algorithm during the execution.

Title: Gender Disparities in International Research Collaboration: A
  Large-scale Bibliometric Study of 25,000 University Professors
Authors: Marek Kwiek and Wojciech Roszka
Categories: cs.DL cs.GL
Comments: 37 pages, 8 figures,6 tables
\\
  In this research, we examine the hypothesis that gender disparities in
international research collaboration differ by collaboration intensity,
academic position, age, and academic discipline. The following are the major
findings: (1) while female scientists exhibit a higher rate of general,
national, and institutional collaboration, male scientists exhibit a higher
rate of international collaboration, a finding critically important in
explaining gender disparities in impact, productivity, and access to large
grants. (2) An aggregated picture of gender disparities hides a more nuanced
cross-disciplinary picture of them. (3) An analysis of international research
collaboration at three separate intensity levels (low, medium, and high)
reveals that male scientists dominate in international collaboration at each
level. However, at each level, there are specific disciplines in which females
collaborate more than males. Further (4), gender disparities are clearly linked
with age. Until about the age of 40, they are marginal and then they begin to
grow. Finally, we estimate the odds of being involved in international research
collaboration using an analytical linear logistic model. The examined sample
includes 25,463 internationally productive Polish university professors from 85
universities, grouped into 27 disciplines, who authored 159,943 Scopus-indexed
articles.

Title: Improved Algorithm for Min-Cuts in Distributed Networks
Authors: Mohit Daga
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: This is a copy of thesis which was submitted to IIT Madras for MS
  Degree in 2017
\\
  In this thesis, we present fast deterministic algorithm to find small cuts in
distributed networks. Finding small min-cuts for a network is essential for
ensuring the quality of service and reliability. Throughout this thesis, we use
the CONGEST model which is a typical message passing model used to design and
analyze algorithms in distributed networks. We survey various algorithmic
techniques in the CONGEST model and give an overview of the recent results to
find cuts. We also describe elegant graph theoretic ideas like cut spaces and
cycle spaces that provide useful intuition upon which our work is built.
  Our contribution is a novel fast algorith to find small cuts. Our algorithm
relies on a new characterization of trees and cuts introduced in this thesis.
Our algorithm is built upon several new algorithmic ideas that, when coupled
with our characterization of trees and cuts, help us to find the required
min-cuts. Our novel techniques include a tree restricted semigroup function
(TRSF), a novel sketching technique, and a layered algorithm. TRSF is defined
with respect to a spanning tree and is based on a commutative semigroup. This
simple yet powerful technique helps us to deterministically find min-cuts of
size one (bridges) and min-cuts of size two optimally. Our sketching technique
samples a small but relevant vertex set which is enough to find small min-cuts
in certain cases. Our layered algorithm finds min-cuts in smaller sub-graphs
pivoted by nodes at different levels in a spanning tree and uses them to make
the decision about the min-cuts in the complete graph. This is interesting
because it enables us to show that even for a global property like finding
min-cuts, local information can be exploited in a coordinated manner.

Title: Communication-Optimal Tilings for Projective Nested Loops with Arbitrary
  Bounds
Authors: Grace Dinh and James Demmel
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Reducing communication - either between levels of a memory hierarchy or
between processors over a network - is a key component of performance
optimization (in both time and energy) for many problems, including dense
linear algebra, particle interactions, and machine learning. For these
problems, which can be represented as nested-loop computations, previous tiling
based approaches have been used to find both lower bounds on the communication
required to execute them and optimal rearrangements, or blockings, to attain
such lower bounds. However, such general approaches have typically assumed the
problem sizes are large, an assumption that is often not met in practice. For
instance, the classical $(\text{# arithmetic operations})/(\text{cache
size})^{1/2}$ lower bound for matrix multiplication is not tight for
matrix-vector multiplications, which must read in at least $O(\text{#
arithmetic operations})$ words of memory; similar issues occur for almost all
convolutions in machine learning applications, which use extremely small filter
sizes (and therefore, loop bounds).
  In this paper, we provide an efficient way to both find and obtain, via an
appropriate, efficiently constructible blocking, communication lower bounds and
matching tilings which attain these lower bounds for nested loop programs with
arbitrary loop bounds that operate on multidimensional arrays in the projective
case, where the array indices are subsets of the loop indices. Our approach
works on all such problems, regardless of dimensionality, size, memory access
patterns, or number of arrays, and directly applies to (among other examples)
matrix multiplication and similar dense linear algebra operations, tensor
contractions, n-body pairwise interactions, pointwise convolutions, and fully
connected layers.

Title: Distributed Testing of Graph Isomorphism in the CONGEST model
Authors: Reut Levi and Moti Medina
Categories: cs.DS cs.DC
\\
  In this paper we study the problem of testing graph isomorphism (GI) in the
CONGEST distributed model. In this setting we test whether the distributive
network, $G_U$, is isomorphic to $G_K$ which is given as an input to all the
nodes in the network, or alternatively, only to a single node.
  We first consider the decision variant of the problem in which the algorithm
distinguishes $G_U$ and $G_K$ which are isomorphic from $G_U$ and $G_K$ which
are not isomorphic. We provide a randomized algorithm with $O(n)$ rounds for
the setting in which $G_K$ is given only to a single node. We prove that for
this setting the number of rounds of any deterministic algorithm is
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ rounds, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes, which
implies a separation between the randomized and the deterministic complexities
of deciding GI.
  We then consider the \emph{property testing} variant of the problem, where
the algorithm is only required to distinguish the case that $G_U$ and $G_K$ are
isomorphic from the case that $G_U$ and $G_K$ are \emph{far} from being
isomorphic (according to some predetermined distance measure). We show that
every algorithm requires $\Omega(D)$ rounds, where $D$ denotes the diameter of
the network. This lower bound holds even if all the nodes are given $G_K$ as an
input, and even if the message size is unbounded. We provide a randomized
algorithm with an almost matching round complexity of $O(D+(\epsilon^{-1}\log
n)^2)$ rounds that is suitable for dense graphs.
  We also show that with the same number of rounds it is possible that each
node outputs its mapping according to a bijection which is an
\emph{approximated} isomorphism.
  We conclude with simple simulation arguments that allow us to obtain
essentially tight algorithms with round complexity $\tilde{O}(D)$ for special
families of sparse graphs.

Title: Connected Components on a PRAM in Log Diameter Time
Authors: S. Cliff Liu, Robert E. Tarjan, Peilin Zhong
Categories: cs.DS cs.DC
Comments: 48 pages
ACM-class: F.2.2
\\
  We present an $O(\log d + \log\log_{m/n} n)$-time randomized PRAM algorithm
for computing the connected components of an $n$-vertex, $m$-edge undirected
graph with maximum component diameter $d$. The algorithm runs on an ARBITRARY
CRCW (concurrent-read, concurrent-write with arbitrary write resolution) PRAM
using $O(m)$ processors. The time bound holds with good probability. Our
algorithm is based on the breakthrough results of Andoni et al. [FOCS'18] and
Behnezhad et al. [FOCS'19]. Their algorithms run on the more powerful MPC model
and rely on sorting and computing prefix sums in $O(1)$ time, tasks that take
$\Omega(\log n / \log\log n)$ time on a CRCW PRAM with $\text{poly}(n)$
processors. Our simpler algorithm uses limited-collision hashing and does not
sort or do prefix sums. It matches the time and space bounds of the algorithm
of Behnezhad et al., who improved the time bound of Andoni et al. It is widely
believed that the larger private memory per processor and unbounded local
computation of the MPC model admit algorithms faster than that on a PRAM. Our
result suggests that such additional power might not be necessary, at least for
fundamental graph problems like connected components and spanning forest.

\\
  Random graph models are frequently used as a controllable and versatile data
source for experimental campaigns in various research fields. Generating such
data-sets at scale is a non-trivial task as it requires design decisions
typically spanning multiple areas of expertise. Challenges begin with the
identification of relevant domain-specific network features, continue with the
question of how to compile such features into a tractable model, and culminate
in algorithmic details arising while implementing the pertaining model.
  In the present survey, we explore crucial aspects of random graph models with
known scalable generators. We begin by briefly introducing network features
considered by such models, and then discuss random graphs alongside with
generation algorithms. Our focus lies on modelling techniques and algorithmic
primitives that have proven successful in obtaining massive graphs. We consider
concepts and graph models for various domains (such as social network,
infrastructure, ecology, and numerical simulations), and discuss generators for
different models of computation (including shared-memory parallelism,
massive-parallel GPUs, and distributed systems).

properties of distributions from i.i.d. samples. For a broad class of symmetric
properties we identify the easy region where empirical estimation works and the
difficult region where more complex estimators are required. We show that by
approximately computing the profile maximum likelihood (PML) distribution
\cite{ADOS16} in this difficult region we obtain a symmetric property
estimation framework that is sample complexity optimal for many properties in a
broader parameter regime than previous universal estimation approaches based on
PML. The resulting algorithms based on these pseudo PML distributions are also
more practical.

2018], hence our algorithm is optimal. Besides the
$2^{O(\sqrt{k})}(n+m)^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for the (arguably) much simpler
Vertex Cover problem by de Berg et al. [STOC 2018] (which easily follows from
the existence of a $2k$-vertex kernel for the problem), this is the only known
ETH-optimal fixed-parameter tractable algorithm on UDGs. Previously, Long Path
and Long Cycle on unit disk graphs were only known to be solvable in time
$2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log k)}(n+m)$. This algorithm involved the introduction of a new
type of a tree decomposition, entailing the design of a very tedious dynamic
programming procedure. Our algorithm is substantially simpler: we completely
avoid the use of this new type of tree decomposition. Instead, we use a marking
procedure to reduce the problem to (a weighted version of) itself on a standard
tree decomposition of width $O(\sqrt{k})$.

  In this paper we provide a characterisation of rational developable surfaces
in terms of the blossoms of the bounding curves and three rational functions
$\Lambda$, $M$, $\nu$. Properties of developable surfaces are revised in this
framework. In particular, a closed algebraic formula for the edge of regression
of the surface is obtained in terms of the functions $\Lambda$, $M$, $\nu$,
which are closely related to the ones that appear in the standard decomposition
of the derivative of the parametrisation of one of the bounding curves in terms
of the director vector of the rulings and its derivative. It is also shown that
all rational developable surfaces can be described as the set of developable
surfaces which can be constructed with a constant $\Lambda$, $M$, $\nu$ . The
results are readily extended to rational spline developable surfaces.

Title: A Feature-aware SPH for Isotropic Unstructured Mesh Generation
Authors: Zhe Ji and Lin Fu and Xiangyu Hu and Nikolaus Adams
Categories: cs.GR physics.comp-ph
Comments: 54 pages and 22 figures
\\
  In this paper, we present a feature-aware SPH method for the concurrent and
automated isotropic unstructured mesh generation. Two additional objectives are
achieved with the proposed method compared to the original SPH-based mesh
generator (Fu et al., 2019). First, a feature boundary correction term is
introduced to address the issue of incomplete kernel support at the boundary
vicinity. The mesh generation of feature curves, feature surfaces and volumes
can be handled concurrently without explicitly following a dimensional
sequence. Second, a two-phase model is proposed to characterize the
mesh-generation procedure by a feature-size-adaptation phase and a
mesh-quality-optimization phase. By proposing a new error measurement criterion
and an adaptive control system with two sets of simulation parameters, the
objectives of faster feature-size adaptation and local mesh-quality improvement
are merged into a consistent framework. The proposed method is validated with a
set of 2D and 3D numerical tests with different complexities and scales. The
results demonstrate that high-quality meshes are generated with a significant
speedup of convergence.

Title: Simple Mechanisms for Non-linear Agents
Authors: Yiding Feng, Jason Hartline, Yingkai Li
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  We consider agents with non-linear preferences given by private values and
private budgets. We quantify the extent to which posted pricing approximately
optimizes welfare and revenue for a single agent. We give a reduction framework
that extends the approximation of multi-agent pricing-based mechanisms from
linear utility to nonlinear utility. This reduction framework is broadly
applicable as Alaei et al. (2012) have shown that mechanisms for linear agents
can generally be interpreted as pricing-based mechanisms. We give example
applications of the framework to oblivious posted pricing (e.g., Chawla et al.,
2010), sequential posted pricing (e.g., Yan, 2011), and virtual surplus
maximization (Myerson, 1981).

MSC-class: 91A12, 68Q15
ACM-class: F.2; J.4
\\
  Participatory budgeting is a democratic approach to deciding the funding of
public projects, which has been adopted in many cities across the world. We
present a survey of research on participatory budgeting emerging from the
computational social choice literature, which draws ideas from computer science
and microeconomic theory. We present a mathematical model for participatory
budgeting, which charts existing models across different axes including whether
the projects are treated as "divisible" or "indivisible" and whether there are
funding limits on individual projects. We then survey various approaches and
methods from the literature, giving special emphasis on issues of preference
elicitation, welfare objectives, fairness axioms, and voter incentives.
Finally, we discuss several directions in which research on participatory
budgeting can be extended in the future.

\\
  Zero-sum games have long guided artificial intelligence research, since they
possess both a rich strategy space of best-responses and a clear evaluation
metric. What's more, competition is a vital mechanism in many real-world
multi-agent systems capable of generating intelligent innovations: Darwinian
evolution, the market economy and the AlphaZero algorithm, to name a few. In
two-player zero-sum games, the challenge is usually viewed as finding Nash
equilibrium strategies, safeguarding against exploitation regardless of the
opponent. While this captures the intricacies of chess or Go, it avoids the
notion of cooperation with co-players, a hallmark of the major transitions
leading from unicellular organisms to human civilization. Beyond two players,
alliance formation often confers an advantage; however this requires trust,
namely the promise of mutual cooperation in the face of incentives to defect.
Successful play therefore requires adaptation to co-players rather than the
pursuit of non-exploitability. Here we argue that a systematic study of
many-player zero-sum games is a crucial element of artificial intelligence
research. Using symmetric zero-sum matrix games, we demonstrate formally that
alliance formation may be seen as a social dilemma, and empirically that
na\"ive multi-agent reinforcement learning therefore fails to form alliances.
We introduce a toy model of economic competition, and show how reinforcement
learning may be augmented with a peer-to-peer contract mechanism to discover
and enforce alliances. Finally, we generalize our agent model to incorporate
temporally-extended contracts, presenting opportunities for further work.

Title: MIndGrasp: A New Training and Testing Framework for Motor Imagery Based
  3-Dimensional Assistive Robotic Control
Authors: Daniel Freer, Guang-Zhong Yang
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IROS 2020
\\
  With increasing global age and disability assistive robots are becoming more
necessary, and brain computer interfaces (BCI) are often proposed as a solution
to understanding the intent of a disabled person that needs assistance. Most
frameworks for electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) BCI
control rely on the direct control of the robot in Cartesian space. However,
for 3-dimensional movement, this requires 6 motor imagery classes, which is a
difficult distinction even for more experienced BCI users. In this paper, we
present a simulated training and testing framework which reduces the number of
motor imagery classes to 4 while still grasping objects in three-dimensional
space. This is achieved through semi-autonomous eye-in-hand vision-based
control of the robotic arm, while the user-controlled BCI achieves movement to
the left and right, as well as movement toward and away from the object of
interest. Additionally, the framework includes a method of training a BCI
directly on the assistive robotic system, which should be more easily
transferrable to a real-world assistive robot than using a standard training
protocol such as Graz-BCI. Presented results do not consider real human EEG
data, but are rather shown as a baseline for comparison with future human data
and other improvements on the system.

\\
  According to the World Health Organization(WHO), it is estimated that
approximately 1.3 billion people live with some forms of vision impairment
globally, of whom 36 million are blind. Due to their disability, engaging these
minority into the society is a challenging problem. The recent rise of smart
mobile phones provides a new solution by enabling blind users' convenient
access to the information and service for understanding the world. Users with
vision impairment can adopt the screen reader embedded in the mobile operating
systems to read the content of each screen within the app, and use gestures to
interact with the phone. However, the prerequisite of using screen readers is
that developers have to add natural-language labels to the image-based
components when they are developing the app. Unfortunately, more than 77% apps
have issues of missing labels, according to our analysis of 10,408 Android
apps. Most of these issues are caused by developers' lack of awareness and
knowledge in considering the minority. And even if developers want to add the
labels to UI components, they may not come up with concise and clear
description as most of them are of no visual issues. To overcome these
challenges, we develop a deep-learning based model, called LabelDroid, to
automatically predict the labels of image-based buttons by learning from
large-scale commercial apps in Google Play. The experimental results show that
our model can make accurate predictions and the generated labels are of higher
quality than that from real Android developers.

Title: What Timing for an Automated Vehicle to Communicate Its Driving
  Intentions to Pedestrians for Improving Their Perception of Safety?
Authors: Hailong Liu, Takatsugu Hirayama, Luis Yoichi Morales, Hiroshi Murase
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 7 pages, 9 figures, 1 table
\\
  Although automated driving systems have been used frequently, they are still
unpopular in society. To increase the popularity of automated vehicles (AVs),
assisting pedestrians to accurately understand the driving intentions of the
vehicle and improving their perception of safety when interacting with AVs are
considered effective. Therefore, the AV should send information about its
driving intention to pedestrians when they interact with each other. However,
the following questions should be answered regarding how the AV sends the
information to them: 1) What timing for the AV to make the pedestrian
understand its driving intentions after it is noticed? 2) What timing for the
AV to make the pedestrian feel safe after it is noticed? Thirteen participants
were invited to interact with a manually driven vehicle and an AV in an
experiment. The participants' gaze information and a subjective evaluation of
their understanding of the driving intention as well as their perception of
safety were collected. By analyzing the participants' gaze duration on the
vehicle with their subjective evaluations, we found that the AV should enable
the pedestrian to accurately understand its driving intention within 0.5~6.5
[s] and make the pedestrian feel safe within 0.5~8.0 [s] while the pedestrian
is gazing at it.

Title: Decision Support in the Context of a Complex Decision Situation
Authors: Teus H. Kappen, Mirko Noordegraaf, Wilton A. van Klei, Karel G.M.
  Moons and Cor J. Kalkman
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  The aim of a clinical decision support tool is to reduce the complexity of
clinical decisions. However, when decision support tools are poorly implemented
they may actually confuse physicians and complicate clinical care. This paper
argues that information from decision support tools is often removed from the
clinical context of the targeted decisions. Physicians largely depend on
clinical context to handle the complexity of their day-to-day decisions.
Clinical context enables them to take into account all ambiguous information
and patient preferences. Decision support tools that provide analytic
information to physicians, without its context, may then complicate the
decision process of physicians. It is likely that the joint forces of
physicians and technology will produce better decisions than either of them
exclusively: after all, they do have different ways of dealing with the
complexity of a decision and are thus complementary. Therefore, the future
challenges of decision support do not only reside in the optimization of the
predictive value of the underlying models and algorithms, but equally in the
effective communication of information and its context to doctors.

\\
  A common and effective form of social touch is stroking on the forearm. We
seek to replicate this stroking sensation using haptic illusions. This work
compares two methods that provide sequential discrete stimulation: sequential
normal indentation and sequential lateral skin-slip using discrete actuators.
Our goals are to understand which form of stimulation more effectively creates
a continuous stroking sensation, and how many discrete contact points are
needed. We performed a study with 20 participants in which they rated
sensations from the haptic devices on continuity and pleasantness. We found
that lateral skin-slip created a more continuous sensation, and decreasing the
number of contact points decreased the continuity. These results inform the
design of future wearable haptic devices and the creation of haptic signals for
effective social communication.

Categories: cs.HC
\\
  We describe CARTOLABE, a web-based multi-scale system for visualizing and
exploring large textual corpora based on topics, introducing a novel mechanism
for the progressive visualization of filtering queries. Initially designed to
represent and navigate through scientific publications in different
disciplines, CARTOLABE has evolved to become a generic system and accommodate
various corpora, ranging from Wikipedia (4.5M entries) to the French National
Debate (4.3M entries). CARTOLABE is made of two modules: the first relies on
Natural Language Processing methods, converting a corpus and its entities
(documents, authors, concepts) into high-dimensional vectors, computing their
projection on the 2D plane, and extracting meaningful labels for regions of the
plane. The second module is a Web-based visualization, displaying tiles
computed from the multidimensional projection of the corpus using the UMAP
projection method. This visualization module aims at enabling users with no
expertise in visualization and data analysis to get an overview of their
corpus, and to interact with it: exploring, querying, filtering, panning and
zooming on regions of semantic interest. Three use cases are discussed to
illustrate CARTOLABE versatility and ability to bring large scale textual
corpus visualization and exploration to a wide audience.

\\
  During the last years, the emerging field of Augmented and Virtual Reality
(AR-VR) has seen tremendous growth. An interface that has also become very
popular for the AR systems is the tangible interface or passive-haptic
interface. Specifically, an interface where users can manipulate digital
information with input devices that are physical objects. This work presents a
low cost Augmented Reality system with a tangible interface that offers
interaction between the real and the virtual world. The system estimates in
real-time the 3D position of a small colored ball (input device), it maps it to
the 3D virtual world and then uses it to control the AR application that runs
in a mobile device. Using the 3D position of our "input" device, it allows us
to implement more complicated interactivity compared to a 2D input device.
Finally, we present a simple, fast and robust algorithm that can estimate the
corners of a convex quadrangle. The proposed algorithm is suitable for the fast
registration of markers and significantly improves performance compared to the
state of the art.

Title: Jointly Learning to Recommend and Advertise
Authors: Xiangyu Zhao, Xudong Zheng, Xiwang Yang, Xiaobing Liu, Jiliang Tang
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  Online recommendation and advertising are two major income channels for
online recommendation platforms (e.g. e-commerce and news feed site). However,
most platforms optimize recommending and advertising strategies by different
teams separately via different techniques, which may lead to suboptimal overall
performances. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel two-level
reinforcement learning framework to jointly optimize the recommending and
advertising strategies, where the first level generates a list of
recommendations to optimize user experience in the long run; then the second
level inserts ads into the recommendation list that can balance the immediate
advertising revenue from advertisers and the negative influence of ads on
long-term user experience. To be specific, first level tackles high
combinatorial action space problem that selects a subset items from the large
item space; while the second level determines three internally related tasks,
i.e., (i) whether to insert an ad, and if yes, (ii) the optimal ad and (iii)
the optimal location to insert. The experimental results based on real-world
data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

\\
  Image hashing is a fundamental problem in the computer vision domain with
various challenges, primarily, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.
Existing hashing methods lack a principled characterization of the goodness of
the hash codes and a principled approach to learn the discrete hash functions
that are being optimized in the continuous space. Adversarial autoencoders are
shown to be able to implicitly learn a robust hash function that generates hash
codes which are balanced and have low-quantization error. However, the existing
adversarial autoencoders for hashing are too inefficient to be employed for
large-scale image retrieval applications because of the minmax optimization
procedure. In this paper, we propose an Independent Relaxed Wasserstein
Autoencoder, which presents a novel, efficient hashing method that can
implicitly learn the optimal hash function by directly training the adversarial
autoencoder without any discriminator/critic. Our method is an
order-of-magnitude more efficient and has a much lower sample complexity than
the Optimal Transport formulation of the Wasserstein distance. The proposed
method outperforms the current state-of-the-art image hashing methods for the
retrieval task on several prominent image collections.

Title: Federating Recommendations Using Differentially Private Prototypes
Authors: M\'onica Ribero, Jette Henderson, Sinead Williamson, Haris Vikalo
Categories: cs.IR cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Machine learning methods allow us to make recommendations to users in
applications across fields including entertainment, dating, and commerce, by
exploiting similarities in users' interaction patterns. However, in domains
that demand protection of personally sensitive data, such as medicine or
banking, how can we learn such a model without accessing the sensitive data,
and without inadvertently leaking private information? We propose a new
federated approach to learning global and local private models for
recommendation without collecting raw data, user statistics, or information
about personal preferences. Our method produces a set of prototypes that allows
us to infer global behavioral patterns, while providing differential privacy
guarantees for users in any database of the system. By requiring only two
rounds of communication, we both reduce the communication costs and avoid the
excessive privacy loss associated with iterative procedures. We test our
framework on synthetic data as well as real federated medical data and
Movielens ratings data. We show local adaptation of the global model allows our
method to outperform centralized matrix-factorization-based recommender system
models, both in terms of accuracy of matrix reconstruction and in terms of
relevance of the recommendations, while maintaining provable privacy
guarantees. We also show that our method is more robust and is characterized by
smaller variance than individual models learned by independent entities.

  Interactive search sessions often contain multiple queries, where the user
submits a reformulated version of the previous query in response to the
original results. We aim to enhance the query recommendation experience for a
commercial image search engine. Our proposed methodology incorporates current
state-of-the-art practices from relevant literature -- the use of
generation-based sequence-to-sequence models that capture session context, and
a multitask architecture that simultaneously optimizes the ranking of results.
We extend this setup by driving the learning of such a model with captions of
clicked images as the target, instead of using the subsequent query within the
session. Since these captions tend to be linguistically richer, the
reformulation mechanism can be seen as assistance to construct more descriptive
queries. In addition, via the use of a pairwise loss for the secondary ranking
task, we show that the generated reformulations are more diverse.

Title: Fake Review Detection Using Behavioral and Contextual Features
Authors: Jay Kumar
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  User reviews reflect significant value of product in the world of e-market.
Many firms or product providers hire spammers for misleading new customers by
posting spam reviews. There are three types of fake reviews, untruthful
reviews, brand reviews and non-reviews. All three types mislead the new
customers. A multinomial organization "Yelp" is separating fake reviews from
non-fake reviews since last decade. However, there are many e-commerce sites
which do not filter fake and non-fake reviews separately. Automatic fake review
detection is focused by researcher for last ten years. Many approaches and
feature set are proposed for improving classification model of fake review
detection. There are two types of dataset commonly used in this research area:
psuedo fake and real life reviews. Literature reports low performance of
classification model real life dataset if compared with pseudo fake reviews.
After investigation behavioral and contextual features are proved important for
fake review detection Our research has exploited important behavioral feature
of reviewer named as "reviewer deviation". Our study comprises of investigating
reviewer deviation with other contextual and behavioral features. We
empirically proved importance of selected feature set for classification model
to identify fake reviews. We ranked features in selected feature set where
reviewer deviation achieved ninth rank. To assess the viability of selected
feature set we scaled dataset and concluded that scaling dataset can improve
recall as well as accuracy. Our selected feature set contains a contextual
feature which capture text similarity between reviews of a reviewer. We
experimented on NNC, LTC and BM25 term weighting schemes for calculating text
similarity of reviews. We report that BM25 outperformed other term weighting
scheme.

  To solve the information explosion problem and enhance user experience in
various online applications, recommender systems have been developed to model
users preferences. Although numerous efforts have been made toward more
personalized recommendations, recommender systems still suffer from several
challenges, such as data sparsity and cold start. In recent years, generating
recommendations with the knowledge graph as side information has attracted
considerable interest. Such an approach can not only alleviate the
abovementioned issues for a more accurate recommendation, but also provide
explanations for recommended items. In this paper, we conduct a systematical
survey of knowledge graph-based recommender systems. We collect recently
published papers in this field and summarize them from two perspectives. On the
one hand, we investigate the proposed algorithms by focusing on how the papers
utilize the knowledge graph for accurate and explainable recommendation. On the
other hand, we introduce datasets used in these works. Finally, we propose
several potential research directions in this field.

  We introduce the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine)
Dataset for Scientific Entity Extraction, Classification, and Resolution,
version 1.0 (STEM-ECR v1.0). The STEM-ECR v1.0 dataset has been developed to
provide a benchmark for the evaluation of scientific entity extraction,
classification, and resolution tasks in a domain-independent fashion. It
comprises abstracts in 10 STEM disciplines that were found to be the most
prolific ones on a major publishing platform. We describe the creation of such
a multidisciplinary corpus and highlight the obtained findings in terms of the
following features: 1) a generic conceptual formalism for scientific entities
in a multidisciplinary scientific context; 2) the feasibility of the
domain-independent human annotation of scientific entities under such a generic
formalism; 3) a performance benchmark obtainable for automatic extraction of
multidisciplinary scientific entities using BERT-based neural models; 4) a
delineated 3-step entity resolution procedure for human annotation of the
scientific entities via encyclopedic entity linking and lexicographic word
sense disambiguation; and 5) human evaluations of Babelfy returned encyclopedic
links and lexicographic senses for our entities. Our findings cumulatively
indicate that human annotation and automatic learning of multidisciplinary
scientific concepts as well as their semantic disambiguation in a wide-ranging
setting as STEM is reasonable.

Title: High Rate Communication over One-Bit Quantized Channels via Deep
  Learning and LDPC Codes
Authors: Eren Balevi and Jeffrey G. Andrews
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  This paper proposes a method for designing error correction codes by
combining a known coding scheme with an autoencoder. Specifically, we integrate
an LDPC code with a trained autoencoder to develop an error correction code for
intractable nonlinear channels. The LDPC encoder shrinks the input space of the
autoencoder, which enables the autoencoder to learn more easily. The proposed
error correction code shows promising results for one-bit quantization, a
challenging case of a nonlinear channel. Specifically, our design gives a
waterfall slope bit error rate even with high order modulation formats such as
16-QAM and 64-QAM despite one-bit quantization. This gain is theoretically
grounded by proving that the trained autoencoder provides approximately
Gaussian distributed data to the LDPC decoder even though the received signal
has non-Gaussian statistics due to the one-bit quantization.

Title: A new construction of Algebraic Geometry code using Trace function
Authors: Nupur Patanker, Sanjay Kumar Singh
Categories: cs.IT math.AG math.IT
MSC-class: 14H05, 94B27, 94B05
\\
  In this note, we give a construction of Algebraic-Geometry codes on algebraic
function field $F/ \mathbb{F}_{q}$ using places of $F$ (not necessarily of
degree one) and trace functions from various extensions of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We
compute a bound on the dimension of this code. We also determine a bound on the
minimum distance of this code in terms of $B_{r}(F)$ ( the number of places of
degree $r$ in $F$), $1 \leq r < \infty$. This code is a generalization of the
geometric Goppa code, with no restriction on the length of the code except the
support condition on divisors defining the code. We obtained few quasi-cyclic
codes over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ as examples of these codes.

Title: Energy-Efficient Federated Edge Learning with Joint Communication and
  Computation Design
Authors: Xiaopeng Mo and Jie Xu
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: Submiited for possible publication
\\
  This paper studies a federated edge learning system, in which an edge server
coordinates a set of edge devices to train a shared machine learning model
based on their locally distributed data samples. During the distributed
training, we exploit the joint communication and computation design for
improving the system energy efficiency, in which both the communication
resource allocation for global ML parameters aggregation and the computation
resource allocation for locally updating MLparameters are jointly optimized. In
particular, we consider two transmission protocols for edge devices to upload
ML parameters to edge server, based on the non orthogonal multiple access and
time division multiple access, respectively. Under both protocols, we minimize
the total energy consumption at all edge devices over a particular finite
training duration subject to a given training accuracy, by jointly optimizing
the transmission power and rates at edge devices for uploading MLparameters and
their central processing unit frequencies for local update. We propose
efficient algorithms to optimally solve the formulated energy minimization
problems by using the techniques from convex optimization. Numerical results
show that as compared to other benchmark schemes, our proposed joint
communication and computation design significantly improves the energy
efficiency of the federated edge learning system, by properly balancing the
energy tradeoff between communication and computation.

Title: Secure Polar Coding for Adversarial Wiretap Channel
Authors: Yizhi Zhao and Hongmei Chi
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  The adversarial wiretap channel (AWTC) model is a secure communication model
that eavesdropper can directly read and write fractions of the transmitted bits
in legitimate communication. In this paper we propose a secure polar coding
scheme to provide secure and reliable communication over the AWTC model. For
the adversarial reading and writing action, we present a $\rho$ equivalent
channel block and apply the non-stationary polarization on it. By comparing the
polarization result of $\rho$ equivalent channel block with a $\rho$ BEC block
(channel block of BEC with erase probability $\rho$), we find that the
polarized subsets of $\rho$ BEC block is fully contained by the polarized
subsets of $\rho$ equivalent channel block by choosing the polarization
parameter $\beta$ properly. Based on this observation, we construct a secure
polar coding scheme on the $\rho$ BEC blocks for the AWTC model. We
theoretically prove that the proposed scheme achieves the secrecy capacity of
AWTC model under both reliability and strong security criterions with an
infinite block length $N$. Further, by simulations, we prove that the proposed
scheme can provide secure and reliable communication over AWTC model with a
finite block length $N$.

\\
  While Remote control over wireless connections is a key enabler for scalable
control systems consisting of multiple actuator-sensor pairs, i.e., control
systems, it entails two technical challenges. Due to the lack of wireless
resources, only a limited number of control systems can be served, making the
state observations outdated. Further, even after scheduling, the state
observations received through wireless channels are distorted, hampering
control stability. To address these issues, in this article we propose a
scheduling algorithm that guarantees the age-of-information (AoI) of the last
received states. Meanwhile, for non-scheduled sensor-actuator pairs, we propose
a machine learning (ML) aided predictive control algorithm, in which states are
predicted using a Gaussian process regression (GPR). Since the GPR prediction
credibility decreases with the AoI of the input data, both predictive control
and AoI-based scheduler should be co-designed. Hence, we formulate a joint
scheduling and transmission power optimization via the Lyapunov optimization
framework. Numerical simulations corroborate that the proposed co-designed
predictive control and AoI based scheduling achieves lower control errors,
compared to a benchmark scheme using a round-robin scheduler without state
prediction.

Title: Downlink Secrecy Rate of One-Bit Massive MIMO System with Active
  Eavesdropping
Authors: M. A. Teeti
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 49 pages (onecolumn), 12 figures (Available in IEEE ACCESS(early
  access): https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9006840)
DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2975540
\\
  In this study, we consider the physical layer security in the downlink of a
Massive MIMO system employing one-bit quantization at the base station (BS). We
assume an active eavesdropper that attempts to spoiling the channel estimation
acquisition at the BS for a legitimate user, whereas overhearing on downlink
transmission. We consider the two most widespread methods for degrading the
eavesdropper's channel, the nullspace artificial noise (NS-AN) and random
artificial noise (R-AN). Then, we present a lower bound on the secrecy rate and
asymptotic performance, considering zero-forcing beamforming (ZF-BF) and
maximum-ratio transmission beamforming (MRT-BF). Our results reveal that even
when the eavesdropper is close enough to the intercepted user, a positive
secrecy rate --which tends to saturation with increasing the number of BS
antennas $N$---is possible, as long as the transmit power of eavesdropper is
less than that of the legitimate user during channel training. We show that
ZF-BF with NS-AN provides the best performance. It is found that MRT-BF and
ZF-BF are equivalent in the asymptotic limit of $N$ and hence the artificial
noise technique is the performance indicator. Moreover, we study the impact of
\emph{power-scaling law} on the secrecy rate. When the transmit power of BS is
reduced proportional to $1/N$, the performance is independent of artificial
noise asymptotically and hence the beamforming technique is the performance
indicator. In addition, when the BS's power is reduced proportional to
$1/\sqrt{N}$, all combinations of beamforming and artificial noise schemes are
equally likely asymptotically, independent of quantization noise. We present
various numerical results to corroborate our analysis.

Title: The Rate Distortion Function of Asynchronously Sampled Memoryless
  Cyclostationary Gaussian Processes
Authors: Emeka Abakasanga, Nir Shlezinger, Ron Dabora
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Man-made communications signals are typically modelled as continuous-time
(CT) wide-sense cyclostationary (WSCS) processes. As modern processing is
digital, it operates on sampled versions of the CT signals. When sampling is
applied to a CT WSCS process, the statistics of the resulting discrete-time
(DT) process depends on the relationship between the sampling interval and the
period of the statistics of the CT process: When these two parameters have a
common integer factor, then the DT process is WSCS. This situation is referred
to as synchronous sampling. When this is not the case, which is referred to as
asynchronous sampling, the resulting DT process is wide-sense almost
cyclostationary (WSACS). In this work, we study the fundamental tradeoff of
sources codes applied to sampled CT WSCS processes, namely, their
rate-distortion function (RDF). We note that RDF characterization for the case
of synchronous sampling directly follows from classic information-theoretic
tools utilizing ergodicity and the law of large numbers; however, when sampling
is asynchronous, the resulting process is not information stable. In such
cases, commonly used information-theoretic tools are inapplicable to RDF
analysis, which poses a major challenge. Using the information spectrum
framework, we show that the RDF for asynchronous sampling in the low distortion
regime can be expressed as the limit superior of a sequence of RDFs in which
each element corresponds to the RDF of a synchronously sampled WSCS process
(but their limit is not guaranteed to exist). The resulting characterization
allows us to introduce novel insights on the relationship between sampling
synchronization and RDF. For example, we demonstrate that, differently from
stationary processes, small differences in the sampling rate and the sampling
time offset can notably affect the RDF of sampled CT WSCS processes.

Title: AoI and Energy Consumption Oriented Dynamic Status Updating in Caching
  Enabled IoT Networks
Authors: Chao Xu, Xijun Wang, Howard H. Yang, Hongguang Sun, Tony Q. S. Quek

\\
  Caching has been regarded as a promising technique to alleviate energy
consumption of sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) networks by responding to
users' requests with the data packets stored in the edge caching node (ECN).
For real-time applications in caching enabled IoT networks, it is essential to
develop dynamic status update strategies to strike a balance between the
information freshness experienced by users and energy consumed by the sensor,
which, however, is not well addressed. In this paper, we first depict the
evolution of information freshness, in terms of age of information (AoI), at
each user. Then, we formulate a dynamic status update optimization problem to
minimize the expectation of a long term accumulative cost, which jointly
considers the users' AoI and sensor's energy consumption. To solve this
problem, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is formulated to cast the status
updating procedure, and a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm is
proposed, with which the challenge brought by the unknown of the formulated
MDP's dynamics can be addressed. Finally, simulations are conducted to validate
the convergence of our proposed algorithm and its effectiveness compared with
the zero-wait baseline policy.

Title: Average Age of Changed Information in the Internet of Things
Authors: Wenrui Lin, Xijun Wang, Chao Xu, Xinghua Sun, Xiang Chen

Comments: Accepted by IEEE WCNC 2020
\\
  The freshness of status updates is imperative in mission-critical Internet of
things (IoT) applications. Recently, Age of Information (AoI) has been proposed
to measure the freshness of updates at the receiver. However, AoI only
characterizes the freshness over time, but ignores the freshness in the
content. In this paper, we introduce a new performance metric, Age of Changed
Information (AoCI), which captures both the passage of time and the change of
information content. Also, we examine the AoCI in a time-slotted status update
system, where a sensor samples the physical process and transmits the update
packets with a cost. We formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find the
optimal updating policy that minimizes the weighted sum of the AoCI and the
update cost. Particularly, in a special case that the physical process is
modeled by a two-state discrete time Markov chain with equal transition
probability, we show that the optimal policy is of threshold type with respect
to the AoCI and derive the closed-form of the threshold. Finally, simulations
are conducted to exhibit the performance of the threshold policy and its
superiority over the zero-wait baseline policy.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Fresh Data Collection in UAV-assisted
  IoT Networks
Authors: Mengjie Yi, Xijun Wang, Juan Liu, Yan Zhang, Bo Bai

Comments: Accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2020-AoI workshop
\\
  Due to the flexibility and low operational cost, dispatching unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) to collect information from distributed sensors is expected to
be a promising solution in Internet of Things (IoT), especially for
time-critical applications. How to maintain the information freshness is a
challenging issue. In this paper, we investigate the fresh data collection
problem in UAV-assisted IoT networks. Particularly, the UAV flies towards the
sensors to collect status update packets within a given duration while
maintaining a non-negative residual energy. We formulate a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) to find the optimal flight trajectory of the UAV and transmission
scheduling of the sensors that minimizes the weighted sum of the age of
information (AoI). A UAV-assisted data collection algorithm based on deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is further proposed to overcome the curse of
dimensionality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
DRL-based algorithm can significantly reduce the weighted sum of the AoI
compared to other baseline algorithms.

Title: Timely Synchronization with Sporadic Status Changes
Authors: Chenghao Deng, Jing Yang, Changyong Pan
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we consider a status updating system where the transmitter
sends status updates of the signal it monitors to the destination through a
rate-limited link. We consider the scenario where the status of the monitored
signal only changes at discrete time points. The objective is to let the
destination be synchronized with the source in a timely manner once a status
change happens. What complicates the problem is that the transmission takes
multiple time slots due to the link-rate constraint. Thus, the transmitter has
to decide to switch or to skip a new update when the status of the monitored
signal changes and it has not completed the transmission of the previous one
yet. We adopt a metric called "Age of Synchronization" (AoS) to measure the
"dissatisfaction" of the destination when it is desynchronized with the source.
Then, the objective of this paper is to minimize the time-average AoS by
designing optimal transmission policies for the transmitter. We formulate the
problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and prove the multi-threshold
structure of the optimal policy. Based on that, we propose a low
computational-complexity algorithm for the MDP value iteration. We then
evaluate the performance of the multi-threshold policy through simulations and
compare it with two baseline policies and the AoI-optimal policy.

Title: Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Multi-User OFDMA: Channel
  Estimation and Training Design
Authors: Beixiong Zheng, Changsheng You, Rui Zhang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted to IEEE for possible publication. In this paper, we derive
  and compare the fundamental limits on the minimum training overhead, the
  maximum number of supportable users, and channel estimation error of the two
  proposed multi-user channel estimation schemes in an IRS-assisted multi-user
  broadband communication system
\\
  To achieve the full passive beamforming gains of intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS), accurate channel state information (CSI) is indispensable but
practically challenging to acquire, due to the excessive amount of channel
parameters to be estimated which increases with the number of IRS reflecting
elements as well as that of IRS-served users. To tackle this challenge, we
propose in this paper two efficient channel estimation schemes for different
channel setups in an IRS-assisted multi-user broadband communication system
employing the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). The first
channel estimation scheme, which estimates the CSI of all users in parallel
simultaneously at the access point (AP), is applicable for arbitrary
frequency-selective fading channels. In contrast, the second channel estimation
scheme, which exploits a key property that all users share the same (common)
IRS-AP channel to enhance the training efficiency and support more users, is
proposed for the typical scenario with line-of-sight (LoS) dominant user-IRS
channels. For the two proposed channel estimation schemes, we further optimize
their corresponding training designs (including pilot tone allocations for all
users and IRS time-varying reflection pattern) to minimize the channel
estimation error. Moreover, we derive and compare the fundamental limits on the
minimum training overhead and the maximum number of supportable users of these
two schemes. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
channel estimation schemes and training designs, and show their significant
performance improvement over various benchmark schemes.

Title: Smooth Strongly Convex Regression
Authors: Andrea Simonetto
Categories: cs.IT math.IT math.OC
Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Convex regression (CR) is the problem of fitting a convex function to a
finite number of noisy observations of an underlying convex function. CR is
important in many domains and one of its workhorses is the non-parametric least
square estimator (LSE). Currently, LSE delivers only non-smooth non-strongly
convex function estimates. In this paper, leveraging recent results in convex
interpolation, we generalize LSE to smooth strongly convex regression problems.
The resulting algorithm relies on a convex quadratically constrained quadratic
program. We also propose a parallel implementation, which leverages ADMM, that
lessens the overall computational complexity to a tight $O(n^2)$ for $n$
observations. Numerical results support our findings.

Title: A new method for constructing EAQEC MDS codes
Authors: Peng Hu and Xiusheng Liu
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 16 pages,3 tables
\\
  Entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting (EAQEC) codes make use of
preexisting entanglement between the sender and receiver to boost the rate of
transmission. It is possible to construct an EAQEC code from any classical
linear code, unlike standard quantum error-correcting codes, which can only be
constructed from dual-containing codes. However, the number $c$ of pre-shared
maximally entangled states is usually calculated by computer search. In this
paper, we first give a new formula for calculating the number $c$ of pre-shared
maximally entangled states. Then, using this formula, we construct three
classes of new entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting
maximum-distance-separable ( EAQEC MDS) codes.

Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, journal
\\
  Detecting the presence of a valid signal is an important task of a
telecommunication receiver. When the receiver is unable to detect the presence
of a valid signal, due to noise and fading, it is referred to as an erasure.
This work deals with the probability of erasure computation for orthogonal
frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) signals used by multiple input multiple
output (MIMO) systems. The theoretical results are validated by computer
simulations. OFDM is widely used in present day wireless communication systems
due to its ability to mitigate intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by
frequency selective fading channels. MIMO systems offer the advantage of
spatial multiplexing, resulting in increased bit-rate, which is the main
requirement of the recent wireless standards like 5G and beyond.

Comments: Source code (for academic use only):
  https://github.com/LPD-EPFL/ByzantineMomentum
\\
  Momentum is a variant of gradient descent that has been proposed for its
benefits on convergence. In a distributed setting, momentum can be implemented
either at the server or the worker side. When the aggregation rule used by the
server is linear, commutativity with addition makes both deployments
equivalent. Robustness and privacy are however among motivations to abandon
linear aggregation rules. In this work, we demonstrate the benefits on
robustness of using momentum at the worker side. We first prove that computing
momentum at the workers reduces the variance-norm ratio of the gradient
estimation at the server, strengthening Byzantine resilient aggregation rules.
We then provide an extensive experimental demonstration of the robustness
effect of worker-side momentum on distributed SGD.

algorithms' performance. Optimal poisoning attacks, which can be formulated as
bilevel optimisation problems, help to assess the robustness of learning
algorithms in worst-case scenarios. However, current attacks against algorithms
with hyperparameters typically assume that these hyperparameters are constant
and thus ignore the effect the attack has on them. In this paper, we show that
this approach leads to an overly pessimistic view of the robustness of the
learning algorithms tested. We propose a novel optimal attack formulation that
considers the effect of the attack on the hyperparameters by modelling the
attack as a multiobjective bilevel optimisation problem. We apply this novel
attack formulation to ML classifiers using $L_2$ regularisation and show that,
in contrast to results previously reported in the literature, $L_2$
regularisation enhances the stability of the learning algorithms and helps to
partially mitigate poisoning attacks. Our empirical evaluation on different
datasets confirms the limitations of previous poisoning attack strategies,
evidences the benefits of using $L_2$ regularisation to dampen the effect of
poisoning attacks and shows that the regularisation hyperparameter increases as
more malicious data points are injected in the training dataset.

Title: Learned Threshold Pruning
Authors: Kambiz Azarian, Yash Bhalgat, Jinwon Lee and Tijmen Blankevoort
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This paper presents a novel differentiable method for unstructured weight
pruning of deep neural networks. Our learned-threshold pruning (LTP) method
enjoys a number of important advantages. First, it learns per-layer thresholds
via gradient descent, unlike conventional methods where they are set as input.
Making thresholds trainable also makes LTP computationally efficient, hence
scalable to deeper networks. For example, it takes less than $30$ epochs for
LTP to prune most networks on ImageNet. This is in contrast to other methods
that search for per-layer thresholds via a computationally intensive iterative
pruning and fine-tuning process. Additionally, with a novel differentiable
$L_0$ regularization, LTP is able to operate effectively on architectures with
batch-normalization. This is important since $L_1$ and $L_2$ penalties lose
their regularizing effect in networks with batch-normalization. Finally, LTP
generates a trail of progressively sparser networks from which the desired
pruned network can be picked based on sparsity and performance requirements.
These features allow LTP to achieve state-of-the-art compression rates on
ImageNet networks such as AlexNet ($26.4\times$ compression with $79.1\%$ Top-5
accuracy) and ResNet50 ($9.1\times$ compression with $92.0\%$ Top-5 accuracy).
We also show that LTP effectively prunes newer architectures, such as
EfficientNet, MobileNetV2 and MixNet.

\\
  As machine learning (ML) being applied to many mission-critical scenarios,
certifying ML model robustness becomes increasingly important. Many previous
works focuses on the robustness of independent ML and ensemble models, and can
only certify a very small magnitude of the adversarial perturbation. In this
paper, we take a different viewpoint and improve learning robustness by going
beyond independent ML and ensemble models. We aim at promoting the generic
Sensing-Reasoning machine learning pipeline which contains both the sensing
(e.g. deep neural networks) and reasoning (e.g. Markov logic networks (MLN))
components enriched with domain knowledge. Can domain knowledge help improve
learning robustness? Can we formally certify the end-to-end robustness of such
an ML pipeline?
  We first theoretically analyze the computational complexity of checking the
provable robustness in the reasoning component. We then derive the provable
robustness bound for several concrete reasoning components. We show that for
reasoning components such as MLN and a specific family of Bayesian networks it
is possible to certify the robustness of the whole pipeline even with a large
magnitude of perturbation which cannot be certified by existing work. Finally,
we conduct extensive real-world experiments on large scale datasets to evaluate
the certified robustness for Sensing-Reasoning ML pipelines.

Title: Determination of Latent Dimensionality in International Trade Flow
Authors: Duc P. Truong, Erik Skau, Vladimir I. Valtchinov, Boian S. Alexandrov
Categories: cs.LG cs.IR econ.GN q-fin.EC stat.ML
\\
  Currently, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous in data science, which
necessitates the development of techniques to decompose and interpret such
multidimensional (aka tensor) datasets. Finding a low dimensional
representation of the data, that is, its inherent structure, is one of the
approaches that can serve to understand the dynamics of low dimensional latent
features hidden in the data. Nonnegative RESCAL is one such technique,
particularly well suited to analyze self-relational data, such as dynamic
networks found in international trade flows. Nonnegative RESCAL computes a low
dimensional tensor representation by finding the latent space containing
multiple modalities. Estimating the dimensionality of this latent space is
crucial for extracting meaningful latent features. Here, to determine the
dimensionality of the latent space with nonnegative RESCAL, we propose a latent
dimension determination method which is based on clustering of the solutions of
multiple realizations of nonnegative RESCAL decompositions. We demonstrate the
performance of our model selection method on synthetic data and then we apply
our method to decompose a network of international trade flows data from
International Monetary Fund and validate the resulting features against
empirical facts from economic literature.

Title: Gradient-Based Deep Quantization of Neural Networks through Sinusoidal
  Adaptive Regularization
Authors: Ahmed T. Elthakeb, Prannoy Pilligundla, Fatemehsadat Mireshghallah,
  Tarek Elgindi, Charles-Alban Deledalle, Hadi Esmaeilzadeh
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Preliminary work. Under review
\\
  As deep neural networks make their ways into different domains, their compute
efficiency is becoming a first-order constraint. Deep quantization, which
reduces the bitwidth of the operations (below 8 bits), offers a unique
opportunity as it can reduce both the storage and compute requirements of the
network super-linearly. However, if not employed with diligence, this can lead
to significant accuracy loss. Due to the strong inter-dependence between layers
and exhibiting different characteristics across the same network, choosing an
optimal bitwidth per layer granularity is not a straight forward. As such, deep
quantization opens a large hyper-parameter space, the exploration of which is a
major challenge. We propose a novel sinusoidal regularization, called SINAREQ,
for deep quantized training. Leveraging the sinusoidal properties, we seek to
learn multiple quantization parameterization in conjunction during
gradient-based training process. Specifically, we learn (i) a per-layer
quantization bitwidth along with (ii) a scale factor through learning the
period of the sinusoidal function. At the same time, we exploit the
periodicity, differentiability, and the local convexity profile in sinusoidal
functions to automatically propel (iii) network weights towards values
quantized at levels that are jointly determined. We show how SINAREQ balance
compute efficiency and accuracy, and provide a heterogeneous bitwidth
assignment for quantization of a large variety of deep networks (AlexNet,
CIFAR-10, MobileNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-20, SVHN, and VGG-11) that virtually
preserves the accuracy. Furthermore, we carry out experimentation using fixed
homogenous bitwidths with 3- to 5-bit assignment and show the versatility of
SINAREQ in enhancing quantized training algorithms (DoReFa and WRPN) with about
4.8% accuracy improvements on average, and then outperforming multiple
state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: Training BatchNorm and Only BatchNorm: On the Expressive Power of Random
  Features in CNNs
Authors: Jonathan Frankle, David J. Schwab, and Ari S. Morcos
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  Batch normalization (BatchNorm) has become an indispensable tool for training
deep neural networks, yet it is still poorly understood. Although previous work
has typically focused on its normalization component, BatchNorm also adds two
per-feature trainable parameters: a coefficient and a bias. However, the role
and expressive power of these parameters remains unclear. To study this
question, we investigate the performance achieved when training only these
parameters and freezing all others at their random initializations. We find
that doing so leads to surprisingly high performance. For example, a
sufficiently deep ResNet reaches 83% accuracy on CIFAR-10 in this
configuration. Interestingly, BatchNorm achieves this performance in part by
naturally learning to disable around a third of the random features without any
changes to the training objective. Not only do these results highlight the
under-appreciated role of the affine parameters in BatchNorm, but - in a
broader sense - they characterize the expressive power of neural networks
constructed simply by shifting and rescaling random features.

Title: Learning Near Optimal Policies with Low Inherent Bellman Error
Authors: Andrea Zanette, Alessandro Lazaric, Mykel Kochenderfer, Emma Brunskill
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  We study the exploration problem with approximate linear action-value
functions in episodic reinforcement learning under the notion of low inherent
Bellman error, a condition normally employed to show convergence of approximate
value iteration. First we relate this condition to other common frameworks and
show that it is strictly more general than the low rank (or linear) MDP
assumption of prior work. Second we provide an algorithm with a high
probability regret bound $\widetilde O(\sum_{t=1}^H d_t \sqrt{K} + \sum_{t=1}^H
\sqrt{d_t} \IBE K)$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes,
$\IBE$ is the value if the inherent Bellman error and $d_t$ is the feature
dimension at timestep $t$. In addition, we show that the result is unimprovable
beyond constants and logs by showing a matching lower bound. This has two
important consequences: 1) the algorithm has the optimal statistical rate for
this setting which is more general than prior work on low-rank MDPs 2) the lack
of closedness (measured by the inherent Bellman error) is only amplified by
$\sqrt{d_t}$ despite working in the online setting. Finally, the algorithm
reduces to the celebrated \textsc{LinUCB} when $H=1$ but with a different
choice of the exploration parameter that allows handling misspecified
contextual linear bandits. While computational tractability questions remain
open for the MDP setting, this enriches the class of MDPs with a linear
representation for the action-value function where statistically efficient
reinforcement learning is possible.

Title: Decentralized Multi-player Multi-armed Bandits with No Collision
  Information
Authors: Chengshuai Shi, Wei Xiong, Cong Shen, Jing Yang
Categories: cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
Comments: 17 pages, 11 figures. Accepted to AISTATS 2020
\\
  The decentralized stochastic multi-player multi-armed bandit (MP-MAB)
problem, where the collision information is not available to the players, is
studied in this paper. Building on the seminal work of Boursier and Perchet
(2019), we propose error correction synchronization involving communication
(EC-SIC), whose regret is shown to approach that of the centralized stochastic
MP-MAB with collision information. By recognizing that the communication phase
without collision information corresponds to the Z-channel model in information
theory, the proposed EC-SIC algorithm applies optimal error correction coding
for the communication of reward statistics. A fixed message length, as opposed
to the logarithmically growing one in Boursier and Perchet (2019), also plays a
crucial role in controlling the communication loss. Experiments with practical
Z-channel codes, such as repetition code, flip code and modified Hamming code,
demonstrate the superiority of EC-SIC in both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Title: TAdam: A Robust Stochastic Gradient Optimizer

\\
  Machine learning algorithms aim to find patterns from observations, which may
include some noise, especially in robotics domain. To perform well even with
such noise, we expect them to be able to detect outliers and discard them when
needed. We therefore propose a new stochastic gradient optimization method,
whose robustness is directly built in the algorithm, using the robust student-t
distribution as its core idea. Adam, the popular optimization method, is
modified with our method and the resultant optimizer, so-called TAdam, is shown
to effectively outperform Adam in terms of robustness against noise on diverse
task, ranging from regression and classification to reinforcement learning
problems.

Title: Logarithmic Regret for Adversarial Online Control
Authors: Dylan J. Foster and Max Simchowitz
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  We introduce a new algorithm for online linear-quadratic control in a known
system subject to adversarial disturbances. Existing regret bounds for this
setting scale as $\sqrt{T}$ unless strong stochastic assumptions are imposed on
the disturbance process. We give the first algorithm with logarithmic regret
for arbitrary adversarial disturbance sequences, provided the state and control
costs are given by known quadratic functions. Our algorithm and analysis use a
characterization for the optimal offline control law to reduce the online
control problem to (delayed) online learning with approximate advantage
functions. Compared to previous techniques, our approach does not need to
control movement costs for the iterates, leading to logarithmic regret.

Title: AMAGOLD: Amortized Metropolis Adjustment for Efficient Stochastic
  Gradient MCMC
Authors: Ruqi Zhang, A. Feder Cooper, Christopher De Sa
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Published at AISTATS 2020
\\
  Stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) is an efficient method
for sampling from continuous distributions. It is a faster alternative to HMC:
instead of using the whole dataset at each iteration, SGHMC uses only a
subsample. This improves performance, but introduces bias that can cause SGHMC
to converge to the wrong distribution. One can prevent this using a step size
that decays to zero, but such a step size schedule can drastically slow down
convergence. To address this tension, we propose a novel second-order SG-MCMC
algorithm---AMAGOLD---that infrequently uses Metropolis-Hastings (M-H)
corrections to remove bias. The infrequency of corrections amortizes their
cost. We prove AMAGOLD converges to the target distribution with a fixed,
rather than a diminishing, step size, and that its convergence rate is at most
a constant factor slower than a full-batch baseline. We empirically demonstrate
AMAGOLD's effectiveness on synthetic distributions, Bayesian logistic
regression, and Bayesian neural networks.

Title: Contextual Policy Reuse using Deep Mixture Models
Authors: Michael Gimelfarb, Scott Sanner, Chi-Guhn Lee
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Reinforcement learning methods that consider the context, or current state,
when selecting source policies for transfer have been shown to outperform
context-free approaches. However, existing work typically tailors the approach
to a specific learning algorithm such as Q-learning, and it is often difficult
to interpret and validate the knowledge transferred between tasks. In this
paper, we assume knowledge of estimated source task dynamics and policies, and
common goals between tasks. We introduce a novel deep mixture model formulation
for learning a state-dependent prior over source task dynamics that matches the
target dynamics using only state trajectories obtained while learning the
target policy. The mixture model is easy to train and interpret, is compatible
with most reinforcement learning algorithms, and complements existing work by
leveraging knowledge of source dynamics rather than Q-values. We then show how
the trained mixture model can be incorporated into standard policy reuse
frameworks, and demonstrate its effectiveness on benchmarks from OpenAI-Gym.

Title: Multiplicative Gaussian Particle Filter
Authors: Xuan Su, Wee Sun Lee, Zhen Zhang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose a new sampling-based approach for approximate inference in
filtering problems. Instead of approximating conditional distributions with a
finite set of states, as done in particle filters, our approach approximates
the distribution with a weighted sum of functions from a set of continuous
functions. Central to the approach is the use of sampling to approximate
multiplications in the Bayes filter. We provide theoretical analysis, giving
conditions for sampling to give good approximation. We next specialize to the
case of weighted sums of Gaussians, and show how properties of Gaussians enable
closed-form transition and efficient multiplication. Lastly, we conduct
preliminary experiments on a robot localization problem and compare performance
with the particle filter, to demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.

Title: Deep differentiable forest with sparse attention for the tabular data
Authors: Yingshi Chen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 6 pages,3 figures
\\
  We present a general architecture of deep differentiable forest and its
sparse attention mechanism. The differentiable forest has the advantages of
both trees and neural networks. Its structure is a simple binary tree, easy to
use and understand. It has full differentiability and all variables are
learnable parameters. We would train it by the gradient-based optimization
method, which shows great power in the training of deep CNN. We find and
analyze the attention mechanism in the differentiable forest. That is, each
decision depends on only a few important features, and others are irrelevant.
The attention is always sparse. Based on this observation, we improve its
sparsity by data-aware initialization. We use the attribute importance to
initialize the attention weight. Then the learned weight is much sparse than
that from random initialization. Our experiment on some large tabular dataset
shows differentiable forest has higher accuracy than GBDT, which is the state
of art algorithm for tabular datasets. The source codes are available at

Title: An End-to-End Graph Convolutional Kernel Support Vector Machine
Authors: Padraig Corcoran
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A novel kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) for graph classification is
proposed. The SVM feature space mapping consists of a sequence of graph
convolutional layers, which generates a vector space representation for each
vertex, followed by a pooling layer which generates a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS) representation for the graph. The use of a RKHS offers the
ability to implicitly operate in this space using a kernel function without the
computational complexity of explicitly mapping into it. The proposed model is
trained in a supervised end-to-end manner whereby the convolutional layers, the
kernel function and SVM parameters are jointly optimized with respect to a
regularized classification loss. This approach is distinct from existing
kernel-based graph classification models which instead either use feature
engineering or unsupervised learning to define the kernel function.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing
deep learning baseline models on a number of datasets.

  Learning

\\
  As a means of decentralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has
recently drawn considerable attentions. One of the prominent advantages of FL
is its capability of preventing clients' data from being directly exposed to
external adversaries. Nevertheless, via a viewpoint of information theory, it
is still possible for an attacker to steal private information from
eavesdropping upon the shared models uploaded by FL clients. In order to
address this problem, we develop a novel privacy preserving FL framework based
on the concept of differential privacy (DP). To be specific, we first borrow
the concept of local DP and introduce a client-level DP (CDP) by adding
artificial noises to the shared models before uploading them to servers. Then,
we prove that our proposed CDP algorithm can satisfy the DP guarantee with
adjustable privacy protection levels by varying the variances of the artificial
noises. More importantly, we derive a theoretical convergence upper-bound of
the CDP algorithm. Our derived upper-bound reveals that there exists an optimal
number of communication rounds to achieve the best convergence performance in
terms of loss function values for a given privacy protection level.
Furthermore, to obtain this optimal number of communication rounds, which
cannot be derived in a closed-form expression, we propose a communication
rounds discounting (CRD) method. Compared with the heuristic searching method,
our proposed CRD can achieve a much better trade-off between the computational
complexity of searching for the optimal number and the convergence performance.
Extensive experiments indicate that our CDP algorithm with an optimization on
the number of communication rounds using the proposed CRD can effectively
improve both the FL training efficiency and FL model quality for a given
privacy protection level.

  Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm in which a
large number of clients coordinate with a central server to learn a model
without sharing their own training data. Due to the heterogeneity of the client
datasets, standard federated optimization methods such as Federated Averaging
(FedAvg) are often difficult to tune and exhibit unfavorable convergence
behavior. In non-federated settings, adaptive optimization methods have had
notable success in combating such issues. In this work, we propose federated
versions of adaptive optimizers, including Adagrad, Adam, and Yogi, and analyze
their convergence in the presence of heterogeneous data for general nonconvex
settings. Our results highlight the interplay between client heterogeneity and
communication efficiency. We also perform extensive experiments on these
methods and show that the use of adaptive optimizers can significantly improve
the performance of federated learning.

Title: Toward a theory of optimization for over-parameterized systems of
  non-linear equations: the lessons of deep learning
Authors: Chaoyue Liu, Libin Zhu, Mikhail Belkin
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  The success of deep learning is due, to a great extent, to the remarkable
effectiveness of gradient-based optimization methods applied to large neural
networks. In this work we isolate some general mathematical structures allowing
for efficient optimization in over-parameterized systems of non-linear
equations, a setting that includes deep neural networks. In particular, we show
that optimization problems corresponding to such systems are not convex, even
locally, but instead satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition allowing for
efficient optimization by gradient descent or SGD. We connect the PL condition
of these systems to the condition number associated to the tangent kernel and
develop a non-linear theory parallel to classical analyses of
over-parameterized linear equations. We discuss how these ideas apply to
training shallow and deep neural networks. Finally, we point out that tangent
kernels associated to certain large system may be far from constant, even
locally. Yet, our analysis still allows to demonstrate existence of solutions
and convergence of gradient descent and SGD.

Title: Calibrated Prediction with Covariate Shift via Unsupervised Domain
  Adaptation
Authors: Sangdon Park, Osbert Bastani, James Weimer, Insup Lee
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted to AISTATS 2020
\\
  Reliable uncertainty estimates are an important tool for helping autonomous
agents or human decision makers understand and leverage predictive models.
However, existing approaches to estimating uncertainty largely ignore the
possibility of covariate shift--i.e., where the real-world data distribution
may differ from the training distribution. As a consequence, existing
algorithms can overestimate certainty, possibly yielding a false sense of
confidence in the predictive model. We propose an algorithm for calibrating
predictions that accounts for the possibility of covariate shift, given labeled
examples from the training distribution and unlabeled examples from the
real-world distribution. Our algorithm uses importance weighting to correct for
the shift from the training to the real-world distribution. However, importance
weighting relies on the training and real-world distributions to be
sufficiently close. Building on ideas from domain adaptation, we additionally
learn a feature map that tries to equalize these two distributions. In an

approaches to calibrated prediction when there is covariate shift.

Title: Contextual-Bandit Based Personalized Recommendation with Time-Varying
  User Interests
Authors: Xiao Xu, Fang Dong, Yanghua Li, Shaojian He, Xin Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by AAAI 20
\\
  A contextual bandit problem is studied in a highly non-stationary
environment, which is ubiquitous in various recommender systems due to the
time-varying interests of users. Two models with disjoint and hybrid payoffs
are considered to characterize the phenomenon that users' preferences towards
different items vary differently over time. In the disjoint payoff model, the
reward of playing an arm is determined by an arm-specific preference vector,
which is piecewise-stationary with asynchronous and distinct changes across
different arms. An efficient learning algorithm that is adaptive to abrupt
reward changes is proposed and theoretical regret analysis is provided to show
that a sublinear scaling of regret in the time length $T$ is achieved. The
algorithm is further extended to a more general setting with hybrid payoffs
where the reward of playing an arm is determined by both an arm-specific
preference vector and a joint coefficient vector shared by all arms. Empirical
experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to verify the advantages of
the proposed learning algorithms against baseline ones in both settings.

Title: Decision Trees for Decision-Making under the Predict-then-Optimize
  Framework
Authors: Adam N. Elmachtoub, Jason Cheuk Nam Liang, Ryan McNellis
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  We consider the use of decision trees for decision-making problems under the
predict-then-optimize framework. That is, we would like to first use a decision
tree to predict unknown input parameters of an optimization problem, and then
make decisions by solving the optimization problem using the predicted
parameters. A natural loss function in this framework is to measure the
suboptimality of the decisions induced by the predicted input parameters, as
opposed to measuring loss using input parameter prediction error. This natural
loss function is known in the literature as the Smart Predict-then-Optimize
(SPO) loss, and we propose a tractable methodology called SPO Trees (SPOTs) for
training decision trees under this loss. SPOTs benefit from the
interpretability of decision trees, providing an interpretable segmentation of
contextual features into groups with distinct optimal solutions to the
optimization problem of interest. We conduct several numerical experiments on
synthetic and real data including the prediction of travel times for shortest
path problems and predicting click probabilities for news article
recommendation. We demonstrate on these datasets that SPOTs simultaneously
provide higher quality decisions and significantly lower model complexity than
other machine learning approaches (e.g., CART) trained to minimize prediction
error.

Title: Budget-Constrained Bandits over General Cost and Reward Distributions
Authors: Semih Cayci, Atilla Eryilmaz, R. Srikant
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We consider a budget-constrained bandit problem where each arm pull incurs a
random cost, and yields a random reward in return. The objective is to maximize
the total expected reward under a budget constraint on the total cost. The
model is general in the sense that it allows correlated and potentially
heavy-tailed cost-reward pairs that can take on negative values as required by
many applications. We show that if moments of order $(2+\gamma)$ for some
$\gamma > 0$ exist for all cost-reward pairs, $O(\log B)$ regret is achievable
for a budget $B>0$. In order to achieve tight regret bounds, we propose
algorithms that exploit the correlation between the cost and reward of each arm
by extracting the common information via linear minimum mean-square error
estimation. We prove a regret lower bound for this problem, and show that the
proposed algorithms achieve tight problem-dependent regret bounds, which are
optimal up to a universal constant factor in the case of jointly Gaussian cost
and reward pairs.

Title: PlaNet of the Bayesians: Reconsidering and Improving Deep Planning
  Network by Incorporating Bayesian Inference
Authors: Masashi Okada and Norio Kosaka and Tadahiro Taniguchi
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE cs.RO stat.ML
\\
  In the present paper, we propose an extension of the Deep Planning Network
(PlaNet), also referred to as PlaNet of the Bayesians (PlaNet-Bayes). There has
been a growing demand in model predictive control (MPC) in partially observable
environments in which complete information is unavailable because of, for
example, lack of expensive sensors. PlaNet is a promising solution to realize
such latent MPC, as it is used to train state-space models via model-based
reinforcement learning (MBRL) and to conduct planning in the latent space.
However, recent state-of-the-art strategies mentioned in MBRR literature, such
as involving uncertainty into training and planning, have not been considered,
significantly suppressing the training performance. The proposed extension is
to make PlaNet uncertainty-aware on the basis of Bayesian inference, in which
both model and action uncertainty are incorporated. Uncertainty in latent
models is represented using a neural network ensemble to approximately infer
model posteriors. The ensemble of optimal action candidates is also employed to
capture multimodal uncertainty in the optimality. The concept of the action
ensemble relies on a general variational inference MPC (VI-MPC) framework and
its instance, probabilistic action ensemble with trajectory sampling (PaETS).
In this paper, we extend VI-MPC and PaETS, which have been originally
introduced in previous literature, to address partially observable cases. We
experimentally compare the performances on continuous control tasks, and
conclude that our method can consistently improve the asymptotic performance
compared with PlaNet.

Comments: 14 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, AISTATS final paper reformatted for

\\
  Starting with Gilmer et al. (2018), several works have demonstrated the
inevitability of adversarial examples based on different assumptions about the
underlying input probability space. It remains unclear, however, whether these
results apply to natural image distributions. In this work, we assume the
underlying data distribution is captured by some conditional generative model,
and prove intrinsic robustness bounds for a general class of classifiers, which
solves an open problem in Fawzi et al. (2018). Building upon the
state-of-the-art conditional generative models, we study the intrinsic
robustness of two common image benchmarks under $\ell_2$ perturbations, and
show the existence of a large gap between the robustness limits implied by our
theory and the adversarial robustness achieved by current state-of-the-art
robust models. Code for all our experiments is available at

Title: Advanced kNN: A Mature Machine Learning Series
Authors: Muhammad Asim and Muaaz Zakria
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 2 figures
\\
  k-nearest neighbour (kNN) is one of the most prominent, simple and basic
algorithm used in machine learning and data mining. However, kNN has limited
prediction ability, i.e., kNN cannot predict any instance correctly if it does
not belong to any of the predefined classes in the training data set. The
purpose of this paper is to suggest an Advanced kNN (A-kNN) algorithm that will
be able to classify an instance as unknown, after verifying that it does not
belong to any of the predefined classes. Performance of kNN and A-kNN is
compared on three different data sets namely iris plant data set, BUPA liver
disorder data set, and Alpha Beta detection data set. Results of A-kNN are
significantly accurate for detecting unknown instances.

Title: A Hybrid Stochastic Policy Gradient Algorithm for Reinforcement Learning

Categories: cs.LG math.OC
Comments: Accepted for publication at the 23rd International Conference on
  Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2020)
\\
  We propose a novel hybrid stochastic policy gradient estimator by combining
an unbiased policy gradient estimator, the REINFORCE estimator, with another
biased one, an adapted SARAH estimator for policy optimization. The hybrid
policy gradient estimator is shown to be biased, but has variance reduced
property. Using this estimator, we develop a new Proximal Hybrid Stochastic
Policy Gradient Algorithm (ProxHSPGA) to solve a composite policy optimization
problem that allows us to handle constraints or regularizers on the policy
parameters. We first propose a single-looped algorithm then introduce a more
practical restarting variant. We prove that both algorithms can achieve the
best-known trajectory complexity $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-3}\right)$ to
attain a first-order stationary point for the composite problem which is better
than existing REINFORCE/GPOMDP $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-4}\right)$ and
SVRPG $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-10/3}\right)$ in the non-composite
setting. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several well-known
examples in reinforcement learning. Numerical results show that our algorithm
outperforms two existing methods on these examples. Moreover, the composite
settings indeed have some advantages compared to the non-composite ones on
certain problems.

Title: Asynchronous Policy Evaluation in Distributed Reinforcement Learning
  over Networks
Authors: Xingyu Sha, Jiaqi Zhang, Kaiqing Zhang, Keyou You and Tamer Ba\c{s}ar
Categories: cs.LG cs.MA math.OC stat.ML
\\
  This paper proposes a \emph{fully asynchronous} scheme for policy evaluation
of distributed reinforcement learning (DisRL) over peer-to-peer networks.
Without any form of coordination, nodes can communicate with neighbors and
compute their local variables using (possibly) delayed information at any time,
which is in sharp contrast to the asynchronous gossip. Thus, the proposed
scheme fully takes advantage of the distributed setting. We prove that our
method converges at a linear rate $\mathcal{O}(c^k)$ where $c\in(0,1)$ and $k$
increases by one no matter on which node updates, showing the computational
advantage by reducing the amount of synchronization. Numerical experiments show
that our method speeds up linearly w.r.t. the number of nodes, and is robust to
straggler nodes. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
theoretical analysis for asynchronous update in DisRL, including the
\emph{parallel RL} domain advocated by A3C.

  The marriage of wireless big data and machine learning techniques
revolutionizes the wireless system by the data-driven philosophy. However, the
ever exploding data volume and model complexity will limit centralized
solutions to learn and respond within a reasonable time. Therefore, scalability
becomes a critical issue to be solved. In this article, we aim to provide a
systematic discussion on the building blocks of scalable data-driven wireless
networks. On one hand, we discuss the forward-looking architecture and
computing framework of scalable data-driven systems from a global perspective.
On the other hand, we discuss the learning algorithms and model training
strategies performed at each individual node from a local perspective. We also
highlight several promising research directions in the context of scalable
data-driven wireless communications to inspire future research.

Title: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Explainable Machine Learning
Authors: Alexander Jung
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A key obstacle to the successful deployment of machine learning (ML) methods
to important application domains is the (lack of) explainability of
predictions. Explainable ML is challenging since explanations must be tailored
(personalized) to individual users with varying backgrounds. On one extreme,
users can have received graduate level education in machine learning while on
the other extreme, users might have no formal education in linear algebra.
Linear regression with few features might be perfectly interpretable for the
first group but must be considered a black-box for the latter. Using a simple
probabilistic model for the predictions and user knowledge, we formalize
explainable ML using information theory. Providing an explanation is then
considered as the task of reducing the "surprise" incurred by a prediction.
Moreover, the effect of an explanation is measured by the conditional mutual
information between the explanation and prediction, given the user background.

Title: Novelty-Prepared Few-Shot Classification
Authors: Chao Wang, Ruo-Ze Liu, Han-Jia Ye, Yang Yu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Few-shot classification algorithms can alleviate the data scarceness issue,
which is vital in many real-world problems, by adopting models pre-trained from
abundant data in other domains. However, the pre-training process was commonly
unaware of the future adaptation to other concept classes. We disclose that a
classically fully trained feature extractor can leave little embedding space
for unseen classes, which keeps the model from well-fitting the new classes. In
this work, we propose to use a novelty-prepared loss function, called
self-compacting softmax loss (SSL), for few-shot classification. The SSL can
prevent the full occupancy of the embedding space. Thus the model is more
prepared to learn new classes. In experiments on CUB-200-2011 and mini-ImageNet
datasets, we show that SSL leads to significant improvement of the
state-of-the-art performance. This work may shed some light on considering the
model capacity for few-shot classification tasks.

Title: Differentially Private Deep Learning with Smooth Sensitivity
Authors: Lichao Sun, Yingbo Zhou, Philip S. Yu, Caiming Xiong
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR
\\
  Ensuring the privacy of sensitive data used to train modern machine learning
models is of paramount importance in many areas of practice. One approach to
study these concerns is through the lens of differential privacy. In this
framework, privacy guarantees are generally obtained by perturbing models in
such a way that specifics of data used to train the model are made ambiguous. A
particular instance of this approach is through a "teacher-student" framework,
wherein the teacher, who owns the sensitive data, provides the student with
useful, but noisy, information, hopefully allowing the student model to perform
well on a given task without access to particular features of the sensitive
data. Because stronger privacy guarantees generally involve more significant
perturbation on the part of the teacher, deploying existing frameworks
fundamentally involves a trade-off between student's performance and privacy
guarantee. One of the most important techniques used in previous works involves
an ensemble of teacher models, which return information to a student based on a
noisy voting procedure. In this work, we propose a novel voting mechanism with
smooth sensitivity, which we call Immutable Noisy ArgMax, that, under certain
conditions, can bear very large random noising from the teacher without
affecting the useful information transferred to the student.
  Compared with previous work, our approach improves over the state-of-the-art
methods on all measures, and scale to larger tasks with both better performance
and stronger privacy ($\epsilon \approx 0$). This new proposed framework can be
applied with any machine learning models, and provides an appealing solution
for tasks that requires training on a large amount of data.

Comments: 41 pages
\\
  We study the Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) problem using the Constrained
Markov Decision Process (CMDP) formulation in which an agent aims to maximize
the expected total reward subject to a safety constraint on the expected total
value of a criterion function (e.g., utility). We focus on an episodic setting
with the function approximation where the reward and criterion functions and
the Markov transition kernels all have a linear structure but do not impose any
additional assumptions on the sampling model. Designing SRL algorithms with
provable computational and statistical efficiency is particularly challenging
under this setting because of the need to incorporate both the safety
constraint and the function approximation into the fundamental
exploitation/exploration tradeoff. To this end, we present an {O}ptimistic
{P}rimal-{D}ual Proximal Policy {OP}timization (OPDOP) algorithm where the
value function is estimated by combining the least-squares policy evaluation
and an additional bonus term for safe exploration. We prove that the proposed
algorithm achieves an O(d^{1.5}H^{3.5}\sqrt{T}) regret and an
O(d^{1.5}H^{3.5}\sqrt{T}) constraint violation, where d is the dimension of the
feature mapping, H is the horizon of each episode, and T is the total number of
steps. We establish these bounds under the following two settings: (i) Both the
reward and criterion functions can change adversarially but are revealed
entirely after each episode. (ii) The reward/criterion functions are fixed but
the feedback after each episode is bandit. Our bounds depend on the capacity of
the state space only through the dimension of the feature mapping and thus our
results hold even when the number of states goes to infinity. To the best of
our knowledge, we provide the first provably efficient policy optimization
algorithm for CMDPs with safe exploration.

  In complex networks, nodes that share similar structural characteristics
often exhibit similar roles (e.g type of users in a social network or the
hierarchical position of employees in a company). In order to leverage this
relationship, a growing literature proposed latent representations that
identify structurally equivalent nodes. However, most of the existing methods
require high time and space complexity. In this paper, we propose VNEstruct, a
simple approach for generating low-dimensional structural node embeddings, that
is both time efficient and robust to perturbations of the graph structure. The
proposed approach focuses on the local neighborhood of each node and employs
the Von Neumann entropy, an information-theoretic tool, to extract features
that capture the neighborhood's topology. Moreover, on graph classification
tasks, we suggest the utilization of the generated structural embeddings for
the transformation of an attributed graph structure into a set of augmented
node attributes. Empirically, we observe that the proposed approach exhibits
robustness on structural role identification tasks and state-of-the-art
performance on graph classification tasks, while maintaining very high
computational speed.

\\
  Gradient-based approximate inference methods, such as Stein variational
gradient descent (SVGD), provide simple and general-purpose inference engines
for differentiable continuous distributions. However, existing forms of SVGD
cannot be directly applied to discrete distributions. In this work, we fill
this gap by proposing a simple yet general framework that transforms discrete
distributions to equivalent piecewise continuous distributions, on which the
gradient-free SVGD is applied to perform efficient approximate inference. The
empirical results show that our method outperforms traditional algorithms such
as Gibbs sampling and discontinuous Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on various
challenging benchmarks of discrete graphical models. We demonstrate that our
method provides a promising tool for learning ensembles of binarized neural
network (BNN), outperforming other widely used ensemble methods on learning
binarized AlexNet on CIFAR-10 dataset. In addition, such transform can be
straightforwardly employed in gradient-free kernelized Stein discrepancy to
perform goodness-of-fit (GOF) test on discrete distributions. Our proposed
method outperforms existing GOF test methods for intractable discrete
distributions.

Title: MBGD-RDA Training and Similarity-Based Rule Pruning for Concise TSK
  Fuzzy Regression Models
Authors: Dongrui Wu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  To effectively train Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems for regression
problems, a Mini-Batch Gradient Descent with Regularization, DropRule, and
AdaBound (MBGD-RDA) algorithm was recently proposed. It has demonstrated
superior performances; however, there are also some limitations, e.g., it does
not allow the user to specify the number of rules directly, and only Gaussian
MFs can be used. This paper proposes two variants of MBGD-RDA to remedy these
limitations, and show that they outperform the original MBGD-RDA and the
classical ANFIS algorithms with the same number of rules. Furthermore, we also
propose a similarity-based rule-pruning algorithm for TSK fuzzy systems, which
can reduce the number of rules without sacrificing the regression performance.
Experiments showed that the rules obtained from pruning are generally better
than training them from scratch directly.

Title: Cluster-Based Social Reinforcement Learning

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Social Reinforcement Learning methods, which model agents in large networks,
are useful for fake news mitigation, personalized teaching/healthcare, and
viral marketing, but it is challenging to incorporate inter-agent dependencies
into the models effectively due to network size and sparse interaction data.
Previous social RL approaches either ignore agents dependencies or model them
in a computationally intensive manner. In this work, we incorporate agent
dependencies efficiently in a compact model by clustering users (based on their
payoff and contribution to the goal) and combine this with a method to easily
derive personalized agent-level policies from cluster-level policies. We also
propose a dynamic clustering approach that captures changing user behavior.
Experiments on real-world datasets illustrate that our proposed approach learns
more accurate policy estimates and converges more quickly, compared to several
baselines that do not use agent correlations or only use static clusters.

  To fully realize industrial automation, it is indispensable to give the robot
manipulators the ability to adapt by themselves to their surroundings and to
learn to handle novel manipulation tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods
have been proven successful in solving manipulation tasks autonomously.
However, RL is still not widely adopted on real robotic systems because working
with real hardware entails additional challenges, especially when using rigid
position-controlled manipulators. These challenges include the need for a
robust controller to avoid undesired behavior, that risk damaging the robot and
its environment, and constant supervision from a human operator. The main
contributions of this work are, first, we propose a framework for safely
training an RL agent on manipulation tasks using a rigid robot. Second, to
enable a position-controlled manipulator to perform contact-rich manipulation
tasks, we implemented two different force control schemes based on standard
force feedback controllers; one is a modified hybrid position-force control,
and the other one is an impedance control. Third, we empirically study both
control schemes when used as the action representation of an RL agent. We
evaluate the trade-off between control complexity and performance by comparing
several versions of the control schemes, each with a different number of force
control parameters. The proposed methods are validated both on simulation and a
real robot, a UR3 e-series robotic arm when executing contact-rich manipulation
tasks.

  Deep neural nets (DNNs) compression is crucial for adaptation to mobile
devices. Though many successful algorithms exist to compress naturally trained
DNNs, developing efficient and stable compression algorithms for robustly
trained DNNs remains widely open. In this paper, we focus on a co-design of
efficient DNN compression algorithms and sparse neural architectures for robust
and accurate deep learning. Such a co-design enables us to advance the goal of
accommodating both sparsity and robustness. With this objective in mind, we
leverage the relaxed augmented Lagrangian based algorithms to prune the weights
of adversarially trained DNNs, at both structured and unstructured levels.
Using a Feynman-Kac formalism principled robust and sparse DNNs, we can at
least double the channel sparsity of the adversarially trained ResNet20 for
CIFAR10 classification, meanwhile, improve the natural accuracy by $8.69$\% and
the robust accuracy under the benchmark $20$ iterations of IFGSM attack by
$5.42$\%. The code is available at

Title: Permutation Invariant Graph Generation via Score-Based Generative
  Modeling

\\
  Learning generative models for graph-structured data is challenging because
graphs are discrete, combinatorial, and the underlying data distribution is
invariant to the ordering of nodes. However, most of the existing generative
models for graphs are not invariant to the chosen ordering, which might lead to
an undesirable bias in the learned distribution. To address this difficulty, we
propose a permutation invariant approach to modeling graphs, using the recent
framework of score-based generative modeling. In particular, we design a
permutation equivariant, multi-channel graph neural network to model the
gradient of the data distribution at the input graph (a.k.a., the score
function). This permutation equivariant model of gradients implicitly defines a
permutation invariant distribution for graphs. We train this graph neural
network with score matching and sample from it with annealed Langevin dynamics.
In our experiments, we first demonstrate the capacity of this new architecture
in learning discrete graph algorithms. For graph generation, we find that our
learning approach achieves better or comparable results to existing models on
benchmark datasets.

\\
  Artificial intelligence has been applied in wildfire science and management
since the 1990s, with early applications including neural networks and expert
systems. Since then the field has rapidly progressed congruently with the wide
adoption of machine learning (ML) in the environmental sciences. Here, we
present a scoping review of ML in wildfire science and management. Our
objective is to improve awareness of ML among wildfire scientists and managers,
as well as illustrate the challenging range of problems in wildfire science
available to data scientists. We first present an overview of popular ML
approaches used in wildfire science to date, and then review their use in
wildfire science within six problem domains: 1) fuels characterization, fire
detection, and mapping; 2) fire weather and climate change; 3) fire occurrence,
susceptibility, and risk; 4) fire behavior prediction; 5) fire effects; and 6)
fire management. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML
approaches and identify opportunities for future advances in wildfire science
and management within a data science context. We identified 298 relevant
publications, where the most frequently used ML methods included random
forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector
machines, and genetic algorithms. There exists opportunities to apply more
current ML methods (e.g., deep learning and agent based learning) in wildfire
science. However, despite the ability of ML models to learn on their own,
expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure realistic modelling of
fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods
requires sophisticated knowledge for their application. Finally, we stress that
the wildfire research and management community plays an active role in
providing relevant, high quality data for use by practitioners of ML methods.

Title: Subadditivity of Probability Divergences on Bayes-Nets with Applications
  to Time Series GANs
Authors: Mucong Ding, Constantinos Daskalakis, Soheil Feizi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  GANs for time series data often use sliding windows or self-attention to
capture underlying time dependencies. While these techniques have no clear
theoretical justification, they are successful in significantly reducing the
discriminator size, speeding up the training process, and improving the
generation quality. In this paper, we provide both theoretical foundations and
a practical framework of GANs for high-dimensional distributions with
conditional independence structure captured by a Bayesian network, such as time
series data. We prove that several probability divergences satisfy
subadditivity properties with respect to the neighborhoods of the Bayes-net
graph, providing an upper bound on the distance between two Bayes-nets by the
sum of (local) distances between their marginals on every neighborhood of the
graph. This leads to our proposed Subadditive GAN framework that uses a set of
simple discriminators on the neighborhoods of the Bayes-net, rather than a
giant discriminator on the entire network, providing significant statistical
and computational benefits. We show that several probability distances
including Jensen-Shannon, Total Variation, and Wasserstein, have subadditivity
or generalized subadditivity. Moreover, we prove that Integral Probability
Metrics (IPMs), which encompass commonly-used loss functions in GANs, also
enjoy a notion of subadditivity under some mild conditions. Furthermore, we
prove that nearly all f-divergences satisfy local subadditivity in which
subadditivity holds when the distributions are relatively close. Our
experiments on synthetic as well as real-world datasets verify the proposed
theory and the benefits of subadditive GANs.

Title: Adversarial Attacks and Defenses on Graphs: A Review and Empirical Study
Authors: Wei Jin, Yaxin Li, Han Xu, Yiqi Wang and Jiliang Tang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
Comments: 22 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant performance in various
tasks. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs can be easily fooled by
small perturbation on the input, called adversarial attacks. As the extensions
of DNNs to graphs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated to
inherit this vulnerability. Adversary can mislead GNNs to give wrong
predictions by modifying the graph structure such as manipulating a few edges.
This vulnerability has arisen tremendous concerns for adapting GNNs in
safety-critical applications and has attracted increasing research attention in
recent years. Thus, it is necessary and timely to provide a comprehensive
overview of existing graph adversarial attacks and the countermeasures. In this
survey, we categorize existing attacks and defenses, and review the
corresponding state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we have developed a
repository with representative algorithms
(https://github.com/DSE-MSU/DeepRobust/tree/master/deeprobust/graph). The
repository enables us to conduct empirical studies to deepen our understandings
on attacks and defenses on graphs.

Title: Uncertainty-Gated Stochastic Sequential Model for EHR Mortality
  Prediction
Authors: Eunji Jun, Ahmad Wisnu Mulyadi, Jaehun Choi, Heung-Il Suk
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Electronic health records (EHR) are characterized as non-stationary,
heterogeneous, noisy, and sparse data; therefore, it is challenging to learn
the regularities or patterns inherent within them. In particular, sparseness
caused mostly by many missing values has attracted the attention of
researchers, who have attempted to find a better use of all available samples
for determining the solution of a primary target task through the defining a
secondary imputation problem. Methodologically, existing methods, either
deterministic or stochastic, have applied different assumptions to impute
missing values. However, once the missing values are imputed, most existing
methods do not consider the fidelity or confidence of the imputed values in the
modeling of downstream tasks. Undoubtedly, an erroneous or improper imputation
of missing variables can cause difficulties in modeling as well as a degraded
performance. In this study, we present a novel variational recurrent network
that (i) estimates the distribution of missing variables allowing to represent
uncertainty in the imputed values, (ii) updates hidden states by explicitly
applying fidelity based on a variance of the imputed values during a recurrence
(i.e., uncertainty propagation over time), and (iii) predicts the possibility
of in-hospital mortality. It is noteworthy that our model can conduct these
procedures in a single stream and learn all network parameters jointly in an
end-to-end manner. We validated the effectiveness of our method using the
public datasets of MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 by comparing with and
outperforming other state-of-the-art methods for mortality prediction
considered in our experiments. In addition, we identified the behavior of the
model that well represented the uncertainties for the imputed estimates, which
indicated a high correlation between the calculated MAE and the uncertainty.

Title: Upper Confidence Primal-Dual Optimization: Stochastically Constrained
  Markov Decision Processes with Adversarial Losses and Unknown Transitions
Authors: Shuang Qiu, Xiaohan Wei, Zhuoran Yang, Jieping Ye, Zhaoran Wang
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  We consider online learning for episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs)
with stochastic long-term budget constraints, which plays a central role in
ensuring the safety of reinforcement learning. Here the loss function can vary
arbitrarily across the episodes, whereas both the loss received and the budget
consumption are revealed at the end of each episode. Previous works solve this
problem under the restrictive assumption that the transition model of the MDP
is known a priori and establish regret bounds that depend polynomially on the
cardinalities of the state space $\mathcal{S}$ and the action space
$\mathcal{A}$. In this work, we propose a new \emph{upper confidence
primal-dual} algorithm, which only requires the trajectories sampled from the
transition model. In particular, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(L|\mathcal{S}|\sqrt{|\mathcal{A}|T})$ upper bounds of both
the regret and the constraint violation, where $L$ is the length of each
episode. Our analysis incorporates a new high-probability drift analysis of
Lagrange multiplier processes into the celebrated regret analysis of upper
confidence reinforcement learning, which demonstrates the power of "optimism in
the face of uncertainty" in constrained online learning.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Variational-Recurrent Imputation Network for Clinical
  Time Series
Authors: Ahmad Wisnu Mulyadi, Eunji Jun, Heung-Il Suk
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Electronic health records (EHR) consist of longitudinal clinical observations
portrayed with sparsity, irregularity, and high-dimensionality, which become
major obstacles in drawing reliable downstream clinical outcomes. Although
there exist great numbers of imputation methods to tackle these issues, most of
them ignore correlated features, temporal dynamics and entirely set aside the
uncertainty. Since the missing value estimates involve the risk of being
inaccurate, it is appropriate for the method to handle the less certain
information differently than the reliable data. In that regard, we can use the
uncertainties in estimating the missing values as the fidelity score to be
further utilized to alleviate the risk of biased missing value estimates. In
this work, we propose a novel variational-recurrent imputation network, which
unifies an imputation and a prediction network by taking into account the
correlated features, temporal dynamics, as well as the uncertainty.
Specifically, we leverage the deep generative model in the imputation, which is
based on the distribution among variables, and a recurrent imputation network
to exploit the temporal relations, in conjunction with utilization of the
uncertainty. We validated the effectiveness of our proposed model on two
publicly available real-world EHR datasets: PhysioNet Challenge 2012 and
MIMIC-III, and compared the results with other competing state-of-the-art
methods in the literature.

Title: Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Risk Extrapolation (REx)
Authors: David Krueger, Ethan Caballero, Joern-Henrik Jacobsen, Amy Zhang,
  Jonathan Binas, Remi Le Priol, Aaron Courville
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  Generalizing outside of the training distribution is an open challenge for
current machine learning systems. A weak form of out-of-distribution (OoD)
generalization is met when a model is able to interpolate between multiple
observed distributions. One way to achieve this is through robust optimization
where an argmax over convex combinations of the risk on different training
distributions is minimized. However, a much stronger form of OoD generalization
is the ability of models to extrapolate beyond the distributions observed
during training. Current methods targeting extrapolation are either not
scalable or require adversarial training procedures. We introduce risk
extrapolation (REx) as a simpler, yet effective alternative to previous
approaches. REx can be viewed as encouraging robustness over affine
combinations of training risks, by encouraging strict equality between training
risks. We show conceptually how this principle enables extrapolation, and
demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of instantiations of REx on
various generalization benchmarks.

Title: Stochastically Differentiable Probabilistic Programs
Authors: David Tolpin, Yuan Zhou, Hongseok Yang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Probabilistic programs with mixed support (both continuous and discrete
latent random variables) commonly appear in many probabilistic programming
systems (PPSs). However, the existence of the discrete random variables
prohibits many basic gradient-based inference engines, which makes the
inference procedure on such models particularly challenging. Existing PPSs
either require the user to manually marginalize out the discrete variables or
to perform a composing inference by running inference separately on discrete
and continuous variables. The former is infeasible in most cases whereas the
latter has some fundamental shortcomings. We present a novel approach to run
inference efficiently and robustly in such programs using stochastic gradient
Markov Chain Monte Carlo family of algorithms. We compare our stochastic
gradient-based inference algorithm against conventional baselines in several
important cases of probabilistic programs with mixed support, and demonstrate
that it outperforms existing composing inference baselines and works almost as
well as inference in marginalized versions of the programs, but with less
programming effort and at a lower computation cost.

Title: Batch Stationary Distribution Estimation
Authors: Junfeng Wen, Bo Dai, Lihong Li, Dale Schuurmans
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  We consider the problem of approximating the stationary distribution of an
ergodic Markov chain given a set of sampled transitions. Classical
simulation-based approaches assume access to the underlying process so that
trajectories of sufficient length can be gathered to approximate stationary
sampling. Instead, we consider an alternative setting where a fixed set of
transitions has been collected beforehand, by a separate, possibly unknown
procedure. The goal is still to estimate properties of the stationary
distribution, but without additional access to the underlying system. We
propose a consistent estimator that is based on recovering a correction ratio
function over the given data. In particular, we develop a variational power
method (VPM) that provides provably consistent estimates under general
conditions. In addition to unifying a number of existing approaches from
different subfields, we also find that VPM yields significantly better
estimates across a range of problems, including queueing, stochastic
differential equations, post-processing MCMC, and off-policy evaluation.

Title: Better Depth-Width Trade-offs for Neural Networks through the lens of
  Dynamical Systems
Authors: Vaggos Chatziafratis and Sai Ganesh Nagarajan and Ioannis Panageas
Categories: cs.LG math.DS stat.ML
\\
  The expressivity of neural networks as a function of their depth, width and
type of activation units has been an important question in deep learning
theory. Recently, depth separation results for ReLU networks were obtained via
a new connection with dynamical systems, using a generalized notion of fixed
points of a continuous map $f$, called periodic points. In this work, we
strengthen the connection with dynamical systems and we improve the existing
width lower bounds along several aspects. Our first main result is
period-specific width lower bounds that hold under the stronger notion of
$L^1$-approximation error, instead of the weaker classification error. Our
second contribution is that we provide sharper width lower bounds, still
yielding meaningful exponential depth-width separations, in regimes where
previous results wouldn't apply. A byproduct of our results is that there
exists a universal constant characterizing the depth-width trade-offs, as long
as $f$ has odd periods. Technically, our results follow by unveiling a tighter
connection between the following three quantities of a given function: its
period, its Lipschitz constant and the growth rate of the number of
oscillations arising under compositions of the function $f$ with itself.

Title: Quantized Neural Network Inference with Precision Batching
Authors: Maximilian Lam, Zachary Yedidia, Colby Banbury, Vijay Janapa Reddi
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV cs.PF
\\
  We present PrecisionBatching, a quantized inference algorithm for speeding up
neural network execution on traditional hardware platforms at low bitwidths
without the need for retraining or recalibration. PrecisionBatching decomposes
a neural network into individual bitlayers and accumulates them using fast
1-bit operations while maintaining activations in full precision.
PrecisionBatching not only facilitates quantized inference at low bitwidths (<
8 bits) without the need for retraining/recalibration, but also 1) enables
traditional hardware platforms the ability to realize inference speedups at a
finer granularity of quantization (e.g: 1-16 bit execution) and 2) allows
accuracy and speedup tradeoffs at runtime by exposing the number of bitlayers
to accumulate as a tunable parameter. Across a variety of applications (MNIST,
language modeling, natural language inference) and neural network architectures
(fully connected, RNN, LSTM), PrecisionBatching yields end-to-end speedups of
over 8x on a GPU within a < 1% error margin of the full precision baseline,
outperforming traditional 8-bit quantized inference by over 1.5x-2x at the same
error tolerance.

Title: EvoNet: A Neural Network for Predicting the Evolution of Dynamic Graphs
Authors: Changmin Wu, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Vazirgiannis
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.SI stat.ML
\\
  Neural networks for structured data like graphs have been studied extensively
in recent years. To date, the bulk of research activity has focused mainly on
static graphs. However, most real-world networks are dynamic since their
topology tends to change over time. Predicting the evolution of dynamic graphs
is a task of high significance in the area of graph mining. Despite its
practical importance, the task has not been explored in depth so far, mainly
due to its challenging nature. In this paper, we propose a model that predicts
the evolution of dynamic graphs. Specifically, we use a graph neural network
along with a recurrent architecture to capture the temporal evolution patterns
of dynamic graphs. Then, we employ a generative model which predicts the
topology of the graph at the next time step and constructs a graph instance
that corresponds to that topology. We evaluate the proposed model on several
artificial datasets following common network evolving dynamics, as well as on
real-world datasets. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model.

Title: Addressing target shift in zero-shot learning using grouped adversarial
  learning
Authors: Saneem Ahmed Chemmengath, Samarth Bharadwaj, Soumava Paul, Suranjana
  Samanta, Karthik Sankaranarayanan
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we present a new paradigm to zero-shot learning (ZSL) that is
trained by utilizing additional information (such as attribute-class mapping)
for specific set of unseen classes. We conjecture that such additional
information about unseen classes is more readily available than unsupervised
image sets. Further, on close examination of the underlying attribute
predictors of popular ZSL algorithms, we find that they often leverage
attribute correlations to make predictions. While attribute correlations that
remain intact in the unseen classes (test) benefit the prediction of difficult
attributes, change in correlations can have an adverse effect on ZSL
performance. For example, detecting an attribute 'brown' may be the same as
detecting 'fur' over an animals' image dataset captured in the tropics.
However, such a model might fail on unseen images of Arctic animals. To address
this effect, termed target-shift in ZSL, we utilize our proposed framework to
design grouped adversarial learning. We introduce grouping of attributes to
enable the model to continue to benefit from useful correlations, while
restricting cross-group correlations that may be harmful for generalization.
Our analysis shows that it is possible to not only constrain the model from
leveraging unwanted correlations, but also adjust them to specific test setting
using only the additional information (the already available attribute-class
mapping). We show empirical results for zero-shot predictions on standard
benchmark datasets, namely, aPY, AwA2, SUN and CUB datasets. We further
introduce to the research community, a new experimental train-test split that
maximizes target-shift to further study its effects.

Title: Demonstrating Rosa: the fairness solution for any Data Analytic pipeline
Authors: Kate Wilkinson, George Cevora
Categories: cs.LG stat.AP
\\
  Most datasets of interest to the analytics industry are impacted by various
forms of human bias. The outcomes of Data Analytics [DA] or Machine Learning
[ML] on such data are therefore prone to replicating the bias. As a result, a
large number of biased decision-making systems based on DA/ML have recently
attracted attention. In this paper we introduce Rosa, a free, web-based tool to
easily de-bias datasets with respect to a chosen characteristic. Rosa is based
on the principles of Fair Adversarial Networks, developed by illumr Ltd., and
can therefore remove interactive, non-linear, and non-binary bias. Rosa is
stand-alone pre-processing step / API, meaning it can be used easily with any
DA/ML pipeline. We test the efficacy of Rosa in removing bias from data-driven
decision making systems by performing standard DA tasks on five real-world
datasets, selected for their relevance to current DA problems, and also their
high potential for bias. We use simple ML models to model a characteristic of
analytical interest, and compare the level of bias in the model output both
with and without Rosa as a pre-processing step. We find that in all cases there
is a substantial decrease in bias of the data-driven decision making systems
when the data is pre-processed with Rosa.

  Annotating datasets is one of the main costs in nowadays supervised learning.
The goal of weak supervision is to enable models to learn using only forms of
labelling which are cheaper to collect, as partial labelling. This is a type of
incomplete annotation where, for each datapoint, supervision is cast as a set
of labels containing the real one. The problem of supervised learning with
partial labelling has been studied for specific instances such as
classification, multi-label, ranking or segmentation, but a general framework
is still missing. This paper provides a unified framework based on structured
prediction and on the concept of infimum loss to deal with partial labelling
over a wide family of learning problems and loss functions. The framework leads
naturally to explicit algorithms that can be easily implemented and for which
proved statistical consistency and learning rates. Experiments confirm the
superiority of the proposed approach over commonly used baselines.

Title: BASGD: Buffered Asynchronous SGD for Byzantine Learning
Authors: Yi-Rui Yang, Wu-Jun Li
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Distributed learning has become a hot research topic, due to its wide
application in cluster-based large-scale learning, federated learning, edge
computing and so on. Most distributed learning methods assume no error and
attack on the workers. However, many unexpected cases, such as communication
error and even malicious attack, may happen in real applications. Hence,
Byzantine learning (BL), which refers to distributed learning with attack or
error, has recently attracted much attention. Most existing BL methods are
synchronous, which will result in slow convergence when there exist
heterogeneous workers. Furthermore, in some applications like federated
learning and edge computing, synchronization cannot even be performed most of
the time due to the online workers (clients or edge servers). Hence,
asynchronous BL (ABL) is more general and practical than synchronous BL (SBL).
To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two ABL methods. One of them
cannot resist malicious attack. The other needs to store some training
instances on the server, which has the privacy leak problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, called buffered asynchronous stochastic gradient
descent (BASGD), for BL. BASGD is an asynchronous method. Furthermore, BASGD
has no need to store any training instances on the server, and hence can
preserve privacy in ABL. BASGD is theoretically proved to have the ability of
resisting against error and malicious attack. Moreover, BASGD has a similar
theoretical convergence rate to that of vanilla asynchronous SGD (ASGD), with
an extra constant variance. Empirical results show that BASGD can significantly
outperform vanilla ASGD and other ABL baselines, when there exists error or
attack on workers.

Title: Bayesian Neural Networks With Maximum Mean Discrepancy Regularization
Authors: Jary Pomponi, Simone Scardapane, and Aurelio Uncini
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are trained to optimize an entire
distribution over their weights instead of a single set, having significant
advantages in terms of, e.g., interpretability, multi-task learning, and
calibration. Because of the intractability of the resulting optimization
problem, most BNNs are either sampled through Monte Carlo methods, or trained
by minimizing a suitable Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) on a variational
approximation. In this paper, we propose a variant of the latter, wherein we
replace the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the ELBO term with a Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) estimator, inspired by recent work in variational inference.
After motivating our proposal based on the properties of the MMD term, we
proceed to show a number of empirical advantages of the proposed formulation
over the state-of-the-art. In particular, our BNNs achieve higher accuracy on
multiple benchmarks, including several image classification tasks. In addition,
they are more robust to the selection of a prior over the weights, and they are
better calibrated. As a second contribution, we provide a new formulation for
estimating the uncertainty on a given prediction, showing it performs in a more
robust fashion against adversarial attacks and the injection of noise over
their inputs, compared to more classical criteria such as the differential
entropy.

\\
  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the standard toolkit for analyzing
and learning from data on graphs. They have been successfully applied to a
myriad of domains including chemistry, physics, social sciences, knowledge
graphs, recommendation, and neuroscience. As the field grows, it becomes
critical to identify the architectures and key mechanisms which generalize
across graphs sizes, enabling us to tackle larger, more complex datasets and
domains. Unfortunately, it has been increasingly difficult to gauge the
effectiveness of new GNNs and compare models in the absence of a standardized
benchmark with consistent experimental settings and large datasets. In this
paper, we propose a reproducible GNN benchmarking framework, with the facility
for researchers to add new datasets and models conveniently. We apply this
benchmarking framework to novel medium-scale graph datasets from mathematical
modeling, computer vision, chemistry and combinatorial problems to establish
key operations when designing effective GNNs. Precisely, graph convolutions,
anisotropic diffusion, residual connections and normalization layers are
universal building blocks for developing robust and scalable GNNs.

Title: Robust Policy Search for Robot Navigation with Stochastic Meta-Policies
Authors: Javier Garcia-Barcos, Ruben Martinez-Cantin
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Bayesian optimization is an efficient nonlinear optimization method where the
queries are carefully selected to gather information about the optimum
location. Thus, in the context of policy search, it has been called active
policy search. The main ingredients of Bayesian optimization for sample
efficiency are the probabilistic surrogate model and the optimal decision
heuristics. In this work, we exploit those to provide robustness to different
issues for policy search algorithms. We combine several methods and show how
their interaction works better than the sum of the parts. First, to deal with
input noise and provide a safe and repeatable policy we use an improved version
of unscented Bayesian optimization. Then, to deal with mismodeling errors and
improve exploration we use stochastic meta-policies for query selection and an
adaptive kernel. We compare the proposed algorithm with previous results in
several optimization benchmarks and robot tasks, such as pushing objects with a
robot arm, or path finding with a rover.

Title: Tensor Networks for Language Modeling
Authors: Jacob Miller, Guillaume Rabusseau, John Terilla
Categories: cs.LG quant-ph stat.ML
Comments: 14 pages, 3 figures
\\
  The tensor network formalism has enjoyed over two decades of success in
modeling the behavior of complex quantum-mechanical systems, but has only
recently and sporadically been leveraged in machine learning. Here we introduce
a uniform matrix product state (u-MPS) model for probabilistic modeling of
sequence data. We identify several distinctive features of this recurrent
generative model, notably the ability to condition or marginalize sampling on
characters at arbitrary locations within a sequence, with no need for
approximate sampling methods. Despite the sequential architecture of u-MPS, we
show that a recursive evaluation algorithm can be used to parallelize its
inference and training, with a string of length n only requiring parallel time
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ to evaluate. Experiments on a context-free language
demonstrate a strong capacity to learn grammatical structure from limited data,
pointing towards the potential of tensor networks for language modeling
applications.

Title: Double Trouble in Double Descent : Bias and Variance(s) in the Lazy
  Regime
Authors: St\'ephane d'Ascoli, Maria Refinetti, Giulio Biroli, Florent Krzakala
Categories: cs.LG cond-mat.dis-nn stat.ML
Comments: 29 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Deep neural networks can achieve remarkable generalization performances while
interpolating the training data perfectly. Rather than the U-curve emblematic
of the bias-variance trade-off, their test error often follows a double descent
- a mark of the beneficial role of overparametrization. In this work, we
develop a quantitative theory for this phenomenon in the so-called lazy
learning regime of neural networks, by considering the problem of learning a
high-dimensional function with random features regression. We obtain a precise
asymptotic expression for the bias-variance decomposition of the test error,
and show that the bias displays a phase transition at the interpolation
threshold, beyond it which it remains constant. We disentangle the variances
stemming from the sampling of the dataset, from the additive noise corrupting
the labels, and from the initialization of the weights. Following Geiger et
al., we first show that the latter two contributions are the crux of the double
descent: they lead to the overfitting peak at the interpolation threshold and
to the decay of the test error upon overparametrization. We then quantify how
they are suppressed by ensembling the outputs of K independently initialized
estimators. When K is sent to infinity, the test error remains constant beyond
the interpolation threshold. We further compare the effects of
overparametrizing, ensembling and regularizing. Finally, we present numerical
experiments on classic deep learning setups to show that our results hold
qualitatively in realistic lazy learning scenarios.

Title: Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data by Identifying the Annotation
  Process
Authors: Naji Shajarisales, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ME stat.ML
Comments: Submitted to UAI 2020
\\
  In binary classification, Learning from Positive and Unlabeled data (LePU) is
semi-supervised learning but with labeled elements from only one class. Most of
the research on LePU relies on some form of independence between the selection
process of annotated examples and the features of the annotated class, known as
the Selected Completely At Random (SCAR) assumption. Yet the annotation process
is an important part of the data collection, and in many cases it naturally
depends on certain features of the data (e.g., the intensity of an image and
the size of the object to be detected in the image). Without any constraints on
the model for the annotation process, classification results in the LePU
problem will be highly non-unique. So proper, flexible constraints are needed.
In this work we incorporate more flexible and realistic models for the
annotation process than SCAR, and more importantly, offer a solution for the
challenging LePU problem. On the theory side, we establish the identifiability
of the properties of the annotation process and the classification function, in
light of the considered constraints on the data-generating process. We also
propose an inference algorithm to learn the parameters of the model, with
successful experimental results on both simulated and real data. We also
propose a novel real-world dataset forLePU, as a benchmark dataset for future
studies.

Title: Gaussian Process Policy Optimization

\\
  We propose a novel actor-critic, model-free reinforcement learning algorithm
which employs a Bayesian method of parameter space exploration to solve
environments. A Gaussian process is used to learn the expected return of a
policy given the policy's parameters. The system is trained by updating the
parameters using gradient descent on a new surrogate loss function consisting
of the Proximal Policy Optimization 'Clipped' loss function and a bonus term
representing the expected improvement acquisition function given by the
Gaussian process. This new method is shown to be comparable to and at times
empirically outperform current algorithms on environments that simulate robotic
locomotion using the MuJoCo physics engine.

Categories: cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
\\
  High-dimensional observations and unknown dynamics are major challenges when
applying optimal control to many real-world decision making tasks. The Learning
Controllable Embedding (LCE) framework addresses these challenges by embedding
the observations into a lower dimensional latent space, estimating the latent
dynamics, and then performing control directly in the latent space. To ensure
the learned latent dynamics are predictive of next-observations, all existing
LCE approaches decode back into the observation space and explicitly perform
next-observation prediction---a challenging high-dimensional task that
furthermore introduces a large number of nuisance parameters (i.e., the
decoder) which are discarded during control. In this paper, we propose a novel
information-theoretic LCE approach and show theoretically that explicit
next-observation prediction can be replaced with predictive coding. We then use
predictive coding to develop a decoder-free LCE model whose latent dynamics are
amenable to locally-linear control. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks
show that our model reliably learns a controllable latent space that leads to
superior performance when compared with state-of-the-art LCE baselines.

Title: On the Global Convergence of Training Deep Linear ResNets
Authors: Difan Zou and Philip M. Long and Quanquan Gu
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
Comments: 26 pages, 1 figure. In ICLR 2020
\\
  We study the convergence of gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for training $L$-hidden-layer linear residual networks (ResNets).
We prove that for training deep residual networks with certain linear
transformations at input and output layers, which are fixed throughout
training, both GD and SGD with zero initialization on all hidden weights can
converge to the global minimum of the training loss. Moreover, when
specializing to appropriate Gaussian random linear transformations, GD and SGD
provably optimize wide enough deep linear ResNets. Compared with the global
convergence result of GD for training standard deep linear networks (Du & Hu
2019), our condition on the neural network width is sharper by a factor of
$O(\kappa L)$, where $\kappa$ denotes the condition number of the covariance
matrix of the training data. We further propose a modified identity input and
output transformations, and show that a $(d+k)$-wide neural network is
sufficient to guarantee the global convergence of GD/SGD, where $d,k$ are the
input and output dimensions respectively.

Title: Solving Satisfiability of Polynomial Formulas By Sample-Cell Projection
Authors: Haokun Li and Bican Xia
Categories: cs.LO cs.AI cs.SC
\\
  A new algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of polynomial formulas over
the real is proposed. The key point of the algorithm is a new projection
operator, called sample-cell projection operator, custom-made for
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)-style search. Although the new operator
is also a CAD (Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition)-like projection operator
which computes the cell (not necessarily cylindrical) containing a given sample
such that each polynomial from the problem is sign-invariant on the cell, it is
of singly exponential time complexity. The sample-cell projection operator can
efficiently guide CDCL-style search away from conflicting states. Experiments
show the effectiveness of the new algorithm.

  In the case of multi-threading as found in contemporary programming
languages, parallel processes are interleaved according to what is known as a
process-scheduling policy in the field of operating systems. In a previous
paper, we extend ACP with this form of interleaving. In the current paper, we
do so with the variant of ACP known as ACP$_\epsilon$. The choice of
ACP$_\epsilon$ stems from the need to cover more process-scheduling policies.
We show that a process-scheduling policy supporting mutual exclusion of
critical subprocesses is now covered.

Title: Descriptive complexity of real computation and probabilistic

Categories: cs.LO cs.CC math.LO
\\
  We introduce a novel variant of BSS machines called Separate Branching BSS
machines (S-BSS in short) and develop a Fagin-type logical characterisation for
languages decidable in non-deterministic polynomial time by S-BSS machines. We
show that NP on S-BSS machines is strictly included in NP on BSS machines and
that every NP language on S-BSS machines is a countable union of closed sets in
the usual topology of R^n. Moreover, we establish that on Boolean inputs NP on
S-BSS machines without real constants characterises a natural fragment of the
complexity class existsR (a class of problems polynomial time reducible to the
true existential theory of the reals) and hence lies between NP and PSPACE.
Finally we apply our results to determine the data complexity of probabilistic
independence logic.

Title: Scaling Up Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Systems: Learn
  an Adaptive Sparse Communication Graph
Authors: Chuangchuang Sun, Macheng Shen, and Jonathan P. How
Categories: cs.MA cs.LG
\\
  The complexity of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) in multiagent
systems increases exponentially with respect to the agent number. This
scalability issue prevents MARL from being applied in large-scale multiagent
systems. However, one critical feature in MARL that is often neglected is that
the interactions between agents are quite sparse. Without exploiting this
sparsity structure, existing works aggregate information from all of the agents
and thus have a high sample complexity. To address this issue, we propose an
adaptive sparse attention mechanism by generalizing a sparsity-inducing
activation function. Then a sparse communication graph in MARL is learned by
graph neural networks based on this new attention mechanism. Through this
sparsity structure, the agents can communicate in an effective as well as
efficient way via only selectively attending to agents that matter the most and
thus the scale of the MARL problem is reduced with little optimality
compromised. Comparative results show that our algorithm can learn an
interpretable sparse structure and outperforms previous works by a significant
margin on applications involving a large-scale multiagent system.

Title: NLOptControl: A modeling language for solving optimal control problems
Authors: Huckleberry Febbo, Paramsothy Jayakumar, Jeffrey L. Stein, Tulga Ersal
Categories: cs.MS math.OC
\\
  Current direct-collocation-based optimal control software is either easy to
use or fast, but not both. This is a major limitation for users that are trying
to formulate complex optimal control problems (OCPs) for use in on-line
applications. This paper introduces NLOptControl, an open-source modeling
language that allows users to both easily formulate and quickly solve nonlinear
OCPs using direct-collocation methods. To achieve these attributes,
NLOptControl (1) is written in an efficient, dynamically-typed computing
language called Julia, (2) extends an optimization modeling language called
JuMP to provide a natural algebraic syntax for modeling nonlinear OCPs; and (3)
uses reverse automatic differentiation with the acrylic-coloring method to
exploit sparsity in the Hessian matrix. This work explores the novel design
features of NLOptControl and compares its syntax and speed to those of PROPT.
The syntax comparisons shows that NLOptControl models OCPs more concisely than
PROPT. The speeds of various collocation methods within PROPT and NLOptControl
are benchmarked over a range of collocation points using performance profiles;
overall, NLOptControl's single, two, and four interval pseudospectral methods
are roughly $14$, $26$, and $36$ times faster than PROPT's, respectively.
NLOptControl is well-suited to improve existing off-line and on-line control
systems and to engender new ones.

\\
  This work investigates an elliptic optimal control problem defined on
uncertain domains and discretized by a fictitious domain finite element method
and cut elements. Key ingredients of the study are to manage cases considering
the usually computationally "forbidden" combination of poorly conditioned
equation system matrices due to challenging geometries, optimal control
searches with iterative methods, slow convergence to system solutions on
deterministic and non--deterministic level, and expensive remeshing due to
geometrical changes. We overcome all these difficulties, utilizing the
advantages of proper preconditioners adapted to unfitted mesh methods, improved
types of Monte Carlo methods, and mainly employing the advantages of embedded
FEMs, based on a fixed background mesh computed once even if geometrical
changes are taking place. The sensitivity of the control problem is introduced
in terms of random domains, employing a Quasi--Monte Carlo method. The
variational discretization concept is adopted, optimal error estimates for the
state, adjoint state and control are derived that confirm the efficiency of the
cut finite element method in challenging geometries. The performance of a
multigrid scheme especially developed for unfitted finite element
discretizations adapted to the optimal control problem is also tested. Some
fundamental preconditioners are applied to the arising sparse linear systems
coming from the discretization of the state and adjoint state variational forms
in the spatial domain. The corresponding convergence rates along with the
quality of the prescribed preconditioners are verified by numerical examples.
Further, a practical error estimate for the Quasi--Monte Carlo method is
derived, showing that it yields the theoretically predicted convergence rate.

MSC-class: 65H04
ACM-class: G.1
\\
  Newton's method for polynomial root finding is one of mathematics' most
well-known algorithms. The method also has its shortcomings: it is undefined at
critical points, it could exhibit chaotic behavior and is only guaranteed to
converge locally. Based on the {\it Geometric Modulus Principle} for a complex
polynomial $p(z)$, together with a {\it Modulus Reduction Theorem} proved here,
we develop the {\it Robust Newton's method} (RNM), defined everywhere with a
step-size that guarantees an {\it a priori} reduction in polynomial modulus in
each iteration. Furthermore, we prove RNM iterates converge globally, either to
a root or a critical point. Specifically, given $\varepsilon $ and any seed
$z_0$, in $t=O(1/\varepsilon^{2})$ iterations of RNM, independent of degree of
$p(z)$, either $|p(z_t)| \leq \varepsilon$ or $|p(z_t) p'(z_t)| \leq
\varepsilon$. By adjusting the iterates at {\it near-critical points}, we
describe a {\it modified} RNM that necessarily convergence to a root. In
combination with Smale's point estimation, RNM results in a globally convergent
Newton's method having a locally quadratic rate. We present sample
polynomiographs that demonstrate how in contrast with Newton's method RNM
smooths out the fractal boundaries of basins of attraction of roots. RNM also
finds potentials in computing all roots of arbitrary degree polynomials. A
particular consequence of RNM is a simple algorithm for solving cubic
equations.

  We introduce a new family of paraxial asymptotic models that approximate the
Vlasov-Maxwell equations in non-relativistic cases. This formulation is $n$-th
order accurate in a parameter $\eta$, which denotes the ratio between the
characteristic velocity of the beam and the speed of light. This family of
models is interesting, first because it is simpler than the complete
Vlasov-Maxwell equation, then because it allows us to choose the model
complexity according to the expected accuracy.

Title: Least-squares for linear elasticity eigenvalue problem
Authors: Fleurianne Bertrand and Daniele Boffi
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We study the approximation of the spectrum of least-squares operators arising
from linear elasticity. We consider a two-field (stress/displacement) and a
three-field (stress/displacement/vorticity) formulation; other formulations
might be analyzed with similar techniques. We prove a priori estimates and we
confirm the theoretical results with simple two-dimensional numerical
experiments.

Title: The Inverse Problem of Reconstructing Reaction-Diffusion Systems
Authors: Barbara Kaltenbacher and William Rundell
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: Primary: 35R30, 65M32, Secondary: 35R11
\\
  This paper considers the inverse problem of recovering state-dependent source
terms in a reaction-diffusion system from overposed data consisting of the
values of the state variables either at a fixed finite time (census-type data)
or a time trace of their values at a fixed point on the boundary of the spatial
domain. We show both uniqueness results and the convergence of an iteration
scheme designed to recover these sources. This leads to a reconstructive method
and we shall demonstrate its effectiveness by several illustrative examples.

Title: Time Reversal for elastic scatterer location from Acoustic Recording
Authors: Franck Assous, Moshe Lin
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 22 pages, 15 figures
\\
  The aim of this paper is to study the feasibility of time-reversal methods in
a non homogeneous elastic medium, from data recorded in an acoustic medium. We
aim to determine, from partial aperture boundary measurements, the presence and
some physical properties of elastic unknown "inclusions", i.e. not observable
solid objects, located in the elastic medium. We first derive a variational
formulation of the acousto-elastic problem, from which one constructs a
time-dependent finite element method to solve the forward, and then, the time
reversed problem. Several criteria, derived from the reverse time migration
framework, are then proposed to construct images of the inclusions, and to
determine their locations. The dependence/sensitivity of the approach to
several parameters (aperture, number of sources, etc.) is also investigated. In
particular, it is shown that one can differentiate between a benign and
malignant close inclusions. This technique is fairly insensitive to noise in
the data.

Title: Inverse scattering by a random periodic structure
Authors: Gang Bao and Yiwen Lin
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This paper develops an efficient numerical method for the inverse scattering
problem of a time-harmonic plane wave incident on a perfectly reflecting random
periodic structure. The method is based on a novel combination of the Monte
Carlo technique for sampling the probability space, a continuation method with
respect to the wavenumber, and the Karhunen-Lo$\grave{e}$ve expansion of the
random structure, which reconstructs key statistical properties of the profile
for the unknown random periodic structure from boundary measurements of the
scattered fields away from the structure. Numerical results are presented to
demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed method.

Title: New wavelet method based on Shifted Lucas polynomials: A tau approach
Authors: Rakesh Kumar, Reena Koundal, K. Srivastava
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 10 pages of manuscript
\\
  In current work, non-familiar shifted Lucas polynomials are introduced. We
have constructed a computational wavelet technique for solution of
initial/boundary value second order differential equations. For this numerical
scheme, we have developed weight function and Rodrigues' formula for Lucas
polynomials. Further, Lucas polynomials and their properties are used to
propose shifted Lucas polynomials and then utilization of shifted Lucas
polynomials provides us shifted Lucas wavelet. We furnished the operational
matrix of differentiation and the product operational matrix of the shifted
Lucas wavelets. Moreover, convergence and error analysis ensure accuracy of the
proposed method. Illustrative examples show that the present method is
numerically fruitful, effective and convenient for solving differential
equations

Title: Optimal transport: discretization and algorithms
Authors: Quentin Merigot (LMO), Boris Thibert (CVGI)
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.OC
\\
  This chapter describes techniques for the numerical resolution of optimal
transport problems. We will consider several discretizations of these problems,
and we will put a strong focus on the mathematical analysis of the algorithms
to solve the discretized problems. We will describe in detail the following
discretizations and corresponding algorithms: the assignment problem and
Bertsekas auction's algorithm; the entropic regularization and Sinkhorn-Knopp's
algorithm; semi-discrete optimal transport and Oliker-Prussner or damped
Newton's algorithm, and finally semi-discrete entropic regularization. Our
presentation highlights the similarity between these algorithms and their
connection with the theory of Kantorovich duality.

Title: A surface finite element method for computational modelling of cell
  blebbing
Authors: Bj\"orn Stinner, Andreas Dedner, Adam Nixon
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 65M60
\\
  Cell blebs are protrusions of the cell membrane and can be instrumental for
cell migration. We derive a continuum model for the mechanical and geometrical
aspects of the onset of blebbing in terms of a force balance. It is abstract
and flexible in that it allows for amending force contributions related to
membrane tension or the presence of linker molecules between membrane and cell
cortex. The deforming membrane and all forces are expressed by means of a
parametrisation over a stationary reference surface. A variational formulation
is presented and analysed for well-posedness. For this purpose, we derive a
semi-discrete scheme based on the surface finite element method. We provide a
convergence result and estimates of the error due to the spatial
discretisation. Furthermore, we present a computational framework where
specific models can be implemented and later on conveniently amended if
desired, using a domain specific language implemented in Python. While the high
level program control can be done within the Python scripting environment, the
actual computationally expensive step of evolving the solution over time is
carried out by binding to an efficient software backend. Cell membrane
geometries given in terms of a parametrisation or obtained from image data can
be accounted for. A couple of numerical simulation results illustrate the
approach.

Title: Estimates of constants in error estimates for $H^2$ conforming finite
  elements for regularized nonlinear elliptic geometric evolution equations and
  question of optimality
Authors: Axel Kr\"oner, Heiko Kr\"oner
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 35J66, 35J93, 65N15, 65N30
\\
  Geometric evolution equations in level set form are usually singular and a
well-known regularization procedure generates a family of approximating
non-singular equations (e.g. useful for analytical or numerical aspects). In
the previous work [13] upper bounds for constants which appear in the standard
finite element error estimates for elliptic regularized geometric evolution
equations in dependence on the regularization parameter have been addressed and
an exponential relation in the inverse regularization parameter has been
observed. In this paper the aim is twofold: First, we extend the results from
[13] to $H^2(\Omega)$ conforming approaches which are of interest in the
special case of higher regularity of the solution in order to detect level
sets, and second, we present a strong indication that the previously mentioned
exponential bound which carries over to the higher conforming case is optimal
(independent from the degree of conformity). This is in accordance with
practical experience in own previous work and suggests at least in the special
case of mean curvature flow that a parabolic approach is preferable (in order
to get better FE error estimates).

Title: A Least-Squares Formulation of the Moving Discontinuous Galerkin Finite
  Element Method with Interface Condition Enforcement
Authors: Andrew D. Kercher, Andrew Corrigan
Categories: math.NA cs.NA physics.comp-ph
Comments: 38 pages, 20 figures, this work is a direct extension of
  arXiv:2002.12740
\\
  A least-squares formulation of the Moving Discontinuous Galerkin Finite
Element Method with Interface Condition Enforcement (LS-MDG-ICE) is presented.
This method combines MDG-ICE, which uses a weak formulation that separately
enforces a conservation law and the corresponding interface condition and
treats the discrete geometry as a variable, with the Discontinuous
Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methodology of Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan to
systematically generate optimal test functions from the trial spaces of both
the discrete flow field and discrete geometry. For inviscid flows, LS-MDG-ICE
detects and fits a priori unknown interfaces, including shocks. For
convection-dominated diffusion, LS-MDG-ICE resolves internal layers, e.g.,
viscous shocks, and boundary layers using anisotropic curvilinear
$r$-adaptivity in which high-order shape representations are anisotropically
adapted to accurately resolve the flow field. As such, LS-MDG-ICE solutions are
oscillation-free, regardless of the grid resolution and polynomial degree.
Finally, for both linear and nonlinear problems in one dimension, LS-MDG-ICE is
shown to achieve optimal convergence of the $L^2$ solution error with respect
to the exact solution when the discrete geometry is fixed and super-optimal
convergence when the discrete geometry is treated as a variable.

Title: Information cartography in association rule mining
Authors: Iztok Fister Jr., Iztok Fister
Categories: cs.NE
\\
  Association Rule Mining is a data mining method for discovering the
interesting relations between attributes in a huge transaction database.
Typically, algorithms for association rule mining generate a huge number of
association rules, from which it is hard to extract structured knowledge and
automatically present this in a form that would be suitable for the user.
Recently, an information cartography has been proposed for creating structured
summaries of information and visualizing with methodology called "metro maps".
This was applied to many problem domains. In the hope of widening its
applicability domain, the aim of this study is to develop a method for the
automatic creation of metro maps of information obtained by association rule
mining. Although the proposed method consists of multiple steps, its core
presents metro map construction that is defined in the study as an optimization
problem, which is solved using an evolutionary algorithm. Finally, this was
applied to four well-known UCI Machine Learning datasets and one sport dataset.
Visualizing the resulted metro maps not only justifies the fact this is a
suitable tool for presenting structured knowledge hidden in data, but also that
they can even tell stories to users.

Title: Adaptive Structural Hyper-Parameter Configuration by Q-Learning
Authors: Haotian Zhang, Jianyong Sun and Zongben Xu
Categories: cs.NE cs.AI
\\
  Tuning hyper-parameters for evolutionary algorithms is an important issue in
computational intelligence. Performance of an evolutionary algorithm depends
not only on its operation strategy design, but also on its hyper-parameters.
Hyper-parameters can be categorized in two dimensions as structural/numerical
and time-invariant/time-variant. Particularly, structural hyper-parameters in
existing studies are usually tuned in advance for time-invariant parameters, or
with hand-crafted scheduling for time-invariant parameters. In this paper, we
make the first attempt to model the tuning of structural hyper-parameters as a
reinforcement learning problem, and present to tune the structural
hyper-parameter which controls computational resource allocation in the CEC
2018 winner algorithm by Q-learning. Experimental results show favorably
against the winner algorithm on the CEC 2018 test functions.

Title: Deterministic Intra-Vehicle Communications: Timing and Synchronization
Authors: Hamid Gharavi and Bin Hu
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: 6 pages, 7 figures, conference ICC 2020
\\
  As we power through to the future, in-vehicle communications reliance on
speed is becoming a challenging predicament. This is mainly due to the
ever-increasing number of electronic control units (ECUs), which will continue
to drain network capacity, hence further increasing bandwidth demand. For a
wired network, a tradeoff between bandwidth requirement, reliability, and
cost-effectiveness has been our main motivation in developing a high-speed
network architecture that is based on the integration of two time-triggered
protocols namely; Time Triggered Ethernet (TT-E) and Time Triggered Controller
Area Network (TT-CAN). Therefore, as a visible example of an Internet of
Vehicles technology, we present a time triggered communication-based network
architecture. The new architecture can provide scalable integration of advanced
functionalities, while maintaining safety and high reliability. To comply with
the bandwidth requirement, we consider high-speed TT-Ethernet as the main bus
(i.e., backbone network) where sub-networks can use more cost-effective and
lower bandwidth TT-CAN to communicate with other entities in the network via a
gateway. The main challenge in the proposed network architecture has been to
resolve interoperability between two entirely different time-triggered
protocols, especially in terms of timing and synchronization. In this paper, we
first explore the main key drivers of the proposed architecture, which are
bandwidth, reliability, and timeliness. We then demonstrate the effectiveness
of our gateway design in providing full interoperability between the two
time-triggered protocols.

Title: Improving THz Quality-of-Transmission with Systematic RLNC and Auxiliary
  Channels
Authors: Cao Vien Phung, Anna Engelmann, Thomas Kuerner and Admela Jukan
Categories: cs.NI cs.DC
Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, accepted at IEEE ICC'20 Workshop - TeraCom
\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel solution that can improve the quality of
THz transmission with systematic random linear network coding (sRLNC) and a
low-bitrate auxiliary channel. To minimize complexity of channel coding, we
complement a generic low complexity FEC code by a low complexity sRLNC. To
increase the overall throughput of THz transmission, we propose to send the
native data and coding redundancy in parallel over 2 differently configured THz
channels, i.e., over 1 high bit rate main channel and 1 low bit rate low error
rate auxiliary channel. The results show, that the main THz channel supported
by low bit rate auxiliary channel can use a higher level modulation format and
sent over longer distances with a higher throughput.

Title: An Experimental Study of Network Coded REST HTTP in Dynamic IoT Systems
Authors: Cao Vien Phung, Jasenka Dizdarevic and Admela Jukan

  Communications (ICC), Dublin, Ireland, 2020
\\
  REST HTTP is the communication protocol of choice for software developers
today. In IoT systems with unreliable connectivity, however, a stateless
protocol like REST HTTP needs to send a request message multiple times, and it
only stops the retransmissions when an acknowledgement arrives at the sender.
In our previous work, we studied the usage of random linear network coding
(RLNC) for REST HTTP protocol to reducing the amount of unnecessarily
retransmissions. In this paper, we experimentally validate the study and
analyze REST HTTP with and without RLNC in a simple testbed in dynamic IoT
systems. The measurements show notable improvements in bandwidth utilization in
terms of reducing the retransmissions and delay when using network-coded REST
HTTP.

Title: Mitigation of Civilian-to-Military Interference in DSRC for Urban
  Operations
Authors: Seungmo Kim and Tsigigenet Dessalgn
Categories: cs.NI
Journal-ref: The paper was presented at IEEE MILCOM 2019
\\
  Dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) attracts popularity in the
military applications thanks to its easiness in establishment, no need for paid
subscription, and wide compatibility with any other IEEE 802.11 standards. The
main challenge in DSRC is congestion due to existence of only 7 channels, which
may not be enough to accommodate the increased number of transmitters expected
to be deployed in the near future. Recently, there are a myriad of urban
operation scenarios for the military including urban warfare and humanitarian
assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR). The key challenge is that the
communications among the military vehicles can be interfered by civilian users.
It is the desire that the messages transmitted by the military vehicles hold a
higher significance so that they can avoid the interference coming from the
civilian users, which is not supported in the current version of DSRC. As a
remedy, this paper proposes a protocol that prioritizes the military DSRC users
while muffling the civilian DSRC users. Our results show that this
prioritization method achieves higher communications performances for the
military DSRC users.

Categories: cs.NI
Comments: 5 pages, 7 figures, to be published at IEEE Communications Letters
\\
  The goal of this study is to improve the accuracy of millimeter wave received
power prediction by utilizing camera images and radio frequency (RF) signals,
while gathering image inputs in a communication-efficient and
privacy-preserving manner. To this end, we propose a distributed multimodal
machine learning (ML) framework, coined multimodal split learning (MultSL), in
which a large neural network (NN) is split into two wirelessly connected
segments. The upper segment combines images and received powers for future
received power prediction, whereas the lower segment extracts features from
camera images and compresses its output to reduce communication costs and
privacy leakage. Experimental evaluation corroborates that MultSL achieves
higher accuracy than the baselines utilizing either images or RF signals.
Remarkably, without compromising accuracy, compressing the lower segment output
by 16x yields 16x lower communication latency and 2.8% less privacy leakage
compared to the case without compression.

\\
  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted cellular communication is gaining
significant interest recently. Although it offers several advantages over
terrestrial communication, UAV communication suffers from two main
shortcomings. The typical untethered UAV (uUAV) has a limited battery power
supply and therefore limited flying time, and it needs an extra wireless
backhaul link to connect users to the core network. In this paper, we propose
the utilization of the tethered UAV (tUAV) to assist the cellular network,
where the tether provides power supply and connects the tUAV to the core
network through high capacity link. The tUAV however has a limited mobility due
to the limited tether length. A stochastic geometry-based analysis is provided
for the coverage probability of an UAV-assisted cellular network where the
mobile users located within a circular hot-spot. For that setup, we analyze and
compare two scenarios: (i) utilizing uUAV and (ii) utilizing tUAV, for
offloading the terrestrial base station (TBS). We capture the aforementioned
limitations of each of the uUAV and the tUAV in our analysis. A novel user
association analysis is provided given the TBS and the UAV locations. Next, we
study the optimal locations of the uUAV and the tUAV to maximize the coverage
probability. Multiple useful insights are revealed. For instance, numerical
results show that tUAVs outperform uUAVs when the tether length is above 75 m,
given that the uUAV is available for 80% of the time due to its battery
limitations.

  Recent years have seen rapid deployment of mobile computing and Internet of

communication and sensing capabilities of wireless systems. Big data analysis,
pervasive computing , and eventually artificial intelligence (AI) are envisaged
to be deployed on top of IoT and create a new world featured by data-driven AI.

Title: An Efficient Routing Protocol in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks by using
  Artificial Immune System

\\
  Characteristics of the mobile ad-hoc networks such as nodes high mobility and
limited energy are regarded as the routing challenges in these networks. OLSR
protocol is one of the routing protocols in mobile ad hoc network that selects
the shortest route between source and destination through Dijkstra's algorithm.
However, OLSR suffers from a major problem. It does not consider parameters
such as nodes energy level and links length in its route processing. This paper
employs the artificial immune system (AIS) to enhance efficiency of OLSR
routing protocol. The proposed algorithm, called AIS-OLSR, considers hop count,
remaining energy in the intermediate nodes, and distance among node, which is
realized by negative selection and ClonalG algorithms of AIS. Widespread packet
- level simulation in ns-2 environment, shows that AIS-OLSR outperforms OLSR
and EA-OLSR in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, end-end delay and
lifetime.

  MANETs (Mobile Ad-hoc Networks) is a temporal network, which is managed by
autonomous nodes, which have the ability to communicate with each other without
having fixed network infrastructure or any central base station. Due to some
reasons such as dynamic changes of the network topology, trusting the nodes to
each other, lack of fixed substructure for the analysis of nodes behaviors and
loss of specific offensive lines, this type of networks is not supportive
against malicious nodes attacks. One of these attacks is black hole attack. In
this attack, the malicious nodes absorb data packets and destroy them. Thus, it
is essential to present an algorithm against the black hole attacks. This paper
proposed a new approach, which improvement the security of DSR routing protocol
to encounter the black hole attacks. This schema tries to identify malicious
nodes according to nodes behaviors in a MANETs and isolate them from routing.
The proposed protocol, called AIS-DSR (Artificial Immune System DSR) employ AIS
(Artificial Immune System) to defend against black hole attacks. AIS-DSR is
evaluated through extensive simulations in the ns-2 environment. The results
show that AIS-DSR outperforms other existing solutions in terms of throughput,
end-to-end delay, packets loss ratio and packets drop ratio.

Title: Inexpensive surface electromyography sleeve with consistent electrode
  placement enables dexterous and stable prosthetic control through deep
  learning
Authors: Jacob A. George, Anna Neibling, Michael D. Paskett, Gregory A. Clark
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV q-bio.NC
Comments: MEC2020
\\
  The dexterity of conventional myoelectric prostheses is limited in part by
the small datasets used to train the control algorithms. Variations in surface
electrode positioning make it difficult to collect consistent data and to
estimate motor intent reliably over time. To address these challenges, we
developed an inexpensive, easy-to-don sleeve that can record robust and
repeatable surface electromyography from 32 embedded monopolar electrodes.
Embedded grommets are used to consistently align the sleeve with natural skin
markings (e.g., moles, freckles, scars). The sleeve can be manufactured in a
few hours for less than $60. Data from seven intact participants show the
sleeve provides a signal-to-noise ratio of 14, a don-time under 11 seconds, and
sub-centimeter precision for electrode placement. Furthermore, in a case study
with one intact participant, we use the sleeve to demonstrate that neural
networks can provide simultaneous and proportional control of six degrees of
freedom, even 263 days after initial algorithm training. We also highlight that
consistent recordings, accumulated over time to establish a large dataset,
significantly improve dexterity. These results suggest that deep learning with
a 74-layer neural network can substantially improve the dexterity and stability
of myoelectric prosthetic control, and that deep-learning techniques can be
readily instantiated and further validated through inexpensive sleeves/sockets
with consistent recording locations.

Title: Comparison of Distal Teacher Learning with Numerical and Analytical
  Methods to Solve Inverse Kinematics for Rigid-Body Mechanisms
Authors: Tim von Oehsen, Alexander Fabisch, Shivesh Kumar and Frank Kirchner
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Several publications are concerned with learning inverse kinematics, however,
their evaluation is often limited and none of the proposed methods is of
practical relevance for rigid-body kinematics with a known forward model. We
argue that for rigid-body kinematics one of the first proposed machine learning
(ML) solutions to inverse kinematics -- distal teaching (DT) -- is actually
good enough when combined with differentiable programming libraries and we
provide an extensive evaluation and comparison to analytical and numerical
solutions. In particular, we analyze solve rate, accuracy, sample efficiency
and scalability. Further, we study how DT handles joint limits, singularities,
unreachable poses, trajectories and provide a comparison of execution times.
The three approaches are evaluated on three different rigid body mechanisms
with varying complexity. With enough training data and relaxed precision
requirements, DT has a better solve rate and is faster than state-of-the-art
numerical solvers for a 15-DoF mechanism. DT is not affected by singularities
while numerical solutions are vulnerable to them. In all other cases numerical
solutions are usually better. Analytical solutions outperform the other
approaches by far if they are available.

\\
  Robust and accurate estimation of liquid height lies as an essential part of
pouring tasks for service robots. However, vision-based methods often fail in
occluded conditions while audio-based methods cannot work well in a noisy
environment. We instead propose a multimodal pouring network (MP-Net) that is
able to robustly predict liquid height by conditioning on both audition and
haptics input. MP-Net is trained on a self-collected multimodal pouring
dataset. This dataset contains 300 robot pouring recordings with audio and
force/torque measurements for three types of target containers. We also augment
the audio data by inserting robot noise. We evaluated MP-Net on our collected
dataset and a wide variety of robot experiments. Both network training results
and robot experiments demonstrate that MP-Net is robust against noise and
changes to the task and environment. Moreover, we further combine the predicted
height and force data to estimate the shape of the target container.

Comments: Submitted, IROS 2020
\\
  Developments in mobile robot navigation have enabled robots to operate in
warehouses, retail stores, and on sidewalks around pedestrians. Various
navigation solutions have been proposed, though few as widely adopted as ROS
Navigation. 10 years on, it is still one of the most popular navigation
solutions. Yet, ROS Navigation has failed to keep up with modern trends. We
propose the new navigation solution, Navigation2, which builds on the
successful legacy of ROS Navigation. Navigation2 uses a behavior tree for
navigator task orchestration and employs new methods designed for dynamic
environments applicable to a wider variety of modern sensors. It is built on
top of ROS2, a secure message passing framework suitable for safety critical
applications and program lifecycle management. We present experiments in a
campus setting utilizing Navigation2 to operate safely alongside students over
a marathon as an extension of the experiment proposed in Eppstein et al. The
Navigation2 system is freely available at

Title: Vision-based Robot Manipulation Learning via Human Demonstrations
Authors: Zhixin Jia, Mengxiang Lin, Zhixin Chen and Shibo Jian
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: submitted to IROS2020
\\
  Vision-based learning methods provide promise for robots to learn complex
manipulation tasks. However, how to generalize the learned manipulation skills
to real-world interactions remains an open question. In this work, we study
robotic manipulation skill learning from a single third-person view
demonstration by using activity recognition and object detection in computer
vision. To facilitate generalization across objects and environments, we
propose to use a prior knowledge base in the form of a text corpus to infer the
object to be interacted with in the context of a robot. We evaluate our
approach in a real-world robot, using several simple and complex manipulation
tasks commonly performed in daily life. The experimental results show that our
approach achieves good generalization performance even from small amounts of
training data.

Title: Experimental Evaluation of a Pseudo-Doppler Direction-Finding System for
  Localizing Radio Tags
Authors: William E. Gerhard III and Pratap Tokekar
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  We present the design of a radio antenna system for obtaining instantaneous
bearing measurements towards a radio emitter. Our work is motivated by
applications where robots are used for localizing and tracking radio-tagged
wildlife. The traditional method is to use directional antennas that need to be
rotated in order find the bearing which is time consuming. Instead, we present
a low-cost system capable of finding bearing measurements almost
instantaneously using an antenna array. This is particularly appealing for
wildlife tracking with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) where remaining
stationary can be challenging and energy consuming, in addition to being slow.
The proposed system uses existing open source hardware and software systems and
leverages principles of pseudo Doppler direction-finding. The resulting system
was tested in an anechoic chamber and in outdoor settings. The outdoor tests
with particle filtering show that the resulting system is capable of localizing
radio tags within 5 meter accuracy starting with an initial estimate of 200m x
200m.

Title: Learn Task First or Learn Human Partner First? Deep Reinforcement
  Learning of Human-Robot Cooperation in Asymmetric Hierarchical Dynamic Task
Authors: Lingfeng Tao, Michael Bowman, Jiucai Zhang, Xiaoli Zhang
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.HC
Comments: 6 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables
\\
  The deep reinforcement learning method for human-robot cooperation (HRC) is
promising for its high performance when robots are learning complex tasks.
However, the applicability of such an approach in a real-world context is
limited due to long training time, additional training difficulty caused by
inconsistent human performance and the inherent instability of policy
exploration. With this approach, the robot has two dynamics to learn: how to
accomplish the given physical task and how to cooperate with the human partner.
Furthermore, the dynamics of the task and human partner are usually coupled,
which means the observable outcomes and behaviors are coupled. It is hard for
the robot to efficiently learn from coupled observations. In this paper, we
hypothesize that the robot needs to learn the task separately from learning the
behavior of the human partner to improve learning efficiency and outcomes. This
leads to a fundamental question: Should the robot learn the task first or learn
the human behavior first (Fig. 1)? We develop a novel hierarchical rewards
mechanism with a task decomposition method that enables the robot to
efficiently learn a complex hierarchical dynamic task and human behavior for
better HRC. The algorithm is validated in a hierarchical control task in a
simulated environment with human subject experiments, and we are able to answer
the question by analyzing the collected experiment results.

Title: Non-iterative One-step Solution for Point Set Registration Problem on
  Pose Estimation without Correspondence
Authors: Yijun Yuan, Dorit Borrmann, Andreas N\"uchter and S\"oren Schwertfeger
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  In this work, we propose to directly find the one-step solution for the point
set registration problem without correspondences. Inspired by the Kernel
Correlation method, we consider the full connected objective function between
two point sets, thus avoiding the computation of correspondences. By utilizing
least square minimization the transformed objective function is directly solved
with existing well-known closed-form solutions, e.g., singular value
decomposition, that is usually used for given correspondences. However, using
equal weights of costs for each connection will degenerate the solution due to
the large influence of distant pairs. Thus, we additionally set a scale on each
term to avoid the high cost on non-important pairs. As in feature-based
registration methods, the similarity between descriptors of points determines
the scaling weight. Given the weights we yield a one step solution. As the
runtime is in $\mathcal O (n^2)$, we also propose a variant with keypoints that
strongly reduce the cost. The experiments show, that our proposed method gives
a one-step solution without an initial guess. Our method exhibits competitive
outliers robustness, accuracy compared with various methods. And it is more
stable to large rotation. In addition, though feature based algorithms are more
sensitive to noise, Our method still provide better result compared with the
feature match initialized ICP.

\\
  Developing artificial tactile sensing capabilities that rival human touch is
a long-term goal in robotics and prosthetics. Gradually more elaborate
biomimetic tactile sensors are being developed and applied to grasping and
manipulation tasks to help achieve this goal. Here we present the neuroTac, a
novel neuromorphic optical tactile sensor. The neuroTac combines the biomimetic
hardware design from the TacTip sensor which mimicks the layered papillae
structure of human glabrous skin, with an event-based camera (DAVIS240,
iniVation) and algorithms which transduce contact information in the form of
spike trains. The performance of the sensor is evaluated on a texture
classification task, with four spike coding methods being implemented and
compared: Intensive, Spatial, Temporal and Spatiotemporal. We found
timing-based coding methods performed with the highest accuracy over both
artificial and natural textures. The spike-based output of the neuroTac could
enable the development of biomimetic tactile perception algorithms in robotics
as well as non-invasive and invasive haptic feedback methods in prosthetics.

Title: Optimal Oscillation Damping Control of cable-Suspended Aerial
  Manipulator with a Single IMU Sensor
Authors: Yuri S. Sarkisov, Min Jun Kim, Andre Coelho, Dzmitry Tsetserukou,
  Christian Ott, and Konstantin Kondak
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  This paper presents a design of oscillation damping control for the
cable-Suspended Aerial Manipulator (SAM). The SAM is modeled as a double
pendulum, and it can generate a body wrench as a control action. The main
challenge is the fact that there is only one onboard IMU sensor which does not
provide full information on the system state. To overcome this difficulty, we
design a controller motivated by a simplified SAM model. The proposed
controller is very simple yet robust to model uncertainties. Moreover, we
propose a gain tuning rule by formulating the proposed controller in the form
of output feedback linear quadratic regulation problem. Consequently, it is
possible to quickly dampen oscillations with minimal energy consumption. The
proposed approach is validated through simulations and experiments.

Comments: icra 2020
\\
  We propose a novel fast and robust 3D point clouds segmentation framework via
coupled feature selection, named 3DCFS, that jointly performs semantic and
instance segmentation. Inspired by the human scene perception process, we
design a novel coupled feature selection module, named CFSM, that adaptively
selects and fuses the reciprocal semantic and instance features from two tasks
in a coupled manner. To further boost the performance of the instance
segmentation task in our 3DCFS, we investigate a loss function that helps the
model learn to balance the magnitudes of the output embedding dimensions during
training, which makes calculating the Euclidean distance more reliable and
enhances the generalizability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our 3DCFS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets in
terms of accuracy, speed and computational cost.

Title: Exploiting Ergonomic Priors in Human-to-Robot Task Transfer
Authors: Jeevan Manavalan, Prabhakar Ray, Matthew Howard
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
\\
  In recent years, there has been a booming shift in the development of
versatile, autonomous robots by introducing means to intuitively teach robots
task-oriented behaviour by demonstration. In this paper, a method based on
programming by demonstration is proposed to learn null space policies from
constrained motion data. The main advantage to using this is generalisation of
a task by retargeting a systems redundancy as well as the capability to fully
replace an entire system with another of varying link number and lengths while
still accurately repeating a task subject to the same constraints. The
effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated in a 3-link simulation and a
real world experiment using a human subject as the demonstrator and is verified
through task reproduction on a 7DoF physical robot. In simulation, the method
works accurately with even as little as five data points producing errors less
than 10^-14. The approach is shown to outperform the current state-of-the-art
approach in a simulated 3DoF robot manipulator control problem where motions
are reproduced using learnt constraints. Retargeting of a systems null space
component is also demonstrated in a task where controlling how redundancy is
resolved allows for obstacle avoidance. Finally, the approach is verified in a
real world experiment using demonstrations from a human subject where the
learnt task space trajectory is transferred onto a 7DoF physical robot of a
different embodiment.

  This paper presents preliminary results of the design, development, and
evaluation of a hand rehabilitation glove fabricated using lobster-inspired
hybrid design with rigid and soft components for actuation. Inspired by the
bending abdomen of lobsters, hybrid actuators are built with serially jointed
rigid shells actuated by pressurized soft chambers inside to generate bending

robotics with precisely-defined motion generation, as well as the emerging soft
robotics with light-weight, physically safe, and adaptive actuation. The
fabrication procedure is described, followed by experiments to mechanically
characterize these actuators. Finally, an open-palm glove design integrated
with these hybrid actuators is presented for a qualitative case study. A hand

from the user's forearm to train the assistive glove for hand rehabilitation
exercises.

crustaceans, where its bending radius and axis can be mechanically programmed
through the selective activation of the rigid exterior joints, actuated by the
soft actuators inside. The hybrid actuator was experimentally measured in terms

  Soft actuators have drawn significant attention from researchers with an
inherently compliant design to address the safety issues in physical
human-robot interactions. However, they are also vulnerable and pose new
challenges in the design, fabrication, and analysis due to their inherent
material softness. In this paper, a novel hybrid actuator design is presented
with bio-inspirations from the lobster, or crustaceans in a broader
perspective. We enclose a soft chamber with rectangular cross-section using a
series of articulated rigid shells to produce bending under pneumatic input. By
mimicking the shell pattern of lobsters' abdomen, foldable rigid shells are
designed to provide the soft actuator with full protection throughout the
motion range. The articulation of the rigid shells predefines the actuator's
bending motions. As a result, the proposed design enables one to analyze this
hybrid actuator with simplified quasi-static models and rigid-body kinematics,
which are further validated by mechanical tests. This paper demonstrates that
the proposed hybrid actuator design is capable of bridging the major design
drawbacks of the entirely rigid and soft robots while preserving their
engineering merits in performance.

trajectories. A straightforward transcription of this formulation into a
nonlinear programming problem is not tractable for state-of-the-art solvers,
but it is possible to overcome this complication by exploiting the structure

solutions. We demonstrate the results of our approach using a quadruped robot

Title: Socially-Aware Robot Planning via Bandit Human Feedback
Authors: Xusheng Luo, Yan Zhang, Michael M. Zavlanos
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures
\\
  In this paper, we consider the problem of designing collision-free,
dynamically feasible, and socially-aware trajectories for robots operating in
environments populated by humans. We define trajectories to be social-aware if
they do not interfere with humans in any way that causes discomfort. In this
paper, discomfort is defined broadly and, depending on specific individuals, it
can result from the robot being too close to a human or from interfering with
human sight or tasks. Moreover, we assume that human feedback is a bandit
feedback indicating a complaint or no complaint on the part of the robot
trajectory that interferes with the humans, and it does not reveal any
contextual information about the locations of the humans or the reason for a
complaint. Finally, we assume that humans can move in the obstacle-free space
and, as a result, human utility can change. We formulate this planning problem
as an online optimization problem that minimizes the social value of the
time-varying robot trajectory, defined by the total number of incurred human
complaints. As the human utility is unknown, we employ zeroth order, or
derivative-free, optimization methods to solve this problem, which we combine
with off-the-shelf motion planners to satisfy the dynamic feasibility and
collision-free specifications of the resulting trajectories. To the best of our
knowledge, this is a new framework for socially-aware robot planning that is
not restricted to avoiding collisions with humans but, instead, focuses on
increasing the social value of the robot trajectories using only bandit human
feedback.

Title: MVP: Unified Motion and Visual Self-Supervised Learning for Large-Scale
  Robotic Navigation
Authors: Marvin Chanc\'an, Michael Milford
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Under review at IROS 2020
\\
  Autonomous navigation emerges from both motion and local visual perception in
real-world environments. However, most successful robotic motion estimation
methods (e.g. VO, SLAM, SfM) and vision systems (e.g. CNN, visual place
recognition-VPR) are often separately used for mapping and localization tasks.
Conversely, recent reinforcement learning (RL) based methods for visual
navigation rely on the quality of GPS data reception, which may not be reliable
when directly using it as ground truth across multiple, month-spaced traversals
in large environments. In this paper, we propose a novel motion and visual
perception approach, dubbed MVP, that unifies these two sensor modalities for
large-scale, target-driven navigation tasks. Our MVP-based method can learn
faster, and is more accurate and robust to both extreme environmental changes
and poor GPS data than corresponding vision-only navigation methods. MVP
temporally incorporates compact image representations, obtained using VPR, with
optimized motion estimation data, including but not limited to those from VO or
optimized radar odometry (RO), to efficiently learn self-supervised navigation
policies via RL. We evaluate our method on two large real-world datasets,
Oxford Robotcar and Nordland Railway, over a range of weather (e.g. overcast,
night, snow, sun, rain, clouds) and seasonal (e.g. winter, spring, fall,
summer) conditions using the new CityLearn framework; an interactive
environment for efficiently training navigation agents. Our experimental
results, on traversals of the Oxford RobotCar dataset with no GPS data, show
that MVP can achieve 53% and 93% navigation success rate using VO and RO,
respectively, compared to 7% for a vision-only method. We additionally report a
trade-off between the RL success rate and the motion estimation precision.

Title: Safe Speed Control and Collision Probability Estimation Under Ego-Pose
  Uncertainty for Autonomous Vehicle
Authors: Vladislav Kibalov and Oleg Shipitko
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  In order for autonomous vehicles to become a part of the Intelligent
Transportation Ecosystem, they are required to guarantee a particular level of
safety. For that to happen a safe vehicle control algorithms need to be
developed, which include assessing the probability of a collision while driving
along a given trajectory and selecting control signals that minimize this
probability. In this paper, we propose a speed control system that estimates a
collision probability taking into account static and dynamic obstacles as well
as ego-pose uncertainty and chooses the maximum safe speed. For that, the
planned trajectory is converted by the control system into control signals that
form input for the dynamic vehicle model. The model predicts a real vehicle
path. The predicted trajectory is generated for each particle -- a weighted by
a probability hypothesis of the localization system about the vehicle pose.
Based on the predicted particles' trajectories, the probability of collision is
calculated, and a decision is made on the maximum safe speed. The proposed
algorithm was validated on the real autonomous vehicle. The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed speed control system reduces the vehicle
speed to a safe value when performing maneuvers and driving through narrow
openings. Therefore the observed behavior of the system is mimicking a human
driver behavior when driving in difficult and ambiguous traffic situations.

Title: Design and Implementation of A Novel Precision Irrigation Robot Based on
  An Intelligent Path Planning Algorithm
Authors: Minghan Chen, Yilong Sun, Xueqing Cai, Boyi Liu, Tenglong Ren
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  The agricultural irrigation system is closely related to agricultural
production. There are some problems in nowadays agricultural irrigation system,
such as poor mobility, imprecision and high price. To address these issues, an
intelligent irrigation robot is designed and implemented in this work. The
robot achieves precise irrigation by the irrigation path planning algorithm
which is improved by Bayesian theory. In the proposed algorithm, we utilize as
much information as possible to achieve full coverage irrigation in the complex
agricultural environment. Besides, we propose the maximum risk to avoid the
problem of lack of inspection in certain areas. Finally, We carried out
simulation experiments and field experiments to verify the robot and the
algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the robot is capable of
fulfilling the requirements of various agricultural irrigation tasks.

Title: Efficient Latent Representations using Multiple Tasks for Autonomous
  Driving
Authors: Eshagh Kargar and Ville Kyrki
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 6 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IROS 2020
\\
  Driving in the dynamic, multi-agent, and complex urban environment is a
difficult task requiring a complex decision policy. The learning of such a
policy requires a state representation that can encode the entire environment.
Mid-level representations that encode a vehicle's environment as images have
become a popular choice, but they are quite high-dimensional, which limits
their use in data-scarce cases such as reinforcement learning. In this article,
we propose to learn a low dimensional and rich feature representation of the
environment by training an encoder-decoder deep neural network to predict
multiple application relevant factors such as trajectories of other agents. We
demonstrate that the use of the multi-head encoder-decoder neural network
results in a more informative representation compared to a single-head
encoder-decoder model. In particular, the proposed representation learning
approach helps the policy network to learn faster, with increased performance
and with less data, compared to existing approaches using a single-head
network.

Title: Planning to Build Soma Blocks Using a Dual-arm Robot
Authors: Hao Chen, Weiwei Wan, Keisuke Koyama, and Kensuke Harada
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  This paper presents a planner that can automatically find an optimal assembly
sequence for a dual-arm robot to assemble the soma blocks. The planner uses the
mesh model of objects and the final state of the assembly to generate all
possible assembly sequence and evaluate the optimal assembly sequence by
considering the stability, graspability, assemblability, as well as the need
for a second arm. Especially, the need for a second arm is considered when
supports from worktables and other workpieces are not enough to produce a
stable assembly. The planner will refer to an assisting grasp to additionally
hold and support the unstable components so that the robot can further assemble
new workpieces and finally reach a stable state. The output of the planner is
the optimal assembly orders, candidate grasps, assembly directions, and the
assisting grasps if any. The output of the planner can be used to guide a
dual-arm robot to perform the assembly task. The planner is verified in both
simulations and real-world executions.

Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Nowadays, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is considered by the
Robotics community to be a mature field. Currently, there are many open-source
systems that are able to deliver fast and accurate estimation in typical
real-world scenarios. Still, all these systems often provide an ad-hoc
implementation that entailed to predefined sensor configurations. In this work,
we tackle this issue, proposing a novel SLAM architecture specifically designed
to address heterogeneous sensors' configuration and to standardize SLAM
solutions. Thanks to its modularity and to specific design patterns, the
presented architecture is easy to extend, enhancing code reuse and efficiency.
Finally, adopting our solution, we conducted comparative experiments for a
variety of sensor configurations, showing competitive results that confirm
state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Spatiotemporal Learning of Multivehicle Interaction Patterns in
  Lane-Change Scenarios
Authors: Chengyuan Zhang, Jiacheng Zhu, Wenshuo Wang, Junqiang Xi
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
\\
  Interpretation of common-yet-challenging interaction scenarios can benefit
well-founded decisions for autonomous vehicles. Previous research achieved this
using their prior knowledge of specific scenarios with predefined models, which
limits their adaptive capabilities. This paper describes a Bayesian
nonparametric approach that leverages continuous (i.e., Gaussian processes) and
discrete (i.e., Dirichlet processes) stochastic processes to reveal underlying
interaction patterns of the ego vehicle with other nearby vehicles. Our model
relaxes dependency on the number of surrounding vehicles by developing an
acceleration-sensitive velocity field based on Gaussian processes. The
experiment results demonstrate that the velocity field can represent the
spatial interactions between the ego vehicle and its surroundings. Then, a
discrete Bayesian nonparametric model, integrating Dirichlet processes and
hidden Markov models, is developed to learn the interaction patterns over the
temporal space by segmenting and clustering the sequential interaction data
into interpretable granular patterns automatically. We then evaluate our
approach in the highway lane-change scenarios using the highD dataset, which
was collected from real-world settings. Results demonstrate that our proposed
Bayesian nonparametric approach provides an insight into the complicated
lane-change interactions of the ego vehicle with multiple surrounding traffic
participants based on the interpretable interaction patterns and their
transition properties in temporal relationships. Our proposed approach sheds
light on efficiently analyzing other kinds of multi-agent interactions, such as
vehicle-pedestrian interactions.

Title: Gaining a Sense of Touch. Physical Parameters Estimation using a Soft
  Gripper and Neural Networks
Authors: Micha{\l} Bednarek, Piotr Kicki, Jakub Bednarek, Krzysztof Walas
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to IEEE IROS 2020
\\
  Soft grippers are gaining significant attention in the manipulation of
elastic objects, where it is required to handle soft and unstructured objects
which are vulnerable to deformations. A crucial problem is to estimate the
physical parameters of a squeezed object to adjust the manipulation procedure,
which is considered as a significant challenge. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, there is not enough research on physical parameters estimation using
deep learning algorithms on data from direct interaction with objects using
robotic grippers. In our work, we proposed a trainable system for the
regression of a stiffness coefficient and provided extensive experiments using
the physics simulator environment. Moreover, we prepared the application that
works in the real-world scenario. Our system can reliably estimate the
stiffness of an object using the Yale OpenHand soft gripper based on readings
from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) attached to its fingers. Additionally,
during the experiments, we prepared three datasets of signals gathered while
squeezing objects -- two created in the simulation environment and one composed
of real data.

Title: Fabric Defect Detection Using Vision-Based Tactile Sensor
Authors: Bin Fang, Xingming Long, Yifan Zhang, GuoYi Luo, Fuchun Sun, Huaping
  Liu
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  This paper introduces a new type of system for fabric defect detection with
the tactile inspection system. Different from existed visual inspection
systems, the proposed system implements a vision-based tactile sensor. The
tactile sensor, which mainly consists of a camera, four LEDs, and an elastic
sensing layer, captures detailed information about fabric surface structure and
ignores the color and pattern. Thus, the ambiguity between a defect and image
background related to fabric color and pattern is avoided. To utilize the
tactile sensor for fabric inspection, we employ intensity adjustment for image
preprocessing, Residual Network with ensemble learning for detecting defects,
and uniformity measurement for selecting ideal dataset for model training. An
experiment is conducted to verify the performance of the proposed tactile
system. The experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of the
proposed system, which performs well in detecting structural defects for
various types of fabrics. In addition, the system does not require external
light sources, which skips the process of setting up and tuning a lighting
environment.

  Environments

Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Visually poor scenarios are one of the main sources of failure in visual
localization systems in outdoor environments. To address this challenge, we
present MOZARD, a multi-modal localization system for urban outdoor
environments using vision and LiDAR. By extending our preexisting key-point
based visual multi-session local localization approach with the use of semantic
data, an improved localization recall can be achieved across vastly different
appearance conditions.In particular we focus on the use of curbstone
information because of their broad distribution and reliability within urban
environments. We present thorough experimental evaluations on several driving
kilometers in challenging urban outdoor environments, analyze the recall and
accuracy of our localization system and demonstrate in a case study possible
failure cases of each subsystem. We demonstrate that MOZARD is able to bridge
scenarios where our previous work VIZARD fails, hence yielding an increased
recall performance, while a similar localization accuracy of 0.2m is achieved

Title: A Self-Supervised Learning Approach to Rapid Path Planning for Car-Like
  Vehicles Maneuvering in Urban Environment
Authors: Piotr Kicki, Tomasz Gawron, Piotr Skrzypczy\'nski
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
ACM-class: I.2.9; I.2.6; J.2
\\
  An efficient path planner for autonomous car-like vehicles should handle the
strong kinematic constraints, particularly in confined spaces commonly
encountered while maneuvering in city traffic, and should enable rapid
planning, as the city traffic scenarios are highly dynamic. State-of-the-art
planning algorithms handle such difficult cases at high computational cost,
often yielding non-deterministic results. However, feasible local paths can be
quickly generated leveraging the past planning experience gained in the same or
similar environment. While learning through supervised training is problematic
for real traffic scenarios, we introduce in this paper a novel neural
network-based method for path planning, which employs a gradient-based
self-supervised learning algorithm to predict feasible paths. This approach
strongly exploits the experience gained in the past and rapidly yields feasible
maneuver plans for car-like vehicles with limited steering-angle. The
effectiveness of such an approach has been confirmed by computational
experiments.

Title: On robot compliance. A cerebellar control approach
Authors: Ignacio Abadia, Francisco Naveros, Jesus A. Garrido, Eduardo Ros,

Categories: cs.RO cs.NE cs.SY eess.SY
DOI: 10.1109/TCYB.2019.2945498
\\
  The work presented here is a novel biological approach for the compliant
control of a robotic arm in real time (RT). We integrate a spiking cerebellar
network at the core of a feedback control loop performing torque-driven
control. The spiking cerebellar controller provides torque commands allowing
for accurate and coordinated arm movements. To compute these output motor
commands, the spiking cerebellar controller receives the robot's sensorial
signals, the robot's goal behavior, and an instructive signal. These input
signals are translated into a set of evolving spiking patterns representing
univocally a specific system state at every point of time.
Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is then supported, allowing for
building adaptive control. The spiking cerebellar controller continuously
adapts the torque commands provided to the robot from experience as STDP is
deployed. Adaptive torque commands, in turn, help the spiking cerebellar
controller to cope with built-in elastic elements within the robot's actuators
mimicking human muscles (inherently elastic). We propose a natural integration
of a bio inspired control scheme, based on the cerebellum, with a compliant
robot. We prove that our compliant approach outperforms the accuracy of the
default factory-installed position control in a set of tasks used for
addressing cerebellar motor behavior: controlling six degrees of freedom (DoF)
in smooth movements, fast ballistic movements, and unstructured scenario
compliant movements.

  We present ProxEmo, a novel end-to-end emotion prediction algorithm for

perceived emotions of a pedestrian from walking gaits, which is then used for
emotion-guided navigation taking into account social and proxemic constraints.
To classify emotions, we propose a multi-view skeleton graph convolution-based
model that works on a commodity camera mounted onto a moving robot. Our emotion
recognition is integrated into a mapless navigation scheme and makes no
assumptions about the environment of pedestrian motion. It achieves a mean
average emotion prediction precision of 82.47% on the Emotion-Gait benchmark
dataset. We outperform current state-of-art algorithms for emotion recognition
from 3D gaits. We highlight its benefits in terms of navigation in indoor
scenes using a Clearpath Jackal robot.

Title: Harmonics Based Representation in Clarinet Tone Quality Evaluation

Categories: cs.SD cs.MM eess.AS
\\
  Music tone quality evaluation is generally performed by experts. It could be
subjective and short of consistency and fairness as well as time-consuming. In
this paper we present a new method for identifying the clarinet reed quality by
evaluating tone quality based on the harmonic structure and energy
distribution. We first decouple the quality of reed and clarinet pipe based on
the acoustic harmonics, and discover that the reed quality is strongly relevant
to the even parts of the harmonics. Then we construct a features set consisting
of the even harmonic envelope and the energy distribution of harmonics in
spectrum. The annotated clarinet audio data are recorded from 3 levels of
performers and the tone quality is classified by machine learning. The results
show that our new method for identifying low and medium high tones
significantly outperforms previous methods.

Title: Declarative Stream Runtime Verification (hLola)
Authors: Martin Ceresa, Felipe Gorostiaga, Cesar Sanchez
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: 23 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Stream Runtime Verification is a formal dynamic analysis technique that
generalizes runtime verification algorithms from temporal logics like LTL to
stream monitoring, allowing to compute richer verdicts than Booleans (including
quantitative and arbitrary data). In this paper we study the problem of
implementing an SRV engine that is truly extensible to arbitrary data theories,
and we propose a solution as a Haskell embedded domain specific language. In
spite of the theoretical clean separation in SRV between temporal dependencies
and data computations, previous engines include ad-hoc implementations of a few
data types, requiring complex changes to incorporate new data theories. We
propose here an SRV language called hLola that borrows general Haskell types
and embeds them transparently into an eDSL. This novel technique, which we call
lift deep embedding, allows for example, the use of higher-order functions for
static stream parameterization. We describe the Haskell implementation of hLola
and illustrate simple extensions implemented using libraries, which require
long and error-prone additions in other ad-hoc SRV formalisms.

Title: Automated Regression Unit Test Generation for Program Merges
Authors: Tao Ji, Liqian Chen, Xiaoguang Mao, Xin Yi, Jiahong Jiang
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Merging other branches into the current working branch is common in
collaborative software development. However, developers still heavily rely on
the textual merge tools to handle the complicated merge tasks. The latent
semantic merge conflicts may fail to be detected and degrade the software
quality. Regression testing is able to prevent regression faults and has been
widely used in real-world software development. However, the merged software
may fail to be well examined by rerunning the existing whole test suite.
Intuitively, if the test suite fails to cover the changes of different branches
at the same time, the merge conflicts would fail to be detected. Recently, it
has been proposed to conduct verification on 3-way merges, but this approach
does not support even some common cases such as different changes made to
different parts of the program. In this paper, we propose an approach of
regression unit test generation specifically for checking program merges
according to our proposed test oracles. And our general test oracles support us
to examine not only 3-way merges, but also 2-way and octopus merges.
Considering the conflicts may arise in other locations besides changed methods
of the project, we design an algorithm to select UUTs based on the dependency
analysis of the whole project. On this basis, we implement a tool called TOM to
generate unit tests for Java program merges. We also design the benchmark
MCon4J consisting of 389 conflict 3-way merges and 389 conflict octopus merges
to facilitate further studies on this topic. The experimental results show that
TOM finds 45 conflict 3- way merges and 87 conflicts octopus merges, while the
verification based tool fails to work on MCon4J.

\\
  Testing is an important technique to improve the quality of Ethereum smart
contract programs. However, current work on testing smart contract only focus
on static problems of smart contract programs. A data flow oriented test case
generation approach for dynamic testing of smart contract programs is still
missing. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel test case
generation approach, called ADF-GA (All-uses Data Flow criterion based test
case generation using Genetic Algorithm), for Solidity based Ethereum smart
contract programs. ADF-GA aims to efficiently generate a valid set of test
cases via three stages. First, the corresponding program control flow graph is
constructed from the source codes. Second, the generated control flow graph is
analyzed to obtain the variable information in the Solidity programs, locate
the require statements, and also get the definition-use pairs to be tested.
Finally, a genetic algorithm is used to generate test cases, in which an
improved fitness function is proposed to calculate the definition-use pairs
coverage of each test case with program instrumentation. Experimental studies
are performed on several representative Solidity programs. The results show
that ADF-GA can effectively generate test cases, achieve better coverage, and
reduce the number of iterations in genetic algorithm.

Title: The cross cyclomatic complexity: a bi-dimensional measure for program
  complexity on graphs
Authors: Hugo Tremblay and Fabio Petrillo
Categories: cs.SE cs.PL
\\
  Reduce and control complexity is an essential practice in software design.
Cyclomatic complexity (CC) is one of the most popular software metrics, applied
for more than 40 years. Despite CC is an interesting metric to highlight the
number of branches in a program, it clearly not sufficient to represent the
complexity in a piece of software. In this paper, we introduce the cross
cyclomatic complexity (CCC), a new bi-dimensional complexity measure on graphs
that combines the cyclomatic complexity and the weight of a minimum-weight
cycle basis in as pair on the Cartesian plan to characterize program complexity
using control flow graphs. Our postulates open a new venue to represent program
complexity, and we discuss its implications and opportunities.

Title: Longitudinal Evaluation of Open-Source Software Maintainability
Authors: Arthur-Jozsef Molnar and Simona Motogna
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  We present a longitudinal study on the long-term evolution of maintainability
in open-source software. Quality assessment remains at the forefront of both
software research and practice, with many models and assessment methodologies
proposed and used over time. Some of them helped create and shape standards
such as ISO 9126 and 25010, which are well established today. Both describe
software quality in terms of characteristics such as reliability, security or
maintainability. An important body of research exists linking these
characteristics with software metrics, and proposing ways to automate quality
assessment by aggregating software metric values into higher-level quality
models. We employ the Maintainability Index, technical debt ratio and a
maintainability model based on the ARiSA Compendium. Our study covers the
entire 18 year development history and all released versions for three complex,
open-source applications. We determine the maintainability for each version
using the proposed models, we compare obtained results and use manual source
code examination to put them into context. We examine the common development
patterns of the target applications and study the relation between refactoring
and maintainability. Finally, we study the strengths and weaknesses of each
maintainability model using manual source code examination as the baseline.

Title: Experience in engineering of scientific software: The case of an
  optimization software for oil pipelines
Authors: Vahid Garousi, Ehsan Abbasi, Bedir Tekinerdogan
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Development of scientific and engineering software is usually different and
could be more challenging than the development of conventional enterprise
software. The authors were involved in a technology-transfer project between
academia and industry which focused on engineering, development and testing of
a software for optimization of pumping energy costs for oil pipelines. Experts
with different skillsets (mechanical, power and software engineers) were
involved. Given the complex nature of the software (a sophisticated underlying
optimization model) and having experts from different fields, there were
challenges in various software engineering aspects of the software system
(e.g., requirements and testing). We report our observations and experience in
addressing those challenges during our technology-transfer project, and aim to
add to the existing body of experience and evidence in engineering of
scientific and engineering software. We believe that our observations,
experience and lessons learnt could be useful for other researchers and
practitioners in engineering of other scientific and engineering software
systems.

Title: Change Point Detection in Software Performance Testing
Authors: David Daly, William Brown, Henrik Ingo, Jim O'Leary, David Bradford
Categories: cs.SE cs.DB cs.PF
DOI: 10.1145/3358960.3375791
\\
  We describe our process for automatic detection of performance changes for a
software product in the presence of noise. A large collection of tests run
periodically as changes to our software product are committed to our source
repository, and we would like to identify the commits responsible for
performance regressions. Previously, we relied on manual inspection of time
series graphs to identify significant changes. That was later replaced with a
threshold-based detection system, but neither system was sufficient for finding
changes in performance in a timely manner. This work describes our recent
implementation of a change point detection system built upon the E-Divisive
means algorithm. The algorithm produces a list of change points representing
significant changes from a given history of performance results. A human
reviews the list of change points for actionable changes, which are then
triaged for further inspection. Using change point detection has had a dramatic
impact on our ability to detect performance changes. Quantitatively, it has
dramatically dropped our false positive rate for performance changes, while
qualitatively it has made the entire performance evaluation process easier,
more productive (ex. catching smaller regressions), and more timely.

  We report on the state-of-the-art of software visualization. To ensure
reproducibility, we adopted the Systematic Literature Review methodology. That
is, we analyzed 1440 entries from IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library
databases. We selected 105 relevant full papers published in 2013-2019, which
we classified based on the aspect of the software system that is supported
(i.e., structure, behavior, and evolution). For each paper, we extracted main
dimensions that characterize software visualizations, such as software
engineering tasks, roles of users, information visualization techniques, and
media used to display visualizations. We provide researchers in the field an
overview of the state-of-the-art in software visualization and highlight
research opportunities. We also help developers to identify suitable
visualizations for their particular context by matching software visualizations
to development concerns and concrete details to obtain available visualization
tools.

Title: Examining user reviews of conversational systems: a case study of Alexa
  skills
Authors: Soodeh Atefi, Andrew Truelove, Matheus Rheinschmitt, Eduardo Almeida,
  Iftekhar Ahmed and Amin Alipour
Categories: cs.SE cs.HC
Comments: Draft
\\
  Conversational systems use spoken language to interact with their users.
Although conversational systems, such as Amazon Alexa, are becoming common and
afford interesting functionalities, there is little known about the issues
users of these systems face.
  In this paper, we study user reviews of more than 2,800 Alexa skills to
understand the characteristics of the reviews and issues that are raised in
them. Our results suggest that most skills receive less than 50 reviews. Our
qualitative study of user reviews using open coding resulted in identifying 16
types of issues in the user reviews. Issues related to the content, integration
with online services and devices, error, and regression are top issues raised
by the users. Our results also indicate differences in volume and types of
complaints by users when compared with more traditional mobile applications. We
discuss the implication of our results for practitioners and researchers.

Title: Generalizing cyclomatic complexity via path homology
Authors: Steve Huntsman
Categories: cs.SE math.AT
\\
  Cyclomatic complexity is an incompletely specified but mathematically
principled software metric that can be usefully applied to both source and
binary code. We consider the application of path homology as a more powerful
analogue of cyclomatic complexity. There exist control flow graphs realizable
at the assembly level with nontrivial path homology in arbitrary dimension. We
exhibit several classes of examples in this vein while also experimentally
demonstrating that path homology gives identicial results to cyclomatic
complexity for at least one detailed notion of structured control flow. Thus
path homology generalizes cyclomatic complexity, and has the potential to
substantially improve upon it.

Title: Topological Differential Testing
Authors: Kristopher Ambrose, Steve Huntsman, Michael Robinson, Matvey Yutin
Categories: cs.SE math.AT
\\
  We introduce topological differential testing (TDT), an approach to
extracting the consensus behavior of a set of programs on a corpus of inputs.
TDT uses the topological notion of a simplicial complex (and implicitly draws
on richer topological notions such as sheaves and persistence) to determine
inputs that cause inconsistent behavior and in turn reveal \emph{de facto}
input specifications. We gently introduce TDT with a toy example before
detailing its application to understanding the PDF file format from the
behavior of various parsers. Finally, we discuss theoretical details and other
possible applications.

Title: Library Adoption Dynamics in Software Teams
Authors: Pamela Bilo Thomas, Rachel Krohn, Tim Weninger
Categories: cs.SI
Comments: 12 pages. Short version published at ASONAM 2019
\\
  When a group of people strives to understand new information, struggle ensues
as various ideas compete for attention. Steep learning curves are surmounted as
teams learn together. To understand how these team dynamics play out in
software development, we explore Git logs, which provide a complete change
history of software repositories. In these repositories, we observe code
additions, which represent successfully implemented ideas, and code deletions,
which represent ideas that have failed or been superseded. By examining the
patterns between these commit types, we can begin to understand how teams adopt
new information. We specifically study what happens after a software library is
adopted by a project, i.e. when a library is used for the first time in the
project. We find that a variety of factors, including team size, library
popularity, and prevalence on Stack Overflow are associated with how quickly
teams learn and successfully adopt new software libraries.

Title: Modularity-Deltas: a Semi-Global Centrality Measure for Complex Networks
Authors: Thomas Magelinski, Mihovil Bartulovic, Kathleen M. Carley
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  The phenomena of community structure in real-world networks has been central
to network science's success. While much attention has been paid to community
detection algorithms and evaluation criteria, a related question has been
overlooked: what would the change in modularity be if a node were to be deleted
from a network? In this work, we first show that the answer to this question
can be calculated for all nodes in the network in $O(m)$ time. Then, we show
that this quantity has implications in three research areas within network
science: community analysis, network robustness, and community deception.
Modularity-deltas are useful in community analysis as they are a semi-global
measure, scalable like local measures but using global information through the
network's partition.In robustness, modularity maximizing attack strategies are
more efficient than betweenness-based ones, and are shown to damage the US
Powergrid and European Road networks more effectively than degree based
attacks. Finally, we show that inverting the robustness method to select
modularity minimizing nodes solves the community deception problem in a
scalable manner.

Title: Advertisers Jump on Coronavirus Bandwagon: Politics, News, and Business

Comments: Preprint. Under Review
\\
  In the age of social media, disasters and epidemics usher not only a
devastation and affliction in the physical world, but also prompt a deluge of
information, opinions, prognoses and advice to billions of internet users. The
coronavirus epidemic of 2019-2020, or COVID-19, is no exception, with the World
Health Organization warning of a possible "infodemic" of fake news. In this
study, we examine the alternative narratives around the coronavirus outbreak
through advertisements promoted on Facebook, the largest social media platform
in the US. Using the new Facebook Ads Library, we discover advertisers from
public health and non-profit sectors, alongside those from news media,
politics, and business, incorporating coronavirus into their messaging and
agenda. We find the virus used in political attacks, donation solicitations,
business promotion, stock market advice, and animal rights campaigning. Among
these, we find several instances of possible misinformation, ranging from
bioweapons conspiracy theories to unverifiable claims by politicians. As we
make the dataset available to the community, we hope the advertising domain
will become an important part of quality control for public health
communication and public discourse in general.

Title: YouTube Recommendations and Effects on Sharing Across Online Social
  Platforms

Categories: cs.SI cs.HC
Comments: Currently under review
\\
  YouTube recently announced a decision to exclude potentially harmful content
from video recommendations while allowing such videos to remain on the
platform, but it is unclear whether this compromise is sufficient in mitigating
YouTube's role in propagating this content. To assess this impact, we measure
YouTube sharing in Twitter and Reddit in the eight months around YouTube's
announcement using interrupted time series models. These models evaluate
YouTube's impact on sharing of videos from a curated set of alternative
political channels and popular videos shared in three conspiracy-oriented
Reddit subreddits; we compare these models to a placebo dataset of
makeup-oriented videos that should be unaffected by YouTube's announcement.
Results suggest YouTube's de-recommending AIN-produced content has a
significant suppressive effect on sharing of AIN videos in both Twitter and
Reddit, with our models showing a significant and downward trend in sharing.
For conspiracy video sharing, however, we see no significant change in Reddit
and find an increase in the level of conspiracy sharing in Twitter. We see no
significant effect on makeup sharing in either platform, suggesting YouTube's
targeting particular content types has a targeted effect. Reducing exposure to
anti-social videos without deleting them therefore has the potential to improve
quality across the information ecosystem, but additional transparency is needed
to evaluate these effects further.

Title: Everything About You: A Multimodal Approach towards Friendship Inference
  in Online Social Networks
Authors: Tahleen Rahman, Mario Fritz, Michael Backes and Yang Zhang
Categories: cs.SI
Comments: 14 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Most previous works in privacy of Online Social Networks (OSN) focus on a
restricted scenario of using one type of information to infer another type of
information or using only static profile data such as username, profile picture
or home location. However the multimedia footprints of users has become
extremely diverse nowadays. In reality, an adversary would exploit all types of
information obtainable over time, to achieve its goal. In this paper, we
analyse OSN privacy by jointly exploiting longterm multimodal information. We
focus in particular on inference of social relationships. We consider five
popular components of posts shared by users, namely images, hashtags, captions,
geo-locations and published friendships. Large scale evaluation on a real-world
OSN dataset shows that while our monomodal attacks achieve strong predictions,
our multimodal attack leads to a stronger performance with AUC (area under the
ROC curve) above 0.9. Our results highlight the need for multimodal obfuscation
approaches towards protecting privacy in an era where multimedia footprints of
users get increasingly diverse.

  For a non-linear MIMO feedback system, the robustness against uncertain

of time-variation for the system to be stable is derived. The condition gives a
tolerable limit on infrequent large variations or slow time-variation rate of a

Title: On the Sample Complexity of Data-Driven Inference of the
  $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain
Authors: Miel Sharf
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Lately, data-driven control has become a widespread area of research. A few
recent big-data based approaches for data-driven control of nonlinear systems
try to use classical input-output techniques to design controllers for systems
for which only a finite number of (input-output) samples are known. These
methods focus on using the given data to compute bounds on the
$\mathcal{L}_2$-gain or on the shortage of passivity from finite input-output
data, allowing for the application of the small gain theorem or the feedback
theorem for passive systems. One question regarding these methods asks about
their sample complexity, namely how many input-output samples are needed to get
an approximation of the operator norm or of the shortage of passivity. We show
that the number of samples needed to estimate the operator norm of a system is
roughly the same as the number of samples required to approximate the system in
the operator norm.

Title: Proportional Power Sharing Control of Distributed Generators in
  Microgirds
Authors: Farzad Aalipour and Tuhin Das
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 24 pages, 19 figures
\\
  This research addresses distributed proportional power sharing of
inverter-based Distributed Generators (DGs) in microgrids under variations in
maximum power capacity of DGs. A microgrid can include renewable energy
resources such as wind turbines, solar panels, fuel cells, etc. The
intermittent nature of such energy resources causes variations in their maximum
power capacities. Since DGs in microgrids can be regarded as
Multi-Agent-Systems (MASs), a consensus algorithm is designed to have the DGs
generate their output power in proportion to their maximum capacities under
capacity fluctuations. A change in power capacity of a DG triggers the
consensus algorithm which uses a communication map at the cyber layer to
estimate the corresponding change. During the transient time of reaching a
consensus, the delivered power may not match the load power demand. To
eliminate this mismatch, a control law is augmented that consists of a finite
time consensus algorithm embedded within the overarching power sharing
consensus algorithm. The effectiveness of the distributed controller is
assessed through simulation of a microgrid consisting of a realistic model of
inverter-based DGs.

Title: Formal Controller Synthesis for Continuous-Space MDPs via Model-Free
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Abolfazl Lavaei, Fabio Somenzi, Sadegh Soudjani, Ashutosh Trivedi, and
  Majid Zamani
Categories: eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY
Comments: This work is accepted at the 11th ACM/IEEE Conference on
  Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS)
\\
  A novel reinforcement learning scheme to synthesize policies for
continuous-space Markov decision processes (MDPs) is proposed. This scheme
enables one to apply model-free, off-the-shelf reinforcement learning
algorithms for finite MDPs to compute optimal strategies for the corresponding
continuous-space MDPs without explicitly constructing the finite-state
abstraction. The proposed approach is based on abstracting the system with a
finite MDP (without constructing it explicitly) with unknown transition
probabilities, synthesizing strategies over the abstract MDP, and then mapping
the results back over the concrete continuous-space MDP with approximate
optimality guarantees. The properties of interest for the system belong to a
fragment of linear temporal logic, known as syntactically co-safe linear
temporal logic (scLTL), and the synthesis requirement is to maximize the
probability of satisfaction within a given bounded time horizon. A key
contribution of the paper is to leverage the classical convergence results for
reinforcement learning on finite MDPs and provide control strategies maximizing
the probability of satisfaction over unknown, continuous-space MDPs while
providing probabilistic closeness guarantees. Automata-based reward functions
are often sparse; we present a novel potential-based reward shaping technique
to produce dense rewards to speed up learning. The effectiveness of the
proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to three physical benchmarks
concerning the regulation of a room's temperature, control of a road traffic
cell, and of a 7-dimensional nonlinear model of a BMW 320i car.

Title: Fusing Physics-based and Deep Learning Models for Prognostics
Authors: Manuel Arias Chao, Chetan Kulkarni, Kai Goebel, Olga Fink
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 18 pages, 11 figures, Under Review
\\
  Data-driven and physics-based models for remaining useful lifetime (RUL)
prediction typically suffer from two major challenges that limit their
applicability to complex real-world domains: (a) high complexity or
incompleteness of physics-based models and (b) limited representativeness of
the training dataset for data-driven models. The work proposed in the paper
describes a novel hybrid framework for fusing the information from
physics-based performance models with deep learning algorithms for prognostics
of complex safety critical systems under real-world scenarios. In this
framework, we use physics-based performance models to infer unobservable model
parameters related to the system's components health solving a calibration
problem a.k.a. an inverse problem. These parameters are subsequently combined
with sensor readings and used as input to a deep neural network to generate a
data-driven prognostics model. The performance of the hybrid framework is
evaluated on a synthetic dataset comprising run-to-failure degradation
trajectories from a small fleet of nine turbofan engines under a wide range of
real flight conditions. The dataset was generated with the Commercial Modular
Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dynamical model developed at NASA.
The performance of the approach is compared to an alternative data-driven
approach where only sensor data are used as input to the deep neural network. A
scenario of incomplete representation of the test degradation conditions in the
training dataset is evaluated. The experimental results show that the hybrid
framework outperforms the alternative pure data-driven approach by extending
the prediction horizon by nearly 100% and decreasing the prediction error by
34% based on the applied metrics.

Title: Profitability of Photovoltaic and Battery Systems on Municipal Buildings

\\
  The increasing gap between electricity prices and feed-in tariffs for
photovoltaic (PV) electricity in many countries, along with the recent strong
cost degression of batteries, led to a rise in installed combined PV and
battery systems worldwide. The load profile of a property greatly affects the
self-consumption rate and, thus, the profitability of the system. Therefore,
insights from analyses of residential applications, which are well studied,
cannot simply be transferred to other types of properties. In comparison to
residential applications, PV is especially suitable for municipal buildings,
due to their better match of demand and supply. In order to analyze the value
of additional batteries, municipal PV battery systems of different sizes were
simulated, taking load profiles of 101 properties as inputs. It was found that
self-consumption differs significantly from households, while different types
of municipal buildings are largely similar in terms of the indicators analyzed.
The share of electricity consumed during summertime was found to have the most
significant impact on the self-consumption rate for most considered system
sizes. Due to lower electricity tariffs and lower increases in self-consumption
provided through batteries in municipal buildings, the investment into a
battery is not economically advantageous in most of the cases considered.

  Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are measurement devices long used in
transmission systems and today even more essential for a proper monitoring of
distribution grids. The expected massive penetration of distributed energy
resources (DERs) is slowly taking place, carrying along a new set of challenges
that put to test traditional instruments and requiring more performance and
flexibility to adapt to this evolving scenario. Cheap devices based on single
board computer (SBC) are proving to be a valid alternative to traditional PMU
architectures, able to combine together high-performance, great versatility and
low-cost. However, such devices lack a proper modeling of their measurement
errors that conversely would be extremely useful for improving their design and
evaluate their performance in accordance with the relevant standards. The paper
intends to fill this gap by discussing the error sources and their effects on
the observed signals. An analysis of error statistics is presented, in order to
give a more complete metrological characterization.

Title: Data-Driven Control of Unknown Systems: A Linear Programming Approach
Authors: Alexandros Tanzanakis and John Lygeros
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  We consider the problem of discounted optimal state-feedback regulation for
general unknown deterministic discrete-time systems. It is well known that
open-loop instability of systems, non-quadratic cost functions and complex
nonlinear dynamics, as well as the on-policy behavior of many reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, make the design of model-free optimal adaptive
controllers a challenging task. We depart from commonly used least-squares and
neural network approximation methods in conventional model-free control theory,
and propose a novel family of data-driven optimization algorithms based on
linear programming, off-policy Q-learning and randomized experience replay. We
develop both policy iteration (PI) and value iteration (VI) methods to compute
an approximate optimal feedback controller with high precision and without the
knowledge of a system model and stage cost function. Simulation studies confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Title: Mixed Reinforcement Learning with Additive Stochastic Uncertainty
Authors: Yao Mu, Shengbo Eben Li, Chang Liu, Qi Sun, Bingbing Nie, Bo Cheng,
  and Baiyu Peng
Categories: eess.SY cs.LG cs.RO cs.SY stat.ML
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) methods often rely on massive exploration data to
search optimal policies, and suffer from poor sampling efficiency. This paper
presents a mixed reinforcement learning (mixed RL) algorithm by simultaneously
using dual representations of environmental dynamics to search the optimal
policy with the purpose of improving both learning accuracy and training speed.
The dual representations indicate the environmental model and the state-action
data: the former can accelerate the learning process of RL, while its inherent
model uncertainty generally leads to worse policy accuracy than the latter,
which comes from direct measurements of states and actions. In the framework
design of the mixed RL, the compensation of the additive stochastic model
uncertainty is embedded inside the policy iteration RL framework by using
explored state-action data via iterative Bayesian estimator (IBE). The optimal
policy is then computed in an iterative way by alternating between policy
evaluation (PEV) and policy improvement (PIM). The convergence of the mixed RL
is proved using the Bellman's principle of optimality, and the recursive
stability of the generated policy is proved via the Lyapunov's direct method.
The effectiveness of the mixed RL is demonstrated by a typical optimal control
problem of stochastic non-affine nonlinear systems (i.e., double lane change
task with an automated vehicle).

  In this paper we consider a class of linear time invariant systems with
infinitely many unstable modes. By using the parameterization of all
stabilizing controllers, we show that H-infinity controllers for such systems
can be computed using the techniques developed earlier for infinite dimensional
plants with finitely many unstable modes. We illustrate connections between the
problem solved here and an indirect method for strongly stabilizing H-infinity
controller design for systems with time delays.

Title: Eco-Vehicular Edge Networks for Connected Transportation: A
  Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach

\\
  This paper introduces an energy-efficient, software-defined vehicular edge
network for the growing intelligent connected transportation system. A joint
user-centric virtual cell formation and resource allocation problem is
investigated to bring eco-solutions at the edge. This joint problem aims to
combat against the power-hungry edge nodes while maintaining assured
reliability and data rate. More specifically, by prioritizing the downlink
communication of dynamic eco-routing, highly mobile autonomous vehicles are
served with multiple low-powered access points simultaneously for ubiquitous
connectivity and guaranteed reliability of the network. The formulated
optimization is extremely troublesome to solve within a polynomial time, due to
its complicated combinatorial structure. Hence, a decentralized multi-agent
reinforcement learning (D-MARL) algorithm is proposed for eco-vehicular edges.
First, the algorithm segments the centralized action space into multiple
smaller groups. Based on the model-free decentralized Q learner, each edge
agent then takes its actions from the respective group. Also, in each learning
state, a software-defined controller chooses the global best action from
individual bests of all of the distributed agents. Numerical results validate
that our learning solution outperforms existing baseline schemes and achieves
near-optimal performance.

  Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a versatile approach that enables the
construction of low-order models from data. Controller design tasks based on
such models require estimates and guarantees on predictive accuracy. In this
work, we provide a theoretical analysis of DMD model errors that reveals impact
of model order and data availability. The analysis also establishes conditions
under which DMD models can be made asymptotically exact. We verify our results
using a 2D diffusion system.

  In recent years, different mathematical models have been proposed for widely
used internet control mechanisms. Simple low order controllers (such as PID,
and Smith predictor based linear controllers that are easy to implement) are
desired for network traffic management. In order to design such simple
controllers for Active Queue Management (AQM), delay based linear models have
been considered. In this paper we discuss tuning of the PID controllers by
using a parameter space method, which computes stability regions of a class of
quasi-polynomials in terms of free controller parameters.

Authors: Lixia Yan and Baoli Ma
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  The leader-follower formation control analysis for multiple quad-rotor
systems is investigated in this paper. To achieve predefined formation in the
three-dimensional air space ($x,y$ and $z$), a novel local tracking control law
and a distributed observer are obtained. The local tracking control law starts
with finding a bounded continuous yet greater-than-zero control in $z$, based
on which following a feedback linearization controls derived for errors
associated with $x$ and $y$. The distributed observer achieves position
coordination among followers, though there are only partial followers can know
the leader's states and only neighboring communication is available. Simulation
results validate the proposed formation scheme.

  Tumor segmentation in oncological PET images is challenging, a major reason
being the partial-volume effects that arise from low system resolution and a
finite pixel size. The latter results in pixels containing more than one
region, also referred to as tissue-fraction effects. Conventional
classification-based segmentation approaches are inherently limited in
accounting for the tissue-fraction effects. To address this limitation, we pose
the segmentation task as an estimation problem. We propose a Bayesian method
that estimates the posterior mean of the tumorfraction area within each pixel
and uses these estimates to define the segmented tumor boundary. The method was
implemented using an autoencoder. Quantitative evaluation of the method was
performed using realistic simulation studies conducted in the context of
segmenting the primary tumor in PET images of patients with lung cancer. For
these studies, a framework was developed to generate clinically realistic
simulated PET images. Realism of these images was quantitatively confirmed
using a two-alternative-forced-choice study by six trained readers with
expertise in reading PET scans. The evaluation studies demonstrated that the
proposed segmentation method was accurate, significantly outperformed widely
used conventional methods on the tasks of tumor segmentation and estimation of
tumor-fraction areas, was relatively insensitive to partial-volume effects, and
reliably estimated the ground-truth tumor boundaries. Further, these results
were obtained across different clinical-scanner configurations. This
proof-of-concept study demonstrates the efficacy of an estimation-based
approach to PET segmentation.

Title: Stochastic Calibration of Radio Interferometers
Authors: Sarod Yatawatta
Categories: astro-ph.IM cs.AI cs.DC
\\
  With ever increasing data rates produced by modern radio telescopes like
LOFAR and future telescopes like the SKA, many data processing steps are
overwhelmed by the amount of data that needs to be handled using limited
compute resources. Calibration is one such operation that dominates the overall
data processing computational cost, nonetheless, it is an essential operation
to reach many science goals. Calibration algorithms do exist that scale well
with the number of stations of an array and the number of directions being
calibrated. However, the remaining bottleneck is the raw data volume, which
scales with the number of baselines, and which is proportional to the square of
the number of stations. We propose a 'stochastic' calibration strategy where we
only read in a mini-batch of data for obtaining calibration solutions, as
opposed to reading the full batch of data being calibrated. Nonetheless, we
obtain solutions that are valid for the full batch of data. Normally, data need
to be averaged before calibration is performed to accommodate the data in
size-limited compute memory. Stochastic calibration overcomes the need for data
averaging before any calibration can be performed, and offers many advantages
including: enabling the mitigation of faint radio frequency interference;
better removal of strong celestial sources from the data; and better detection
and spatial localization of fast radio transients.

Title: A complexity chasm for solving sparse polynomial equations over $p$-adic
  fields
Authors: J. Maurice Rojas and Yuyu Zhu
Categories: math.NT cs.CC cs.SC
\\
  We reveal a complexity chasm, separating the trinomial and tetranomial cases,
for solving univariate sparse polynomial equations over certain local fields.
First, for any fixed field
$K\in\{\mathbb{Q}_2,\mathbb{Q}_3,\mathbb{Q}_5,\ldots\}$, we prove that any
polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x_1]$ with exactly $3$ monomial terms, degree $d$,
and all coefficients having absolute value at most $H$, can be solved over $K$
in deterministic time $\log^{O(1)}(dH)$ in the classical Turing model. (The
best previous algorithms were of complexity exponential in $\log d$, even for
just counting roots in $\mathbb{Q}_p$.) In particular, our algorithm generates
approximations in $\mathbb{Q}$ with bit-length $\log^{O(1)}(dH)$ to all the
roots of $f$ in $K$, and these approximations converge quadratically under
Newton iteration. On the other hand, we give a unified family of {\em
tetra}nomials requiring $\Omega(d\log H)$ bits to distinguish the base-$b$
expansions of their roots in $K$.

\\
  Gradient-based inverse design in photonics has already achieved remarkable
results in designing small-footprint, high-performance optical devices. The
adjoint variable method, which allows for the efficient computation of
gradients, has played a major role in this success. However, gradient-based
optimization has not yet been applied to the mode-expansion methods that are
the most common approach to studying periodic optical structures like photonic
crystals. This is because, in such simulations, the adjoint variable method
cannot be defined as explicitly as in standard finite-difference or
finite-element time- or frequency-domain methods. Here, we overcome this
through the use of automatic differentiation, which is a generalization of the
adjoint variable method to arbitrary computational graphs. We implement the
plane-wave expansion and the guided-mode expansion methods using an automatic
differentiation library, and show that the gradient of any simulation output
can be computed efficiently and in parallel with respect to all input
parameters. We then use this implementation to optimize the dispersion of a
photonic crystal waveguide, and the quality factor of an ultra-small cavity in
a lithium niobate slab. This extends photonic inverse design to a whole new
class of simulations, and more broadly highlights the importance that automatic
differentiation could play in the future for tracking and optimizing
complicated physical models.

Title: Online Binary Space Partitioning Forests
Authors: Xuhui Fan, Bin Li, Scott A. Sisson
Categories: stat.ML cs.CG cs.DS cs.LG
\\
  The Binary Space Partitioning-Tree~(BSP-Tree) process was recently proposed
as an efficient strategy for space partitioning tasks. Because it uses more
than one dimension to partition the space, the BSP-Tree Process is more
efficient and flexible than conventional axis-aligned cutting strategies.
However, due to its batch learning setting, it is not well suited to
large-scale classification and regression problems. In this paper, we develop
an online BSP-Forest framework to address this limitation. With the arrival of
new data, the resulting online algorithm can simultaneously expand the space
coverage and refine the partition structure, with guaranteed universal
consistency for both classification and regression problems. The effectiveness
and competitive performance of the online BSP-Forest is verified via
simulations on real-world datasets.

in~$S$ if all points from $H$ lie on the boundary of the convex hull
$\mathrm{conv}(H)$ of $H$ and the interior of $\mathrm{conv}(H)$ does not
contain any point from $S$. A set $I$ of $k$ points from $S$ is a
\emph{$k$-island} in $S$ if $\mathrm{conv} (I) \cap S = I$. Note that each
$k$-hole in $S$ is a $k$-island in $S$.
  For fixed positive integers $d$, $k$ and a convex body $K$ in~$\mathbb{R}^d$
with $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure $1$, let $S$ be a set of $n$ points
chosen uniformly and independently at random from~$K$. We show that the

\\
  The potential of speech as a non-invasive biomarker to assess a speaker's
health has been repeatedly supported by the results of multiple works, for both
physical and psychological conditions. Traditional systems for speech-based
disease classification have focused on carefully designed knowledge-based
features. However, these features may not represent the disease's full
symptomatology, and may even overlook its more subtle manifestations. This has
prompted researchers to move in the direction of general speaker
representations that inherently model symptoms, such as Gaussian Supervectors,
i-vectors and, x-vectors. In this work, we focus on the latter, to assess their
applicability as a general feature extraction method to the detection of
Parkinson's disease (PD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We test our
approach against knowledge-based features and i-vectors, and report results for
two European Portuguese corpora, for OSA and PD, as well as for an additional
Spanish corpus for PD. Both x-vector and i-vector models were trained with an
out-of-domain European Portuguese corpus. Our results show that x-vectors are
able to perform better than knowledge-based features in same-language corpora.
Moreover, while x-vectors performed similarly to i-vectors in matched
conditions, they significantly outperform them when domain-mismatch occurs.

Title: Optimal Feature Manipulation Attacks Against Linear Regression
Authors: Fuwei Li, Lifeng Lai, and Shuguang Cui
Categories: eess.SP cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  In this paper, we investigate how to manipulate the coefficients obtained via
linear regression by adding carefully designed poisoning data points to the
dataset or modify the original data points. Given the energy budget, we first
provide the closed-form solution of the optimal poisoning data point when our
target is modifying one designated regression coefficient. We then extend the
analysis to the more challenging scenario where the attacker aims to change one
particular regression coefficient while making others to be changed as small as
possible. For this scenario, we introduce a semidefinite relaxation method to
design the best attack scheme. Finally, we study a more powerful adversary who
can perform a rank-one modification on the feature matrix. We propose an
alternating optimization method to find the optimal rank-one modification
matrix. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the analytical results
obtained in this paper.

Title: Counting superspecial Richelot isogenies and its cryptographic
  application
Authors: Toshiyuki Katsura and Katsuyuki Takashima
Categories: math.AG cs.CR
Comments: 17 pages
\\
  We give a characterization of decomposed Richelot isogenies in terms of
involutive reduced automorphisms of genus-2 curves over a finite field, and
explicitly count such decomposed (and non-decomposed) superspecial Richelot
isogenies. The characterization implies that the decomposed principally
polarized superspecial abelian surfaces are adjacent to 1-small curves in the
superspecial Richelot isogeny graph, where the smallness is defined as in a
similar manner to Love--Boneh's one. We then obtain an improved isogeny
path-finding algorithm in genus 2 as an application by using $M$-small genus-2
curves for some threshold $M$.

Title: SeismiQB -- a novel framework for deep learning with seismic data
Authors: Alexander Koryagin, Roman Khudorozhkov, Sergey Tsimfer, Darima
  Mylzenova
Categories: physics.geo-ph cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  In recent years, Deep Neural Networks were successfully adopted in numerous
domains to solve various image-related tasks, ranging from simple
classification to fine borders annotation. Naturally, many researches proposed
to use it to solve geological problems. Unfortunately, many of the seismic
processing tools were developed years before the era of machine learning,
including the most popular SEG-Y data format for storing seismic cubes. Its
slow loading speed heavily hampers experimentation speed, which is essential
for getting acceptable results. Worse yet, there is no widely-used format for
storing surfaces inside the volume (for example, seismic horizons). To address
these problems, we've developed an open-sourced Python framework with emphasis
on working with neural networks, that provides convenient tools for (i) fast
loading seismic cubes in multiple data formats and converting between them,
(ii) generating crops of desired shape and augmenting them with various
transformations, and (iii) pairing cube data with labeled horizons or other
types of geobodies.

Title: Why is the Mahalanobis Distance Effective for Anomaly Detection?
Authors: Ryo Kamoi, Kei Kobayashi
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  The Mahalanobis distance-based confidence score, a recently proposed anomaly
detection method for pre-trained neural classifiers, achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both out-of-distribution and adversarial example detection. This
work analyzes why this method exhibits such strong performance while imposing
an implausible assumption; namely, that class conditional distributions of
intermediate features have tied covariance. We reveal that the reason for its
effectiveness has been misunderstood. Although this method scores the
prediction confidence for the original classification task, our analysis
suggests that information critical for classification task does not contribute
to state-of-the-art performance on anomaly detection. To support this
hypothesis, we demonstrate that a simpler confidence score that does not use
class information is as effective as the original method in most cases.
Moreover, our experiments show that the confidence scores can exhibit different
behavior on other frameworks such as metric learning models, and their
detection performance is sensitive to model architecture choice. These findings
provide insight into the behavior of neural classifiers when provided with
anomalous inputs.

Title: Dimensionality reduction to maximize prediction generalization
  capability
Authors: Takuya Isomura, Taro Toyoizumi
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  This work develops an analytically solvable unsupervised learning scheme that
extracts the most informative components for predicting future inputs, termed
predictive principal component analysis (PredPCA). Our scheme can effectively
remove unpredictable observation noise and globally minimize the test
prediction error. Mathematical analyses demonstrate that, with sufficiently
high-dimensional observations that are generated by a linear or nonlinear
system, PredPCA can identify the optimal hidden state representation, true
system parameters, and true hidden state dimensionality, with a global
convergence guarantee. We demonstrate the performance of PredPCA by using
sequential visual inputs comprising hand-digits, rotating 3D objects, and
natural scenes. It reliably and accurately estimates distinct hidden states and
predicts future outcomes of previously unseen test input data, even in the
presence of considerable observation noise. The simple model structure and low
computational cost of PredPCA make it highly desirable as a learning scheme for
biological neural networks and neuromorphic chips.

Title: PSF--NET: A Non-parametric Point Spread Function Model for Ground Based
  Optical Telescopes

  DOI:10.12149/101014
\\
  Ground based optical telescopes are seriously affected by atmospheric
turbulence induced aberrations. Understanding properties of these aberrations
is important both for instruments design and image restoration methods
development. Because the point spread function can reflect performance of the
whole optic system, it is appropriate to use the point spread function to
describe atmospheric turbulence induced aberrations. Assuming point spread
functions induced by the atmospheric turbulence with the same profile belong to
the same manifold space, we propose a non-parametric point spread function --
PSF-NET. The PSF-NET has a cycle convolutional neural network structure and is
a statistical representation of the manifold space of PSFs induced by the
atmospheric turbulence with the same profile. Testing the PSF-NET with
simulated and real observation data, we find that a well trained PSF--NET can
restore any short exposure images blurred by atmospheric turbulence with the
same profile. Besides, we further use the impulse response of the PSF-NET,
which can be viewed as the statistical mean PSF, to analyze interpretation
properties of the PSF-NET. We find that variations of statistical mean PSFs are
caused by variations of the atmospheric turbulence profile: as the difference
of the atmospheric turbulence profile increases, the difference between
statistical mean PSFs also increases. The PSF-NET proposed in this paper
provides a new way to analyze atmospheric turbulence induced aberrations, which
would be benefit to develop new observation methods for ground based optical
telescopes.

Title: Convolutional Sparse Support Estimator Network (CSEN) From energy
  efficient support estimation to learning-aided Compressive Sensing
Authors: Mehmet Yamac, Mete Ahishali, Serkan Kiranyaz, Moncef Gabbouj
Categories: eess.SP cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Support estimation (SE) of a sparse signal refers to finding the location
indices of the non-zero elements in a sparse representation. Most of the
traditional approaches dealing with SE problem are iterative algorithms based
on greedy methods or optimization techniques. Indeed, a vast majority of them
use sparse signal recovery techniques to obtain support sets instead of
directly mapping the non-zero locations from denser measurements (e.g.,
Compressively Sensed Measurements). This study proposes a novel approach for
learning such a mapping from a training set. To accomplish this objective, the
Convolutional Support Estimator Networks (CSENs), each with a compact
configuration, are designed. The proposed CSEN can be a crucial tool for the
following scenarios: (i) Real-time and low-cost support estimation can be
applied in any mobile and low-power edge device for anomaly localization,
simultaneous face recognition, etc. (ii) CSEN's output can directly be used as
"prior information" which improves the performance of sparse signal recovery
algorithms. The results over the benchmark datasets show that state-of-the-art
performance levels can be achieved by the proposed approach with a
significantly reduced computational complexity.

Title: Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Blind Hyperspectral
  Unmixing incorporating Endmember Independence

\\
  Hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis has become a key area in the field of
remote sensing as a result of its ability to exploit richer information in the
form of multiple spectral bands. The study of hyperspectral unmixing (HU) is
important in HSI analysis due to the insufficient spatial resolution of
customary imaging spectrometers. The endmembers of an HSI are more likely to be
generated by independent sources and be mixed in a macroscopic degree before
arriving at the sensor element of the imaging spectrometer as mixed spectra.
Over the past few decades, many attempts have focused on imposing auxiliary
constraints on the conventional nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)
framework in order to effectively unmix these mixed spectra. Signifying a step
forward toward finding an optimum constraint to extract endmembers, this paper
presents a novel blind HU algorithm, referred to as Kurtosis-based Smooth
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (KbSNMF) which incorporates a novel
constraint-based on the statistical independence of the probability density
functions of endmembers. Imposing this constraint on the conventional NMF
framework promotes the extraction of independent endmembers while further
enhancing the parts-based representation of data. The proposed algorithm
manages to outperform several state of the art NMF-based algorithms in terms of
extracting endmembers from hyperspectral remote sensing data, hence could
uplift the performance of recent deep learning HU methods which utilizes the
endmembers as supervisory data for abundance extraction. Keywords:
Hyperspectral unmixing (HU), blind source separation, kurtosis, constrained,
Gaussianity, endmember independence, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF).

  In this paper we present a novel simulation technique for generating high
quality images of any predefined resolution. This method can be used to
synthesize sonar scans of size equivalent to those collected during a
full-length mission, with across track resolutions of any chosen magnitude. In
essence, our model extends Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based
architecture into a conditional recursive setting, that facilitates the
continuity of the generated images. The data produced is continuous,
realistically-looking, and can also be generated at least two times faster than
the real speed of acquisition for the sonars with higher resolutions, such as
EdgeTech. The seabed topography can be fully controlled by the user. The visual
assessment tests demonstrate that humans cannot distinguish the simulated
images from real. Moreover, experimental results suggest that in the absence of
real data the autonomous recognition systems can benefit greatly from training
with the synthetic data, produced by the R2D2-GANs.

Title: How to choose the most appropriate centrality measure?

\\
  We propose a new method to select the most appropriate network centrality
measure based on the user's opinion on how such a measure should work on a set
of simple graphs. The method consists in: (1) forming a set $\cal F$ of
candidate measures; (2) generating a sequence of sufficiently simple graphs
that distinguish all measures in $\cal F$ on some pairs of nodes; (3) compiling
a survey with questions on comparing the centrality of test nodes; (4)
completing this survey, which provides a centrality measure consistent with all
user responses. The developed algorithms make it possible to implement this
approach for any finite set $\cal F$ of measures. This paper presents its
realization for a set of 40 centrality measures. The proposed method, called
culling, can be used for rapid analysis or combined with a normative approach
by compiling a survey on the subset of measures that satisfy certain normative
conditions (axioms). In the present study, the latter was done for the subsets
determined by the Self-consistency or Bridge axioms.

\\
  Autonomous Maxwellian demons exploit structured environments as a resource to
generate work: They randomize ordered inputs and leverage the increased Shannon
entropy to transfer energy from a thermal reservoir to a work reservoir,
respecting both Liouvillian state-space dynamics and the Second Law. To date,
correctly determining such functional thermodynamic operating regimes was
restricted to information engines for which correlations among
information-bearing degrees of freedom can be calculated exactly via compact
analytical forms---a highly restricted set of engines. Despite
information-engine controllers being represented as finite hidden Markov chains
and rate matrices, the restriction arose since the processes generated are
notoriously complicated, defying closed-form analysis. Even when finite state
(i) no finite expression for their Shannon entropy rate exists, (ii) the set of
their predictive features is generically uncountably infinite, and (iii) their
effective memory---the statistical complexity---diverges. When attempting to
circumvent these challenges, previous analyses of thermodynamic function either
heavily constrained controller structure, invoked approximations that
misclassified thermodynamic functioning, or simply failed. Here, we adapt
recent results from dynamical-system and ergodic theories that efficiently and
accurately calculate the entropy rates and the rate of statistical complexity
divergence of general hidden Markov processes. Applied to information ratchets,
the results precisely determine the thermodynamic functionality for
previously-studied Maxwellian Demons and open up analysis to a substantially
broader class of information engines.

  We investigate the problem of jointly testing two hypotheses and estimating a
random parameter based on data that is observed sequentially by sensors in a
distributed network. In particular, we assume the data to be drawn from a
Gaussian distribution, whose random mean is to be estimated. Forgoing the need
for a fusion center, the processing is performed locally and the sensors
interact with their neighbors following the consensus+innovations approach. We
design the test at the individual sensors such that the performance measures,
namely, error probabilities and mean-squared error, do not exceed pre-defined
levels while the average sample number is minimized. After converting the
constrained problem to an unconstrained problem and the subsequent reduction to
an optimal stopping problem, we solve the latter utilizing dynamic programming.
The solution is shown to be characterized by a set of non-linear Bellman
equations, parametrized by cost coefficients, which are then determined by
linear programming as to fulfill the performance specifications. A numerical
example validates the proposed theory.

\\
  Lung Disease can be considered as the second most common type of disease for
men and women. Many people die of lung disease such as lung cancer, Asthma, CPD
(Chronic pulmonary disease) etc. in every year. Early detection of lung cancer
can lessen the probability of deaths. In this paper, a chest X ray image
dataset has been used in order to diagnosis properly and analysis the lung
disease. For binary classification, some important is selected. The criteria
include precision, recall, F beta score and accuracy. The fusion of AI and
cancer diagnosis are acquiring huge interest as a cancer diagnostic tool. In
recent days, deep learning based AI for example Convolutional neural network
(CNN) can be successfully applied for disease classification and prediction.
This paper mainly focuses the performance of Vanilla neural network, CNN,
fusion of CNN and Visual Geometry group based neural network (VGG), fusion of
CNN, VGG, STN and finally Capsule network. Normally basic CNN has poor
performance for rotated, tilted or other abnormal image orientation. As a
result, hybrid systems have been exhibited in order to enhance the accuracy
with the maintenance of less training time. All models have been implemented in
two groups of data sets: full dataset and sample dataset. Therefore, a
comparative analysis has been developed in this paper. Some visualization of
the attributes of the dataset has also been showed in this paper

  Despite fluorescent cell-labelling being widely employed in biomedical
studies, some of its drawbacks are inevitable, with unsuitable fluorescent
probes or probes inducing a functional change being the main limitations.
Consequently, the demand for and development of label-free methodologies to
classify cells is strong and its impact on precision medicine is relevant.
Towards this end, high-throughput techniques for cell mechanical phenotyping
have been proposed to get a multidimensional biophysical characterization of
single cells. With this motivation, our goal here is to investigate the extent
to which an unsupervised machine learning methodology, which is applied
exclusively on morpho-rheological markers obtained by real-time deformability
and fluorescence cytometry (RT-FDC), can address the difficult task of
providing label-free discrimination of reticulocytes from mature red blood
cells. We focused on this problem, since the characterization of reticulocytes
(their percentage and cellular features) in the blood is vital in multiple
human disease conditions, especially bone-marrow disorders such as anemia and
leukemia. Our approach reports promising label-free results in the
classification of reticulocytes from mature red blood cells, and it represents
a step forward in the development of high-throughput morpho-rheological-based
methodologies for the computational categorization of single cells. Besides,
our methodology can be an alternative but also a complementary method to
integrate with existing cell-labelling techniques.

\\
  In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for analyzing and predicting
the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Our model is a time-dependent
susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that tracks two time series: (i) the
transmission rate at time $t$ and (ii) the recovering rate at time $t$. Our
time-dependent SIR method is better than the traditional static SIR model as it
can adapt to the change of contagious disease control policies such as city
lockdowns. Moreover, it is also more robust than the direct estimation of the
number of confirmed cases, as a sudden change of the definition of the number
of confirmed cases might result in a spike of the number of new cases. Using
the data set provided by the National Health Commission of the People's
Republic of China (NHC) [2], we show that the one-day prediction errors for the
numbers of confirmed cases are less than $3\%$ except the day when the
definition of the number of confirmed cases is changed. Also, the turning
point, defined as the day that the transmission rate is less than the
recovering rate, is predicted to be Feb. 17, 2020. After that day, the basic
reproduction number, known as the $R_0(t)$ value, is less than $1$ if the
current contagious disease control policies are maintained in China. In that
case, the total number of confirmed cases is predicted to be less than $80,000$
cases in China under our deterministic model.

Title: Tightly Robust Optimization via Empirical Domain Reduction
Authors: Akihiro Yabe and Takanori Maehara
Categories: math.OC cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Data-driven decision-making is performed by solving a parameterized
optimization problem, and the optimal decision is given by an optimal solution
for unknown true parameters. We often need a solution that satisfies true
constraints even though these are unknown. Robust optimization is employed to
obtain such a solution, where the uncertainty of the parameter is represented
by an ellipsoid, and the scale of robustness is controlled by a coefficient. In
this study, we propose an algorithm to determine the scale such that the
solution has a good objective value and satisfies the true constraints with a
given confidence probability. Under some regularity conditions, the scale
obtained by our algorithm is asymptotically $O(1/\sqrt{n})$, whereas the scale
obtained by a standard approach is $O(\sqrt{d/n})$. This means that our
algorithm is less affected by the dimensionality of the parameters.

Title: Quantum Computing Assisted Deep Learning for Fault Detection and
  Diagnosis in Industrial Process Systems
Authors: Akshay Ajagekar, Fengqi You
Categories: quant-ph cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Quantum computing (QC) and deep learning techniques have attracted widespread
attention in the recent years. This paper proposes QC-based deep learning
methods for fault diagnosis that exploit their unique capabilities to overcome
the computational challenges faced by conventional data-driven approaches
performed on classical computers. Deep belief networks are integrated into the
proposed fault diagnosis model and are used to extract features at different
levels for normal and faulty process operations. The QC-based fault diagnosis
model uses a quantum computing assisted generative training process followed by
discriminative training to address the shortcomings of classical algorithms. To
demonstrate its applicability and efficiency, the proposed fault diagnosis
method is applied to process monitoring of continuous stirred tank reactor
(CSTR) and Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. The proposed QC-based deep learning
approach enjoys superior fault detection and diagnosis performance with
obtained average fault detection rates of 79.2% and 99.39% for CSTR and TE
process, respectively.

Title: Dimension-free convergence rates for gradient Langevin dynamics in RKHS
Authors: Boris Muzellec, Kanji Sato, Mathurin Massias, Taiji Suzuki
Categories: math.PR cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Gradient Langevin dynamics (GLD) and stochastic GLD (SGLD) have attracted
considerable attention lately, as a way to provide convergence guarantees in a
non-convex setting. However, the known rates grow exponentially with the
dimension of the space. In this work, we provide a convergence analysis of GLD
and SGLD when the optimization space is an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.
More precisely, we derive non-asymptotic, dimension-free convergence rates for
GLD/SGLD when performing regularized non-convex optimization in a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space. Amongst others, the convergence analysis relies on the
properties of a stochastic differential equation, its discrete time Galerkin
approximation and the geometric ergodicity of the associated Markov chains.

Title: Differentiating through the Fr\'echet Mean
Authors: Aaron Lou, Isay Katsman, Qingxuan Jiang, Serge Belongie, Ser-Nam Lim,
  Christopher De Sa
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Recent advances in deep representation learning on Riemannian manifolds
extend classical deep learning operations to better capture the geometry of the
manifold. One possible extension is the Fr\'echet mean, the generalization of
the Euclidean mean; however, it has been difficult to apply because it lacks a
closed form with an easily computable derivative. In this paper, we show how to
differentiate through the Fr\'echet mean for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds.
Then, focusing on hyperbolic space, we derive explicit gradient expressions and
a fast, accurate, and hyperparameter-free Fr\'echet mean solver. This fully
integrates the Fr\'echet mean into the hyperbolic neural network pipeline. To
demonstrate this integration, we present two case studies. First, we apply our
Fr\'echet mean to the existing Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network,
replacing its projected aggregation to obtain state-of-the-art results on
datasets with high hyperbolicity. Second, to demonstrate the Fr\'echet mean's
capacity to generalize Euclidean neural network operations, we develop a
hyperbolic batch normalization method that gives an improvement parallel to the
one observed in the Euclidean setting.

\\
  Conventional survival analysis approaches estimate risk scores or
individualized time-to-event distributions conditioned on covariates. In
practice, there is often great population-level phenotypic heterogeneity,
resulting from (unknown) subpopulations with diverse risk profiles or survival
distributions. As a result, there is an unmet need in survival analysis for
identifying subpopulations with distinct risk profiles, while jointly
accounting for accurate individualized time-to-event predictions. An approach
that addresses this need is likely to improve characterization of individual
outcomes by leveraging regularities in subpopulations, thus accounting for
population-level heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian
nonparametrics approach that represents observations (subjects) in a clustered
latent space, and encourages accurate time-to-event predictions and clusters
(subpopulations) with distinct risk profiles. Experiments on real-world
datasets show consistent improvements in predictive performance and
interpretability relative to existing state-of-the-art survival analysis
models.

Title: Estimating Multiple Precision Matrices with Cluster Fusion
  Regularization
Authors: Bradley S. Price and Aaron J. Molstad and Ben Sherwood
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO stat.ME
\\
  We propose a penalized likelihood framework for estimating multiple precision
matrices from different classes. Most existing methods either incorporate no
information on relationships between the precision matrices, or require this
information be known a priori. The framework proposed in this article allows
for simultaneous estimation of the precision matrices and relationships between
the precision matrices, jointly. Sparse and non-sparse estimators are proposed,
both of which require solving a non-convex optimization problem. To compute our
proposed estimators, we use an iterative algorithm which alternates between a
convex optimization problem solved by blockwise coordinate descent and a
k-means clustering problem. Blockwise updates for computing the sparse
estimator require solving an elastic net penalized precision matrix estimation
problem, which we solve using a proximal gradient descent algorithm. We prove
that this subalgorithm has a linear rate of convergence. In simulation studies
and two real data applications, we show that our method can outperform
competitors that ignore relevant relationships between precision matrices and
performs similarly to methods which use prior information often uknown in
practice.

Title: Statistical power for cluster analysis

Comments: 32 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables; for code and data see:

\\
  Cluster algorithms are gaining in popularity due to their compelling ability
to identify discrete subgroups in data, and their increasing accessibility in
mainstream programming languages and statistical software. While researchers
can follow guidelines to choose the right algorithms, and to determine what
constitutes convincing clustering, there are no firmly established ways of
computing a priori statistical power for cluster analysis. Here, we take a
simulation approach to estimate power and classification accuracy for popular
analysis pipelines. We systematically varied cluster size, number of clusters,
number of different features between clusters, effect size within each
different feature, and cluster covariance structure in generated datasets. We
then subjected these datasets to common dimensionality reduction approaches
(none, multi-dimensional scaling, or uniform manifold approximation and
projection) and cluster algorithms (k-means, hierarchical agglomerative
clustering with Ward linkage and Euclidean distance, or average linkage and
cosine distance, HDBSCAN). Furthermore, we simulated additional datasets to
explore the effect of sample size and cluster separation on statistical power
and classification accuracy. We found that clustering outcomes were driven by
large effect sizes or the accumulation of many smaller effects across features,
and were mostly unaffected by differences in covariance structure. Sufficient
statistical power can be achieved with relatively small samples (N=20 per
subgroup), provided cluster separation is large ({\Delta}=4). Finally, we
discuss whether fuzzy clustering (c-means) could provide a more parsimonious
alternative for identifying separable multivariate normal distributions,
particularly those with lower centroid separation.

Title: Stable behaviour of infinitely wide deep neural networks
Authors: Stefano Favaro, Sandra Fortini, Stefano Peluchetti
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 25 pages, 3 figures
\\
  We consider fully connected feed-forward deep neural networks (NNs) where
weights and biases are independent and identically distributed as symmetric
centered stable distributions. Then, we show that the infinite wide limit of
the NN, under suitable scaling on the weights, is a stochastic process whose
finite-dimensional distributions are multivariate stable distributions. The
limiting process is referred to as the stable process, and it generalizes the
class of Gaussian processes recently obtained as infinite wide limits of NNs
(Matthews at al., 2018b). Parameters of the stable process can be computed via
an explicit recursion over the layers of the network. Our result contributes to
the theory of fully connected feed-forward deep NNs, and it paves the way to
expand recent lines of research that rely on Gaussian infinite wide limits.

Comments: Invited Paper, ASILOMAR 2019, TP4b: Machine Learning Advances in
  Computational Imaging
\\
  The diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with musculoskeletal
(MSK) disorders require radiology imaging (using computed tomography, magnetic
resonance imaging(MRI), and ultrasound) and their precise analysis by expert
radiologists. Radiology scans can also help assessment of metabolic health,
aging, and diabetes. This study presents how machinelearning, specifically deep
learning methods, can be used for rapidand accurate image analysis of MRI
scans, an unmet clinicalneed in MSK radiology. As a challenging example, we
focus on automatic analysis of knee images from MRI scans and study machine
learning classification of various abnormalities including meniscus and
anterior cruciate ligament tears. Using widely used convolutional neural
network (CNN) based architectures, we comparatively evaluated the knee
abnormality classification performances of different neural network
architectures under limited imaging data regime and compared single and
multi-view imaging when classifying the abnormalities. Promising results
indicated the potential use of multi-view deep learning based classification of
MSK abnormalities in routine clinical assessment.

Title: Online Hierarchical Forecasting for Power Consumption Data
Authors: Margaux Br\'eg\`ere and Malo Huard
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We study the forecasting of the power consumptions of a population of
households and of subpopulations thereof. These subpopulations are built
according to location, to exogenous information and/or to profiles we
determined from historical households consumption time series. Thus, we aim to
forecast the electricity consumption time series at several levels of
households aggregation. These time series are linked through some summation
constraints which induce a hierarchy. Our approach consists in three steps:
feature generation, aggregation and projection. Firstly (feature generation
step), we build, for each considering group for households, a benchmark
forecast (called features), using random forests or generalized additive
models. Secondly (aggregation step), aggregation algorithms, run in parallel,
aggregate these forecasts and provide new predictions. Finally (projection
step), we use the summation constraints induced by the time series underlying
hierarchy to re-conciliate the forecasts by projecting them in a well-chosen
linear subspace. We provide some theoretical guaranties on the average
prediction error of this methodology, through the minimization of a quantity
called regret. We also test our approach on households power consumption data
collected in Great Britain by multiple energy providers in the Energy Demand
Research Project context. We build and compare various population segmentations
for the evaluation of our approach performance.

Title: Approximate Cross-validation: Guarantees for Model Assessment and
  Selection
Authors: Ashia Wilson, Maximilian Kasy, Lester Mackey
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Cross-validation (CV) is a popular approach for assessing and selecting
predictive models. However, when the number of folds is large, CV suffers from
a need to repeatedly refit a learning procedure on a large number of training
datasets. Recent work in empirical risk minimization (ERM) approximates the
expensive refitting with a single Newton step warm-started from the full
training set optimizer. While this can greatly reduce runtime, several open
questions remain including whether these approximations lead to faithful model
selection and whether they are suitable for non-smooth objectives. We address
these questions with three main contributions: (i) we provide uniform
non-asymptotic, deterministic model assessment guarantees for approximate CV;
(ii) we show that (roughly) the same conditions also guarantee model selection
performance comparable to CV; (iii) we provide a proximal Newton extension of
the approximate CV framework for non-smooth prediction problems and develop
improved assessment guarantees for problems such as l1-regularized ERM.

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.DS math.OA
\\
  Kernel methods have been among the most popular techniques in machine
learning, where learning tasks are solved using the property of reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In this paper, we propose a novel data analysis
framework with reproducing kernel Hilbert $C^*$-module (RKHM), which is another
generalization of RKHS than vector-valued RKHS (vv-RKHS). Analysis with RKHMs
enables us to deal with structures among variables more explicitly than
vv-RKHS. We show the theoretical validity for the construction of orthonormal
systems in Hilbert $C^*$-modules, and derive concrete procedures for
orthonormalization in RKHMs with those theoretical properties in numerical
computations. Moreover, we apply those to generalize with RKHM kernel principal
component analysis and the analysis of dynamical systems with Perron-Frobenius
operators. The empirical performance of our methods is also investigated by
using synthetic and real-world data.

Title: Analysis of Gait-Event-related Brain Potentials During Instructed And
  Spontaneous Treadmill Walking -- Technical Affordances and used Methods
Authors: Cornelia Herbert, Jan Nachtsheim, Michael Munz
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.LG
\\
  To improve the understanding of human gait and to facilitate novel
developments in gait rehabilitation, the neural correlates of human gait as
measured by means of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) have been
investigated recently. Particularly, gait-related event-related brain
potentials (gERPs) may provide information about the functional role of
cortical brain regions in human gait control. The purpose of this paper is to
explore possible experimental and technical solutions for time-sensitive
analysis of human gait-related ERPs during spontaneous and instructed treadmill
walking. A solution (HW/SW) for synchronous recording of gait- and EEG data was
developed, tested and piloted. The solution consists of a custom-made USB
synchronization interface, a time-synchronization module and a data merging
module, allowing temporal synchronization of recording devices for
time-sensitive extraction of gait markers for analysis of gait-related ERPs and
for the training of artificial neural networks. In the present manuscript, the
hardware and software components were tested with the following devices: A
treadmill with an integrated pressure plate for gait analysis (zebris FDM-T)
and an Acticap non-wireless 32-channel EEG-system (Brain Products GmbH). The
usability and validity of the developed solution was tested in a pilot study (n
= 3 healthy participants, n=3 females, mean age = 22.75 years). Recorded EEG
data was segmented and analyzed according to the detected gait markers for the
analysis of gait-related ERPs. Finally, EEG periods were used to train a deep
learning artificial neural network as classifier of gait phases. The results
obtained in this pilot study, although preliminary, support the feasibility of
the solution for the application of gait-related EEG analysis..

  The cryptocurrency market is amongst the fastest-growing of all the financial
markets in the world. Unlike traditional markets, such as equities, foreign
exchange and commodities, cryptocurrency market is considered to have larger
volatility and illiquidity. This paper is inspired by the recent success of
using deep learning for stock market prediction. In this work, we analyze and
present the characteristics of the cryptocurrency market in a high-frequency
setting. In particular, we applied a deep learning approach to predict the
direction of the mid-price changes on the upcoming tick. We monitored live
tick-level data from $8$ cryptocurrency pairs and applied both statistical and
machine learning techniques to provide a live prediction. We reveal that
promising results are possible for cryptocurrencies, and in particular, we
achieve a consistent $78\%$ accuracy on the prediction of the mid-price
movement on live exchange rate of Bitcoins vs US dollars.

Comments: 14 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Molecular dynamics simulations use statistical mechanics at the atomistic
scale to enable both the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms and the
engineering of matter for desired tasks. The behavior of molecular systems at
the microscale is typically simulated with differential equations parameterized
by a Hamiltonian, or energy function. The Hamiltonian describes the state of
the system and its interactions with the environment. In order to derive
predictive microscopic models, one wishes to infer a molecular Hamiltonian that
agrees with observed macroscopic quantities. From the perspective of
engineering, one wishes to control the Hamiltonian to achieve desired
simulation outcomes and structures, as in self-assembly and optical control, to
then realize systems with the desired Hamiltonian in the lab. In both cases,
the goal is to modify the Hamiltonian such that emergent properties of the
simulated system match a given target. We demonstrate how this can be achieved
using differentiable simulations where bulk target observables and simulation
outcomes can be analytically differentiated with respect to Hamiltonians,
opening up new routes for parameterizing Hamiltonians to infer macroscopic
models and develop control protocols.

\\
  The $k$ nearest neighbour learning rule (under the uniform distance tie
breaking) is universally consistent in every metric space $X$ that is
sigma-finite dimensional in the sense of Nagata. This was pointed out by
C\'erou and Guyader (2006) as a consequence of the main result by those
authors, combined with a theorem in real analysis sketched by D. Preiss (1971)
(and elaborated in detail by Assouad and Quentin de Gromard (2006)). We show
that it is possible to give a direct proof along the same lines as the original
theorem of Charles J. Stone (1977) about the universal consistency of the
$k$-NN classifier in the finite dimensional Euclidean space. The generalization
is non-trivial because of the distance ties being more prevalent in the
non-euclidean setting, and on the way we investigate the relevant geometric
properties of the metrics and the limitations of the Stone argument, by
constructing various examples.

Categories: stat.ME cs.LG

  We propose a matching method that recovers direct treatment effects from
randomized experiments where units are connected in an observed network, and
units that share edges can potentially influence each others' outcomes.
Traditional treatment effect estimators for randomized experiments are biased
and error prone in this setting. Our method matches units almost exactly on
counts of unique subgraphs within their neighborhood graphs. The matches that
we construct are interpretable and high-quality. Our method can be extended
easily to accommodate additional unit-level covariate information. We show
empirically that our method performs better than other existing methodologies
for this problem, while producing meaningful, interpretable results.

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We introduce a novel regularization approach for deep learning that
incorporates and respects the underlying graphical structure of the neural
network. Existing regularization methods often focus on dropping/penalizing
weights in a global manner that ignores the connectivity structure of the
neural network. We propose to use the Fiedler value of the neural network's
underlying graph as a tool for regularization. We provide theoretical support
for this approach via spectral graph theory. We demonstrate the convexity of
this penalty and provide an approximate, variational approach for fast
computation in practical training of neural networks. We provide bounds on such
approximations. We provide an alternative but equivalent formulation of this
framework in the form of a structurally weighted L1 penalty, thus linking our
approach to sparsity induction. We performed experiments on datasets that
compare Fiedler regularization with traditional regularization methods such as
dropout and weight decay. Results demonstrate the efficacy of Fiedler
regularization.

Title: Semiparametric Nonlinear Bipartite Graph Representation Learning with
  Provable Guarantees
Authors: Sen Na, Yuwei Luo, Zhuoran Yang, Zhaoran Wang, Mladen Kolar
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Graph representation learning is a ubiquitous task in machine learning where
the goal is to embed each vertex into a low-dimensional vector space. We
consider the bipartite graph and formalize its representation learning problem
as a statistical estimation problem of parameters in a semiparametric
exponential family distribution. The bipartite graph is assumed to be generated
by a semiparametric exponential family distribution, whose parametric component
is given by the proximity of outputs of two one-layer neural networks, while
nonparametric (nuisance) component is the base measure. Neural networks take
high-dimensional features as inputs and output embedding vectors. In this
setting, the representation learning problem is equivalent to recovering the
weight matrices. The main challenges of estimation arise from the nonlinearity
of activation functions and the nonparametric nuisance component of the
distribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a pseudo-likelihood
objective based on the rank-order decomposition technique and focus on its
local geometry. We show that the proposed objective is strongly convex in a
neighborhood around the ground truth, so that a gradient descent-based method
achieves linear convergence rate. Moreover, we prove that the sample complexity
of the problem is linear in dimensions (up to logarithmic factors), which is
consistent with parametric Gaussian models. However, our estimator is robust to
any model misspecification within the exponential family, which is validated in
extensive experiments.

Title: Week Texture Information Map Guided Image Super-resolution with Deep
  Residual Networks
Authors: Bo Fu, Liyan Wang, Yuechu Wu, Yufeng Wu, Shilin Fu, Yonggong Ren
Categories: eess.IV cs.MM
\\
  Single image super-resolution (SISR) is an image processing task which
obtains high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) image. Recently,
due to the capability in feature extraction, a series of deep learning methods
have brought important crucial improvement for SISR. However, we observe that
no matter how deeper the networks are designed, they usually do not have good
generalization ability, which leads to the fact that almost all of existing SR
methods have poor performances on restoration of the week texture details. To
solve these problems, we propose a week texture information map guided image
super-resolution with deep residual networks. It contains three sub-networks,
one main network which extracts the main features and fuses week texture
details, another two auxiliary networks extract the week texture details fallen
in the main network. Two part of networks work cooperatively, the auxiliary
networks predict and integrates week texture information into the main network,
which is conducive to the main network learning more inconspicuous details.
Experiments results demonstrate that our method's performs achieve the
state-of-the-art quantitatively. Specifically, the image super-resolution
results of our method own more week texture details.

  In this paper we develop an adaptive transform-domain technique based on
rational function systems. It is of general importance in several areas of
signal theory, including filter design, transfer function approximation, system
identification, control theory etc. The construction of the proposed method is
discussed in the framework of a general mathematical model called variable
projection. First we generalize this method by adding dimension type free
parameters. Then we deal with the optimization problem of the free parameters.
To this order, based on the well-known particle swarm optimization (PSO)
algorithm, we develop the multi-dimensional hyperbolic PSO algorithm. It is
designed especially for the rational transforms in question. As a result, the
system along with its dimension is dynamically optimized during the process.
The main motivation was to increase the adaptivity while keeping the
computational complexity manageable. We note that the proposed method is of
general nature. As a case study the problem of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal
compression is discussed. By means of comparison tests performed on the
PhysioNet MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database we demonstrate that our method
outperforms other transformation techniques.

Title: OpEn: Code Generation for Embedded Nonconvex Optimization
Authors: Pantelis Sopasakis, Emil Fresk and Panagiotis Patrinos
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
Comments: IFAC World Congress 2020, Berlin
\\
  We present Optimization Engine (OpEn): an open-source code generation tool
for real-time embedded nonconvex optimization, which implements a novel
numerical method. OpEn combines the proximal averaged Newton-type method for
optimal control (PANOC) with the penalty and augmented Lagrangian methods to
compute approximate stationary points of nonconvex problems. The proposed
method involves very simple algebraic operations such as vector products, has a
low memory footprint and exhibits very good convergence properties that allow
the solution of nonconvex problems on embedded devices. OpEn's core solver is
written is Rust - a modern, high-performance, memory-safe and thread-safe
systems programming language - while users can call it from Python, MATLAB, C,
C++ or over a TCP socket.

Title: Multirate Timestepping for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in
  Overlapping Grids
Authors: Ketan Mittal, Som Dutta, Paul Fischer
Categories: physics.flu-dyn cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 40 pages, 13 figures
\\
  We develop a multirate timestepper for semi-implicit solutions of the
unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE) based on a
recently-developed multidomain spectral element method (SEM). For {\em
incompressible} flows, multirate timestepping (MTS) is particularly challenging
because of the tight coupling implied by the incompressibility constraint,
which manifests as an elliptic subproblem for the pressure at each timestep.
The novelty of our approach stems from the development of a stable overlapping
Schwarz method applied directly to the Navier-Stokes equations, rather than to
the convective, viscous, and pressure substeps that are at the heart of most
INSE solvers. Our MTS approach is based on a predictor-corrector (PC) strategy
that preserves the temporal convergence of the underlying semi-implicit
timestepper. We present numerical results demonstrating that this approach
scales to an arbitrary number of overlapping grids, accurately models complex
turbulent flow phenomenon, and improves computational efficiency in comparison
to singlerate timestepping-based calculations.

Title: A Stochastic Covariance Shrinkage Approach in Ensemble Transform Kalman
  Filtering
Authors: Andrey A. Popov, Adrian Sandu, Elias D. Nino-Ruiz, Geir Evensen
Categories: stat.ME cs.NA math.NA
Report-no: CSL-TR-20-3
\\
  Operational Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) methods rely on model-specific
heuristics such as localization, which are typically implemented based on the
spacial locality of the model variables. We instead propose methods that more
closely depend on the dynamics of the model, by looking at locally
averaged-in-time behavior. Such behavior is typically described in terms of a
climatological covariance of the dynamical system. We will be utilizing this
covariance as the target matrix in covariance shrinkage methods, from which we
will be drawing a synthetic ensemble in order to enrich both the ensemble
transformation and the subspace of the ensemble.

\\
  Recently, so-called full-history recursive multilevel Picard (MLP)
approximation schemes have been introduced and shown to overcome the curse of
dimensionality in the numerical approximation of semilinear parabolic partial
differential equations (PDEs) with Lipschitz nonlinearities. The key
contribution of this article is to introduce and analyze a new variant of MLP
approximation schemes for certain semilinear elliptic PDEs with Lipschitz
nonlinearities and to prove that the proposed approximation schemes overcome
the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of such semilinear
elliptic PDEs.

Title: Regularized Potentials of Schr\"odinger Operators and a Local Landscape
  Function
Authors: Stefan Steinerberger
Categories: math.AP cs.NA math.NA
\\
  We study localization properties of low-lying eigenfunctions $$(-\Delta +V)
\phi = \lambda \phi \qquad \mbox{in}~\Omega$$ for rapidly varying potentials
$V$ in bounded domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Filoche & Mayboroda
introduced the landscape function $(-\Delta + V)u=1$ and showed that the
function $u$ has remarkable properties: localized eigenfunctions prefer to
localize in the local maxima of $u$. Arnold, David, Filoche, Jerison \&
Mayboroda showed that $1/u$ arises naturally as the potential in a related
equation. Motivated by these questions, we introduce a one-parameter family of
regularized potentials $V_t$ that arise from convolving $V$ with the radial
kernel $$ V_t(x) = V * \left( \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t \frac{ \exp\left( -
\|\cdot\|^2/ (4s) \right)}{(4 \pi s )^{d/2}} ds \right).$$ We prove that for
eigenfunctions $(-\Delta +V) \phi = \lambda \phi$ this regularization $V_t$ is,
in a precise sense, the canonical effective potential on small scales. The
landscape function $u$ respects the same type of regularization. This allows
allows us to derive landscape-type functions out of solutions of the equation
$(-\Delta + V)u = f$ for a general right-hand side $f:\Omega \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}_{>0}$.

Title: Effective Localization Using Double Ideal Quotient and Its

  In this paper, we propose a new method for localization of polynomial ideal,
which we call "Local Primary Algorithm". For an ideal $I$ and a prime ideal
$P$, our method computes a $P$-primary component of $I$ after checking if $P$
is associated with $I$ by using "double ideal quotient" $(I:(I:P))$ and its
variants which give us a lot of information about localization of $I$.

Title: Modular Techniques for Effective Localization and Double Ideal Quotient
Authors: Yuki Ishihara
Categories: math.AC cs.SC
\\
  By double ideal quotient, we mean $(I:(I:J))$ where ideals $I$ and $J$. In
our previous work [11], double ideal quotient and its variants are shown to be
very useful for checking prime divisor and generating primary component.
Combining those properties, we can compute "direct localization" effectively,
comparing with full primary decomposition. In this paper, we apply modular
techniques effectively to computation of such double ideal quotient and its
variants, where first we compute them modulo several prime numbers and then
lift them up over rational numbers by Chinese Remainder Theorem and rational
reconstruction. As a new modular technique for double ideal quotient and its
variants, we devise criteria for output from modular computations. Also, we
apply modular techniques to intermediate primary decomposition. We examine the
effectiveness of our modular techniques for several examples by preliminary
computational experiences on Singular.

Title: Expression Recognition in the Wild Using Sequence Modeling

Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2002.12766
\\
  As we exceed upon the procedures for modelling the different aspects of
behaviour, expression recognition has become a key field of research in Human
Computer Interactions. Expression recognition in the wild is a very interesting
problem and is challenging as it involves detailed feature extraction and heavy
computation. This paper presents the methodologies and techniques used in our
contribution to recognize different expressions i.e., neutral, anger, disgust,
fear, happiness, sadness, surprise in ABAW competition on Aff-Wild2 database.
Aff-Wild2 database consists of videos in the wild labelled for seven different
expressions at frame level. We used a bi-modal approach by fusing audio and
visual features and train a sequence-to-sequence model that is based on Gated
Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. We show
experimental results on validation data. The overall accuracy of the proposed
approach is 41.5 \%, which is better than the competition baseline of 37\%.

Title: Uniform Array with Broadband Beamforming for Arbitrary Beam Patterns
Authors: Phan Le Son
Categories: eess.SP cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  Broadband beamforming is a technique to obtain the signal with a wide range
of frequencies. It maintains the signal integrity and spatial selectivity over
frequencies. This is important in several applications such as microphone
array, sonar array or radar where the operation range of the signal is several
octaves. Using uniform array for broadband beamforming is the old topic but
there is no available design method for the arbitrary beam patterns, except the
optimization methods. In this paper, we present a new method based on geometry
translation and coordinate transformation to design broadband beamformer for
arbitrary beam patterns. The new method uses less computation time than the
optimization methods and it could help to find a better configuration of the
array such as fewer sensors, smaller size.

Title: Assessing Energy Storage Requirements Based on Accepted Risks
Authors: Michael P. Evans and Simon H. Tindemans
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  This paper presents a framework to derive the storage capacity an electricity
system requires in order to satisfy a chosen risk appetite. The framework takes
as inputs event categories defined in terms of peak power-not-supplied and
accepted risk of failure to deliver, and returns as an output the total
capacity of storage that is needed. For increased model accuracy, our
methodology incorporates multiple nodes with constrained transfer capacities,
and we provide a foresight-free dispatch policy for application to this
setting. Finally, we demonstrate the chance-constrained capacity determination
via application to a model of the British network.

Title: Design optimization of stochastic complex systems via iterative density
  estimation
Authors: Wang-Sheng Liu, Sai Hung Cheung
Categories: stat.AP cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) provides a rational and sound
framework for finding the optimal design while taking uncertainties into
ac-count. The main issue in implementing RBDO methods, particularly stochastic
simu-lation based ones, is the computational burden arising from the evaluation
of reliability constraints. In this contribution, we propose an efficient
method which ap-proximates the failure probability functions (FPF) to decouple
reliability. Based on the augmentation concept, the approximation of FPF is
equivalent to density estimation of failure design samples. Unlike traditional
density estimation schemes, where the esti-mation is conducted in the entire
design space, in the proposed method we iteratively partition the design space
into several subspaces according to the distribution of fail-ure design
samples. Numerical results of an illustrative example indicate that the
pro-posed method can improve the computational performance considerably.
