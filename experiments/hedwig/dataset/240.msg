Title: Algorithms for Optimizing Fleet Scheduling of Air Ambulances
Authors: Joseph Tassone and Salimur Choudhury
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 14 pages, 4 figures, 16 references
\\
  Proper scheduling of air assets can be the difference between life and death
for a patient. While poor scheduling can be incredibly problematic during
hospital transfers, it can be potentially catastrophic in the case of a
disaster. These issues are amplified in the case of an air emergency medical
service (EMS) system where populations are dispersed, and resources are
limited. There are exact methodologies existing for scheduling missions,
although actual calculation times can be quite significant given a large enough
problem space. For this research, known coordinates of air and health
facilities were used in conjunction with a formulated integer linear
programming model. This was the programmed through Gurobi so that performance
could be compared against custom algorithmic solutions. Two methods were
developed, one based on neighbourhood search and the other on Tabu search.
While both were able to achieve results quite close to the Gurobi solution, the
Tabu search outperformed the former algorithm. Additionally, it was able to do
so in a greatly decreased time, with Gurobi actually being unable to resolve to
optimal in larger examples. Parallel variations were also developed with the
compute unified device architecture (CUDA), though did not improve the timing
given the smaller sample size.

Title: Type-2 Fuzzy Set based Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets for
  Linguistic Decision Making
Authors: Taniya Seth and Pranab K. Muhuri
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Approaches based on computing with words find good applicability in decision
making systems. Predominantly finding their basis in type-1 fuzzy sets,
computing with words approaches employ type-1 fuzzy sets as semantics of the
linguistic terms. However, type-2 fuzzy sets have been proven to be
scientifically more appropriate to represent linguistic information in
practical systems. They take into account both the intra-uncertainty as well as
the inter-uncertainty in cases where the linguistic information comes from a
group of experts. Hence in this paper, we propose to introduce linguistic terms
whose semantics are denoted by interval type-2 fuzzy sets within the hesitant
fuzzy linguistic term set framework, resulting in type-2 fuzzy sets based
hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets. We also introduce a novel method of
computing type-2 fuzzy envelopes out of multiple interval type-2 fuzzy sets
with trapezoidal membership functions. Furthermore, the proposed framework with
interval type-2 fuzzy sets is applied on a supplier performance evaluation
scenario. Since humans are predominantly involved in the entire process of
supply chain, their feedback is crucial while deciding many factors. Towards
the end of the paper, we compare our presented model with various existing
models and demonstrate the advantages of the former.

\\
  Crowdsourcing is defined as the outsourcing of tasks to a crowd of
contributors. The crowd is very diverse on these platforms and includes
malicious contributors attracted by the remuneration of tasks and not
conscientiously performing them. It is essential to identify these contributors
in order to avoid considering their responses. As not all contributors have the
same aptitude for a task, it seems appropriate to give weight to their answers
according to their qualifications. This paper, published at the ICTAI 2019
conference, proposes a method, MONITOR, for estimating the profile of the
contributor and aggregating the responses using belief function theory.

Title: Knowledge Cores in Large Formal Contexts
Authors: Tom Hanika and Johannes Hirth
Categories: cs.AI cs.LO
Comments: 13 pages, 10 figures
MSC-class: 68T30 03G10 97R40
\\
  Knowledge computation tasks are often infeasible for large data sets. This is
in particular true when deriving knowledge bases in formal concept analysis
(FCA). Hence, it is essential to come up with techniques to cope with this
problem. Many successful methods are based on random processes to reduce the
size of the investigated data set. This, however, makes them hardly
interpretable with respect to the discovered knowledge. Other approaches
restrict themselves to highly supported subsets and omit rare and interesting
patterns. An essentially different approach is used in network science, called
$k$-cores. These are able to reflect rare patterns if they are well connected
in the data set. In this work, we study $k$-cores in the realm of FCA by
exploiting the natural correspondence to bi-partite graphs. This structurally
motivated approach leads to a comprehensible extraction of knowledge cores from
large formal contexts data sets.

Title: Gamma-Reward: A Novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Method for
  Traffic Signal Control
Authors: Junjia Liu, Huimin Zhang, Zhuang Fu and Yao Wang
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
Comments: 13 pages, 13 figures
\\
  The intelligent control of traffic signal is critical to the optimization of
transportation systems. To solve the problem in large-scale road networks,
recent research has focused on interactions among intersections, which have
shown promising results. However, existing studies pay more attention to the
sensation sharing among agents and do not care about the results after taking
each action. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent interaction
mechanism, defined as Gamma-Reward that includes both original Gamma-Reward and
Gamma-Attention-Reward, which use the space-time information in the replay
buffer to amend the reward of each action, for traffic signal control based on
deep reinforcement learning method. We give a detailed theoretical foundation
and prove the proposed method can converge to Nash Equilibrium. By extending
the idea of Markov Chain to the road network, this interaction mechanism
replaces the graph attention method and realizes the decoupling of the road
network, which is more in line with practical applications. Simulation and
experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model can get better
performance than previous studies, by amending the reward. To our best
knowledge, our work appears to be the first to treat the road network itself as
a Markov Chain.

Title: Improving the Performance of Stochastic Local Search for Maximum Vertex
  Weight Clique Problem Using Programming by Optimization
Authors: Yi Chu, Chuan Luo, Holger H. Hoos, QIngwei Lin, Haihang You
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The maximum vertex weight clique problem (MVWCP) is an important
generalization of the maximum clique problem (MCP) that has a wide range of
real-world applications. In situations where rigorous guarantees regarding the
optimality of solutions are not required, MVWCP is usually solved using
stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms, which also define the state of the
art for solving this problem. However, there is no single SLS algorithm which
gives the best performance across all classes of MVWCP instances, and it is
challenging to effectively identify the most suitable algorithm for each class
of MVWCP instances. In this work, we follow the paradigm of Programming by
Optimization (PbO) to develop a new, flexible and highly parametric SLS
framework for solving MVWCP, combining, for the first time, a broad range of
effective heuristic mechanisms. By automatically configuring this PbO-MWC
framework, we achieve substantial advances in the state-of-the-art in solving
MVWCP over a broad range of prominent benchmarks, including two derived from
real-world applications in transplantation medicine (kidney exchange) and
assessment of research excellence.

Title: Reinforcement Learning of Risk-Constrained Policies in Markov Decision
  Processes
Authors: Tomas Brazdil, Krishnendu Chatterjee, Petr Novotny, Jiri Vahala
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Published on AAAI 2020
\\
  Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the defacto frame-work for sequential
decision making in the presence ofstochastic uncertainty. A classical
optimization criterion forMDPs is to maximize the expected discounted-sum
pay-off, which ignores low probability catastrophic events withhighly negative
impact on the system. On the other hand,risk-averse policies require the
probability of undesirableevents to be below a given threshold, but they do not
accountfor optimization of the expected payoff. We consider MDPswith
discounted-sum payoff with failure states which repre-sent catastrophic
outcomes. The objective of risk-constrainedplanning is to maximize the expected
discounted-sum payoffamong risk-averse policies that ensure the probability to
en-counter a failure state is below a desired threshold. Our maincontribution
is an efficient risk-constrained planning algo-rithm that combines UCT-like
search with a predictor learnedthrough interaction with the MDP (in the style
of AlphaZero)and with a risk-constrained action selection via linear
pro-gramming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approachwith experiments
on classical MDPs from the literature, in-cluding benchmarks with an order of
10^6 states.

Title: Hallucinative Topological Memory for Zero-Shot Visual Planning
Authors: Kara Liu, Thanard Kurutach, Christine Tung, Pieter Abbeel, Aviv Tamar
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE cs.RO
\\
  In visual planning (VP), an agent learns to plan goal-directed behavior from
observations of a dynamical system obtained offline, e.g., images obtained from
self-supervised robot interaction. Most previous works on VP approached the
problem by planning in a learned latent space, resulting in low-quality visual
plans, and difficult training algorithms. Here, instead, we propose a simple VP
method that plans directly in image space and displays competitive performance.
We build on the semi-parametric topological memory (SPTM) method: image samples
are treated as nodes in a graph, the graph connectivity is learned from image
sequence data, and planning can be performed using conventional graph search
methods. We propose two modifications on SPTM. First, we train an energy-based
graph connectivity function using contrastive predictive coding that admits
stable training. Second, to allow zero-shot planning in new domains, we learn a
conditional VAE model that generates images given a context of the domain, and
use these hallucinated samples for building the connectivity graph and
planning. We show that this simple approach significantly outperform the
state-of-the-art VP methods, in terms of both plan interpretability and success
rate when using the plan to guide a trajectory-following controller.
Interestingly, our method can pick up non-trivial visual properties of objects,
such as their geometry, and account for it in the plans.

Title: Energy Resolved Neutron Imaging for Strain Reconstruction using the
  Finite Element Method
Authors: Riya Aggarwal, Mike Meylan, Bishnu Lamichhane, and Chris Wensrich
Categories: cs.CE
\\
  A pulsed neutron imaging technique is used to reconstruct the residual strain
within a polycrystalline material from Bragg edge strain images. This technique
offers the possibility of a nondestructive analysis of strain fields with a
high spatial resolution. A finite element approach is used to reconstruct the
strain using the least square method constrained by the conditions of
equilibrium. The procedure is developed and verified by validating for a
cantilevered beam problem. It is subsequently demonstrated by reconstructing
the strain from experimental data for a ring-and-plug sample, measured at the
spallation neutron source RADEN at J-PARC in Japan. The reconstruction is
validated by comparison with conventional constant wavelength strain
measurements on the KOWARI diffractometer at ANSTO in Australia. It is also
shown that the addition of a simple Tikhonov regularization can improve the
reconstruction.

In accordance with the increasingly diverse modes of usage of splines, it is

for various file formats and a wide range of spline manipulation algorithms.
Further, a new efficient and objective-oriented algorithm for B-spline basis
function evaluation is included. All features are available by a spline-type
independent interface. The library is written in modern C++ with CMake as build

Title: Finding large matchings in 1-planar graphs of minimum degree 3
Authors: Therese Biedl and Fabian Klute
Categories: cs.CG cs.DS
\\
  A matching is a set of edges without common endpoint. It was recently shown
that every 1-planar graph (i.e., a graph that can be drawn in the plane with at
most one crossing per edge) that has minimum degree 3 has a matching of size at
least $\frac{n+12}{7}$, and this is tight for some graphs. The proof did not
come with an algorithm to find the matching more efficiently than a
general-purpose maximum-matching algorithm. In this paper, we give such an
algorithm. More generally, we show that any matching that has no augmenting
paths of length 9 or less has size at least $\frac{n+12}{7}$ in a 1-planar
graph with minimum degree 3.

Title: Layered Sampling for Robust Optimization Problems
Authors: Hu Ding and Zixiu Wang
Categories: cs.CG cs.DS math.OC
\\
  In real world, our datasets often contain outliers. Moreover, the outliers
can seriously affect the final machine learning result. Most existing
algorithms for handling outliers take high time complexities (e.g. quadratic or
cubic complexity). {\em Coreset} is a popular approach for compressing data so
as to speed up the optimization algorithms. However, the current coreset
methods cannot be easily extended to handle the case with outliers. In this
paper, we propose a new variant of coreset technique, {\em layered sampling},
to deal with two fundamental robust optimization problems: {\em
$k$-median/means clustering with outliers} and {\em linear regression with
outliers}. This new coreset method is in particular suitable to speed up the
iterative algorithms (which often improve the solution within a local range)
for those robust optimization problems. Moreover, our method is easy to be
implemented in practice. We expect that our framework of layered sampling will
be applicable to other robust optimization problems.

Title: The Effectiveness of Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform for High
  Dimensional Optimization with Outliers
Authors: Hu Ding, Ruizhe Qin, Jiawei Huang
Categories: cs.CG cs.LG
\\
  {\em Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Transform} is one of the most popular methods
for dimension reduction. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of JL
transform for solving the high dimensional optimization problems with outliers.
We focus on two fundamental optimization problems: {\em $k$-center clustering
with outliers} and {\em SVM with outliers}. In general, the time complexity for
dealing with outliers in high dimensional space could be very large. Based on
some novel insights in geometry, we prove that the complexities of these two
problems can be significantly reduced through JL transform. In the experiments,
we compare JL transform with several other well known dimension reduction
methods, and study their performances on synthetic and real datasets.

Title: On Metric DBSCAN with Low Doubling Dimension
Authors: Hu Ding, Fan Yang
Categories: cs.CG cs.DS
\\
  The density based clustering method {\em Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)} is a popular method for outlier recognition
and has received tremendous attention from many different areas. A major issue
of the original DBSCAN is that the time complexity could be as large as
quadratic. Most of existing DBSCAN algorithms focus on developing efficient
index structures to speed up the procedure in low-dimensional Euclidean space.
However, the research of DBSCAN in high-dimensional Euclidean space or general
metric space is still quite limited, to the best of our knowledge. In this
paper, we consider the metric DBSCAN problem under the assumption that the
inliers (excluding the outliers) have a low doubling dimension. We apply a
novel randomized $k$-center clustering idea to reduce the complexity of range
query, which is the most time consuming step in the whole DBSCAN procedure. Our
proposed algorithms do not need to build any complicated data structures and
are easy to be implemented in practice. The experimental results show that our
algorithms can significantly outperform the existing DBSCAN algorithms in terms
of running time.

Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  Automatic phonemic transcription tools are useful for low-resource language
documentation. However, due to the lack of training sets, only a tiny fraction
of languages have phonemic transcription tools. Fortunately, multilingual
acoustic modeling provides a solution given limited audio training data. A more
challenging problem is to build phonemic transcribers for languages with zero
training data. The difficulty of this task is that phoneme inventories often
differ between the training languages and the target language, making it
infeasible to recognize unseen phonemes. In this work, we address this problem
by adopting the idea of zero-shot learning. Our model is able to recognize
unseen phonemes in the target language without any training data. In our model,
we decompose phonemes into corresponding articulatory attributes such as vowel
and consonant. Instead of predicting phonemes directly, we first predict
distributions over articulatory attributes, and then compute phoneme
distributions with a customized acoustic model. We evaluate our model by
training it using 13 languages and testing it using 7 unseen languages. We find
that it achieves 7.7% better phoneme error rate on average over a standard
multilingual model.

Title: Train Large, Then Compress: Rethinking Model Size for Efficient Training
  and Inference of Transformers
Authors: Zhuohan Li, Eric Wallace, Sheng Shen, Kevin Lin, Kurt Keutzer, Dan
  Klein, Joseph E. Gonzalez
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Since hardware resources are limited, the objective of training deep learning
models is typically to maximize accuracy subject to the time and memory
constraints of training and inference. We study the impact of model size in
this setting, focusing on Transformer models for NLP tasks that are limited by
compute: self-supervised pretraining and high-resource machine translation. We
first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per
iteration, wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps.
Moreover, this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional
computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore, the most
compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely
large models but stop after a small number of iterations.
  This leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large
Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models.
However, we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques
such as quantization and pruning than small models. Consequently, one can get
the best of both worlds: heavily compressed, large models achieve higher
accuracy than lightly compressed, small models.

\\
  Multilingual models can improve language processing, particularly for low
resource situations, by sharing parameters across languages. Multilingual
acoustic models, however, generally ignore the difference between phonemes
(sounds that can support lexical contrasts in a particular language) and their
corresponding phones (the sounds that are actually spoken, which are language
independent). This can lead to performance degradation when combining a variety
of training languages, as identically annotated phonemes can actually
correspond to several different underlying phonetic realizations. In this work,
we propose a joint model of both language-independent phone and
language-dependent phoneme distributions. In multilingual ASR experiments over
11 languages, we find that this model improves testing performance by 2%
phoneme error rate absolute in low-resource conditions. Additionally, because
we are explicitly modeling language-independent phones, we can build a
(nearly-)universal phone recognizer that, when combined with the PHOIBLE large,
manually curated database of phone inventories, can be customized into 2,000
language dependent recognizers. Experiments on two low-resourced indigenous
languages, Inuktitut and Tusom, show that our recognizer achieves phone
accuracy improvements of more than 17%, moving a step closer to speech
recognition for all languages in the world.

that even with this extremely simple model construction and training procedure,
ESNMT can already reach 70-80% quality of fully trainable baselines. We examine
how spectral radius of the reservoir, a key quantity that characterizes the

Title: Analysis of diversity-accuracy tradeoff in image captioning
Authors: Ruotian Luo, Gregory Shakhnarovich
Categories: cs.CL cs.CV
\\
  We investigate the effect of different model architectures, training
objectives, hyperparameter settings and decoding procedures on the diversity of
automatically generated image captions. Our results show that 1) simple
decoding by naive sampling, coupled with low temperature is a competitive and
fast method to produce diverse and accurate caption sets; 2) training with
CIDEr-based reward using Reinforcement learning harms the diversity properties
of the resulting generator, which cannot be mitigated by manipulating decoding
parameters. In addition, we propose a new metric AllSPICE for evaluating both
accuracy and diversity of a set of captions by a single value.

Title: CrossWOZ: A Large-Scale Chinese Cross-Domain Task-Oriented Dialogue
  Dataset
Authors: Qi Zhu, Kaili Huang, Zheng Zhang, Xiaoyan Zhu, Minlie Huang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  To advance multi-domain (cross-domain) dialogue modeling as well as alleviate
the shortage of Chinese task-oriented datasets, we propose CrossWOZ, the first
large-scale Chinese Cross-Domain Wizard-of-Oz task-oriented dataset. It
contains 6K dialogue sessions and 102K utterances for 5 domains, including
hotel, restaurant, attraction, metro, and taxi. Moreover, the corpus contains
rich annotation of dialogue states and dialogue acts at both user and system
sides. About 60% of the dialogues have cross-domain user goals that favor
inter-domain dependency and encourage natural transition across domains in
conversation. We also provide a user simulator and several benchmark models for
pipelined task-oriented dialogue systems, which will facilitate researchers to
compare and evaluate their models on this corpus. The large size and rich
annotation of CrossWOZ make it suitable to investigate a variety of tasks in
cross-domain dialogue modeling, such as dialogue state tracking, policy
learning, user simulation, etc.

Title: Integrating Boundary Assembling into a DNN Framework for Named Entity
  Recognition in Chinese Social Media Text
Authors: Zhaoheng Gong, Ping Chen, Jiang Zhou
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Named entity recognition is a challenging task in Natural Language
Processing, especially for informal and noisy social media text. Chinese word
boundaries are also entity boundaries, therefore, named entity recognition for
Chinese text can benefit from word boundary detection, outputted by Chinese
word segmentation. Yet Chinese word segmentation poses its own difficulty
because it is influenced by several factors, e.g., segmentation criteria,
employed algorithm, etc. Dealt improperly, it may generate a cascading failure
to the quality of named entity recognition followed. In this paper we integrate
a boundary assembling method with the state-of-the-art deep neural network
model, and incorporate the updated word boundary information into a conditional
random field model for named entity recognition. Our method shows a 2% absolute
improvement over previous state-of-the-art results.

  We show analytically that removing sigmoid transformation in the SGNS

same time is related to factorizing a binarized PMI matrix which, in turn, can
be treated as an adjacency matrix of a certain graph. Empirically, such graph
is a complex network, i.e. it has strong clustering and scale-free degree
distribution, and is tightly connected with hyperbolic spaces. In short, we
show the connection between static word embeddings and hyperbolic spaces

Title: Annotation of Emotion Carriers in Personal Narratives
Authors: Aniruddha Tammewar, Alessandra Cervone, Eva-Maria Messner, Giuseppe

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: To be published in LREC 2020
\\
  We are interested in the problem of understanding personal narratives (PN) -
spoken or written - recollections of facts, events, and thoughts. In PN,
emotion carriers are the speech or text segments that best explain the
emotional state of the user. Such segments may include entities, verb or noun
phrases. Advanced automatic understanding of PNs requires not only the
prediction of the user emotional state but also to identify which events (e.g.
{\em the loss of relative} or {\em the visit of grandpa}) or people ( e.g. {\em
the old group of high school mates}) carry the emotion manifested during the
personal recollection. This work proposes and evaluates an annotation model for
identifying emotion carriers in spoken personal narratives. Compared to other
text genres such as news and microblogs, spoken PNs are particularly
challenging because a narrative is usually unstructured, involving multiple
sub-events and characters as well as thoughts and associated emotions perceived
by the narrator. In this work, we experiment with annotating emotion carriers
from speech transcriptions in the Ulm State-of-Mind in Speech (USoMS) corpus, a
dataset of German PNs. We believe this resource could be used for experiments
in the automatic extraction of emotion carriers from PN, a task that could
provide further advancements in narrative understanding.

\\
  As a crucial component in task-oriented dialog systems, the Natural Language
Generation (NLG) module converts a dialog act represented in a semantic form
into a response in natural language. The success of traditional template-based
or statistical models typically relies on heavily annotated data, which is
infeasible for new domains. Therefore, it is pivotal for an NLG system to
generalize well with limited labelled data in real applications. To this end,
we present FewShotWoz, the first NLG benchmark to simulate the few-shot
learning setting in task-oriented dialog systems. Further, we develop the
SC-GPT model. It is pre-trained on a large set of annotated NLG corpus to
acquire the controllable generation ability, and fine-tuned with only a few
domain-specific labels to adapt to new domains. Experiments on FewShotWoz and
the large Multi-Domain-WOZ datasets show that the proposed SC-GPT significantly
outperforms existing methods, measured by various automatic metrics and human
evaluations.

Title: Generating Followup Questions for Interpretable Multi-hop Question
  Answering
Authors: Christopher Malon and Bing Bai
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  We propose a framework for answering open domain multi-hop questions in which
partial information is read and used to generate followup questions, to finally
be answered by a pretrained single-hop answer extractor. This framework makes
each hop interpretable, and makes the retrieval associated with later hops as
flexible and specific as for the first hop. As a first instantiation of this
framework, we train a pointer-generator network to predict followup questions
based on the question and partial information. This provides a novel
application of a neural question generation network, which is applied to give
weak ground truth single-hop followup questions based on the final answers and
their supporting facts. Learning to generate followup questions that select the
relevant answer spans against downstream supporting facts, while avoiding
distracting premises, poses an exciting semantic challenge for text generation.
We present an evaluation using the two-hop bridge questions of HotpotQA.

Categories: cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures,21 references
\\
  Federated learning (FL) is an emerging collaborative machine learning method
to train models on distributed datasets with privacy concerns. To properly
incentivize data owners to contribute their efforts, Shapley Value (SV) is
often adopted to fairly assess their contribution. However, the calculation of
SV is time-consuming and computationally costly. In this paper, we propose
FedCoin, a blockchain-based peer-to-peer payment system for FL to enable a
feasible SV based profit distribution. In FedCoin, blockchain consensus
entities calculate SVs and a new block is created based on the proof of Shapley
(PoSap) protocol. It is in contrast to the popular BitCoin network where
consensus entities "mine" new blocks by solving meaningless puzzles. Based on
the computed SVs, a scheme for dividing the incentive payoffs among FL clients
with nonrepudiation and tamper-resistance properties is proposed. Experimental
results based on real-world data show that FedCoin can promote high-quality
data from FL clients through accurately computing SVs with an upper bound on
the computational resources required for reaching consensus. It opens
opportunities for non-data owners to play a role in FL.

Title: On Certifying Robustness against Backdoor Attacks via Randomized
  Smoothing
Authors: Binghui Wang, Xiaoyu Cao, Jinyuan jia, and Neil Zhenqiang Gong
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Backdoor attack is a severe security threat to deep neural networks (DNNs).
We envision that, like adversarial examples, there will be a cat-and-mouse game
for backdoor attacks, i.e., new empirical defenses are developed to defend
against backdoor attacks but they are soon broken by strong adaptive backdoor
attacks. To prevent such cat-and-mouse game, we take the first step towards
certified defenses against backdoor attacks. Specifically, in this work, we
study the feasibility and effectiveness of certifying robustness against
backdoor attacks using a recent technique called randomized smoothing.
Randomized smoothing was originally developed to certify robustness against
adversarial examples. We generalize randomized smoothing to defend against
backdoor attacks. Our results show the theoretical feasibility of using
randomized smoothing to certify robustness against backdoor attacks. However,
we also find that existing randomized smoothing methods have limited
effectiveness at defending against backdoor attacks, which highlight the needs
of new theory and methods to certify robustness against backdoor attacks.

Title: Attacking Neural Text Detectors
Authors: Max Wolff
Categories: cs.CR cs.CL
\\
  Machine learning based language models have recently made significant
progress, which introduces a danger to spread misinformation. To combat this
potential danger, several methods have been proposed for detecting text written
by these language models. This paper presents two classes of black-box attacks
on these detectors, one which randomly replaces characters with homoglyphs, and
the other a simple scheme to purposefully misspell words. The homoglyph and
misspelling attacks decrease a popular neural text detector's recall on neural
text from 97.44% to 0.26% and 22.68%, respectively. Results also indicate that
the attacks are transferable to other neural text detectors.

Title: Membership Inference Attacks and Defenses in Supervised Learning via
  Generalization Gap
Authors: Jiacheng Li, Ninghui Li, Bruno Ribeiro
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  This work studies membership inference (MI) attack against classifiers, where
the attacker's goal is to determine whether a data instance was used for
training the classifier. While it is known that overfitting makes classifiers
susceptible to MI attacks, we showcase a simple numerical relationship between
the generalization gap---the difference between training and test
accuracies---and the classifier's vulnerability to MI attacks---as measured by
an MI attack's accuracy gain over a random guess. We then propose to close the
gap by matching the training and validation accuracies during training, by
means of a new {\em set regularizer} using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between
the softmax output empirical distributions of the training and validation sets.
Our experimental results show that combining this approach with another simple
defense (mix-up training) significantly improves state-of-the-art defense
against MI attacks, with minimal impact on testing accuracy.

Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
Comments: Accepted by KDD 2019 AdvML workshop
\\
  Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved a great success in various
computer vision tasks, it is recently found that they are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. In this paper, we focus on the so-called \textit{backdoor
attack}, which injects a backdoor trigger to a small portion of training data
(also known as data poisoning) such that the trained DNN induces
misclassification while facing examples with this trigger. To be specific, we
carefully study the effect of both real and synthetic backdoor attacks on the
internal response of vanilla and backdoored DNNs through the lens of Gard-CAM.
Moreover, we show that the backdoor attack induces a significant bias in neuron
activation in terms of the $\ell_\infty$ norm of an activation map compared to
its $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norm. Spurred by our results, we propose the
\textit{$\ell_\infty$-based neuron pruning} to remove the backdoor from the
backdoored DNN. Experiments show that our method could effectively decrease the
attack success rate, and also hold a high classification accuracy for clean
images.

Title: Entangled Watermarks as a Defense against Model Extraction
Authors: Hengrui Jia, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Nicolas Papernot
Categories: cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Machine learning involves expensive data collection and training procedures.
Model owners may be concerned that valuable intellectual property can be leaked
if adversaries mount model extraction attacks. Because it is difficult to
defend against model extraction without sacrificing significant prediction
accuracy, watermarking leverages unused model capacity to have the model
overfit to outlier input-output pairs, which are not sampled from the task
distribution and are only known to the defender. The defender then demonstrates
knowledge of the input-output pairs to claim ownership of the model at
inference. The effectiveness of watermarks remains limited because they are
distinct from the task distribution and can thus be easily removed through
compression or other forms of knowledge transfer.
  We introduce Entangled Watermarking Embeddings (EWE). Our approach encourages
the model to learn common features for classifying data that is sampled from
the task distribution, but also data that encodes watermarks. An adversary
attempting to remove watermarks that are entangled with legitimate data is also
forced to sacrifice performance on legitimate data. Experiments on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, and Google Speech Commands validate that the defender can claim
model ownership with 95% confidence after less than 10 queries to the stolen
copy, at a modest cost of 1% accuracy in the defended model's performance.

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020
\\
  Fine-tuning from pre-trained ImageNet models has become the de-facto standard
for various computer vision tasks. Current practices for fine-tuning typically
involve selecting an ad-hoc choice of hyperparameters and keeping them fixed to
values normally used for training from scratch. This paper re-examines several
common practices of setting hyperparameters for fine-tuning. Our findings are
based on extensive empirical evaluation for fine-tuning on various transfer
learning benchmarks. (1) While prior works have thoroughly investigated
learning rate and batch size, momentum for fine-tuning is a relatively
unexplored parameter. We find that the value of momentum also affects
fine-tuning performance and connect it with previous theoretical findings. (2)
Optimal hyperparameters for fine-tuning, in particular, the effective learning
rate, are not only dataset dependent but also sensitive to the similarity
between the source domain and target domain. This is in contrast to
hyperparameters for training from scratch. (3) Reference-based regularization
that keeps models close to the initial model does not necessarily apply for
"dissimilar" datasets. Our findings challenge common practices of fine-tuning
and encourages deep learning practitioners to rethink the hyperparameters for
fine-tuning.

Title: On Leveraging Pretrained GANs for Limited-Data Generation
Authors: Miaoyun Zhao, Yulai Cong, Lawrence Carin
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Recent work has shown GANs can generate highly realistic images that are
indistinguishable by human. Of particular interest here is the empirical
observation that most generated images are not contained in training datasets,
indicating potential generalization with GANs. That generalizability makes it
appealing to exploit GANs to help applications with limited available data,
e.g., augment training data to alleviate overfitting. To better facilitate
training a GAN on limited data, we propose to leverage already-available GAN
models pretrained on large-scale datasets (like ImageNet) to introduce
additional common knowledge (which may not exist within the limited data)
following the transfer learning idea. Specifically, exampled by natural image
generation tasks, we reveal the fact that low-level filters (those close to
observations) of both the generator and discriminator of pretrained GANs can be
transferred to help the target limited-data generation. For better adaption of
the transferred filters to the target domain, we introduce a new technique
named adaptive filter modulation (AdaFM), which provides boosted performance
over baseline methods. Unifying the transferred filters and the introduced
techniques, we present our method and conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate its training efficiency and better performance on limited-data
generation.

  We present a fully automatic method to generate detailed and accurate
artistic shadows from pairs of line drawing sketches and lighting directions.
We also contribute a new dataset of one thousand examples of pairs of line
drawings and shadows that are tagged with lighting directions. Remarkably, the
generated shadows quickly communicate the underlying 3D structure of the
sketched scene. Consequently, the shadows generated by our approach can be used
directly or as an excellent starting point for artists. We demonstrate that the
deep learning network we propose takes a hand-drawn sketch, builds a 3D model
in latent space, and renders the resulting shadows. The generated shadows
respect the hand-drawn lines and underlying 3D space and contain sophisticated
and accurate details, such as self-shadowing effects. Moreover, the generated
shadows contain artistic effects, such as rim lighting or halos appearing from
back lighting, that would be achievable with traditional 3D rendering methods.

Title: Joint Unsupervised Learning of Optical Flow and Egomotion with Bi-Level
  Optimization
Authors: Shihao Jiang, Dylan Campbell, Miaomiao Liu, Stephen Gould, Richard
  Hartley
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We address the problem of joint optical flow and camera motion estimation in
rigid scenes by incorporating geometric constraints into an unsupervised deep
learning framework. Unlike existing approaches which rely on brightness
constancy and local smoothness for optical flow estimation, we exploit the
global relationship between optical flow and camera motion using epipolar
geometry. In particular, we formulate the prediction of optical flow and camera
motion as a bi-level optimization problem, consisting of an upper-level problem
to estimate the flow that conforms to the predicted camera motion, and a
lower-level problem to estimate the camera motion given the predicted optical
flow. We use implicit differentiation to enable back-propagation through the
lower-level geometric optimization layer independent of its implementation,
allowing end-to-end training of the network. With globally-enforced geometric
constraints, we are able to improve the quality of the estimated optical flow
in challenging scenarios and obtain better camera motion estimates compared to
other unsupervised learning methods.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: to appear in CVPR 2020
\\
  Recognizing wild faces is extremely hard as they appear with all kinds of
variations. Traditional methods either train with specifically annotated
variation data from target domains, or by introducing unlabeled target
variation data to adapt from the training data. Instead, we propose a universal
representation learning framework that can deal with larger variation unseen in
the given training data without leveraging target domain knowledge. We firstly
synthesize training data alongside some semantically meaningful variations,
such as low resolution, occlusion and head pose. However, directly feeding the
augmented data for training will not converge well as the newly introduced
samples are mostly hard examples. We propose to split the feature embedding
into multiple sub-embeddings, and associate different confidence values for
each sub-embedding to smooth the training procedure. The sub-embeddings are
further decorrelated by regularizing variation classification loss and
variation adversarial loss on different partitions of them. Experiments show
that our method achieves top performance on general face recognition datasets
such as LFW and MegaFace, while significantly better on extreme benchmarks such
as TinyFace and IJB-S.

Title: GATCluster: Self-Supervised Gaussian-Attention Network for Image
  Clustering
Authors: Chuang Niu, Jun Zhang, Ge Wang, Jimin Liang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Deep clustering has achieved state-of-the-art results via joint
representation learning and clustering, but still has an inferior performance
for the real scene images, e.g., those in ImageNet. With such images, deep
clustering methods face several challenges, including extracting discriminative
features, avoiding trivial solutions, capturing semantic information, and
performing on large-size image datasets. To address these problems, here we
propose a self-supervised attention network for image clustering
(AttentionCluster). Rather than extracting intermediate features first and then
performing the traditional clustering algorithm, AttentionCluster directly
outputs semantic cluster labels that are more discriminative than intermediate
features and does not need further post-processing. To train the
AttentionCluster in a completely unsupervised manner, we design four learning
tasks with the constraints of transformation invariance, separability
maximization, entropy analysis, and attention mapping. Specifically, the
transformation invariance and separability maximization tasks learn the
relationships between sample pairs. The entropy analysis task aims to avoid
trivial solutions. To capture the object-oriented semantics, we design a
self-supervised attention mechanism that includes a parameterized attention
module and a soft-attention loss. All the guiding signals for clustering are
self-generated during the training process. Moreover, we develop a two-step
learning algorithm that is training-friendly and memory-efficient for
processing large-size images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of our proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art image clustering
benchmarks.

Title: Defense-PointNet: Protecting PointNet Against Adversarial Attacks

\\
  Despite remarkable performance across a broad range of tasks, neural networks
have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Many works focus on
adversarial attacks and defenses on 2D images, but few focus on 3D point
clouds. In this paper, our goal is to enhance the adversarial robustness of
PointNet, which is one of the most widely used models for 3D point clouds. We
apply the fast gradient sign attack method (FGSM) on 3D point clouds and find
that FGSM can be used to generate not only adversarial images but also
adversarial point clouds. To minimize the vulnerability of PointNet to
adversarial attacks, we propose Defense-PointNet. We compare our model with two
baseline approaches and show that Defense-PointNet significantly improves the
robustness of the network against adversarial samples.

Title: Hierarchical Memory Decoding for Video Captioning
Authors: Aming Wu, Yahong Han
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent advances of video captioning often employ a recurrent neural network
(RNN) as the decoder. However, RNN is prone to diluting long-term information.
Recent works have demonstrated memory network (MemNet) has the advantage of
storing long-term information. However, as the decoder, it has not been well
exploited for video captioning. The reason partially comes from the difficulty
of sequence decoding with MemNet. Instead of the common practice, i.e.,
sequence decoding with RNN, in this paper, we devise a novel memory decoder for
video captioning. Concretely, after obtaining representation of each frame
through a pre-trained network, we first fuse the visual and lexical
information. Then, at each time step, we construct a multi-layer MemNet-based
decoder, i.e., in each layer, we employ a memory set to store previous
information and an attention mechanism to select the information related to the
current input. Thus, this decoder avoids the dilution of long-term information.
And the multi-layer architecture is helpful for capturing dependencies between
frames and word sequences. Experimental results show that even without the
encoding network, our decoder still could obtain competitive performance and
outperform the performance of RNN decoder. Furthermore, compared with one-layer
RNN decoder, our decoder has fewer parameters.

Title: Unshuffling Data for Improved Generalization
Authors: Damien Teney, Ehsan Abbasnejad, Anton van den Hengel
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The inability to generalize to test data outside the distribution of a
training set is at the core of practical limits of machine learning. We show
that mixing and shuffling training examples when training deep neural networks
is not an optimal practice. On the opposite, partitioning the training data
into non-i.i.d. subsets can guide the model to use reliable statistical
patterns, while ignoring spurious correlations in the training data. We
demonstrate multiple use cases where these subsets are built using unsupervised
clustering, prior knowledge, or other meta-data available in existing datasets.
The approach is supported by recent results on a causal view of generalization,
it is simple to apply, and demonstrably improves generalization. Applied to the
task of visual question answering, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on
VQA-CP. We also show improvement over data augmentation using equivalent
questions on GQA. Finally, we show a small improvement when training a model
simultaneously on VQA v2 and Visual Genome, treating them as two distinct
environments rather than one aggregated training set.

Title: RNNPool: Efficient Non-linear Pooling for RAM Constrained Inference
Authors: Oindrila Saha, Aditya Kusupati, Harsha Vardhan Simhadri, Manik Varma,
  Prateek Jain
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 16 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Pooling operators are key components in most Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) as they serve to downsample images, aggregate feature information, and
increase receptive field. However, standard pooling operators reduce the
feature size gradually to avoid significant loss in information via gross
aggregation. Consequently, CNN architectures tend to be deep, computationally
expensive and challenging to deploy on RAM constrained devices. We introduce
RNNPool, a novel pooling operator based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
that efficiently aggregate features over large patches of an image and rapidly
downsamples its size. Our empirical evaluation indicates that an RNNPool
layer(s) can effectively replace multiple blocks in a variety of architectures
such as MobileNets (Sandler et al., 2018), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) and
can be used for several vision tasks like image classification and face
detection. That is, RNNPool can significantly decrease computational complexity
and peak RAM usage for inference, while retaining comparable accuracy. Further,
we use RNNPool to construct a novel real-time face detection method that
achieves state-of-the-art MAP within computational budget afforded by a tiny
Cortex M4 microcontroller with ~256 KB RAM.

Title: Set-Constrained Viterbi for Set-Supervised Action Segmentation
Authors: Jun Li, Sinisa Todorovic
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Preprint
\\
  This paper is about weakly supervised action segmentation, where ground truth
specifies only a set of actions present in a training video. This problem is
more challenging than the standard weakly supervised setting where the temporal
ordering of actions is provided. Prior work typically uses a classifier that
independently labels video frames for generating the pseudo ground truth, and
multiple instance learning for training the classifier. We extend this
framework by specifying an HMM, which accounts for co-occurrences of action
classes and their temporal lengths, and by explicitly training the HMM on a
Viterbi-based loss. Our first contribution is the formulation of a new
set-constrained Viterbi algorithm (SCV). Given a video, the SCV generates the
MAP action segmentation that satisfies the ground truth. This prediction is
used as a framewise pseudo ground truth in our HMM training. Our second
contribution is a new regularization of learning by a n-pair loss that
regularizes the feature affinity of training videos sharing the same action
classes. Evaluation on action segmentation and alignment on the Breakfast, MPII
Cooking2, Hollywood Extended datasets demonstrates our significant performance
improvement for the two tasks over prior work.

Title: Social-STGCNN: A Social Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural
  Network for Human Trajectory Prediction
Authors: Abduallah Mohamed, Kun Qian, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Christian Claudel
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020
\\
  Better machine understanding of pedestrian behaviors enables faster progress
in modeling interactions between agents such as autonomous vehicles and humans.
Pedestrian trajectories are not only influenced by the pedestrian itself but
also by interaction with surrounding objects. Previous methods modeled these
interactions by using a variety of aggregation methods that integrate different
learned pedestrians states. We propose the Social Spatio-Temporal Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (Social-STGCNN), which substitutes the need of
aggregation methods by modeling the interactions as a graph. Our results show
an improvement over the state of art by 20% on the Final Displacement Error
(FDE) and an improvement on the Average Displacement Error (ADE) with 8.5 times
less parameters and up to 48 times faster inference speed than previously
reported methods. In addition, our model is data efficient, and exceeds
previous state of the art on the ADE metric with only 20% of the training data.
We propose a kernel function to embed the social interactions between
pedestrians within the adjacency matrix. Through qualitative analysis, we show
that our model inherited social behaviors that can be expected between
pedestrians trajectories.

Title: Auto-Encoding Twin-Bottleneck Hashing
Authors: Yuming Shen, Jie Qin, Jiaxin Chen, Mengyang Yu, Li Liu, Fan Zhu, Fumin
  Shen, Ling Shao
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: CVPR 2020 Accepted
\\
  Conventional unsupervised hashing methods usually take advantage of
similarity graphs, which are either pre-computed in the high-dimensional space
or obtained from random anchor points. On the one hand, existing methods
uncouple the procedures of hash function learning and graph construction. On
the other hand, graphs empirically built upon original data could introduce
biased prior knowledge of data relevance, leading to sub-optimal retrieval
performance. In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing an
efficient and adaptive code-driven graph, which is updated by decoding in the
context of an auto-encoder. Specifically, we introduce into our framework twin
bottlenecks (i.e., latent variables) that exchange crucial information
collaboratively. One bottleneck (i.e., binary codes) conveys the high-level
intrinsic data structure captured by the code-driven graph to the other (i.e.,
continuous variables for low-level detail information), which in turn
propagates the updated network feedback for the encoder to learn more
discriminative binary codes. The auto-encoding learning objective literally
rewards the code-driven graph to learn an optimal encoder. Moreover, the
proposed model can be simply optimized by gradient descent without violating
the binary constraints. Experiments on benchmarked datasets clearly show the
superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art hashing methods.

Title: Weakly supervised discriminative feature learning with state information
  for person identification
Authors: Hong-Xing Yu, Wei-Shi Zheng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To appear at CVPR20
\\
  Unsupervised learning of identity-discriminative visual feature is appealing
in real-world tasks where manual labelling is costly. However, the images of an
identity can be visually discrepant when images are taken under different
states, e.g. different camera views and poses. This visual discrepancy leads to
great difficulty in unsupervised discriminative learning. Fortunately, in
real-world tasks we could often know the states without human annotation, e.g.
we can easily have the camera view labels in person re-identification and
facial pose labels in face recognition. In this work we propose utilizing the
state information as weak supervision to address the visual discrepancy caused
by different states. We formulate a simple pseudo label model and utilize the
state information in an attempt to refine the assigned pseudo labels by the
weakly supervised decision boundary rectification and weakly supervised feature
drift regularization. We evaluate our model on unsupervised person
re-identification and pose-invariant face recognition. Despite the simplicity
of our method, it could outperform the state-of-the-art results on Duke-reID,
MultiPIE and CFP datasets with a standard ResNet-50 backbone. We also find our
model could perform comparably with the standard supervised fine-tuning results
on the three datasets. Code is available at

  Ground texture based vehicle localization using feature-based methods is a
promising approach to achieve infrastructure-free high-accuracy localization.
In this paper, we provide the first extensive evaluation of available feature
extraction methods for this task, using separately taken image pairs as well as
synthetic transformations. We identify AKAZE, SURF and CenSurE as best
performing keypoint detectors, and find pairings of CenSurE with the ORB, BRIEF
and LATCH feature descriptors to achieve greatest success rates for incremental
localization, while SIFT stands out when considering severe synthetic
transformations as they might occur during absolute localization.

Title: Unbiased Scene Graph Generation from Biased Training

Comments: This paper is accepted by CVPR 2020. The code is publicly available
  on GitHub: https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch
\\
  Today's scene graph generation (SGG) task is still far from practical, mainly
due to the severe training bias, e.g., collapsing diverse human walk on/ sit
on/lay on beach into human on beach. Given such SGG, the down-stream tasks such
as VQA can hardly infer better scene structures than merely a bag of objects.
However, debiasing in SGG is not trivial because traditional debiasing methods
cannot distinguish between the good and bad bias, e.g., good context prior
(e.g., person read book rather than eat) and bad long-tailed bias (e.g.,
behind/in front of collapsed to near). In this paper, we present a novel SGG
framework based on causal inference but not the conventional likelihood. We
first build a causal graph for SGG, and perform traditional biased training
with the graph. Then, we propose to draw the counterfactual causality from the
trained graph to infer the effect from the bad bias, which should be removed.
In particular, we use Total Direct Effect as the proposed final predicate score
for unbiased SGG. Note that our framework is agnostic to any SGG model and thus
can be widely applied in the community who seeks unbiased predictions. By using
the proposed Scene Graph Diagnosis toolkit on the SGG benchmark Visual Genome
and several prevailing models, we observed significant improvements over the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Multiple Discrimination and Pairwise CNN for View-based 3D Object
  Retrieval
Authors: Z. Gao, K.X Xue, S.H Wan
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  With the rapid development and wide application of computer, camera device,
network and hardware technology, 3D object (or model) retrieval has attracted
widespread attention and it has become a hot research topic in the computer
vision domain. Deep learning features already available in 3D object retrieval
have been proven to be better than the retrieval performance of hand-crafted
features. However, most existing networks do not take into account the impact
of multi-view image selection on network training, and the use of contrastive
loss alone only forcing the same-class samples to be as close as possible. In
this work, a novel solution named Multi-view Discrimination and Pairwise CNN
(MDPCNN) for 3D object retrieval is proposed to tackle these issues. It can
simultaneously input of multiple batches and multiple views by adding the Slice
layer and the Concat layer. Furthermore, a highly discriminative network is
obtained by training samples that are not easy to be classified by clustering.
Lastly, we deploy the contrastive-center loss and contrastive loss as the
optimization objective that has better intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability. Large-scale experiments show that the proposed MDPCNN can achieve
a significant performance over the state-of-the-art algorithms in 3D object
retrieval.

Title: Attention-guided Chained Context Aggregation for Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Quan Tang, Fagui Liu, Jun Jiang and Yu Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent breakthroughs in semantic segmentation methods based on Fully
Convolutional Networks (FCNs) have aroused great research interest. One of the
critical issues is how to aggregate multi-scale contextual information
effectively to obtain reliable results. To address this problem, we propose a
novel paradigm called the Chained Context Aggregation Module (CAM). CAM gains
features of various spatial scales through chain-connected ladder-style
information flows. The features are then guided by Flow Guidance Connections to
interact and fuse in a two-stage process, which we refer to as pre-fusion and
re-fusion. We further adopt attention models in CAM to productively recombine
and select those fused features to refine performance. Based on these
developments, we construct the Chained Context Aggregation Network (CANet),
which employs a two-step decoder to recover precise spatial details of
prediction maps. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging
datasets, including Pascal VOC 2012, CamVid and SUN-RGBD. Results evidence that
our CANet achieves state-of-the-art performance. Codes will be available on the
publication of this paper.

Title: XSepConv: Extremely Separated Convolution
Authors: Jiarong Chen, Zongqing Lu, Jing-Hao Xue, Qingmin Liao
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Depthwise convolution has gradually become an indispensable operation for
modern efficient neural networks and larger kernel sizes ($\ge5$) have been
applied to it recently. In this paper, we propose a novel extremely separated
convolutional block (XSepConv), which fuses spatially separable convolutions
into depthwise convolution to further reduce both the computational cost and
parameter size of large kernels. Furthermore, an extra $2\times2$ depthwise
convolution coupled with improved symmetric padding strategy is employed to
compensate for the side effect brought by spatially separable convolutions.
XSepConv is designed to be an efficient alternative to vanilla depthwise
convolution with large kernel sizes. To verify this, we use XSepConv for the
state-of-the-art architecture MobileNetV3-Small and carry out extensive
experiments on four highly competitive benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
SVHN and Tiny-ImageNet) to demonstrate that XSepConv can indeed strike a better
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

  As face recognition algorithms become more accurate and get deployed more
widely, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the algorithms work
equally well for everyone. We study the geographic performance
differentials-differences in false acceptance and false rejection rates across
different countries-when comparing selfies against photos from ID documents. We
show how to mitigate geographic performance differentials using sampling
strategies despite large imbalances in the dataset. Using vanilla domain
adaptation strategies to fine-tune a face recognition CNN on domain-specific
doc-selfie data improves the performance of the model on such data, but, in the
presence of imbalanced training data, also significantly increases the
demographic bias. We then show how to mitigate this effect by employing
sampling strategies to balance the training procedure.

  Learning

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages, 5 Figures, 8 tables
\\
  Automated vision-based score estimation models can be used as an alternate
opinion to avoid judgment bias. In the past works the score estimation models
were learned by regressing the video representations to the ground truth score
provided by the judges. However such regression-based solutions lack
interpretability in terms of giving reasons for the awarded score. One solution
to make the scores more explicable is to compare the given action video with a
reference video. This would capture the temporal variations w.r.t. the
reference video and map those variations to the final score. In this work, we
propose a new action scoring system as a two-phase system: (1) A Deep Metric
Learning Module that learns similarity between any two action videos based on
their ground truth scores given by the judges; (2) A Score Estimation Module
that uses the first module to find the resemblance of a video to a reference
video in order to give the assessment score. The proposed scoring model has
been tested for Olympics Diving and Gymnastic vaults and the model outperforms
the existing state-of-the-art scoring models.

\\
  In a broad range of fields it may be desirable to reuse a supervised
classification algorithm and apply it to a new data set. However,
generalization of such an algorithm and thus achieving a similar classification
performance is only possible when the training data used to build the algorithm
is similar to new unseen data one wishes to apply it to. It is often unknown in
advance how an algorithm will perform on new unseen data, being a crucial
reason for not deploying an algorithm at all. Therefore, tools are needed to
measure the similarity of data sets. In this paper, we propose the Data
Representativeness Criterion (DRC) to determine how representative a training
data set is of a new unseen data set. We present a proof of principle, to see
whether the DRC can quantify the similarity of data sets and whether the DRC
relates to the performance of a supervised classification algorithm. We
compared a number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets, ranging from
subtle to severe difference is acquisition parameters. Results indicate that,
based on the similarity of data sets, the DRC is able to give an indication as
to when the performance of a supervised classifier decreases. The strictness of
the DRC can be set by the user, depending on what one considers to be an
acceptable underperformance.

\\
  Slow motion videos are becoming increasingly popular, but capturing
high-resolution videos at extremely high frame rates requires professional
high-speed cameras. To mitigate this problem, current techniques increase the
frame rate of standard videos through frame interpolation by assuming linear
motion between the existing frames. While this assumption holds true for simple
cases with small motion, in challenging cases the motion is usually complex and
this assumption is no longer valid. Therefore, they typically produce results
with unnatural motion in these challenging cases. In this paper, we address
this problem using two video streams as the input; an auxiliary video with high
frame rate and low spatial resolution, providing temporal information, in
addition to the standard main video with low frame rate and high spatial
resolution. We propose a two-stage deep learning system consisting of alignment
and appearance estimation that reconstructs high resolution slow motion video
from the hybrid video input. For alignment, we propose to use a set of
pre-trained and trainable convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to compute the
flows between the missing frame and the two existing frames of the main video
by utilizing the content of the auxiliary video frames. We then warp the
existing frames using the flows to produce a set of aligned frames. For
appearance estimation, we propose to combine the aligned and auxiliary frames
using a context and occlusion aware CNN. We train our model on a set of
synthetically generated hybrid videos and show high-quality results on a wide
range of test scenes. We further demonstrate the practicality of our approach
by showing the performance of our system on two real dual camera setups with
small baseline.

Title: Domain Decluttering: Simplifying Images to Mitigate Synthetic-Real
  Domain Shift and Improve Depth Estimation
Authors: Yunhan Zhao, Shu Kong, Daeyun Shin, Charless Fowlkes
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at CVPR2020
\\
  Leveraging synthetically rendered data offers great potential to improve
monocular depth estimation, but closing the synthetic-real domain gap is a
non-trivial and important task. While much recent work has focused on
unsupervised domain adaptation, we consider a more realistic scenario where a
large amount of synthetic training data is supplemented by a small set of real
images with ground-truth. In this setting we find that existing domain
translation approaches are difficult to train and offer little advantage over
simple baselines that use a mix of real and synthetic data. A key failure mode
is that real-world images contain novel objects and clutter not present in
synthetic training. This high-level domain shift isn't handled by existing
image translation models.
  Based on these observations, we develop an attentional module that learns to
identify and remove (hard) out-of-domain regions in real images in order to
improve depth prediction for a model trained primarily on synthetic data. We
carry out extensive experiments to validate our attend-remove-complete approach
(ARC) and find that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art domain
adaptation methods for depth prediction. Visualizing the removed regions
provides interpretable insights into the synthetic-real domain gap.

Title: Evolving Losses for Unsupervised Video Representation Learning
Authors: AJ Piergiovanni, Anelia Angelova, Michael S. Ryoo

\\
  We present a new method to learn video representations from large-scale
unlabeled video data. Ideally, this representation will be generic and
transferable, directly usable for new tasks such as action recognition and zero
or few-shot learning. We formulate unsupervised representation learning as a
multi-modal, multi-task learning problem, where the representations are shared
across different modalities via distillation. Further, we introduce the concept
of loss function evolution by using an evolutionary search algorithm to
automatically find optimal combination of loss functions capturing many
(self-supervised) tasks and modalities. Thirdly, we propose an unsupervised
representation evaluation metric using distribution matching to a large
unlabeled dataset as a prior constraint, based on Zipf's law. This unsupervised
constraint, which is not guided by any labeling, produces similar results to
weakly-supervised, task-specific ones. The proposed unsupervised representation
learning results in a single RGB network and outperforms previous methods.
Notably, it is also more effective than several label-based methods (e.g.,
ImageNet), with the exception of large, fully labeled video datasets.

Title: University-1652: A Multi-view Multi-source Benchmark for Drone-based
  Geo-localization
Authors: Zhedong Zheng and Yunchao Wei and Yi Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We consider the problem of cross-view geo-localization. The primary challenge
of this task is to learn the robust feature against large viewpoint changes.
Existing benchmarks can help, but are limited in the number of viewpoints.
Image pairs, containing two viewpoints, e.g., satellite and ground, are usually
provided, which may compromise the feature learning. Besides phone cameras and
satellites, in this paper, we argue that drones could serve as the third
platform to deal with the geo-localization problem. In contrast to the
traditional ground-view images, drone-view images meet fewer obstacles, e.g.,
trees, and could provide a comprehensive view when flying around the target
place. To verify the effectiveness of the drone platform, we introduce a new
multi-view multi-source benchmark for drone-based geo-localization, named
University-1652. University-1652 contains data from three platforms, i.e.,
synthetic drones, satellites and ground cameras of 1,652 university buildings
around the world. To our knowledge, University-1652 is the first drone-based
geo-localization dataset and enables two new tasks, i.e., drone-view target
localization and drone navigation. As the name implies, drone-view target
localization intends to predict the location of the target place via drone-view
images. On the other hand, given a satellite-view query image, drone navigation
is to drive the drone to the area of interest in the query. We use this dataset
to analyze a variety of off-the-shelf CNN features and propose a strong CNN
baseline on this challenging dataset. The experiments show that University-1652
helps the model to learn the viewpoint-invariant features and also has good
generalization ability in the real-world scenario.

Title: Visual Commonsense R-CNN
Authors: Tan Wang, Jianqiang Huang, Hanwang Zhang, Qianru Sun
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020
\\
  We present a novel unsupervised feature representation learning method,
Visual Commonsense Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (VC R-CNN), to
serve as an improved visual region encoder for high-level tasks such as
captioning and VQA. Given a set of detected object regions in an image (e.g.,
using Faster R-CNN), like any other unsupervised feature learning methods
(e.g., word2vec), the proxy training objective of VC R-CNN is to predict the
contextual objects of a region. However, they are fundamentally different: the
prediction of VC R-CNN is by using causal intervention: P(Y|do(X)), while
others are by using the conventional likelihood: P(Y|X). This is also the core
reason why VC R-CNN can learn "sense-making" knowledge like chair can be sat
--- while not just "common" co-occurrences such as chair is likely to exist if
table is observed. We extensively apply VC R-CNN features in prevailing models
of three popular tasks: Image Captioning, VQA, and VCR, and observe consistent
performance boosts across all the methods and tasks, achieving many new
state-of-the-arts. Code and feature are available at

Title: Total3DUnderstanding: Joint Layout, Object Pose and Mesh Reconstruction
  for Indoor Scenes from a Single Image
Authors: Yinyu Nie, Xiaoguang Han, Shihui Guo, Yujian Zheng, Jian Chang, Jian
  Jun Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020
\\
  Semantic reconstruction of indoor scenes refers to both scene understanding
and object reconstruction. Existing works either address one part of this
problem or focus on independent objects. In this paper, we bridge the gap
between understanding and reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end solution to
jointly reconstruct room layout, object bounding boxes and meshes from a single
image. Instead of separately resolving scene understanding and object
reconstruction, our method builds upon a holistic scene context and proposes a
coarse-to-fine hierarchy with three components: 1. room layout with camera
pose; 2. 3D object bounding boxes; 3. object meshes. We argue that
understanding the context of each component can assist the task of parsing the
others, which enables joint understanding and reconstruction. The experiments
on the SUN RGB-D and Pix3D datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing methods in indoor layout estimation, 3D object detection
and mesh reconstruction.

Title: Meta-Transfer Learning for Zero-Shot Super-Resolution
Authors: Jae Woong Soh, Sunwoo Cho, Nam Ik Cho
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Will be presented in CVPR 2020
\\
  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown dramatic improvements in
single image super-resolution (SISR) by using large-scale external samples.
Despite their remarkable performance based on the external dataset, they cannot
exploit internal information within a specific image. Another problem is that
they are applicable only to the specific condition of data that they are
supervised. For instance, the low-resolution (LR) image should be a "bicubic"
downsampled noise-free image from a high-resolution (HR) one. To address both
issues, zero-shot super-resolution (ZSSR) has been proposed for flexible
internal learning. However, they require thousands of gradient updates, i.e.,
long inference time. In this paper, we present Meta-Transfer Learning for
Zero-Shot Super-Resolution (MZSR), which leverages ZSSR. Precisely, it is based
on finding a generic initial parameter that is suitable for internal learning.
Thus, we can exploit both external and internal information, where one single
gradient update can yield quite considerable results. (See Figure 1). With our
method, the network can quickly adapt to a given image condition. In this
respect, our method can be applied to a large spectrum of image conditions
within a fast adaptation process.

Title: Learning Representations by Predicting Bags of Visual Words
Authors: Spyros Gidaris, Andrei Bursuc, Nikos Komodakis, Patrick P\'erez,
  Matthieu Cord
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Accepted to CVPR2020
\\
  Self-supervised representation learning targets to learn convnet-based image
representations from unlabeled data. Inspired by the success of NLP methods in
this area, in this work we propose a self-supervised approach based on
spatially dense image descriptions that encode discrete visual concepts, here
called visual words. To build such discrete representations, we quantize the
feature maps of a first pre-trained self-supervised convnet, over a k-means
based vocabulary. Then, as a self-supervised task, we train another convnet to
predict the histogram of visual words of an image (i.e., its Bag-of-Words
representation) given as input a perturbed version of that image. The proposed
task forces the convnet to learn perturbation-invariant and context-aware image
features, useful for downstream image understanding tasks. We extensively
evaluate our method and demonstrate very strong empirical results, e.g., our
pre-trained self-supervised representations transfer better on detection task
and similarly on classification over classes "unseen" during pre-training, when
compared to the supervised case.
  This also shows that the process of image discretization into visual words
can provide the basis for very powerful self-supervised approaches in the image
domain, thus allowing further connections to be made to related methods from
the NLP domain that have been extremely successful so far.

Title: ZoomCount: A Zooming Mechanism for Crowd Counting in Static Images
Authors: Usman Sajid, Hasan Sajid, Hongcheng Wang, Guanghui Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  This paper proposes a novel approach for crowd counting in low to high
density scenarios in static images. Current approaches cannot handle huge crowd
diversity well and thus perform poorly in extreme cases, where the crowd
density in different regions of an image is either too low or too high, leading
to crowd underestimation or overestimation. The proposed solution is based on
the observation that detecting and handling such extreme cases in a specialized
way leads to better crowd estimation. Additionally, existing methods find it
hard to differentiate between the actual crowd and the cluttered background
regions, resulting in further count overestimation. To address these issues, we
propose a simple yet effective modular approach, where an input image is first
subdivided into fixed-size patches and then fed to a four-way classification
module labeling each image patch as low, medium, high-dense or no-crowd. This
module also provides a count for each label, which is then analyzed via a
specifically devised novel decision module to decide whether the image belongs
to any of the two extreme cases (very low or very high density) or a normal
case. Images, specified as high- or low-density extreme or a normal case, pass
through dedicated zooming or normal patch-making blocks respectively before
routing to the regressor in the form of fixed-size patches for crowd estimate.
Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks under most of the
evaluation criteria.

  Face recognition of vehicle occupants through windshields in unconstrained
environments poses a number of unique challenges ranging from glare, poor
illumination, driver pose and motion blur. In this paper, we further develop
the hardware and software components of a custom vehicle imaging system to
better overcome these challenges. After the build out of a physical prototype
system that performs High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging, we collect a small
dataset of through-windshield image captures of known drivers. We then
re-formulate the classical Mertens-Kautz-Van Reeth HDR fusion algorithm as a
pre-initialized neural network, which we name the Mertens Unrolled Network
(MU-Net), for the purpose of fine-tuning the HDR output of through-windshield
images. Reconstructed faces from this novel HDR method are then evaluated and
compared against other traditional and experimental HDR methods in a
pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) facial recognition pipeline, verifying the
efficacy of our approach.

Comments: This work is accepted in CVPR 2020
\\
  Existing works reduce motion blur and up-convert frame rate through two
separate ways, including frame deblurring and frame interpolation. However, few
studies have approached the joint video enhancement problem, namely
synthesizing high-frame-rate clear results from low-frame-rate blurry inputs.
In this paper, we propose a blurry video frame interpolation method to reduce
motion blur and up-convert frame rate simultaneously. Specifically, we develop
a pyramid module to cyclically synthesize clear intermediate frames. The
pyramid module features adjustable spatial receptive field and temporal scope,
thus contributing to controllable computational complexity and restoration
ability. Besides, we propose an inter-pyramid recurrent module to connect
sequential models to exploit the temporal relationship. The pyramid module
integrates a recurrent module, thus can iteratively synthesize temporally
smooth results without significantly increasing the model size. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method performs favorably against
state-of-the-art methods.

\\
  Automated methods for breast cancer detection have focused on 2D mammography
and have largely ignored 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), which is
frequently used in clinical practice. The two key challenges in developing
automated methods for DBT classification are handling the variable number of
slices and retaining slice-to-slice changes. We propose a novel deep 2D
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for DBT classification that
simultaneously overcomes both challenges. Our approach operates on the full
volume, regardless of the number of slices, and allows the use of pre-trained
2D CNNs for feature extraction, which is important given the limited amount of
annotated training data. In an extensive evaluation on a real-world clinical
dataset, our approach achieves 0.854 auROC, which is 28.80% higher than
approaches based on 3D CNNs. We also find that these improvements are stable
across a range of model configurations.

Title: Semantically-Guided Representation Learning for Self-Supervised

Comments: Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Learning
  Representations (ICLR 2020)
\\
  Self-supervised learning is showing great promise for monocular depth
estimation, using geometry as the only source of supervision. Depth networks
are indeed capable of learning representations that relate visual appearance to
3D properties by implicitly leveraging category-level patterns. In this work we
investigate how to leverage more directly this semantic structure to guide
geometric representation learning, while remaining in the self-supervised
regime. Instead of using semantic labels and proxy losses in a multi-task
approach, we propose a new architecture leveraging fixed pretrained semantic
segmentation networks to guide self-supervised representation learning via
pixel-adaptive convolutions. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training
process to overcome a common semantic bias on dynamic objects via resampling.
Our method improves upon the state of the art for self-supervised monocular
depth prediction over all pixels, fine-grained details, and per semantic
categories.

Title: Visual Camera Re-Localization from RGB and RGB-D Images Using DSAC
Authors: Eric Brachmann and Carsten Rother
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We describe a learning-based system that estimates the camera position and
orientation from a single input image relative to a known environment. The
system is flexible w.r.t. the amount of information available at test and at
training time, catering to different applications. Input images can be RGB-D or
RGB, and a 3D model of the environment can be utilized for training but is not
necessary. In the minimal case, our system requires only RGB images and ground
truth poses at training time, and it requires only a single RGB image at test
time. The framework consists of a deep neural network and fully differentiable
pose optimization. The neural network predicts so called scene coordinates,
i.e. dense correspondences between the input image and 3D scene space of the
environment. The pose optimization implements robust fitting of pose parameters
using differentiable RANSAC (DSAC) to facilitate end-to-end training. The
system, an extension of DSAC++ and referred to as DSAC*, achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy an various public datasets for RGB-based
re-localization, and competitive accuracy for RGB-D based re-localization.

Title: Measures to Evaluate Generative Adversarial Networks Based on Direct
  Analysis of Generated Images
Authors: Shuyue Guan, Murray H. Loew
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures
\\
  The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a state-of-the-art technique in
the field of deep learning. A number of recent papers address the theory and
applications of GANs in various fields of image processing. Fewer studies,
however, have directly evaluated GAN outputs. Those that have been conducted
focused on using classification performance (e.g., Inception Score) and
statistical metrics (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Distance). , Here, we consider a
fundamental way to evaluate GANs by directly analyzing the images they
generate, instead of using them as inputs to other classifiers. We characterize
the performance of a GAN as an image generator according to three aspects: 1)
Creativity: non-duplication of the real images. 2) Inheritance: generated
images should have the same style, which retains key features of the real
images. 3) Diversity: generated images are different from each other. A GAN
should not generate a few different images repeatedly. Based on the three
aspects of ideal GANs, we have designed two measures:
Creativity-Inheritance-Diversity (CID) index and Likeness Score (LS) to
evaluate GAN performance, and have applied them to evaluate three typical GANs.
We compared our proposed measures with three commonly used GAN evaluation
methods: Inception Score (IS), Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and 1-Nearest
Neighbor classifier (1NNC). In addition, we discuss how these evaluations could
help us deepen our understanding of GANs and improve their performance.

Title: No computation without representation: Avoiding data and algorithm
  biases through diversity
Authors: Caitlin Kuhlman, Latifa Jackson, Rumi Chunara
Categories: cs.CY
\\
  The emergence and growth of research on issues of ethics in AI, and in
particular algorithmic fairness, has roots in an essential observation that
structural inequalities in society are reflected in the data used to train
predictive models and in the design of objective functions. While research
aiming to mitigate these issues is inherently interdisciplinary, the design of
unbiased algorithms and fair socio-technical systems are key desired outcomes
which depend on practitioners from the fields of data science and computing.
However, these computing fields broadly also suffer from the same
under-representation issues that are found in the datasets we analyze. This
disconnect affects the design of both the desired outcomes and metrics by which
we measure success. If the ethical AI research community accepts this, we
tacitly endorse the status quo and contradict the goals of non-discrimination
and equity which work on algorithmic fairness, accountability, and transparency
seeks to address. Therefore, we advocate in this work for diversifying
computing as a core priority of the field and our efforts to achieve ethical AI
practices. We draw connections between the lack of diversity within academic
and professional computing fields and the type and breadth of the biases
encountered in datasets, machine learning models, problem formulations, and
interpretation of results. Examining the current fairness/ethics in AI
literature, we highlight cases where this lack of diverse perspectives has been
foundational to the inequity in treatment of underrepresented and protected
group data. We also look to other professional communities, such as in law and
health, where disparities have been reduced both in the educational diversity
of trainees and among professional practices. We use these lessons to develop
recommendations that provide concrete steps for the computing community to
increase diversity.

Title: SWARM: Adaptive Load Balancing in Distributed Streaming Systems for Big
  Spatial Data
Authors: Anas Daghistani, Walid G. Aref, Arif Ghafoor, and Ahmed R. Mahmood
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  The proliferation of GPS-enabled devices has led to the development of
numerous location-based services. These services need to process massive
amounts of spatial data in real-time. The current scale of spatial data cannot
be handled using centralized systems. This has led to the development of
distributed spatial streaming systems. Existing systems are using static
spatial partitioning to distribute the workload. In contrast, the real-time
streamed spatial data follows non-uniform spatial distributions that are
continuously changing over time. Distributed spatial streaming systems need to
react to the changes in the distribution of spatial data and queries. This
paper introduces SWARM, a light-weight adaptivity protocol that continuously
monitors the data and query workloads across the distributed processes of the
spatial data streaming system, and redistribute and rebalance the workloads
soon as performance bottlenecks get detected. SWARM is able to handle multiple
query-execution and data-persistence models. A distributed streaming system can
directly use SWARM to adaptively rebalance the system's workload among its
machines with minimal changes to the original code of the underlying spatial
application. Extensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic
datasets illustrate that, on average, SWARM achieves 200% improvement over a
static grid partitioning that is determined based on observing a limited
history of the data and query workloads. Moreover, SWARM reduces execution
latency on average 4x compared with the other technique.

Title: Black or White? How to Develop an AutoTuner for Memory-based Analytics
  [Extended Version]
Authors: Mayuresh Kunjir and Shivnath Babu
Categories: cs.DC cs.DB
Comments: Main version in ACM SIGMOD 2020

DOI: 10.1145/3318464.3380591
\\
  There is a lot of interest today in building autonomous (or, self-driving)
data processing systems. An emerging school of thought is to leverage AI-driven
"black box" algorithms for this purpose. In this paper, we present a contrarian
view. We study the problem of autotuning the memory allocation for applications
running on modern distributed data processing systems. For this problem, we
show that an empirically-driven "white-box" algorithm, called RelM, that we
have developed provides a close-to-optimal tuning at a fraction of the
overheads compared to state-of-the-art AI-driven "black box" algorithms,
namely, Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Deep Distributed Policy Gradient (DDPG).
The main reason for RelM's superior performance is that the memory management
in modern memory-based data analytics systems is an interplay of algorithms at
multiple levels: (i) at the resource-management level across various containers
allocated by resource managers like Kubernetes and YARN, (ii) at the container
level among the OS, pods, and processes such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
(iii) at the application level for caching, aggregation, data shuffles, and
application data structures, and (iv) at the JVM level across various pools
such as the Young and Old Generation. RelM understands these interactions and
uses them in building an analytical solution to autotune the memory management
knobs. In another contribution, called GBO, we use the RelM's analytical models
to speed up Bayesian Optimization. Through an evaluation based on Apache Spark,
we showcase that RelM's recommendations are significantly better than what
commonly-used Spark deployments provide, and are close to the ones obtained by
brute-force exploration; while GBO provides optimality guarantees for a higher,

  In recent years, with the slowing down of Moore's law, utilization of
hardware other than CPU such as GPU or FPGA is increasing. However, when using
heterogeneous hardware other than CPUs, barriers of technical skills such as
CUDA and HDL are high. Based on that, I have proposed environment adaptive
software that enables automatic conversion, configuration, and high-performance
operation of once written code, according to the hardware to be placed. Partly
of the offloading to the GPU and FPGA was automated previously. In this paper,
I improve and propose a previous automatic GPU offloading method to expand
applicapable software and enhance performances more. I evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in multiple applications.

  The current challenges in technology scaling are pushing the semiconductor
industry towards hardware specialization, creating a proliferation of
heterogeneous systems-on-chip, delivering orders of magnitude performance and
power benefits compared to traditional general-purpose architectures. This
transition is getting a significant boost with the advent of RISC-V with its
unique modular and extensible ISA, allowing a wide range of low-cost processor
designs for various target applications. In addition, OpenCL is currently the
most widely adopted programming framework for heterogeneous platforms available
on mainstream CPUs, GPUs, as well as FPGAs and custom DSP. In this work, we
present Vortex, a RISC-V General-Purpose GPU that supports OpenCL. Vortex
implements a SIMT architecture with a minimal ISA extension to RISC-V that
enables the execution of OpenCL programs. We also extended OpenCL runtime
framework to use the new ISA. We evaluate this design using 15nm technology. We
also show the performance and energy numbers of running them with a subset of
benchmarks from the Rodinia Benchmark suite.

Title: Who pays? Comparing cost sharing models for a Gold Open Access
  publication environment
Authors: Andre Bruns, Christine Rimmert, Niels Taubert
Categories: cs.DL
Comments: 26 pages
\\
  The article focuses on possible financial effects of the transformation
towards Gold Open Access publishing based on article processing charges and
studies an aspect that has so far been overlooked: Do possible cost sharing
models lead to the same overall expenses or do they result in different
financial burdens for the research institutions involved? It takes the current
state of Gold OA publishing as a starting point, develops five possible models
of attributing costs based on different author roles, number of authors and
author-address-combinations. The analysis of the distributional effects of the
application of the different models shows that all models result in similar
expenditures for the overwhelming majority of institutions. Still, there are
some research institutions where the difference between most and least
expensive model results in a considerable amount of money. Given that the model
calculation only considers publications that are Open Access and where all
authors come from Germany, it is likely that different cost sharing models will
become an issue in the debate on how to shoulder a possible large scale
transformation towards Open Access based on publication fees.

Title: Trapping problem on star-type graphs with applications
Authors: Fei Ma, Ping Wang
Categories: cs.DM
\\
  The trapping problem on graph (or network) as a typical focus of great
interest has attracted more attention from various science fields, including
applied mathematics and theoretical computer science, in the past. Here, we
first study this problem on an arbitrary graph and obtain the closed-form
formula for calculating the theoretical lower bound of average trapping time
($ATT$), a quantity that evaluates trapping efficiency of graph in question,
using methods from spectral graph theory. The results show that the choice of
the trap's location has a significant influence on determining parameter $ATT$.
As a result, we consider the problem on star-type graphs, a special graph
family which will be introduced shortly, with a single trap $\theta$ and then
derive using probability generating functions the exact solution to quantity
$ATT$. Our results suggest that all star-type graphs have most optimal trapping
efficiency by achieving the corresponding theoretical lower bounds of $ATT$.
More importantly, we further find that a given graph is most optimal only if
its underlying structure is star-type when considering the trapping problem. At
meantime, we also provide the upper bounds for $ATT$ of several graphs in terms
of well-known Holder inequality, some of which are sharp. By using all the
consequences obtained, one may be able to design better control scheme for
complex networks from respect of trapping efficiency, to some extent, which are
in well agreement with many other previous thoughts.

Title: Edge corona product as an approach to modeling complex simplical
  networks
Authors: Yucheng Wang, Yuhao Yi, Wanyue Xu, Zhongzhi Zhang
Categories: cs.DM cs.SI
Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Many graph products have been applied to generate complex networks with
striking properties observed in real-world systems. In this paper, we propose a
simple generative model for simplicial networks by iteratively using edge
corona product. We present a comprehensive analysis of the structural
properties of the network model, including degree distribution, diameter,
clustering coefficient, as well as distribution of clique sizes, obtaining
explicit expressions for these relevant quantities, which agree with the
behaviors found in diverse real networks. Moreover, we obtain exact expressions
for all the eigenvalues and their associated multiplicities of the normalized
Laplacian matrix, based on which we derive explicit formulas for mixing time,
mean hitting time and the number of spanning trees. Thus, as previous models
generated by other graph products, our model is also an exactly solvable one,
whose structural properties can be analytically treated. More interestingly,
the expressions for the spectra of our model are also exactly determined, which
is sharp contrast to previous models whose spectra can only be given
recursively at most. This advantage makes our model a good test-bed and an
ideal substrate network for studying dynamical processes, especially those
closely related to the spectra of normalized Laplacian matrix, in order to
uncover the influences of simplicial structure on these processes.

Title: The Complexity of Finding Tangles
Authors: Oksana Firman, Stefan Felsner, Philipp Kindermann, Alexander Ravsky,
  Alexander Wolff, Johannes Zink
Categories: cs.DM
\\
  We study the following combinatorial problem. Given a set of $n$ y-monotone
curves, which we call wires, a tangle determines the order of the wires on a
number of horizontal layers such that the orders of the wires on any two
consecutive layers differ only in swaps of neighboring wires. Given a multiset
$L$ of swaps (that is, unordered pairs of wires) and an initial order of the
wires, a tangle realizes $L$ if each pair of wires changes its order exactly as
many times as specified by $L$. Finding a tangle that realizes a given multiset
of swaps and uses the least number of layers is known to be NP-hard. We show
that it is even NP-hard to decide if a realizing tangle exists.

Title: Polynomial algorithms for p-dispersion problems in a 2d Pareto Front
Authors: Nicolas Dupin
Categories: cs.DS cs.CC cs.CG cs.DM
\\
  Having many best compromise solutions for bi-objective optimization problems,
this paper studies p-dispersion problems to select $p\geqslant 2$
representative points in the Pareto Front(PF). Four standard variants of
p-dispersion are considered. A novel variant, denoted Max-Sum-Neighbor
p-dispersion, is introduced for the specific case of a 2d PF. Firstly, it is
proven that $2$-dispersion and $3$-dispersion problems are solvable in $O(n)$
time in a 2d PF. Secondly, dynamic programming algorithms are designed for
three p-dispersion variants, proving polynomial complexities in a 2d PF. The
Max-Min p-dispersion problem is proven solvable in $O(pn\log n)$ time and
$O(n)$ memory space. The Max-Sum-Min p-dispersion problem is proven solvable in
$O(pn^3)$ time and $O(pn^2)$ space. The Max-Sum-Neighbor p-dispersion problem
is proven solvable in $O(pn^2)$ time and $O(pn)$ space. Complexity results and
parallelization issues are discussed in regards to practical implementation.

Title: Stochastic Matching with Few Queries: $(1-\varepsilon)$ Approximation
Authors: Soheil Behnezhad, Mahsa Derakhshan, MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi
Categories: cs.DS cs.CC cs.DC cs.DM
Comments: A version of this paper is to appear at STOC 2020
\\
  Suppose that we are given an arbitrary graph $G=(V, E)$ and know that each
edge in $E$ is going to be realized independently with some probability $p$.
The goal in the stochastic matching problem is to pick a sparse subgraph $Q$ of
$G$ such that the realized edges in $Q$, in expectation, include a matching
that is approximately as large as the maximum matching among the realized edges
of $G$. The maximum degree of $Q$ can depend on $p$, but not on the size of
$G$.
  This problem has been subject to extensive studies over the years and the
approximation factor has been improved from $0.5$ to $0.5001$ to $0.6568$ and
eventually to $2/3$. In this work, we analyze a natural sampling-based
algorithm and show that it can obtain all the way up to $(1-\epsilon)$
approximation, for any constant $\epsilon > 0$.
  A key and of possible independent interest component of our analysis is an
algorithm that constructs a matching on a stochastic graph, which among some
other important properties, guarantees that each vertex is matched
independently from the vertices that are sufficiently far. This allows us to
bypass a previously known barrier towards achieving $(1-\epsilon)$
approximation based on existence of dense Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi graphs.

Title: The Complexity of Contracts
Authors: Paul Duetting, Tim Roughgarden, Inbal Talgam-Cohen
Categories: cs.DS cs.GT
Comments: An extended abstract appeared in Proceedings of the ACM-SIAM
  Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2020 (SODA'20)
\\
  We initiate the study of computing (near-)optimal contracts in succinctly
representable principal-agent settings. Here optimality means maximizing the
principal's expected payoff over all incentive-compatible contracts---known in
economics as "second-best" solutions. We also study a natural relaxation to
approximately incentive-compatible contracts.
  We focus on principal-agent settings with succinctly described (and
exponentially large) outcome spaces. We show that the computational complexity
of computing a near-optimal contract depends fundamentally on the number of
agent actions. For settings with a constant number of actions, we present a
fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the separation oracle of
the dual of the problem of minimizing the principal's payment to the agent, and
use this subroutine to efficiently compute a delta-incentive-compatible
(delta-IC) contract whose expected payoff matches or surpasses that of the
optimal IC contract.
  With an arbitrary number of actions, we prove that the problem is hard to
approximate within any constant c. This inapproximability result holds even for
delta-IC contracts where delta is a sufficiently rapidly-decaying function of
c. On the positive side, we show that simple linear delta-IC contracts with
constant delta are sufficient to achieve a constant-factor approximation of the
"first-best" (full-welfare-extracting) solution, and that such a contract can
be computed in polynomial time.

  We present a compact data structure to represent both the duration and length
of homogeneous segments of trajectories from moving objects in a way that, as a
data warehouse, it allows us to efficiently answer cumulative queries. The
division of trajectories into relevant segments has been studied in the
literature under the topic of Trajectory Segmentation. In this paper, we design
a data structure to compactly represent them and the algorithms to answer the
more relevant queries. We experimentally evaluate our proposal in the real
context of an enterprise with mobile workers (truck drivers) where we aim at
analyzing the time they spend in different activities. To test our proposal
under higher stress conditions we generated a huge amount of synthetic
realistic trajectories and evaluated our system with those data to have a good
idea about its space needs and its efficiency when answering different types of
queries.

Title: Random-Order Models

Categories: cs.DS cs.GT
Comments: Preprint of Chapter 11 in "Beyond the Worst-Case Analysis of
  Algorithms", Cambridge University Press, 2020
\\
  This chapter introduces the \emph{random-order model} in online algorithms.
In this model, the input is chosen by an adversary, then randomly permuted
before being presented to the algorithm. This reshuffling often weakens the
power of the adversary and allows for improved algorithmic guarantees. We show
such improvements for two broad classes of problems: packing problems where we
must pick a constrained set of items to maximize total value, and covering
problems where we must satisfy given requirements at minimum total cost. We
also discuss how random-order model relates to other stochastic models used for
non-worst-case competitive analysis.

Title: Is my Neural Network Neuromorphic? Taxonomy, Recent Trends and Future
  Directions in Neuromorphic Engineering
Authors: Sumon Kumar Bose, Jyotibdha Acharya, and Arindam Basu
Categories: cs.ET cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML
Comments: 6 pages
\\
  In this paper, we review recent work published over the last 3 years under
the umbrella of Neuromorphic engineering to analyze what are the common
features among such systems. We see that there is no clear consensus but each
system has one or more of the following features:(1) Analog computing (2) Non
vonNeumann Architecture and low-precision digital processing (3) Spiking Neural
Networks (SNN) with components closely related to biology. We compare recent
machine learning accelerator chips to show that indeed analog processing and
reduced bit precision architectures have best throughput, energy and area
efficiencies. However, pure digital architectures can also achieve quite high
efficiencies by just adopting a non von-Neumann architecture. Given the design
automation tools for digital hardware design, it raises a question on the
likelihood of adoption of analog processing in the near future for industrial
designs. Next, we argue about the importance of defining standards and choosing
proper benchmarks for the progress of neuromorphic system designs and propose
some desired characteristics of such benchmarks. Finally, we show brain-machine
interfaces as a potential task that fulfils all the criteria of such
benchmarks.

Title: Tree Polymatrix Games are PPAD-hard
Authors: Argyrios Deligkas and John Fearnley and Rahul Savani
Categories: cs.GT cs.CC
\\
  We prove that it is PPAD-hard to compute a Nash equilibrium in a tree
polymatrix game with twenty actions per player. This is the first PPAD hardness
result for a game with a constant number of actions per player where the
interaction graph is acyclic. Along the way we show PPAD-hardness for finding
an $\epsilon$-fixed point of a 2D LinearFIXP instance, when $\epsilon$ is any
constant less than $(\sqrt{2} - 1)/2 \approx 0.2071$. This lifts the hardness
regime from polynomially small approximations in $k$-dimensions to constant
approximations in two-dimensions, and our constant is substantial when compared
to the trivial upper bound of $0.5$.

  Neurophysiological studies are typically conducted in laboratories with
limited ecological validity, scalability, and generalizability of findings.
This is a significant challenge for the development of brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs), which ultimately need to function in unsupervised settings
on consumer-grade hardware. We introduce MYND: A smartphone application for
unsupervised evaluation of BCI control strategies with consumer-grade hardware.
Subjects are guided through experiment selection, hardware fitting, recording,
and data upload in order to self-administer multi-day studies that include
neurophysiological recordings and questionnaires. As a use case, we evaluate
the BCI control strategies "Positive memories" and "Music imagery" in a
realistic scenario by combining MYND with a four-channel electroencephalogram
(EEG). Thirty subjects recorded 70 hours of EEG data with the system at home.
On average, subjects were able to fit the headset in less than one minute and
retained a signal quality of 90.2% during recordings. Neural activity in both
control strategies could be decoded with an offline accuracy of 68.5% and 64.0%
across all days. The repeated, unsupervised execution of the same strategy
affected performance, which could be tackled by implementing feedback to let
subjects switch between strategies or devise new strategies with the platform.

Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Despite their name and stated goal, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) often
introduce users to new security and privacy threats. For example, recent
studies have shown that VPNs can leak user traffic to third-party trackers. In
light of these developments, we set out to understand how and why a highly
educated population, university students, chooses and uses VPNs, whether they
are aware of data leakages by VPNs, and how their awareness and attitudes about
VPNs affects their decisions to use them. To answer these questions, we
conducted 32 in-person interviews, a survey with 350 respondents, and a
controlled lab study with 11 users, all university students in the United
States. We found that, surprisingly, access, cost, and performance trumped
privacy concerns for many users; many users even expected that their VPNs were
collecting data about them. Even presenting information to users about the data
leaked from VPNs to third-party trackers had little effect on their attitudes,
suggesting that more work is needed to improve ways to show users what can be
inferred from data collected about them.

Title: Impact of Information Placement and User Representations in VR on
  Performance and Embodiment

Categories: cs.HC
ACM-class: H.5.m
\\
  Human sensory processing is sensitive to the proximity of stimuli to the
body. It is therefore plausible that these perceptual mechanisms also modulate
the detectability of content in VR, depending on its location. We evaluate this
in a user study and further explore the impact of the user's representation
during interaction. We also analyze how embodiment and motor performance are
influenced by these factors. In a dual-task paradigm, participants executed a
motor task, either through virtual hands, virtual controllers, or a keyboard.
Simultaneously, they detected visual stimuli appearing in different locations.
We found that while actively performing a motor task in the virtual
environment, performance in detecting additional visual stimuli is higher when
presented near the user's body. This effect is independent of how the user is
represented and only occurs when the user is also engaged in a secondary task.
We further found improved motor performance and increased embodiment when
interacting through virtual tools and hands in VR, compared to interacting with
a keyboard. This study contributes to better understanding the detectability of
visual content in VR, depending on its location, as well as the impact of
different user representations on information processing, embodiment, and motor
performance.

Title: Impact of Visuomotor Feedback on the Embodiment of Virtual Hands
  Detached from the Body
Authors: Sofia Seinfeld and J\"org M\"uller
Categories: cs.HC
ACM-class: H.5.m
\\
  It has been shown that mere observation of body discontinuity leads to
diminished body ownership and threat-related physiological responding. However,
the impact of body discontinuity has mainly been investigated in conditions
where participants observe a collocated static virtual body from a first-person
perspective. The present study further explored the influence of body
discontinuity in the sense of embodiment, when rich visuomotor feedback between
the real and a fake virtual body was provided. In two experiments, we evaluated
body ownership, motor performance, and physiological responding to a threat,
when participants interacted in virtual reality either using virtual hands
connected or disconnected from the rest of the artificial body. We found that
even under the presence of congruent visuomotor feedback, mere observation of
body discontinuity resulted in diminished embodiment. Conversely, the visual
disconnection of the artificial hands did not significantly influence
physiological responding to a virtual threat and motor performance in a quick
task. These results are in accordance with past evidence, indicating that
observation of body discontinuity negatively impacts the sense of embodiment.
However, we have also found that on a physiological and motor level, visuomotor
feedback seems to override incongruent morphological and visual information in
relation to the body.

\\
  Advances in multimodal characterization methods fuel a generation of
increasing immense hyper-dimensional datasets. Color mapping is employed for
conveying higher dimensional data in two-dimensional (2D) representations for
human consumption without relying on multiple projections. How one constructs
these color maps, however, critically affects how accurately one perceives
data. For simple scalar fields, perceptually uniform color maps and color
selection have been shown to improve data readability and interpretation across
research fields. Here we review core concepts underlying the design of
perceptually uniform color map and extend the concepts from scalar fields to
two-dimensional vector fields and three-component composition fields frequently
found in materials-chemistry research to enable high-fidelity visualization. We
develop the software tools PAPUC and CMPUC to enable researchers to utilize
these colorimetry principles and employ perceptually uniform color spaces for
rigorously meaningful color mapping of higher dimensional data representations.
Last, we demonstrate how these approaches deliver immediate improvements in
data readability and interpretation in microscopies and spectroscopies
routinely used in discerning materials structure, chemistry, and properties.

Title: Opportunities of a Machine Learning-based Decision Support System for
  Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment
Authors: Min Hun Lee, Daniel P. Siewiorek, Asim Smailagic, Alexandre
  Bernardino, and Sergi Berm\'udez i Badia
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  Rehabilitation assessment is critical to determine an adequate intervention
for a patient. However, the current practices of assessment mainly rely on
therapist's experience, and assessment is infrequently executed due to the
limited availability of a therapist. In this paper, we identified the needs of
therapists to assess patient's functional abilities (e.g. alternative
perspective on assessment with quantitative information on patient's exercise
motions). As a result, we developed an intelligent decision support system that
can identify salient features of assessment using reinforcement learning to
assess the quality of motion and summarize patient specific analysis. We
evaluated this system with seven therapists using the dataset from 15 patient
performing three exercises. The evaluation demonstrates that our system is
preferred over a traditional system without analysis while presenting more
useful information and significantly increasing the agreement over therapists'
evaluation from 0.6600 to 0.7108 F1-scores ($p <0.05$). We discuss the
importance of presenting contextually relevant and salient information and
adaptation to develop a human and machine collaborative decision making system.

\\
  Push-buttons provide rich haptic feedback during a press via mechanical
structures. While different buttons have varying haptic qualities, few works
have attempted to dynamically render such tactility, which limits designers
from freely exploring buttons' haptic design. We extend the typical
force-displacement (FD) model with vibration (V) and velocity-dependence
characteristics (V) to form a novel FDVV model. We then introduce Press'Em, a
3D-printed prototype capable of simulating button tactility based on FDVV
models. To drive Press'Em, an end-to-end simulation pipeline is presented that
covers (1) capturing any physical buttons, (2) controlling the actuation
signals, and (3) simulating the tactility. Our system can go beyond replicating
existing buttons to enable designers to emulate and test non-existent ones with
desired haptic properties. Press'Em aims to be a tool for future research to
better understand and iterate over button designs.

Title: A hypergeometric test interpretation of a common tf-idf variant
Authors: Paul Sheridan and Mikael Onsj\"o
Categories: cs.IR
Comments: 26 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Term frequency-inverse document frequency, or tf-idf for short, is a
numerical measure that is widely used in information retrieval to quantify the
importance of a term of interest in one out of many documents. While tf-idf was
originally proposed as a heuristic, much work has been devoted over the years
to placing it on a solid theoretical foundation. Following in this tradition,
we here advance the first justification for tf-idf that is grounded in
statistical hypothesis testing. More precisely, we first show that the
hypergeometric test from classical statistics corresponds well with a common
tf-idf variant on selected real-data information retrieval tasks. Then we set
forth a mathematical argument that suggests the tf-idf variant functions as an
approximation to the hypergeometric test (and vice versa). The hypergeometric
test interpretation of this common tf-idf variant equips the working
statistician with a ready explanation of tf-idf's long-established
effectiveness.

Title: HAM: Hybrid Associations Model with Pooling for Sequential
  Recommendation
Authors: Bo Peng, Zhiyun Ren, Srinivasan Parthasarathy and Xia Ning
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  We developed a hybrid associations model (HAM) to generate sequential
recommendations using two factors: 1) users' long-term preferences and 2)
sequential, both high-order and low-order association patterns in the users'
most recent purchases/ratings. HAM uses simplistic pooling to represent a set
of items in the associations. We compare HAM with three the most recent,
state-of-the-art methods on six public benchmark datasets in three different
experimental settings. Our experimental results demonstrate that HAM
significantly outperforms the state of the art in all the experimental
settings, with an improvement as high as 27.90%.

Title: Dataset Search In Biodiversity Research: Do Metadata In Data
  Repositories Reflect Scholarly Information Needs?

\\
  The increasing amount of research data provides the opportunity to link and
integrate data to create novel hypotheses, to repeat experiments or to compare
recent data to data collected at a different time or place. However, recent
studies have shown that retrieving relevant data for data reuse is a
time-consuming task in daily research practice. In this study, we explore what
hampers dataset retrieval in biodiversity research, a field that produces a
large amount of heterogeneous data. We analyze the primary source in dataset
search - metadata - and determine if they reflect scholarly search interests.
We examine if metadata standards provide elements corresponding to search
interests, we inspect if selected data repositories use metadata standards
representing scholarly interests, and we determine how many fields of the
metadata standards used are filled. To determine search interests in
biodiversity research, we gathered 169 questions that researchers aimed to
answer with the help of retrieved data, identified biological entities and
grouped them into 13 categories. Our findings indicate that environments,
materials and chemicals, species, biological and chemical processes, locations,
data parameters and data types are important search interests in biodiversity
research. The comparison with existing metadata standards shows that
domain-specific standards cover search interests quite well, whereas general
standards do not explicitly contain elements that reflect search interests. We
inspect metadata from five large data repositories. Our results confirm that
metadata currently poorly reflect search interests in biodiversity research.
>From these findings, we derive recommendations for researchers and data
repositories how to bridge the gap between search interest and metadata
provided.

Title: Massive MIMO Asymptotics for Ray-Based Propagation Channels
Authors: Shuang Li, Peter Smith, Pawel Dmochowski, Harsh Tataria, Michail
  Matthaiou, and Jingwei Yin
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Favorable propagation (FP) and channel hardening (CH) are desired properties
in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To date, these
properties have primarily been analyzed for classical \textit{statistical}
channel models, or \textit{ray-based} models with very specific angular
parameters and distributions. This paper presents a thorough mathematical
analysis of the asymptotic system behavior for ray-based channels with
\textit{arbitrary} ray distributions, and considers \textit{two} types of
antenna array structures at the cellular base station: a uniform linear array
(ULA) and a uniform planar array (UPA). In addition to FP and channel
hardening, we analyze the \textit{large system potential} (LSP) which measures
the asymptotic ratio of the expected power in the desired channel to the
expected total interference power when both the antenna and user numbers grow.
LSP is said to hold when this ratio converges to a positive constant. The
results demonstrate that while FP is guaranteed in ray-based channels, CH may
or may not occur depending on the nature of the model. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that LSP will not normally hold as the expected interference power
grows logarithmically for both ULAs and UPAs relative to the power in the
desired channel as the system size increases. Nevertheless, we identify some
fundamental and attractive properties of massive MIMO in this limiting regime.

Title: Full Duplex Hybrid A/D Beamforming with Reduced Complexity Multi-Tap
  Analog Cancellation

Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to the IEEE International Workshop on
  Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC), 26-29 May
  2020, Atlanta, USA
\\
  Although the hardware complexity of the analog self-interference canceller in
emerging full duplex Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) designs does not
scale with the number of transceiver antennas, exploiting the benefits of
analog cancellation in massive MIMO systems with dozens of antennas is still
quite impractical. Hybrid Analog and Digital (A/D) beamforming architectures
have been lately considered as a candidate technology for realizing massive
MIMO transceivers with very large number of antenna elements, but with much
fewer numbers of Radio Frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, we present a novel
architecture for full duplex hybrid A/D transceivers including multi-tap analog
cancellation with reduced number of taps and simple multiplexers for efficient
signal routing among the transceiver RF chains. Capitalizing on the proposed
transceiver architecture, we present a joint design of analog cancellation and
A/D beamforming with the objective to maximize the full duplex rate
performance. Representative computer simulation results on a millimeter wave
channel model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and
algorithmic framework for enabling simultaneous uplink and downlink
communications with reduced complexity analog cancellation.

Title: On the Capacity of Fractal D2D Social Networks with Hierarchical
  Communications
Authors: Ying Chen, Rongpeng Li, Zhifeng Zhao, Honggang Zhang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1708.04585
\\
  The maximum capacity of fractal D2D (device-to-device) social networks with
both direct and hierarchical communications is studied in this paper.
Specifically, the fractal networks are characterized by the direct social
connection and the self-similarity. Firstly, for a fractal D2D social network
with direct social communications, it is proved that the maximum capacity is $
\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n\log n}}\right) $ if a user communicates with one
of his/her direct contacts randomly, where $ n $ denotes the total number of
users in the network, and it can reach up to $ \Theta\left(\frac{1}{\log
n}\right) $ if any pair of social contacts with distance $ d $ communicate
according to the probability in proportion to $ d^{-\beta} $. Secondly, since
users might get in touch with others without direct social connections through
the inter-connected multiple users, the fractal D2D social network with these
hierarchical communications is studied as well, and the related capacity is
further derived. Our results show that this capacity is mainly affected by the
correlation exponent $\epsilon$ of the fractal structure. The capacity is
reduced in proportional to $ \frac{1}{{\log n}} $ if $ 2<\epsilon<3 $, while
the reduction coefficient is $ \frac{1}{n} $ if $ \epsilon>3 $.

Title: Large intelligent surface (LIS)-based communications: New features and
  system layouts
Authors: Jide Yuan, Hien Quoc Ngo and Michail Matthaiou
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, to appear at IEEE ICC 2020
\\
  The concept of large intelligent surface (LIS)-based communication has
recently attracted increasing research attention, where a LIS is considered as
an antenna array whose entire surface area is available for radio signal
transmission and reception. In order to provide a fundamental understanding of
LIS-based communication, this paper studies the uplink performance of LIS-based
communication with matched filtering in the presence of a line-of-sight
channel. We first study the new features introduced by LIS. In particular, the
array gain, spatial resolution, and the capability of interference suppression
are theoretically presented and characterized. Then, we study two possible LIS
system layouts, i.e., centralized LIS (C-LIS) and distributed LIS (D-LIS), and
propose a user association scheme aiming to maximize the minimum user spectral
efficiency (SE). Simulation results compare the achievable SE between two
system layouts. We observe that the proposed user association algorithm
significantly improves the performance of D-LIS, and with the help of it, the
per-user achievable SE in D-LIS outperforms that in C-LIS in most considered
scenarios.

Title: Genetic algorithms with permutation-based representation for computing
  the distance of linear codes
Authors: M. P. Cu\'ellar, J. G\'omez-Torrecillas, F. J. Lobillo and G. Navarro
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Finding the minimum distance of linear codes is an NP-hard problem.
Traditionally, this computation has been addressed by means of the design of
algorithms that find, by a clever exhaustive search, a linear combination of
some generating matrix rows that provides a codeword with minimum weight.
Therefore, as the dimension of the code or the size of the underlying finite
field increase, so it does exponentially the run time. In this work, we prove
that, given a generating matrix, there exists a column permutation which leads
to a reduced row echelon form containing a row whose weight is the code
distance. This result enables the use of permutations as representation scheme
in metaheuristics, in contrast to the usual discrete representation. This makes
the search of the optimum polynomial time dependent from the base field.
Experimental results have been carried out employing codes over fields with two
and eight elements, which suggests that evolutionary algorithms with our
proposed permutation encoding are competitive with regard to existing methods
in the literature. As a by-product, we have found and amended some inaccuracies
in the MAGMA Computational Algebra System concerning the stored distances of
some linear codes.

Title: Moniqua: Modulo Quantized Communication in Decentralized SGD
Authors: Yucheng Lu and Christopher De Sa
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Running Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in a decentralized fashion has
shown promising results. In this paper we propose Moniqua, a technique that
allows decentralized SGD to use quantized communication. We prove in theory
that Moniqua communicates a provably bounded number of bits per iteration,
while converging at the same asymptotic rate as the original algorithm does
with full-precision communication. Moniqua improves upon prior works in that it
(1) requires zero additional memory, (2) works with 1-bit quantization, and (3)
is applicable to a variety of decentralized algorithms. We demonstrate
empirically that Moniqua converges faster with respect to wall clock time than
other quantized decentralized algorithms. We also show that Moniqua is robust
to very low bit-budgets, allowing 1-bit-per-parameter communication without
compromising validation accuracy when training ResNet20 and ResNet110 on
CIFAR10.

DOI: 10.1145/3318464.3380571
\\
  The ubiquitous use of machine learning algorithms brings new challenges to
traditional database problems such as incremental view update. Much effort is
being put in better understanding and debugging machine learning models, as
well as in identifying and repairing errors in training datasets. Our focus is
on how to assist these activities when they have to retrain the machine
learning model after removing problematic training samples in cleaning or
selecting different subsets of training data for interpretability. This paper
presents an efficient provenance-based approach, PrIU, and its optimized
version, PrIU-opt, for incrementally updating model parameters without
sacrificing prediction accuracy. We prove the correctness and convergence of
the incrementally updated model parameters, and validate it experimentally.
Experimental results show that up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups can be
achieved by PrIU-opt compared to simply retraining the model from scratch, yet
obtaining highly similar models.

Title: Learning Adversarially Robust Representations via Worst-Case Mutual
  Information Maximization
Authors: Sicheng Zhu, Xiao Zhang, David Evans
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
Comments: 18 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Training machine learning models to be robust against adversarial inputs
poses seemingly insurmountable challenges. To better understand model
robustness, we consider the underlying problem of learning robust
representations. We develop a general definition of representation
vulnerability that captures the maximum change of mutual information between
the input and output distributions, under the worst-case input distribution
perturbation. We prove a theorem that establishes a lower bound on the minimum
adversarial risk that can be achieved for any downstream classifier based on
this definition. We then propose an unsupervised learning method for obtaining
intrinsically robust representations by maximizing the worst-case mutual
information between input and output distributions. Experiments on downstream
classification tasks and analyses of saliency maps support the robustness of
the representations found using unsupervised learning with our training
principle.

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML

  We investigate several confounding factors in the evaluation of optimization
algorithms for deep learning. Primarily, we take a deeper look at how adaptive
gradient methods interact with the learning rate schedule, a notoriously
difficult-to-tune hyperparameter which has dramatic effects on the convergence
and generalization of neural network training. We introduce a "grafting"
experiment which decouples an update's magnitude from its direction, finding
that many existing beliefs in the literature may have arisen from insufficient
isolation of the implicit schedule of step sizes. Alongside this contribution,
we present some empirical and theoretical retrospectives on the generalization
of adaptive gradient methods, aimed at bringing more clarity to this space.

ACM-class: I.2.m
\\
  In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained progressive momentum
in many areas of machine learning. The layer-by-layer process of DNNs has
inspired the development of many deep models, including deep ensembles. The
most notable deep ensemble-based model is Deep Forest, which can achieve highly
competitive performance while having much fewer hyper-parameters comparing to
DNNs. In spite of its huge success in the batch learning setting, no effort has
been made to adapt Deep Forest to the context of evolving data streams. In this
work, we introduce the Streaming Deep Forest (SDF) algorithm, a
high-performance deep ensemble method specially adapted to stream
classification. We also present the Augmented Variable Uncertainty (AVU) active
learning strategy to reduce the labeling cost in the streaming context. We
compare the proposed methods to state-of-the-art streaming algorithms in a wide
range of datasets. The results show that by following the AVU active learning
strategy, SDF with only 70\% of labeling budget significantly outperforms other
methods trained with all instances.

Title: Improving Robustness of Deep-Learning-Based Image Reconstruction
Authors: Ankit Raj, Yoram Bresler, Bo Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Deep-learning-based methods for different applications have been shown
vulnerable to adversarial examples. These examples make deployment of such
models in safety-critical tasks questionable. Use of deep neural networks as
inverse problem solvers has generated much excitement for medical imaging
including CT and MRI, but recently a similar vulnerability has also been
demonstrated for these tasks. We show that for such inverse problem solvers,
one should analyze and study the effect of adversaries in the
measurement-space, instead of the signal-space as in previous work. In this
paper, we propose to modify the training strategy of end-to-end
deep-learning-based inverse problem solvers to improve robustness. We introduce
an auxiliary network to generate adversarial examples, which is used in a
min-max formulation to build robust image reconstruction networks.
Theoretically, we show for a linear reconstruction scheme the min-max
formulation results in a singular-value(s) filter regularized solution, which
suppresses the effect of adversarial examples occurring because of
ill-conditioning in the measurement matrix. We find that a linear network using
the proposed min-max learning scheme indeed converges to the same solution. In
addition, for non-linear Compressed Sensing (CS) reconstruction using deep
networks, we show significant improvement in robustness using the proposed
approach over other methods. We complement the theory by experiments for CS on
two different datasets and evaluate the effect of increasing perturbations on
trained networks. We find the behavior for ill-conditioned and well-conditioned
measurement matrices to be qualitatively different.

Title: Representation Learning Through Latent Canonicalizations
Authors: Or Litany, Ari Morcos, Srinath Sridhar, Leonidas Guibas, Judy Hoffman
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We seek to learn a representation on a large annotated data source that
generalizes to a target domain using limited new supervision. Many prior
approaches to this problem have focused on learning "disentangled"
representations so that as individual factors vary in a new domain, only a
portion of the representation need be updated. In this work, we seek the
generalization power of disentangled representations, but relax the requirement
of explicit latent disentanglement and instead encourage linearity of
individual factors of variation by requiring them to be manipulable by learned
linear transformations. We dub these transformations latent canonicalizers, as
they aim to modify the value of a factor to a pre-determined (but arbitrary)
canonical value (e.g., recoloring the image foreground to black). Assuming a
source domain with access to meta-labels specifying the factors of variation
within an image, we demonstrate experimentally that our method helps reduce the
number of observations needed to generalize to a similar target domain when
compared to a number of supervised baselines.

Title: Policy Evaluation Networks

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Many reinforcement learning algorithms use value functions to guide the
search for better policies. These methods estimate the value of a single policy
while generalizing across many states. The core idea of this paper is to flip
this convention and estimate the value of many policies, for a single set of
states. This approach opens up the possibility of performing direct gradient
ascent in policy space without seeing any new data. The main challenge for this
approach is finding a way to represent complex policies that facilitates
learning and generalization. To address this problem, we introduce a scalable,
differentiable fingerprinting mechanism that retains essential policy
information in a concise embedding. Our empirical results demonstrate that
combining these three elements (learned Policy Evaluation Network, policy
fingerprints, gradient ascent) can produce policies that outperform those that
generated the training data, in zero-shot manner.

\\
  The success of deep learning has been widely recognized in many machine
learning tasks during the last decades, ranging from image classification and
speech recognition to natural language understanding. As an extension of deep
learning, Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to solve the non-Euclidean
problems on graph-structured data which can hardly be handled by general deep
learning techniques. Existing GNNs under various mechanisms, such as random
walk, PageRank, graph convolution, and heat diffusion, are designed for
different types of graphs and problems, which makes it difficult to compare
them directly. Previous GNN surveys focus on categorizing current models into
independent groups, lacking analysis regarding their internal connection. This
paper proposes a unified framework and provides a novel perspective that can
widely fit existing GNNs into our framework methodologically. Specifically, we
survey and categorize existing GNN models into the spatial and spectral
domains, and reveal connections among subcategories in each domain. Further
analysis establishes a strong link across the spatial and spectral domains.

  Previous work explored blending levels from existing games to create levels
for a new game that mixes properties of the original games. In this paper, we
use Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for improving upon such techniques. VAEs
are artificial neural networks that learn and use latent representations of
datasets to generate novel outputs. We train a VAE on level data from Super
Mario Bros. and Kid Icarus, enabling it to capture the latent space spanning
both games. We then use this space to generate level segments that combine
properties of levels from both games. Moreover, by applying evolutionary search
in the latent space, we evolve level segments satisfying specific constraints.
We argue that these affordances make the VAE-based approach especially suitable
for co-creative level design and compare its performance with similar
generative models like the GAN and the VAE-GAN.

Title: Optimality and Stability in Non-Convex-Non-Concave Min-Max Optimization
Authors: Guojun Zhang, Pascal Poupart and Yaoliang Yu
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
Comments: 39 pages
\\
  Convergence to a saddle point for convex-concave functions has been studied
for decades, while the last few years have seen a surge of interest in
non-convex-non-concave min-max optimization due to the rise of deep learning.
However, it remains an intriguing research challenge how local optimal points
are defined and which algorithm can converge to such points. We study
definitions of "local min-max (max-min)" points and provide an elegant
unification, with the corresponding first- and second-order necessary and
sufficient conditions. Specifically, we show that quadratic games, as often
used as illustrative examples and approximations of smooth functions, are too
special, both locally and globally. Lastly, we analyze the exact conditions for
local convergence of several popular gradient algorithms near the "local
min-max" points defined in the previous section, identify "valid"
hyper-parameters and compare the respective stable sets. Our results offer
insights into the necessity of two-time-scale algorithms and the limitation of
the commonly used approach based on ordinary differential equations.

Title: A Visual Communication Map for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ngoc Duy Nguyen, Thanh Thi Nguyen, Saeid Nahavandi

DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.13433.62563
\\
  Multi-agent learning distinctly poses significant challenges in the effort to
allocate a concealed communication medium. Agents receive thorough knowledge
from the medium to determine subsequent actions in a distributed nature.
Apparently, the goal is to leverage the cooperation of multiple agents to
achieve a designated objective efficiently. Recent studies typically combine a
specialized neural network with reinforcement learning to enable communication
between agents. This approach, however, limits the number of agents or
necessitates the homogeneity of the system. In this paper, we have proposed a
more scalable approach that not only deals with a great number of agents but
also enables collaboration between dissimilar functional agents and compatibly
combined with any deep reinforcement learning methods. Specifically, we create
a global communication map to represent the status of each agent in the system
visually. The visual map and the environmental state are fed to a
shared-parameter network to train multiple agents concurrently. Finally, we
select the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to demonstrate
our proposed scheme, namely Visual communication map for Multi-agent A3C
(VMA3C). Simulation results show that the use of visual communication map
improves the performance of A3C regarding learning speed, reward achievement,
and robustness in multi-agent problems.

  Framework

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a standard approach for building
an intelligent system, which involves multiple self-operated agents to
collectively accomplish a designated task. More importantly, there has been a
great attention to RL since the introduction of deep learning that essentially
makes RL feasible to operate in high-dimensional environments. However, current
research interests are diverted into different directions, such as multi-agent
and multi-objective learning, and human-machine interactions. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose a comprehensive software architecture that not only
plays a vital role in designing a connect-the-dots deep RL architecture but
also provides a guideline to develop a realistic RL application in a short time
span. By inheriting the proposed architecture, software managers can foresee
any challenges when designing a deep RL-based system. As a result, they can
expedite the design process and actively control every stage of software
development, which is especially critical in agile development environments.
For this reason, we designed a deep RL-based framework that strictly ensures
flexibility, robustness, and scalability. Finally, to enforce generalization,
the proposed architecture does not depend on a specific RL algorithm, a network
configuration, the number of agents, or the type of agents.

Title: Kernel Bi-Linear Modeling for Reconstructing Data on Manifolds: The
  Dynamic-MRI Case
Authors: Gaurav N.Shetty, Konstantinos Slavakis, Ukash Nakarmi, Gesualdo
  Scutari, and Leslie Ying
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV stat.ML
\\
  This paper establishes a kernel-based framework for reconstructing data on
manifolds, tailored to fit the dynamic-(d)MRI-data recovery problem. The
proposed methodology exploits simple tangent-space geometries of manifolds in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and follows classical kernel-approximation
arguments to form the data-recovery task as a bi-linear inverse problem.
Departing from mainstream approaches, the proposed methodology uses no training
data, employs no graph Laplacian matrix to penalize the optimization task, uses
no costly (kernel) pre-imaging step to map feature points back to the input
space, and utilizes complex-valued kernel functions to account for k-space
data. The framework is validated on synthetically generated dMRI data, where
comparisons against state-of-the-art schemes highlight the rich potential of
the proposed approach in data-recovery problems.

Title: Using a thousand optimization tasks to learn hyperparameter search

Authors: Luke Metz, Niru Maheswaranathan, Ruoxi Sun, C. Daniel Freeman, Ben

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We present TaskSet, a dataset of tasks for use in training and evaluating
optimizers. TaskSet is unique in its size and diversity, containing over a
thousand tasks ranging from image classification with fully connected or
convolutional neural networks, to variational autoencoders, to non-volume
preserving flows on a variety of datasets. As an example application of such a
dataset we explore meta-learning an ordered list of hyperparameters to try
sequentially. By learning this hyperparameter list from data generated using
TaskSet we achieve large speedups in sample efficiency over random search. Next
we use the diversity of the TaskSet and our method for learning hyperparameter
lists to empirically explore the generalization of these lists to new
optimization tasks in a variety of settings including ImageNet classification
with Resnet50 and LM1B language modeling with transformers. As part of this
work we have opensourced code for all tasks, as well as ~29 million training
curves for these problems and the corresponding hyperparameters.

Title: Gradient Boosted Flows
Authors: Robert Giaquinto and Arindam Banerjee
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: Under review
\\
  Normalizing flows (NF) are a powerful framework for approximating posteriors.
By mapping a simple base density through invertible transformations, flows
provide an exact method of density evaluation and sampling. The trend in
normalizing flow literature has been to devise deeper, more complex
transformations to achieve greater flexibility. We propose an alternative:
Gradient Boosted Flows (GBF) model a variational posterior by successively
adding new NF components by gradient boosting so that each new NF component is
fit to the residuals of the previously trained components. The GBF formulation
results in a variational posterior that is a mixture model, whose flexibility
increases as more components are added. Moreover, GBFs offer a wider, not
deeper, approach that can be incorporated to improve the results of many
existing NFs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique for density
estimation and, by coupling GBF with a variational autoencoder, generative
modeling of images.

Title: Acceleration of Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning for Visual
  Grasping in Clutter by State Representation Learning Based on Disentanglement
  of a Raw Input Image
Authors: Taewon Kim, Yeseong Park, Youngbin Park and Il Hong Suh
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  For a robotic grasping task in which diverse unseen target objects exist in a
cluttered environment, some deep learning-based methods have achieved
state-of-the-art results using visual input directly. In contrast, actor-critic
deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods typically perform very poorly when
grasping diverse objects, especially when learning from raw images and sparse
rewards. To make these RL techniques feasible for vision-based grasping tasks,
we employ state representation learning (SRL), where we encode essential
information first for subsequent use in RL. However, typical representation
learning procedures are unsuitable for extracting pertinent information for
learning the grasping skill, because the visual inputs for representation
learning, where a robot attempts to grasp a target object in clutter, are
extremely complex. We found that preprocessing based on the disentanglement of
a raw input image is the key to effectively capturing a compact representation.
This enables deep RL to learn robotic grasping skills from highly varied and
diverse visual inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with
varying levels of disentanglement in a realistic simulated environment.

Title: Network Cooperation with Progressive Disambiguation for Partial Label
  Learning
Authors: Yao Yao, Chen Gong, Jiehui Deng, Jian Yang
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 7 pages,3 figures
\\
  Partial Label Learning (PLL) aims to train a classifier when each training
instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, among which only one is
correct but is not accessible during the training phase. The common strategy
dealing with such ambiguous labeling information is to disambiguate the
candidate label sets. Nonetheless, existing methods ignore the disambiguation
difficulty of instances and adopt the single-trend training mechanism. The
former would lead to the vulnerability of models to the false positive labels
and the latter may arouse error accumulation problem. To remedy these two
drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel approach termed "Network Cooperation
with Progressive Disambiguation" (NCPD) for PLL. Specifically, we devise a
progressive disambiguation strategy of which the disambiguation operations are
performed on simple instances firstly and then gradually on more complicated
ones. Therefore, the negative impacts brought by the false positive labels of
complicated instances can be effectively mitigated as the disambiguation
ability of the model has been strengthened via learning from the simple
instances. Moreover, by employing artificial neural networks as the backbone,
we utilize a network cooperation mechanism which trains two networks
collaboratively by letting them interact with each other. As two networks have
different disambiguation ability, such interaction is beneficial for both
networks to reduce their respective disambiguation errors, and thus is much
better than the existing algorithms with single-trend training process.
Extensive experimental results on various benchmark and practical datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our NCPD to other state-of-the-art PLL methods.

Title: Supervised Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization using
  Centroid-encoder
Authors: Tomojit Ghosh and Michael Kirby
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: 25 pages (including 3 reference pages), 12 figures. I am planning to
  submit the paper to JMLR very soon. Centroid-encoder was applied on a
  biological pathway data
  (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202317300439). In
  this paper we throughly analyzed the algorithm and compared it with
  state-of-the art techniques on a 8 data sets including MNIST, USPS
\\
  Visualizing high-dimensional data is an essential task in Data Science and
Machine Learning. The Centroid-Encoder (CE) method is similar to the
autoencoder but incorporates label information to keep objects of a class close
together in the reduced visualization space. CE exploits nonlinearity and
labels to encode high variance in low dimensions while capturing the global
structure of the data. We present a detailed analysis of the method using a
wide variety of data sets and compare it with other supervised dimension
reduction techniques, including NCA, nonlinear NCA, t-distributed NCA,
t-distributed MCML, supervised UMAP, supervised PCA, Colored Maximum Variance
Unfolding, supervised Isomap, Parametric Embedding, supervised Neighbor
Retrieval Visualizer, and Multiple Relational Embedding. We empirically show
that centroid-encoder outperforms most of these techniques. We also show that
when the data variance is spread across multiple modalities, centroid-encoder
extracts a significant amount of information from the data in low dimensional
space. This key feature establishes its value to use it as a tool for data
visualization.

Title: How Much Can A Retailer Sell? Sales Forecasting on Tmall

Comments: Accepted by PAKDD'19
\\
  Time-series forecasting is an important task in both academic and industry,
which can be applied to solve many real forecasting problems like stock,
water-supply, and sales predictions. In this paper, we study the case of
retailers' sales forecasting on Tmall|the world's leading online B2C platform.
By analyzing the data, we have two main observations, i.e., sales seasonality
after we group different groups of retails and a Tweedie distribution after we
transform the sales (target to forecast). Based on our observations, we design
two mechanisms for sales forecasting, i.e., seasonality extraction and
distribution transformation. First, we adopt Fourier decomposition to
automatically extract the seasonalities for different categories of retailers,
which can further be used as additional features for any established regression
algorithms. Second, we propose to optimize the Tweedie loss of sales after
logarithmic transformations. We apply these two mechanisms to classic
regression models, i.e., neural network and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree,
and the experimental results on Tmall dataset show that both mechanisms can
significantly improve the forecasting results.

Title: Plannable Approximations to MDP Homomorphisms: Equivariance under
  Actions
Authors: Elise van der Pol, Thomas Kipf, Frans A. Oliehoek, Max Welling
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: To appear in Proceedings of the International Conference on
  Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2020)
\\
  This work exploits action equivariance for representation learning in
reinforcement learning. Equivariance under actions states that transitions in
the input space are mirrored by equivalent transitions in latent space, while
the map and transition functions should also commute. We introduce a
contrastive loss function that enforces action equivariance on the learned
representations. We prove that when our loss is zero, we have a homomorphism of
a deterministic Markov Decision Process (MDP). Learning equivariant maps leads
to structured latent spaces, allowing us to build a model on which we plan
through value iteration. We show experimentally that for deterministic MDPs,
the optimal policy in the abstract MDP can be successfully lifted to the
original MDP. Moreover, the approach easily adapts to changes in the goal
states. Empirically, we show that in such MDPs, we obtain better
representations in fewer epochs compared to representation learning approaches
using reconstructions, while generalizing better to new goals than model-free
approaches.

  Secure online transaction is an essential task for e-commerce platforms.
Alipay, one of the world's leading cashless payment platform, provides the
payment service to both merchants and individual customers. The fraud detection
models are built to protect the customers, but stronger demands are raised by
the new scenes, which are lacking in training data and labels. The proposed
model makes a difference by utilizing the data under similar old scenes and the
data under a new scene is treated as the target domain to be promoted. Inspired
by this real case in Alipay, we view the problem as a transfer learning problem
and design a set of revise strategies to transfer the source domain models to
the target domain under the framework of gradient boosting tree models. This
work provides an option for the cold-starting and data-sharing problems.

  Chen, Marianne Winslett, Hassan Sajjad, Preslav Nakov
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Transformer-based models pre-trained on large-scale corpora achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy for natural language processing tasks, but are too
resource-hungry and compute-intensive to suit low-capability devices or
applications with strict latency requirements. One potential remedy is model
compression, which has attracted extensive attention. This paper summarizes the
branches of research on compressing Transformers, focusing on the especially
popular BERT model. BERT's complex architecture means that a compression
technique that is highly effective on one part of the model, e.g., attention
layers, may be less successful on another part, e.g., fully connected layers.
In this systematic study, we identify the state of the art in compression for
each part of BERT, clarify current best practices for compressing large-scale
Transformer models, and provide insights into the inner workings of various
methods. Our categorization and analysis also shed light on promising future
research directions for achieving a lightweight, accurate, and generic natural
language processing model.

Title: Online Learning for Active Cache Synchronization
Authors: Andrey Kolobov, S\'ebastien Bubeck, Julian Zimmert
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Existing multi-armed bandit (MAB) models make two implicit assumptions: an
arm generates a payoff only when it is played, and the agent observes every
payoff that is generated. This paper introduces synchronization bandits, a MAB
variant where all arms generate costs at all times, but the agent observes an
arm's instantaneous cost only when the arm is played. Synchronization MABs are
inspired by online caching scenarios such as Web crawling, where an arm
corresponds to a cached item and playing the arm means downloading its fresh
copy from a server. We present MirrorSync, an online learning algorithm for
synchronization bandits, establish an adversarial regret of $O(T^{2/3})$ for
it, and show how to make it efficient in practice.

Title: Transductive Few-shot Learning with Meta-Learned Confidence
Authors: Seong Min Kye, Hae Beom Lee, Hoirin Kim, and Sung Ju Hwang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  We propose a novel transductive inference framework for metric-based
meta-learning models, which updates the prototype of each class with the
confidence-weighted average of all the support and query samples. However, a
caveat here is that the model confidence may be unreliable, which could lead to
incorrect prediction in the transductive setting. To tackle this issue, we
further propose to meta-learn to assign correct confidence scores to unlabeled
queries. Specifically, we meta-learn the parameters of the distance-metric,
such that the model can improve its transductive inference performance on
unseen tasks with the generated confidence scores. We also consider various
types of uncertainties to further enhance the reliability of the meta-learned
confidence. We combine our transductive meta-learning scheme, Meta-Confidence
Transduction (MCT) with a novel dense classifier, Dense Feature Matching
Network (DFMN), which performs both instance-level and feature-level
classification without global average pooling and validate it on four benchmark
datasets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art models by 11.11% and 7.68% on
miniImageNet and tieredImageNet dataset respectively. Further qualitative
analysis confirms that this impressive performance gain is indeed due to its
ability to assign high confidence to instances with the correct labels.

Title: Complexity Measures and Features for Times Series classification

Categories: cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
\\
  Classification of time series is a growing problem in different disciplines
due to the progressive digitalization of the world. Currently, the state of the
art in time series classification is dominated by Collective of
Transformation-Based Ensembles. This algorithm is composed of several
classifiers of diverse nature that are combined according to their results in
an internal cross validation procedure. Its high complexity prevents it from
being applied to large datasets. One Nearest Neighbours with Dynamic Time
Warping remains the base classifier in any time series classification problem,
for its simplicity and good results. Despite their good performance, they share
a weakness, which is that they are not interpretable. In the field of time
series classification, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a set of characteristics capable of
extracting information of the structure of the time series in order to face
time series classification problems. The use of these characteristics allows
the use of traditional classification algorithms in time series problems. The
experimental results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the
accuracy of the results obtained by our proposal with respect to the original
time series. Apart from the improvement in accuracy, our proposal is able to
offer interpretable results based on the set of characteristics proposed.

  Mixed Sample Data Augmentation (MSDA) has received increasing attention in
recent years, with many successful variants such as MixUp and CutMix. Following
insight on the efficacy of CutMix in particular, we propose FMix, an MSDA that
uses binary masks obtained by applying a threshold to low frequency images
sampled from Fourier space. FMix improves performance over MixUp and CutMix for
a number of state-of-the-art models across a range of data sets and problem
settings. We go on to analyse MixUp, CutMix, and FMix from an information
theoretic perspective, characterising learned models in terms of how they
progressively compress the input with depth. Ultimately, our analyses allow us
to decouple two complementary properties of augmentations, and present a
unified framework for reasoning about MSDA. Code for all experiments is

Comments: Submitted to ICML 2020; 12 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Automatic evaluation of the goodness of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) has been a challenge for the field of machine learning. In this work, we
propose a distance complementary to existing measures: Topology Distance (TD),
the main idea behind which is to compare the geometric and topological features
of the latent manifold of real data with those of generated data. More
specifically, we build Vietoris-Rips complex on image features, and define TD
based on the differences in persistent-homology groups of the two manifolds. We
compare TD with the most commonly used and relevant measures in the field,
including Inception Score (IS), Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel
Inception Distance (KID) and Geometry Score (GS), in a range of experiments on
various datasets. We demonstrate the unique advantage and superiority of our
proposed approach over the aforementioned metrics. A combination of our
empirical results and the theoretical argument we propose in favour of TD,
strongly supports the claim that TD is a powerful candidate metric that
researchers can employ when aiming to automatically evaluate the goodness of
GANs' learning.

vehicles. However, the downside of using deep neural networks to learn control
policies is their opaque nature and the difficulties of validating their
safety. As the networks used to obtain state-of-the-art results become
increasingly deep and complex, the rules they have learned and how they operate
become more challenging to understand. This presents an issue, since in
safety-critical applications the safety of the control policy must be ensured
to a high confidence level. In this paper, we propose an automated black box
testing framework based on adversarial reinforcement learning. The technique
uses an adversarial agent, whose goal is to degrade the performance of the
target model under test. We test the approach on an autonomous vehicle problem,
by training an adversarial reinforcement learning agent, which aims to cause a
deep neural network-driven autonomous vehicle to collide. Two neural networks
trained for autonomous driving are compared, and the results from the testing
are used to compare the robustness of their learned control policies. We show
that the proposed framework is able to find weaknesses in both control policies
that were not evident during online testing and therefore, demonstrate a
significant benefit over manual testing methods.

Title: High-Dimensional Feature Selection for Genomic Datasets
Authors: Majid Afshar, Hamid Usefi
Categories: cs.LG q-bio.QM stat.ML
\\
  In the presence of large dimensional datasets that contain many irrelevant
features (variables), dimensionality reduction algorithms have proven to be
useful in removing features with low variance and combine features with high
correlation. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection method which
uses singular value decomposition of a matrix and the method of least squares
to remove the irrelevant features and detect correlations between the remaining
features. The effectiveness of our method has been verified by performing a
series of comparisons with state-of-the-art feature selection methods over ten
genetic datasets ranging up from 9,117 to 267,604 features. The results show
that our method is favorable in various aspects compared to state-of-the-art
feature selection methods.

Title: Simultaneously Evolving Deep Reinforcement Learning Models using
  Multifactorial Optimization
Authors: Aritz D. Martinez, Eneko Osaba, Javier Del Ser and Francisco Herrera
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Conference on Evolutionary
  Computation 2020 (IEEE CEC)
\\
  In recent years, Multifactorial Optimization (MFO) has gained a notable
momentum in the research community. MFO is known for its inherent capability to
efficiently address multiple optimization tasks at the same time, while
transferring information among such tasks to improve their convergence speed.
On the other hand, the quantum leap made by Deep Q Learning (DQL) in the
Machine Learning field has allowed facing Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems
of unprecedented complexity. Unfortunately, complex DQL models usually find it
difficult to converge to optimal policies due to the lack of exploration or
sparse rewards. In order to overcome these drawbacks, pre-trained models are
widely harnessed via Transfer Learning, extrapolating knowledge acquired in a
source task to the target task. Besides, meta-heuristic optimization has been
shown to reduce the lack of exploration of DQL models. This work proposes a MFO
framework capable of simultaneously evolving several DQL models towards solving
interrelated RL tasks. Specifically, our proposed framework blends together the
benefits of meta-heuristic optimization, Transfer Learning and DQL to automate
the process of knowledge transfer and policy learning of distributed RL agents.
A thorough experimentation is presented and discussed so as to assess the
performance of the framework, its comparison to the traditional methodology for
Transfer Learning in terms of convergence, speed and policy quality , and the
intertask relationships found and exploited over the search process.

Title: Block Hankel Tensor ARIMA for Multiple Short Time Series Forecasting
Authors: Qiquan Shi, Jiaming Yin, Jiajun Cai, Andrzej Cichocki, Tatsuya Yokota,
  Lei Chen, Mingxuan Yuan, Jia Zeng
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by AAAI 2020
\\
  This work proposes a novel approach for multiple time series forecasting. At
first, multi-way delay embedding transform (MDT) is employed to represent time
series as low-rank block Hankel tensors (BHT). Then, the higher-order tensors
are projected to compressed core tensors by applying Tucker decomposition. At
the same time, the generalized tensor Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) is explicitly used on consecutive core tensors to predict future
samples. In this manner, the proposed approach tactically incorporates the
unique advantages of MDT tensorization (to exploit mutual correlations) and
tensor ARIMA coupled with low-rank Tucker decomposition into a unified
framework. This framework exploits the low-rank structure of block Hankel
tensors in the embedded space and captures the intrinsic correlations among
multiple TS, which thus can improve the forecasting results, especially for
multiple short time series. Experiments conducted on three public datasets and
two industrial datasets verify that the proposed BHT-ARIMA effectively improves
forecasting accuracy and reduces computational cost compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Fairness-Aware Learning with Prejudice Free Representations
Authors: Ramanujam Madhavan, Mohit Wadhwa
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Machine learning models are extensively being used to make decisions that
have a significant impact on human life. These models are trained over
historical data that may contain information about sensitive attributes such as
race, sex, religion, etc. The presence of such sensitive attributes can impact
certain population subgroups unfairly. It is straightforward to remove
sensitive features from the data; however, a model could pick up prejudice from
latent sensitive attributes that may exist in the training data. This has led
to the growing apprehension about the fairness of the employed models. In this
paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can effectively identify and treat
latent discriminating features. The approach is agnostic of the learning
algorithm and generalizes well for classification as well as regression tasks.
It can also be used as a key aid in proving that the model is free of
discrimination towards regulatory compliance if the need arises. The approach
helps to collect discrimination-free features that would improve the model
performance while ensuring the fairness of the model. The experimental results
from our evaluations on publicly available real-world datasets show a
near-ideal fairness measurement in comparison to other methods.

Title: Fair Adversarial Networks
Authors: George Cevora
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The influence of human judgement is ubiquitous in datasets used across the
analytics industry, yet humans are known to be sub-optimal decision makers
prone to various biases. Analysing biased datasets then leads to biased
outcomes of the analysis. Bias by protected characteristics (e.g. race) is of
particular interest as it may not only make the output of analytical process
sub-optimal, but also illegal. Countering the bias by constraining the
analytical outcomes to be fair is problematic because A) fairness lacks a
universally accepted definition, while at the same time some definitions are
mutually exclusive, and B) the use of optimisation constraints ensuring
fairness is incompatible with most analytical pipelines. Both problems are
solved by methods which remove bias from the data and returning an altered
dataset. This approach aims to not only remove the actual bias variable (e.g.
race), but also alter all proxy variables (e.g. postcode) so the bias variable
is not detectable from the rest of the data. The advantage of using this
approach is that the definition of fairness as a lack of detectable bias in the
data (as opposed to the output of analysis) is universal and therefore solves
problem (A). Furthermore, as the data is altered to remove bias the problem (B)
disappears because the analytical pipelines can remain unchanged. This approach
has been adopted by several technical solutions. None of them, however, seems
to be satisfactory in terms of ability to remove multivariate, non-linear and
non-binary biases. Therefore, in this paper I propose the concept of Fair
Adversarial Networks as an easy-to-implement general method for removing bias
from data. This paper demonstrates that Fair Adversarial Networks achieve this
aim.

\\
  This paper presents the concept of an adaptive safe padding that forces
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to synthesize optimal control policies while
ensuring safety during the learning process. We express the safety requirements
as a temporal logic formula. Enforcing the RL agent to stay safe during
learning might limit the exploration in some safety-critical cases. However, we
show that the proposed architecture is able to automatically handle the
trade-off between efficient progress in exploration and ensuring strict safety.
Theoretical guarantees are available on the convergence of the algorithm.
Finally experimental results are provided to showcase the performance of the
proposed method.

Title: A Comprehensive Approach to Unsupervised Embedding Learning based on AND
  Algorithm
Authors: Sungwon Han, Yizhan Xu, Sungwon Park, Meeyoung Cha, Cheng-Te Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Unsupervised embedding learning aims to extract good representation from data
without the need for any manual labels, which has been a critical challenge in
many supervised learning tasks. This paper proposes a new unsupervised
embedding approach, called Super-AND, which extends the current
state-of-the-art model. Super-AND has its unique set of losses that can gather
similar samples nearby within a low-density space while keeping invariant
features intact against data augmentation. Super-AND outperforms all existing
approaches and achieves an accuracy of 89.2% on the image classification task
for CIFAR-10. We discuss the practical implications of this method in assisting
semi-supervised tasks.

\\
  Extracting large amounts of data from biological samples is not feasible due
to radiation issues, and image processing in the small-data regime is one of
the critical challenges when working with a limited amount of data. In this
work, we applied an existing algorithm named Variational Auto Encoder (VAE)
that pre-trains a latent space representation of the data to capture the
features in a lower-dimension for the small-data regime input. The fine-tuned
latent space provides constant weights that are useful for classification. Here
we will present the performance analysis of the VAE algorithm with different
latent space sizes in the semi-supervised learning using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Title: Infinitely Wide Graph Convolutional Networks: Semi-supervised Learning
  via Gaussian Processes
Authors: Jilin Hu, Jianbing Shen, Bin Yang, Ling Shao
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Graph convolutional neural networks~(GCNs) have recently demonstrated
promising results on graph-based semi-supervised classification, but little
work has been done to explore their theoretical properties. Recently, several
deep neural networks, e.g., fully connected and convolutional neural networks,
with infinite hidden units have been proved to be equivalent to Gaussian
processes~(GPs). To exploit both the powerful representational capacity of GCNs
and the great expressive power of GPs, we investigate similar properties of
infinitely wide GCNs. More specifically, we propose a GP regression model via
GCNs~(GPGC) for graph-based semi-supervised learning. In the process, we
formulate the kernel matrix computation of GPGC in an iterative analytical
form. Finally, we derive a conditional distribution for the labels of
unobserved nodes based on the graph structure, labels for the observed nodes,
and the feature matrix of all the nodes. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate the semi-supervised classification performance of GPGC and demonstrate
that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin on all the
datasets while being efficient.

Title: Multi-source Domain Adaptation in the Deep Learning Era: A Systematic
  Survey
Authors: Sicheng Zhao, Bo Li, Colorado Reed, Pengfei Xu, Kurt Keutzer
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  In many practical applications, it is often difficult and expensive to obtain
enough large-scale labeled data to train deep neural networks to their full
capability. Therefore, transferring the learned knowledge from a separate,
labeled source domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain becomes
an appealing alternative. However, direct transfer often results in significant
performance decay due to domain shift. Domain adaptation (DA) addresses this
problem by minimizing the impact of domain shift between the source and target
domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) is a powerful extension in which
the labeled data may be collected from multiple sources with different
distributions. Due to the success of DA methods and the prevalence of
multi-source data, MDA has attracted increasing attention in both academia and
industry. In this survey, we define various MDA strategies and summarize
available datasets for evaluation. We also compare modern MDA methods in the
deep learning era, including latent space transformation and intermediate
domain generation. Finally, we discuss future research directions for MDA.

Title: Kalman Recursions Aggregated Online

Categories: cs.LG stat.ME stat.ML
\\
  In this article, we aim at improving the prediction of expert aggregation by
using the underlying properties of the models that provide expert predictions.
We restrict ourselves to the case where expert predictions come from Kalman
recursions, fitting state-space models. By using exponential weights, we
construct different algorithms of Kalman recursions Aggregated Online (KAO)
that compete with the best expert or the best convex combination of experts in
a more or less adaptive way. We improve the existing results on expert
aggregation literature when the experts are Kalman recursions by taking
advantage of the second-order properties of the Kalman recursions. We apply our
approach to Kalman recursions and extend it to the general adversarial expert
setting by state-space modeling the errors of the experts. We apply these new
algorithms to a real dataset of electricity consumption and show how it can
improve forecast performances comparing to other exponentially weighted average
procedures.

Title: Optimistic Exploration even with a Pessimistic Initialisation
Authors: Tabish Rashid, Bei Peng, Wendelin B\"ohmer, Shimon Whiteson
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020
\\
  Optimistic initialisation is an effective strategy for efficient exploration
in reinforcement learning (RL). In the tabular case, all provably efficient
model-free algorithms rely on it. However, model-free deep RL algorithms do not
use optimistic initialisation despite taking inspiration from these provably
efficient tabular algorithms. In particular, in scenarios with only positive
rewards, Q-values are initialised at their lowest possible values due to
commonly used network initialisation schemes, a pessimistic initialisation.
Merely initialising the network to output optimistic Q-values is not enough,
since we cannot ensure that they remain optimistic for novel state-action
pairs, which is crucial for exploration. We propose a simple count-based
augmentation to pessimistically initialised Q-values that separates the source
of optimism from the neural network. We show that this scheme is provably
efficient in the tabular setting and extend it to the deep RL setting. Our
algorithm, Optimistic Pessimistically Initialised Q-Learning (OPIQ), augments
the Q-value estimates of a DQN-based agent with count-derived bonuses to ensure
optimism during both action selection and bootstrapping. We show that OPIQ
outperforms non-optimistic DQN variants that utilise a pseudocount-based
intrinsic motivation in hard exploration tasks, and that it predicts optimistic
estimates for novel state-action pairs.

\\
  The aim of this study was to approach a difficult regression task on highly
unbalanced data regarding active theater of war in Afghanistan. Our focus was
set on predicting the negative events number without distinguishing precise
nature of the events given historical data on investment and negative events
per each of predefined 400 Afghanistan districts. In contrast with previous
research on the matter, we propose an approach to analysis of time series data
that benefits from non-conventional aggregation of these territorial entities.
By carrying out initial exploratory data analysis we demonstrate that dividing
data according to our proposal allows to identify strong trend and seasonal
components in the selected target variable. Utilizing this approach we also
tried to estimate which data regarding investments is most important for
prediction performance. Based on our exploratory analysis and previous research
we prepared 5 sets of independent variables that were fed to 3 machine learning
regression models. The results expressed by mean absolute and mean square
errors indicate that leveraging historical data regarding target variable
allows for reasonable performance, however unfortunately other proposed
independent variables does not seem to improve prediction quality.

Title: On Isometry Robustness of Deep 3D Point Cloud Models under Adversarial
  Attacks
Authors: Yue Zhao, Yuwei Wu, Caihua Chen, Andrew Lim
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: This paper was accepted for presentation at CVPR2020
\\
  While deep learning in 3D domain has achieved revolutionary performance in
many tasks, the robustness of these models has not been sufficiently studied or
explored. Regarding the 3D adversarial samples, most existing works focus on
manipulation of local points, which may fail to invoke the global geometry
properties, like robustness under linear projection that preserves the
Euclidean distance, i.e., isometry. In this work, we show that existing
state-of-the-art deep 3D models are extremely vulnerable to isometry
transformations. Armed with the Thompson Sampling, we develop a black-box
attack with success rate over 95\% on ModelNet40 data set. Incorporating with
the Restricted Isometry Property, we propose a novel framework of white-box
attack on top of spectral norm based perturbation. In contrast to previous
works, our adversarial samples are experimentally shown to be strongly
transferable. Evaluated on a sequence of prevailing 3D models, our white-box
attack achieves success rates from 98.88\% to 100\%. It maintains a successful
attack rate over 95\% even within an imperceptible rotation range $[\pm
2.81^{\circ}]$.

Title: Woodbury Transformations for Deep Generative Flows
Authors: You Lu, Bert Huang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Normalizing flows are deep generative models that allow efficient likelihood
calculation and sampling. The core requirement for this advantage is that they
are constructed using functions that can be efficiently inverted and for which
the determinant of the function's Jacobian can be efficiently computed.
Researchers have introduced various such flow operations, but few of these
allow rich interactions among variables without incurring significant
computational costs. In this paper, we introduce Woodbury transformations,
which achieve efficient invertibility via the Woodbury matrix identity and
efficient determinant calculation via Sylvester's determinant identity. In
contrast with other operations used in state-of-the-art normalizing flows,
Woodbury transformations enable (1) high-dimensional interactions, (2)
efficient sampling, and (3) efficient likelihood evaluation. Other similar
operations, such as 1x1 convolutions, emerging convolutions, or periodic
convolutions allow at most two of these three advantages. In our experiments on
multiple image datasets, we find that Woodbury transformations allow learning
of higher-likelihood models than other flow architectures while still enjoying
their efficiency advantages.

Comments: 30 Pages, 1 Figure
\\
  We study Online Convex Optimization in the unbounded setting where neither
predictions nor gradient are constrained. The goal is to simultaneously adapt
to both the sequence of gradients and the comparator. We first develop
parameter-free and scale-free algorithms for a simplified setting with hints.
We present two versions: the first adapts to the squared norms of both
comparator and gradients separately using $O(d)$ time per round, the second
adapts to their squared inner products (which measure variance only in the
comparator direction) in time $O(d^3)$ per round. We then generalize two prior
reductions to the unbounded setting; one to not need hints, and a second to
deal with the range ratio problem (which already arises in prior work). We
discuss their optimality in light of prior and new lower bounds. We apply our
methods to obtain sharper regret bounds for scale-invariant online prediction
with linear models.

Title: CATA++: A Collaborative Dual Attentive Autoencoder Method for
  Recommending Scientific Articles
Authors: Meshal Alfarhood and Jianlin Cheng
Categories: cs.LG cs.IR stat.ML
\\
  Recommender systems today have become an essential component of any
commercial website. Collaborative filtering approaches, and Matrix
Factorization (MF) techniques in particular, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, the natural data sparsity problem limits their performance
where users generally interact with very few items in the system. Consequently,
multiple hybrid models were proposed recently to optimize MF performance by
incorporating additional contextual information in its learning process.
Although these models improve the recommendation quality, there are two primary
aspects for further improvements: (1) multiple models focus only on some
portion of the available contextual information and neglect other portions; (2)
learning the feature space of the side contextual information needs to be
further enhanced.
  In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Dual Attentive Autoencoder (CATA++)
for recommending scientific articles. CATA++ utilizes an article's content and
learns its latent space via two parallel autoencoders. We use attention
mechanism to capture the most pertinent part of information in making more
relevant recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world
datasets have shown that our dual-way learning strategy has significantly
improved the MF performance in comparison with other state-of-the-art MF-based
models according to various experimental evaluations. The source code of our
methods is available at: https://github.com/jianlin-cheng/CATA.

Title: Testing Monotonicity of Machine Learning Models
Authors: Arnab Sharma and Heike Wehrheim
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Today, machine learning (ML) models are increasingly applied in decision
making. This induces an urgent need for quality assurance of ML models with
respect to (often domain-dependent) requirements. Monotonicity is one such
requirement. It specifies a software as 'learned' by an ML algorithm to give an
increasing prediction with the increase of some attribute values. While there
exist multiple ML algorithms for ensuring monotonicity of the generated model,
approaches for checking monotonicity, in particular of black-box models, are
largely lacking. In this work, we propose verification-based testing of
monotonicity, i.e., the formal computation of test inputs on a white-box model
via verification technology, and the automatic inference of this approximating
white-box model from the black-box model under test. On the white-box model,
the space of test inputs can be systematically explored by a directed
computation of test cases. The empirical evaluation on 90 black-box models
shows verification-based testing can outperform adaptive random testing as well
as property-based techniques with respect to effectiveness and efficiency.

Title: Deep Randomized Neural Networks
Authors: Claudio Gallicchio and Simone Scardapane
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  Randomized Neural Networks explore the behavior of neural systems where the
majority of connections are fixed, either in a stochastic or a deterministic
fashion. Typical examples of such systems consist of multi-layered neural
network architectures where the connections to the hidden layer(s) are left
untrained after initialization. Limiting the training algorithms to operate on
a reduced set of weights inherently characterizes the class of Randomized
Neural Networks with a number of intriguing features. Among them, the extreme
efficiency of the resulting learning processes is undoubtedly a striking
advantage with respect to fully trained architectures. Besides, despite the
involved simplifications, randomized neural systems possess remarkable
properties both in practice, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple
domains, and theoretically, allowing to analyze intrinsic properties of neural
architectures (e.g. before training of the hidden layers' connections). In
recent years, the study of Randomized Neural Networks has been extended towards
deep architectures, opening new research directions to the design of effective
yet extremely efficient deep learning models in vectorial as well as in more
complex data domains. This chapter surveys all the major aspects regarding the
design and analysis of Randomized Neural Networks, and some of the key results
with respect to their approximation capabilities. In particular, we first
introduce the fundamentals of randomized neural models in the context of
feed-forward networks (i.e., Random Vector Functional Link and equivalent
models) and convolutional filters, before moving to the case of recurrent
systems (i.e., Reservoir Computing networks). For both, we focus specifically
on recent results in the domain of deep randomized systems, and (for recurrent
models) their application to structured domains.

Title: RIDE: Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration for Procedurally-Generated
  Environments
Authors: Roberta Raileanu and Tim Rockt\"aschel
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Exploration in sparse reward environments remains one of the key challenges
of model-free reinforcement learning. Instead of solely relying on extrinsic
rewards provided by the environment, many state-of-the-art methods use
intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. However, we show that existing
methods fall short in procedurally-generated environments where an agent is
unlikely to visit a state more than once. We propose a novel type of intrinsic
reward which encourages the agent to take actions that lead to significant
changes in its learned state representation. We evaluate our method on multiple
challenging procedurally-generated tasks in MiniGrid, as well as on tasks with
high-dimensional observations used in prior work. Our experiments demonstrate
that this approach is more sample efficient than existing exploration methods,
particularly for procedurally-generated MiniGrid environments. Furthermore, we
analyze the learned behavior as well as the intrinsic reward received by our
agent. In contrast to previous approaches, our intrinsic reward does not
diminish during the course of training and it rewards the agent substantially
more for interacting with objects that it can control.

Title: An On-Device Federated Learning Approach for Cooperative Anomaly
  Detection
Authors: Rei Ito, Mineto Tsukada, Hiroki Matsutani
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC stat.ML
\\
  Most edge AI focuses on prediction tasks on resource-limited edge devices,
while the training is done at server machines, so retraining a model on the
edge devices to reflect environmental changes is a complicated task. To follow
such a concept drift, a neural-network based on-device learning approach is
recently proposed, so that edge devices train incoming data at runtime to
update their model. In this case, since a training is done at distributed edge
devices, the issue is that only a limited amount of training data can be used
for each edge device. To address this issue, one approach is a cooperative
learning or federated learning, where edge devices exchange their trained
results and update their model by using those collected from the other devices.
In this paper, as an on-device learning algorithm, we focus on OS-ELM (Online
Sequential Extreme Learning Machine) and combine it with Autoencoder for
anomaly detection. We extend it for an on-device federated learning so that
edge devices exchange their trained results and update their model by using
those collected from the other edge devices. Experimental results using a
driving dataset of cars demonstrate that the proposed on-device federated
learning can produce more accurate model by combining trained results from
multiple edge devices compared to a single model.

Title: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Malicious Account Detection

Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  We present, GEM, the first heterogeneous graph neural network approach for
detecting malicious accounts at Alipay, one of the world's leading mobile
cashless payment platform. Our approach, inspired from a connected subgraph
approach, adaptively learns discriminative embeddings from heterogeneous
account-device graphs based on two fundamental weaknesses of attackers, i.e.
device aggregation and activity aggregation. For the heterogeneous graph
consists of various types of nodes, we propose an attention mechanism to learn
the importance of different types of nodes, while using the sum operator for
modeling the aggregation patterns of nodes in each type. Experiments show that
our approaches consistently perform promising results compared with competitive
methods over time.

Comments: PhD Dissertation 2020
\\
  In this dissertation, we cover some recent advances in collaborative
filtering and ranking. In chapter 1, we give a brief introduction of the
history and the current landscape of collaborative filtering and ranking;
chapter 2 we first talk about pointwise collaborative filtering problem with
graph information, and how our proposed new method can encode very deep graph
information which helps four existing graph collaborative filtering algorithms;
chapter 3 is on the pairwise approach for collaborative ranking and how we
speed up the algorithm to near-linear time complexity; chapter 4 is on the new
listwise approach for collaborative ranking and how the listwise approach is a
better choice of loss for both explicit and implicit feedback over pointwise
and pairwise loss; chapter 5 is about the new regularization technique
Stochastic Shared Embeddings (SSE) we proposed for embedding layers and how it
is both theoretically sound and empirically effectively for 6 different tasks
across recommendation and natural language processing; chapter 6 is how we
introduce personalization for the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation
model with the help of SSE, which plays an important role in preventing our
personalized model from overfitting to the training data; chapter 7, we
summarize what we have achieved so far and predict what the future directions
can be; chapter 8 is the appendix to all the chapters.

Title: The Spectral Underpinning of word2vec

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  word2vec due to Mikolov \textit{et al.} (2013) is a word embedding method
that is widely used in natural language processing. Despite its great success
and frequent use, theoretical justification is still lacking. The main
contribution of our paper is to propose a rigorous analysis of the highly
nonlinear functional of word2vec. Our results suggest that word2vec may be
primarily driven by an underlying spectral method. This insight may open the
door to obtaining provable guarantees for word2vec. We support these findings
by numerical simulations. One fascinating open question is whether the
nonlinear properties of word2vec that are not captured by the spectral method
are beneficial and, if so, by what mechanism.

Title: Estimating the Effects of Continuous-valued Interventions using
  Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Ioana Bica, James Jordon, Mihaela van der Schaar
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  While much attention has been given to the problem of estimating the effect
of discrete interventions from observational data, relatively little work has
been done in the setting of continuous-valued interventions, such as treatments
associated with a dosage parameter. In this paper, we tackle this problem by
building on a modification of the generative adversarial networks (GANs)
framework. Our model, SCIGAN, is flexible and capable of simultaneously
estimating counterfactual outcomes for several different continuous
interventions. The key idea is to use a significantly modified GAN model to
learn to generate counterfactual outcomes, which can then be used to learn an
inference model, using standard supervised methods, capable of estimating these
counterfactuals for a new sample. To address the challenges presented by
shifting to continuous interventions, we propose a novel architecture for our
discriminator - we build a hierarchical discriminator that leverages the
structure of the continuous intervention setting. Moreover, we provide
theoretical results to support our use of the GAN framework and of the
hierarchical discriminator. In the experiments section, we introduce a new
semi-synthetic data simulation for use in the continuous intervention setting
and demonstrate improvements over the existing benchmark models.

Title: A Distributional Framework for Data Valuation
Authors: Amirata Ghorbani, Michael P. Kim, James Zou
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Shapley value is a classic notion from game theory, historically used to
quantify the contributions of individuals within groups, and more recently
applied to assign values to data points when training machine learning models.
Despite its foundational role, a key limitation of the data Shapley framework
is that it only provides valuations for points within a fixed data set. It does
not account for statistical aspects of the data and does not give a way to
reason about points outside the data set. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel framework -- distributional Shapley -- where the value of a
point is defined in the context of an underlying data distribution. We prove
that distributional Shapley has several desirable statistical properties; for
example, the values are stable under perturbations to the data points
themselves and to the underlying data distribution. We leverage these
properties to develop a new algorithm for estimating values from data, which
comes with formal guarantees and runs two orders of magnitude faster than
state-of-the-art algorithms for computing the (non-distributional) data Shapley
values. We apply distributional Shapley to diverse data sets and demonstrate
its utility in a data market setting.

  This EPTCS volume contains the proceedings of the ThEdu'19 workshop, promoted
on August 25, 2019, as a satellite event of CADE-27, in Natal, Brazil.
Representing the eighth installment of the ThEdu series, ThEdu'19 was a vibrant
workshop, with an invited talk by Sarah Winkler, four contributions, and the
first edition of a Geometry Automated Provers Competition. After the workshop
an open call for papers was issued and attracted seven submissions, six of
which have been accepted by the reviewers, and collected in the present
post-proceedings volume.
  The ThEdu series pursues the smooth transition from an intuitive way of doing
mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in
STEM education, while favoring software support for this transition by
exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies.
  The volume editors hope that this collection of papers will further promote
the development of theorem-proving-based software, and that it will collaborate
on improving mutual understanding between computer mathematicians and
stakeholders in education.

Title: A Lower Bound of the Number of Rewrite Rules Obtained by Homological
  Methods
Authors: Mirai Ikebuchi
Categories: cs.LO math.AC math.LO
Comments: 24 pages, submitted to Logical Methods in Computer Science
\\
  It is well-known that some equational theories such as groups or boolean
algebras can be defined by fewer equational axioms than the original axioms.
However, it is not easy to determine if a given set of axioms is the smallest
or not. Malbos and Mimram investigated a general method to find a lower bound
of the cardinality of the set of equational axioms (or rewrite rules) that is
equivalent to a given equational theory (or term rewriting systems), using
homological algebra. Their method is an analog of Squier's homology theory on
string rewriting systems. In this paper, we develop the homology theory for
term rewriting systems more and provide a better lower bound under a stronger
notion of equivalence than their equivalence. The author also implemented a
program to compute the lower bounds, and experimented with 64 complete TRSs.

Comments: 27 pages, paper submitted to a journal
MSC-class: Order, lattices, ordered algebraic structures
\\
  In this paper, we introduce the concept of residuated implications derived
from quasi-overlap functions on lattices and prove some related properties. In
addition, we formalized the residuation principle for the case of quasi-overlap
functions on lattices and their respective induced implications, as well as
revealing that the class of quasi-overlap functions that fulfill the
residuation principle is the same class of continuous functions according to
topology of Scott. Also, Scott's continuity and the notion of densely ordered
posets are used to generalize a classification theorem for residuated
quasi-overlap functions. Finally, the concept of automorphisms are extended to
the context of quasi-overlap functions over lattices, taking these lattices
into account as topological spaces, with a view to obtaining quasi-overlap
functions conjugated by the action of automorphisms.

  Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) will be an important component of the
smart city and intelligent transportation environments of the near future. The
demand for sUAS related applications, such as commercial delivery and land
surveying, is expected to grow rapidly in next few years. In general, sUAS
traffic routing and management functions are needed to coordinate the launching
of sUAS from different launch sites and determine their trajectories to avoid
conflict while considering several other constraints such as expected arrival
time, minimum flight energy, and availability of communication resources.
However, as the airborne sUAS density grows in a certain area, it is difficult
to foresee the potential airspace and communications resource conflicts and
make immediate decisions to avoid them. To address this challenge, we present a
temporal and spatial routing algorithm and simulation platform for sUAS
trajectory management in a high density urban area that plans sUAS movements in
a spatial and temporal maze taking into account obstacles that are either
static or dynamic in time. The routing allows the sUAS to avoid static no-fly
areas (i.e. static obstacles) or other in-flight sUAS and areas that have
congested communication resources (i.e. dynamic obstacles). The algorithm is
evaluated using an agent-based simulation platform. The simulation results show
that the proposed algorithm outperforms other route management algorithms in
many areas, especially in processing speed and memory efficiency. Detailed
comparisons are provided for the sUAS flight time, the overall throughput,
conflict rate and communication resource utilization. The results demonstrate
that our proposed algorithm can be used to address the airspace and
communication resource utilization needs for a next generation smart city and
smart transportation.

  Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) are an important
framework that models coordinated decision-making problem in multi-agent
systems with a set of discrete variables. Later work has extended this to model
problems with a set of continuous variables (F-DCOPs). In this paper, we
combine both of these models into the Mixed Integer Functional DCOP (MIF-DCOP)
model that can deal with problems regardless of its variables' type. We then
propose a novel algorithm, called Distributed Parallel Simulated Annealing
(DPSA), where agents cooperatively learn the optimal parameter configuration
for the algorithm while also solving the given problem using the learned
knowledge. Finally, we empirically benchmark our approach in DCOP, F-DCOP and
MIF-DCOP settings and show that DPSA produces solutions of significantly better
quality than the state-of-the-art non-exact algorithms in their corresponding
setting.

Title: Multi-agent maintenance scheduling based on the coordination between
  central operator and decentralized producers in an electricity market
Authors: Pegah Rokhforoz and Blazhe Gjorgiev and Giovanni Sansavini and Olga
  Fink
Categories: cs.MA
Comments: 17 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Condition-based and predictive maintenance enable early detection of critical
system conditions and thereby enable decision makers to forestall faults and
mitigate them. However, decision makers also need to take the operational and
production needs into consideration for optimal decision-making when scheduling
maintenance activities. Particularly in network systems, such as power grids,
decisions on the maintenance of single assets can affect the entire network and
are, therefore, more complex. This paper proposes a two-level multi-agent
decision support systems for the generation maintenance decision (GMS) of power
grids in an electricity markets. The aim of the GMS is to minimize the
generation cost while maximizing the system reliability. The proposed framework
integrates a central coordination system, i.e. the transmission system operator
(TSO), and distributed agents representing power generation units that act to
maximize their profit and decide about the optimal maintenance time slots while
ensuring the fulfilment of the energy demand. The objective function of agents
(power generation companies) is based on the reward and the penalty that they
obtain from the interplay between power production and loss of production due
to failure, respectively. The optimal strategy of agents is then derived using
a distributed algorithm, where agents choose their optimal maintenance decision
and send their decisions to the central coordinating system. The TSO decides
whether to accept the agents' decisions by considering the market reliability
aspects and power supply constraints. To solve this coordination problem, we
propose a negotiation algorithm using an incentive signal to coordinate the
agents' and central system's decisions such that all the agents' decisions can
be accepted by the central system. We demonstrate the efficiency of our
proposed algorithm using a IEEE 39 bus system.

Title: On Local Computation for Optimization in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Robin Brown, Federico Rossi, Kiril Solovey, Michael T. Wolf, and Marco
  Pavone
Categories: cs.MA cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  A number of prototypical optimization problems in multi-agent systems (e.g.
task allocation and network load-sharing) exhibit a highly local structure:
that is, each agent's decision variables are only directly coupled to few other
agent's variables through the objective function or the constraints.
Nevertheless, existing algorithms for distributed optimization generally do not
exploit the locality structure of the problem, requiring all agents to compute
or exchange the full set of decision variables. In this paper, we develop a
rigorous notion of "locality" that relates the structural properties of a
linearly-constrained convex optimization problem (in particular, the sparsity
structure of the constraint matrix and the objective function) to the amount of
information that agents should exchange to compute an arbitrarily high-quality
approximation to the problem from a cold-start. We leverage the notion of
locality to develop a locality-aware distributed optimization algorithm, and we
show that, for problems where individual agents only require to know a small
portion of the optimal solution, the algorithm requires very limited
inter-agent communication. Numerical results show that the convergence rate of
our algorithm is directly explained by the locality parameter proposed, and
that the proposed theoretical bounds are remarkably tight for well-conditioned
problems.

  An energy preserving reduced order model is developed for the nontraditional
shallow water equation (NTSWE) with full Coriolis force. The NTSWE in the
noncanonical Hamiltonian/Poisson form is discretized in space by finite
differences. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations is
integrated in time by the energy preserving average vector field (AVF) method.
The Poisson structure of the NTSWE in discretized exhibits a skew-symmetric
matrix depending on the state variables. An energy preserving, computationally
efficient reduced-order model (ROM) is constructed by proper orthogonal
decomposition with Galerkin projection. The nonlinearities are computed for the
ROM efficiently by discrete empirical interpolation method. Preservation of the
semi-discrete energy and the enstrophy are shown for the full order model, and
for the ROM which ensures the long term stability of the solutions. The
accuracy and computational efficiency of the ROMs are shown by two numerical
test problems

Title: Bulk-surface virtual element method for systems of coupled bulk-surface
  PDEs in two-space dimensions
Authors: Massimo Frittelli, Anotida Madzvamuse, Ivonne Sgura
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 40 pages, 7 figures
\\
  In this manuscript we present a novel bulk-surface virtual element method
(BSVEM) for the numerical approximation of coupled systems of elliptic and
parabolic bulk-surface partial differential equations (BSPDEs) in two
dimensions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed method is the
first application of the virtual element method [Beirao da Veiga et al., M3AS
(2013)] to BSPDEs. The BSVEM is based on the discretisation of the bulk domain
into polygonal elements with arbitrarily many edges, rather than just
triangles. The polygonal approximation of the bulk induces a piecewise linear
approximation of the one-dimensional surface (a curve). The bulk-surface finite
element method on triangular meshes [Elliott, Ranner, IMAJNA (2013)] is a
special case of the proposed method. The present work contains several
contributions. First, we show that the proposed method has optimal second-order
convergence in space, provided the exact solution is $H^{2+1/4}$ in the bulk
and $H^2$ on the surface, where the additional $\frac{1}{4}$ is required by the
combined effect of surface curvature and polygonal elements. Our analysis
shows, as a by-product, that first-degree virtual elements for bulk-only PDEs
retain optimal convergence in the presence of surface curvature. In carrying
out the analysis we provide novel theoretical tools for the analysis of curved
boundaries and non-constant boundary conditions, such as the Sobolev extension
and a special inverse trace operator. We show that general polygons can be
exploited to reduce the computational complexity of the matrix assembly.
Moreover, we present an optimised matrix implementation that can also be
exploited in the pre-existing special case of bulk-surface finite elements on
triangular meshes [Elliott, Ranner, IMAJNA (2013)]. Numerical examples
illustrate our findings and experimentally show the optimal convergence rates
in space and time.

theoretical background of time integration schemes and prove the relation

reach the desired order. Finally, we can also investigate the stability regions
for the ADER approach for different orders using several basis functions and
compare them with the DeC ansatz.

Title: Optimization-based modal decomposition for systems with multiple
  transports
Authors: Julius Reiss
Categories: math.NA cs.NA physics.flu-dyn
\\
  Mode-based model-reduction is used to reduce the degrees of freedom of high
dimensional systems, often by describing the system state by a linear
combination of spatial modes. Transport dominated phenomena, ubiquitous in
technical and scientific applications, often require a large number of linear
modes to obtain a small representation error. This difficulty, even for the
most simple transports, originates from the inappropriateness of the
decomposition structure in time dependent amplitudes of purely spatial modes.
  In this article an approach is discussed, which decomposes a flow field into
several fields of co-moving frames, where each one can be approximated by a few
modes. The method of decomposition is formulated as an optimization problem.
Different singular-value-based objective functions are discussed and connected
to former formulations. A boundary treatment is provided. The decomposition is
applied to generic cases and to a technically relevant flow configuration of
combustion physics.

Title: A multiscale scheme accurately simulates macroscale shocks in an
  equation-free framework
Authors: John Maclean, J. E. Bunder, A. J. Roberts
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.DS
Comments: 21 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Scientists and engineers often create accurate, trustworthy, computational
simulation schemes - but all too often these are too computationally expensive
to execute over the time or spatial domain of interest. The equation-free
approach is to marry such trusted simulations to a framework for numerical
macroscale reduction - the patch dynamics scheme. This article extends the
patch scheme to scenarios in which the trusted simulation resolves abrupt state
changes on the microscale that appear as shocks on the macroscale. Accurate
simulation for problems in these scenarios requires extending the patch scheme
by capturing the shock within a novel patch, and also modifying the patch
coupling rules in the vicinity in order to maintain accuracy. With these two
extensions to the patch scheme, straightforward arguments derive consistency
conditions that match the usual order of accuracy for patch schemes. The new
scheme is successfully tested on four archetypal problems. This technique will
empower scientists and engineers to accurately and efficiently simulate, over
large spatial domains, multiscale multiphysics systems that have rapid
transition layers on the microscale.

Title: Numerical analysis of two Galerkin discretizations with graded temporal
  grids for fractional evolution equations
Authors: Binjie Li, Tao Wang and Xiaoping Xie
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Two numerical methods with graded temporal grids are analyzed for fractional
evolution equations. One is a low-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
discretization in the case of fractional order $0<\alpha<1$, and the other one
is a low-order Petrov Galerkin (PG) discretization in the case of fractional
order $1<\alpha<2$. By a new duality technique, pointwise-in-time error
estimates of first-order and $ (3-\alpha) $-order temporal accuracies are
respectively derived for DG and PG, under reasonable regularity assumptions on
the initial value. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the
theoretical results.

Title: Performances of the mixed virtual element method on complex grids for
  underground flow
Authors: Alessio Fumagalli, Anna Scotti, and Luca Formaggia
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  The numerical simulation of physical processes in the underground frequently
entails challenges related to the geometry and/or data. The former are mainly
due to the shape of sedimentary layers and the presence of fractures and
faults, while the latter are connected to the properties of the rock matrix
which might vary abruptly in space. The development of approximation schemes
has recently focused on the overcoming of such difficulties with the objective
of obtaining numerical schemes with good approximation properties. In this work
we carry out a numerical study on the performances of the Mixed Virtual Element
Method (MVEM) for the solution of a single-phase flow model in fractured porous
media. This method is able to handle grid cells of polytopal type and treat
hybrid dimensional problems. It has been proven to be robust with respect to
the variation of the permeability field and of the shape of the elements. Our
numerical experiments focus on two test cases that cover several of the
aforementioned critical aspects.

Title: Fast implicit difference schemes for time-space fractional diffusion
  equations with the integral fractional Laplacian
Authors: Xian-Ming Gu, Hai-Wei Sun, Yanzhi Zhang, Yong-Liang Zhao
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 31pages, 11 tables, 4 figures
\\
  In this paper, we develop two fast implicit difference schemes for solving a
class of variable-coefficient time-space fractional diffusion equations with
integral fractional Laplacian (IFL). The proposed schemes utilize the graded
$L1$ formula and a special finite difference discretization for the Caputo
fractional derivative and IFL, respectively, where the graded mesh can capture
the model problem with a weak singularity at initial time. The stability and
convergence are rigorously proved via the $M$-matrix analysis, which is from
the spatial discretized matrix of IFL. Moreover, the proposed schemes use the
fast sum-of-exponential approximation and Toeplitz matrix algorithms to reduce
the computational cost for the nonlocal property of time and space fractional
derivatives, respectively. The fast schemes greatly reduce the computational
work of solving the discretized linear systems from $\mathcal{O}(MN^3 + M^2N)$
by a direct solver to $\mathcal{O}(MN(\log N + N_{exp}))$ per preconditioned
Krylov subspace iteration and a memory requirement from $O(MN^2)$ to
$O(NN_{exp})$, where $N$ and $(N_{exp} \ll)~M$ are the number of spatial and
temporal grid nodes. The spectrum of preconditioned matrix is also given for
ensuring the acceleration benefit of circulant preconditioners. Finally,
numerical results are presented to show the utility of the proposed methods.

\\
  In this paper we consider sweeping preconditioners for stratified media,
especially in the presence of reflections. In the most famous class of sweeping
preconditioners Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators for half-space problems are
approximated through absorbing boundary conditions. In the presence of
reflections absorbing boundary conditions are not accurate resulting in an
unsatisfactory performance of these sweeping preconditioners. We explore the
potential of using more accurate Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators within the
sweep. To this end, we make use of the separability of the equation for the
background model. While this improves the accuracy of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
operator, we find both from numerical tests and analytical arguments that it is
very sensitive to perturbations in the presence of reflections. This implies
that even if accurate approximations to Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators can be
devised for a stratified medium, sweeping preconditioners are limited to very
small perturbations.

\\
  It is well known that in the first-discretize-then-optimize approach in the
control of ordinary differential equations the adjoint method may converge
under additional order conditions only. For Peer two-step methods we derive
such adjoint order conditions and pay special attention to the boundary steps.
For $s$-stage methods, we prove convergence of order $s$ for the state
variables if the adjoint method satisfies the conditions for order $s\!-\!1$,
at least. We remove some bottlenecks at the boundaries encountered in an
earlier paper of the first author et al. [J. Comput. Appl. Math., 262:73-86,
2014] and discuss the construction of 3-stage methods for the order pair (3,2)
in detail including some matrix background for the combined forward and adjoint
order conditions. The impact of nodes having equal differences is highlighted.
It turns out that the most attractive methods are related to BDF. Three 3-stage
methods are constructed which show the expected orders in numerical tests.

Title: A nonconforming pressure-robust finite element method for the Stokes
  equations on anisotropic meshes
Authors: Thomas Apel, Volker Kempf, Alexander Linke, Christian Merdon
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 65N30, 65N15, 65D05
\\
  Most classical finite element schemes for the (Navier-)Stokes equations are
neither pressure-robust, nor are they inf-sup stable on general anisotropic
triangulations. A lack of pressure-robustness may lead to large velocity
errors, whenever the Stokes momentum balance is dominated by a strong and
complicated pressure gradient. It is a consequence of a method, which does not
exactly satisfy the divergence constraint. However, inf-sup stable schemes can
often be made pressure-robust just by a recent, modified discretization of the
exterior forcing term, using $\mathbf{H}(\operatorname{div})$-conforming
velocity reconstruction operators. This approach has so far only been analyzed
on shape-regular triangulations. The novelty of the present contribution is
that the reconstruction approach for the Crouzeix-Raviart method, which has a
stable Fortin operator on arbitrary meshes, is combined with results on the
interpolation error on anisotropic elements for reconstruction operators of
Raviart-Thomas and Brezzi-Douglas-Marini type, generalizing the method to a
large class of anisotropic triangulations. Numerical examples confirm the
theoretical results in a 2D and a 3D test case.

convergence properties when standard high order spatial (discontinuous
Galerkin) discretizations are used. After presenting a derivation of

nonlinear hyperbolic systems to demonstrate the optimal convergence rates. We

  End user AI is trained on large server farms with data collected from the
users. With ever increasing demand for IOT devices, there is a need for deep
learning approaches that can be implemented (at the edge) in an energy
efficient manner. In this work we approach this using spiking neural networks.
The unsupervised learning technique of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP)
using binary activations are used to extract features from spiking input data.
Gradient descent (backpropagation) is used only on the output layer to perform
the training for classification. The accuracies obtained for the balanced
EMNIST data set compare favorably with other approaches. The effect of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approximations on learning capabilities of
our network are also explored.

Title: A Proto-Object Based Dynamic Visual Saliency Model with an FPGA

\\
  The ability to attend to salient regions of a visual scene is an innate and
necessary preprocessing step for both biological and engineered systems
performing high-level visual tasks (e.g. object detection, tracking, and
classification). Computational efficiency, in regard to processing bandwidth
and speed, is improved by only devoting computational resources to salient
regions of the visual stimuli. In this paper, we first present a
biologically-plausible, bottom-up, dynamic visual saliency model based on the
notion of proto-objects. This is achieved by incorporating the temporal
characteristics of the visual stimulus into the model, similarly to the manner
in which early stages of the human visual system extracts temporal information.
This model outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic visual saliency models in
predicting human eye fixations on a commonly-used video dataset with associated
eye tracking data. Secondly, for this model to have practical applications, it
must be capable of performing its computations in real-time under lowpower,
small-size, and lightweight constraints. To address this, we introduce a
Field-Programmable Gate Array implementation of the model on an Opal Kelly 7350
Kintex-7 board. This novel hardware implementation allows for processing of up
to 23.35 frames per second running on a 100 MHz clock -- better than 26x
speedup from the software implementation.

  Dragonfly algorithm (DA) is one of the most recently developed heuristic
optimization algorithms by Mirjalili in 2016. It is now one of the most widely
used algorithms. In some cases, it outperforms the most popular algorithms.
However, this algorithm is not far from obstacles when it comes to complex
optimization problems. In this work, along with the strengths of the algorithm
in solving real-world optimization problems, the weakness of the algorithm to
optimize complex optimization problems is addressed. This survey presents a
comprehensive investigation of DA in the engineering area. First, an overview
of the algorithm is discussed. Additionally, the different variants of the
algorithm are addressed too. The combined versions of the DA with other
techniques and the modifications that have been done to make the algorithm work
better are shown. Besides, a survey on applications in engineering area that
used DA is offered. The algorithm is compared with some other metaheuristic
algorithms to demonstrate its ability to optimize problems comparing to the
others. The results of the algorithm from the works that utilized the DA in the
literature and the results of the benchmark functions showed that in comparison
with some other algorithms DA has an excellent performance, especially for
small to medium problems. Moreover, the bottlenecks of the algorithm and some
future trends are discussed. Authors conduct this research with the hope of
offering beneficial information about the DA to the researchers who want to
study the algorithm and utilize it to optimize engineering problems.

\\
  In this paper, we study the distributed computational capabilities of
device-to-device (D2D) networks. A key characteristic of D2D networks is that
their topologies are reconfigurable to cope with network demands. For
distributed computing, resource management is challenging due to limited
network and communication resources, leading to inter-channel interference. To
overcome this, recent research has addressed the problems of wireless
scheduling, subchannel allocation, power allocation, and multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) signal design, but has not considered them jointly. In
this paper, unlike previous mobile edge computing (MEC) approaches, we propose
a joint optimization of wireless MIMO signal design and network resource
allocation to maximize energy efficiency. Given that the resulting problem is a
non-convex mixed integer program (MIP) which is prohibitive to solve at scale,
we decompose its solution into two parts: (i) a resource allocation subproblem,
which optimizes the link selection and subchannel allocations, and (ii) MIMO
signal design subproblem, which optimizes the transmit beamformer, transmit
power, and receive combiner. Simulation results using wireless edge topologies
show that our method yields substantial improvements in energy efficiency
compared with cases of no offloading and partially optimized methods and that
the efficiency scales well with the size of the network.

  Factors driving success and failure in CS1 are the subject of much study but
less so for CS2. This paper investigates the transition from CS1 to CS2 in
search of leading indicators of success in CS2. Both CS1 and CS2 at the
University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) are taught in Python with annual
enrollments of 300 and 150 respectively. In this paper, we report on the
following research questions: 1) Are CS1 grades indicators of CS2 grades? 2)
Does a quantitative relationship exist between CS2 course grade and a modified
version of the SCS1 concept inventory? 3) What are the most challenging aspects
of CS2, and how well does CS1 prepare students for CS2 from the student's
perspective? We provide a quantitative analysis of 2300 CS1 and CS2 course
grades from 2013--2019. In Spring 2019, we administered a modified version of
the SCS1 concept inventory to 44 students in the first week of CS2. Further, 69
students completed an exit questionnaire at the conclusion of CS2 to gain
qualitative student feedback on their challenges in CS2 and on how well CS1
prepared them for CS2. We find that 56% of students' grades were lower in CS2
than CS1, 18% improved their grades, and 26% earned the same grade. Of the
changes, 62% were within one grade point. We find a statistically significant
correlation between the modified SCS1 score and CS2 grade points. Students
identify linked lists and class/object concepts among the most challenging.
Student feedback on CS2 challenges and the adequacy of their CS1 preparations
identify possible avenues for improving the CS1-CS2 transition.

Comments: Submitted to IROS with RA-L option, 2020
\\
  We present GLAS: Global-to-Local Autonomy Synthesis, a provably-safe,
automated distributed policy generation for multi-robot motion planning. Our
approach combines the advantage of centralized planning of avoiding local
minima with the advantage of decentralized controllers of scalability and
distributed computation. In particular, our synthesized policies only require
relative state information of nearby neighbors and obstacles, and compute a
provably-safe action. Our approach has three major components: i) we generate
demonstration trajectories using a global planner and extract local
observations from them, ii) we use deep imitation learning to learn a
decentralized policy that can run efficiently online, and iii) we introduce a
novel differentiable safety module to ensure collision-free operation, enabling
end-to-end policy training. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our
policies have a 20% higher success rate than ORCA across a wide range of robot
and obstacle densities. We demonstrate our method on an aerial swarm, executing
the policy on low-end microcontrollers in real-time.

Authors: Brian Hou, Sanjiban Choudhury, Gilwoo Lee, Aditya Mandalika,
  Siddhartha S. Srinivasa
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Collision checking is a computational bottleneck in motion planning,
requiring lazy algorithms that explicitly reason about when to perform this
computation. Optimism in the face of collision uncertainty minimizes the number
of checks before finding the shortest path. However, this may take a
prohibitively long time to compute, with no other feasible paths discovered
during this period. For many real-time applications, we instead demand strong
anytime performance, defined as minimizing the cumulative lengths of the
feasible paths yielded over time. We introduce Posterior Sampling for Motion
Planning (PSMP), an anytime lazy motion planning algorithm that leverages
learned posteriors on edge collisions to quickly discover an initial feasible
path and progressively yield shorter paths. PSMP obtains an expected regret
bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathcal{S} \mathcal{A} T})$ and outperforms
comparative baselines on a set of 2D and 7D planning problems.

Title: Efficient Multi-Agent Motion Planning in Continuous Workspaces Using
  Medial-Axis-Based Swap Graphs
Authors: Liang He, Zherong Pan, Biao Jia, and Dinesh Manocha
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  We present an algorithm for homogeneous, labeled, and disk-shaped multi-agent
motion planning in continuous workspaces with arbitrarily-shaped obstacles. Our
method consists of two steps. First, we convert the continuous free space into
a discrete graph where agents are placed on vertices and move along edges. On
the graph, a set of swap operations are defined and we ensure that performing
these swap operations will not lead to collisions between agents or with
obstacles. Second, we prove that it is possible for agents' locations to be
arbitrarily permuted on graph vertices using our swap operations, as long as
these graph vertices are not fully occupied. In other words, a multi-agent
motion planning problem on our graph is always solvable. Finally, we show that
such continuous-to-discrete conversion can be performed efficiently with the
help of a medial axis analysis and can be performed robustly for workspaces
with arbitrarily-shaped obstacles. Moreover, the resulting graph has many
vertices and can accommodate a large number of densely packed agents (up to
$69\%$ of the volume of free space), and motion plans can be computed
$10\times$ faster using our swap operations compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Title: Maximising Manipulability During Resolved-Rate Motion Control
Authors: Jesse Haviland and Peter Corke
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Under review for RA-L and IROS 2020. See project website
  https://jhavl.github.io/mmc
\\
  Resolved-rate motion control of redundant serial-link manipulators is
commonly achieved using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse in which the norm of
the control input is minimized. However, as kinematic singularities are a
significant issue for robotic manipulators, we propose a Manipulability Motion
Controller which chooses joint velocities which will also increase the
manipulability of the robot. The manipulability measure has a complex
non-linear relationship with the robot's joint configuration and in this paper
we derive the manipulability Jacobian which directly relates joint velocities
to the rate of change of manipulability. Furthermore, we use the manipulability
Jacobian within a constrained quadratic program to create an improved
resolved-rate motion controller for redundant robots. The resulting real-time
controller provides joint velocities which achieve a desired Cartesian
end-effector velocity while also maximising the robot's manipulability. We
illustrate and verify our control scheme on several popular serial-link
manipulators and provide an open-source library which implements our controller
(available at jhavl.github.io/mmc).

Title: Globally optimal consensus maximization for robust visual inertial
  localization in point and line map
Authors: Yanmei Jiao, Yue Wang, Bo Fu, Qimeng Tan, Lei Chen, Shoudong Huang,
  and Rong Xiong
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Map based visual inertial localization is a crucial step to reduce the drift
in state estimation of mobile robots. The underlying problem for localization
is to estimate the pose from a set of 3D-2D feature correspondences, of which
the main challenge is the presence of outliers, especially in changing
environment. In this paper, we propose a robust solution based on efficient
global optimization of the consensus maximization problem, which is insensitive
to high percentage of outliers. We first introduce translation invariant
measurements (TIMs) for both points and lines to decouple the consensus
maximization problem into rotation and translation subproblems, allowing for a
two-stage solver with reduced solution dimensions. Then we show that (i) the
rotation can be calculated by minimizing TIMs using only 1-dimensional
branch-and-bound (BnB), (ii) the translation can be found by running
1-dimensional search for three times with prioritized progressive voting.
Compared with the popular randomized solver, our solver achieves deterministic
global convergence without depending on an initial value. While compared with
existing BnB based methods, ours is exponentially faster. Finally, by
evaluating the performance on both simulation and real-world datasets, our
approach gives accurate pose even when there are 90\% outliers (only 2
inliers).

  Alpha N A self-powered, wheel driven Automated Delivery Robot is presented in
this paper. The ADR is capable of navigating autonomously by detecting and
avoiding objects or obstacles in its path. It uses a vector map of the path and
calculates the shortest path by Grid Count Method of Dijkstra Algorithm.
Landmark determination with Radio Frequency Identification tags are placed in
the path for identification and verification of source and destination, and
also for the recalibration of the current position. On the other hand, an
Object Detection Module is built by Faster RCNN with VGGNet16 architecture for
supporting path planning by detecting and recognizing obstacles. The Path
Planning System is combined with the output of the GCM, the RFID Reading System
and also by the binary results of ODM. This PPS requires a minimum speed of 200
RPM and 75 seconds duration for the robot to successfully relocate its position
by reading an RFID tag. In the result analysis phase, the ODM exhibits an
accuracy of 83.75 percent, RRS shows 92.3 percent accuracy and the PPS
maintains an accuracy of 85.3 percent. Stacking all these 3 modules, the ADR is
built, tested and validated which shows significant improvement in terms of
performance and usability comparing with other service robots.

  This paper introduces a rescue robot named Sigma 3 which is developed for
potential applications such as helping hands for humans where a human can not
reach to have an assessment of the hazardous environment. Also, these kinds of
robot can be controlled remotely with an adequate control system. The proposed
methodology forces on two issues : 1. Novel mechanism design for measuring
rotation, joints, links of Degree of Freedom DOF for an arm which is integrated
with Sigma 3, 2. Precise measuring of end effector motion control over three
dimensions. In the proposed mechanism design, the DOF measurement is presented
by a planar and spatial mechanism where 4 types of rigid joints build up each
DOF with controlling by six High Torque MG996R servo motors. Rotation and DOF
measurement are consisting of different theoretical references of Rotation
Matrix, Inverse Kinematics with experimental results. Presented methodology
over Oscillation Damping performance exhibits less than 3 percent error while
configuring for on hands testing. Another evaluation of operating time state
strongly defends the mechanism of low power consumption ability.

Title: Exploiting Variable Impedance for Energy Efficient Sequential Movements
Authors: Fan Wu and Matthew Howard
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 13 pages
\\
  Compliant robotics have seen successful applications in energy efficient
locomotion and cyclic manipulation. However, fully exploitation of variable
physical impedance for energy efficient sequential movements has not been
extensively addressed. This work employs a hierarchical approach to encapsulate
low-level optimal control for sub-movement generation into an outer loop of
iterative policy improvement, thereby benefits of both optimal control and
reinforcement learning are leveraged. The framework enables optimizing
efficiency trade-off for minimal energy expenses in a model-free manner, by
taking account of cost function weighting, variable impedance exploitation, and
transition timing, which are associated with the skill of compliance. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using two consecutive
reaching tasks on a variable impedance actuator. The results demonstrate
significant energy saving by improving the skill of compliance, with a 30%
electrical consumption reduction measured on hardware.

  Guidance for Robot Control
Authors: Ke Lin, Liang Gong, Xudong Li, Te Sun, Binhao Chen, Chengliang Liu,

Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have made important
achievements in many control tasks, they still suffer from the problems of
sample inefficiency and unstable training process, which are usually caused by
sparse rewards. Recently, some reinforcement learning from demonstration (RLfD)
methods have shown to be promising in overcoming these problems. However, they
usually require considerable demonstrations. In order to tackle these
challenges, on the basis of the SAC algorithm we propose a sample efficient
DRL-EG (DRL with efficient guidance) algorithm, in which a discriminator D(s)
and a guider G(s) are modeled by a small number of expert demonstrations. The
discriminator will determine the appropriate guidance states and the guider
will guide agents to better exploration in the training phase. Empirical
evaluation results from several continuous control tasks verify the
effectiveness and performance improvements of our method over other RL and RLfD
counterparts. Experiments results also show that DRL-EG can help the agent to
escape from a local optimum.

\\
  Tracking the pose of an object while it is being held and manipulated by a
robot hand is difficult for vision-based methods due to significant occlusions.
Prior works have explored using contact feedback and particle filters to
localize in-hand objects. However, they have mostly focused on the static grasp
setting and not when the object is in motion, as doing so requires modeling of
complex contact dynamics. In this work, we propose using GPU-accelerated
parallel robot simulations and derivative-free, sample-based optimizers to
track in-hand object poses with contact feedback during manipulation. We use
physics simulation as the forward model for robot-object interactions, and the
algorithm jointly optimizes for the state and the parameters of the
simulations, so they better match with those of the real world. Our method runs
in real-time (30Hz) on a single GPU, and it achieves an average point cloud
distance error of 6mm in simulation experiments and 13mm in the real-world
ones.

\\
  There is an increased demand for task automation in robots. Contact-rich
tasks, wherein multiple contact transitions occur in a series of operations,
are extensively being studied to realize high accuracy. In this study, we
propose a methodology that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve high
performance in robots for the execution of assembly tasks that require precise
contact with objects without causing damage. The proposed method ensures the
online generation of stiffness matrices that help improve the performance of
local trajectory optimization. The method has an advantage of rapid response
owing to short sampling time of the trajectory planning. The effectiveness of
the method was verified via experiments involving two contact-rich tasks. The
results indicate that the proposed method can be implemented in various
contact-rich manipulations. A demonstration video shows the performance.

Title: Safe and Compliant Control of Redundant Robots Using a Stack of Passive
  Task-Space Controllers
Authors: Carlo Tiseo, Wolfgang Merkt, Wouter Wolfslag, Sethu Vijayakumar and
  Michael Mistry
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Safe and compliant control of dynamic systems in interaction with the
environment, e.g., in shared workspaces, continues to represent a major
challenge. Mismatches in the dynamic model of the robots, numerical
singularities, and the intrinsic environmental unpredictability are all
contributing factors.Online optimization of impedance controllers has recently
shown great promise in addressing this challenge, however, their performance is
not sufficiently robust to be deployed in challenging environments. This work
proposes a compliant control method for redundant manipulators based on a stack
of multiple passive task-space controllers. Our control framework of passive
controllers is inherently stable, numerically well-conditioned (as no matrix
inversions are required), and computationally inexpensive (as no optimization
is used). We leverage and introduce a novel stiffness profile for a recently
proposed passive controller with smooth transitions between the divergence and
convergence phases making it particularly suitable when multiple passive
controllers are combined in a stack. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves sub-centimeter tracking performance during dynamic
demanding tasks with fast-changing references, while remaining safe to interact
with and robust to singularities. The proposed framework achieves this without
knowledge of the robot dynamics and thanks to its passivity is intrinsically
stable. The data further shows that the robot can fully take advantage of the
null-space to maintain the primary task accuracy while compensating for
external perturbations.

Title: Self-Supervised Deep Pose Corrections for Robust Visual Odometry
Authors: Brandon Wagstaff, Valentin Peretroukhin, Jonathan Kelly
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Accepted to the 2020 International Conference on Robotics and
  Automation (ICRA)
\\
  We present a self-supervised deep pose correction (DPC) network that applies
pose corrections to a visual odometry estimator to improve its accuracy.
Instead of regressing inter-frame pose changes directly, we build on prior work
that uses data-driven learning to regress pose corrections that account for
systematic errors due to violations of modelling assumptions. Our
self-supervised formulation removes any requirement for six-degrees-of-freedom
ground truth and, in contrast to expectations, often improves overall
navigation accuracy compared to a supervised approach. Through extensive
experiments, we show that our self-supervised DPC network can significantly
enhance the performance of classical monocular and stereo odometry estimators
and substantially out-performs state-of-the-art learning-only approaches.

  Semantic Planning in Unexplored Semantic Environments Using Deep Perceptual

\\
  This paper presents a reactive planning system that enriches the topological
representation of an environment with a tightly integrated semantic
representation, achieved by incorporating and exploiting advances in deep
perceptual learning and probabilistic semantic reasoning. Our architecture
combines object detection with semantic SLAM, affording robust, reactive
logical as well as geometric planning in unexplored environments. Moreover, by
incorporating a human mesh estimation algorithm, our system is capable of
reacting and responding in real time to semantically labeled human motions and
gestures. New formal results allow tracking of suitably non-adversarial moving
targets, while maintaining the same collision avoidance guarantees. We suggest
the empirical utility of the proposed control architecture with a numerical
study including comparisons with a state-of-the-art dynamic replanning
algorithm, and physical implementation on both a wheeled and legged platform in
different settings with both geometric and semantic goals.

Title: DSSLP: A Distributed Framework for Semi-supervised Link Prediction
Authors: Dalong Zhang, Xianzheng Song, Ziqi Liu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Xin Huang, Lin

Categories: cs.SI cs.LG
\\
  Link prediction is widely used in a variety of industrial applications, such
as merchant recommendation, fraudulent transaction detection, and so on.
However, it's a great challenge to train and deploy a link prediction model on
industrial-scale graphs with billions of nodes and edges. In this work, we
present a scalable and distributed framework for semi-supervised link
prediction problem (named DSSLP), which is able to handle industrial-scale
graphs. Instead of training model on the whole graph, DSSLP is proposed to
train on the \emph{$k$-hops neighborhood} of nodes in a mini-batch setting,
which helps reduce the scale of the input graph and distribute the training
procedure. In order to generate negative examples effectively, DSSLP contains a
distributed batched runtime sampling module. It implements uniform and dynamic
sampling approaches, and is able to adaptively construct positive and negative
examples to guide the training process. Moreover, DSSLP proposes a model-split
strategy to accelerate the speed of inference process of the link prediction
task. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness and efficiency of
DSSLP in serval public datasets as well as real-world datasets of
industrial-scale graphs.

Title: Node Immunization with Non-backtracking Eigenvalues
Authors: Leo Torres, Kevin S. Chan, Hanghang Tong, Tina Eliassi-Rad
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  The non-backtracking matrix and its eigenvalues have many applications in
network science and graph mining, such as node and edge centrality, community
detection, length spectrum theory, graph distance, and epidemic and percolation
thresholds. Moreover, in network epidemiology, the reciprocal of the largest
eigenvalue of the non-backtracking matrix is a good approximation for the
epidemic threshold of certain network dynamics. In this work, we develop
techniques that identify which nodes have the largest impact on the leading
non-backtracking eigenvalue. We do so by studying the behavior of the spectrum
of the non-backtracking matrix after a node is removed from the graph. From
this analysis we derive two new centrality measures: X-degree and
X-non-backtracking centrality. We perform extensive experimentation with
targeted immunization strategies derived from these two centrality measures.
Our spectral analysis and centrality measures can be broadly applied, and will
be of interest to both theorists and practitioners alike.

Title: Analysis of Attack via Grounding and Countermeasures in Discrete-Time
  Consensus Networks
Authors: Yamin Yan, Sonja Stuedli, Maria M. Seron, Richard H. Middleton
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 21st IFAC World Congress, 2020, to appear
\\
  We investigate the disruption of discrete-time consensus problems via
grounding. Loosely speaking, grounding a network occurs if the state of one
agent no longer responds to inputs from other agents and/or changes its
dynamics. Then, the agent becomes a leader or a so called stubborn agent. The
disruption of the agent can be caused by internal faults, safety protocols or
externally due to a malicious attack. In this paper we investigate how the
grounding affects the eigenratio of expander graph families that usually
exhibit good scaling properties with increasing network size. It is shown that
the algebraic connectivity and eigenratio of the network will decrease due to
the grounding causing the performance and scalability of the network to
deteriorate, even to the point of losing consensusability. We then present
countermeasures to such interruptions both in a passive and active manner. Our
findings are supported by numerical simulations given within the paper.

\\
  Integral reinforcement learning (IRL) was proposed in literature to obviate
the requirement of drift dynamics in adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)
framework. Most of the online and On-policy IRL schemes that have been
presented in literature require two sets of neural network (NNs), known as
actor-critic NN and an initial stabilizing controller. Additionally, these
schemes require the information of control coupling dynamics. Quite recently, a
novel update law with stabilizing term was proposed to update the critic NN
weights in ADP framework thereby obviating the requirement of initial
stabilizing controller. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been
no study on leveraging such stabilizing term in IRL algorithm framework to
solve optimal trajectory tracking problems for continuous time nonlinear
systems with actuator constraints. To this end an "identifier-critic"
approximation framework along with a novel update law leveraging the
stabilizing term with variable gain gradient descent in IRL algorithm coupled
with simultaneous identifier is presented in this paper. Experience replay (ER)
technique is utilized in both identifier and critic NNs to efficiently learn
the NN weights. The most salient feature of the presented update law is its
variable learning rate, which scales the pace of learning based on
instantaneous Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) error and rate of variation of
Lyapunov function along the system trajectories. Variable learning rate helps
in achieving tighter residual set for augmented states and error in NN weights
as shown in uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) stability proof. The numerical
studies validate the presented "identifier-critic" framework on nonlinear
systems.

  The ability to handle single molecules as effectively as macroscopic
building-blocks would enable the construction of complex supramolecular
structures that are not accessible by self-assembly. The fundamental challenges
on the way towards this goal are the uncontrolled variability and poor
observability of atomic-scale conformations. Here, we present a strategy to
work around both obstacles, and demonstrate autonomous robotic nanofabrication
by manipulating single molecules. Our approach employs reinforcement learning
(RL), which is able to learn solution strategies even in the face of large
uncertainty and with sparse feedback. However, to be useful for autonomous
nanofabrication, standard RL algorithms need to be adapted to cope with the
limited training opportunities available. We demonstrate the potential of our
RL approach by applying it to an exemplary task of subtractive manufacturing,
the removal of individual molecules from a molecular layer using a scanning
probe microscope (SPM). Our RL agent reaches an excellent performance level,
enabling us to automate a task which previously had to be performed by a human.
We anticipate that our work opens the way towards autonomous agents for the
robotic construction of functional supramolecular structures with speed,
precision and perseverance beyond our current capabilities.

Title: Quantum Distributed Complexity of Set Disjointness on a Line
Authors: Frederic Magniez and Ashwin Nayak
Categories: quant-ph cs.CC cs.DC
Comments: 19 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Given $x,y\in\{0,1\}^n$, Set Disjointness consists in deciding whether
$x_i=y_i=1$ for some index $i \in [n]$. We study the problem of computing this
function in a distributed computing scenario in which the inputs $x$ and $y$
are given to the processors at the two extremities of a path of length $d$. Set
Disjointness on a Line was introduced by Le Gall and Magniez (PODC 2018) for
proving lower bounds on the quantum distributed complexity of computing the
diameter of an arbitrary network in the CONGEST model.
  In this work, we prove an unconditional lower bound of
$\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt[3]{n d^2}+\sqrt{n} )$ rounds for Set Disjointness on
a Line. This is the first non-trivial lower bound when there is no restriction
on the memory used by the processors. The result gives us a new lower bound of
$\widetilde{\Omega} (\sqrt[3]{n\delta^2}+\sqrt{n} )$ on the number of rounds
required for computing the diameter $\delta$ of any $n$-node network with
quantum messages of size $O(\log n)$ in the CONGEST model.
  We draw a connection between the distributed computing scenario above and a
new model of query complexity. In this model, an algorithm computing a
bi-variate function $f$ has access to the inputs $x$ and $y$ through two
separate oracles $O_x$ and $O_y$, respectively. The restriction is that the
algorithm is required to alternately make $d$ queries to $O_x$ and $d$ queries
to $O_y$. The technique we use for deriving the round lower bound for Set
Disjointness on a Line also applies to the number of rounds in this query
model. We provide an algorithm for Set Disjointness in this query model with
round complexity that matches the round lower bound stated above, up to a
polylogarithmic factor. In this sense, the round lower bound we show for Set
Disjointness on a Line is optimal.

convert between two coins through an intermediary coin, and obtain a favorable
exchange rate compared to the direct one. We measure the profitability of this
strategy, characterize its risks, and outline two strategies that algorithmic
trading bots use to mitigate their losses. We find that this strategy yields an
exchange ratio that is $0.144\%$, or $14.4$ basis points (bps) better than the
direct exchange ratio. $2.71\%$ of all trades on Binance are attributable to
this strategy.

Title: Max-Affine Spline Insights into Deep Generative Networks
Authors: Randall Balestriero, Sebastien Paris, Richard Baraniuk
Categories: stat.ML cs.CG cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We connect a large class of Generative Deep Networks (GDNs) with spline
operators in order to derive their properties, limitations, and new
opportunities. By characterizing the latent space partition, dimension and
angularity of the generated manifold, we relate the manifold dimension and
approximation error to the sample size. The manifold-per-region affine subspace
defines a local coordinate basis; we provide necessary and sufficient
conditions relating those basis vectors with disentanglement. We also derive
the output probability density mapped onto the generated manifold in terms of
the latent space density, which enables the computation of key statistics such
as its Shannon entropy. This finding also enables the computation of the GDN
likelihood, which provides a new mechanism for model comparison as well as
providing a quality measure for (generated) samples under the learned
distribution. We demonstrate how low entropy and/or multimodal distributions
are not naturally modeled by DGNs and are a cause of training instabilities.

Title: SkinAugment: Auto-Encoding Speaker Conversions for Automatic Speech
  Translation
Authors: Arya D. McCarthy and Liezl Puzon and Juan Pino
Categories: eess.AS cs.CL cs.SD
Comments: Accepted to ICASSP 2020
\\
  We propose autoencoding speaker conversion for training data augmentation in
automatic speech translation. This technique directly transforms an audio
sequence, resulting in audio synthesized to resemble another speaker's voice.
Our method compares favorably to SpecAugment on English$\to$French and
English$\to$Romanian automatic speech translation (AST) tasks as well as on a
low-resource English automatic speech recognition (ASR) task. Further, in
ablations, we show the benefits of both quantity and diversity in augmented
data. Finally, we show that we can combine our approach with augmentation by
machine-translated transcripts to obtain a competitive end-to-end AST model
that outperforms a very strong cascade model on an English$\to$French AST task.
Our method is sufficiently general that it can be applied to other speech
generation and analysis tasks.

Title: A Quantum Money Solution to the Blockchain Scalability Problem
Authors: Andrea Coladangelo, Or Sattath
Categories: quant-ph cs.CR
Comments: This work supersedes arXiv:1902.05214
\\
  We put forward the idea that classical blockchains and smart contracts are
potentially useful primitives not only for classical cryptography, but for
quantum cryptography as well. Abstractly, a smart contract is a functionality
that allows parties to deposit funds, and release them upon fulfillment of
algorithmically checkable conditions, and can thus be employed as a formal tool
to enforce monetary incentives.
  In this work, we give the first example of the use of smart contracts in a
quantum setting. We describe a simple hybrid classical-quantum payment system
whose main ingredients are a classical blockchain capable of handling stateful
smart contracts, and quantum lightning, a strengthening of public-key quantum
money introduced by Zhandry (Eurocrypt'19). Our hybrid payment system employs
quantum states as banknotes and a classical blockchain to settle disputes and
to keep track of the valid serial numbers. It has several desirable properties:
it is decentralized, requiring no trust in any single entity; payments are as
quick as quantum communication, regardless of the total number of users; when a
quantum banknote is damaged or lost, the rightful owner can recover the lost
value.

Title: PAPRIKA: Private Online False Discovery Rate Control
Authors: Wanrong Zhang, Gautam Kamath, Rachel Cummings
Categories: stat.ML cs.CR cs.DS cs.LG math.ST stat.ME stat.TH
\\
  In hypothesis testing, a false discovery occurs when a hypothesis is
incorrectly rejected due to noise in the sample. When adaptively testing
multiple hypotheses, the probability of a false discovery increases as more
tests are performed. Thus the problem of False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is
to find a procedure for testing multiple hypotheses that accounts for this
effect in determining the set of hypotheses to reject. The goal is to minimize
the number (or fraction) of false discoveries, while maintaining a high true
positive rate (i.e., correct discoveries).
  In this work, we study False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in multiple
hypothesis testing under the constraint of differential privacy for the sample.
Unlike previous work in this direction, we focus on the online setting, meaning
that a decision about each hypothesis must be made immediately after the test
is performed, rather than waiting for the output of all tests as in the offline
setting. We provide new private algorithms based on state-of-the-art results in
non-private online FDR control. Our algorithms have strong provable guarantees
for privacy and statistical performance as measured by FDR and power. We also
provide experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in a
variety of data environments.

\\
  Typically, binary classification lens-finding schemes are used to
discriminate between lens candidates and non-lenses. However, these models
often suffer from substantial false-positive classifications. Such false
positives frequently occur due to images containing objects such as crowded
sources, galaxies with arms, and also images with a central source and smaller
surrounding sources. Therefore, a model might confuse the stated circumstances
with an Einstein ring. It has been proposed that by allowing such commonly
misclassified image types to constitute their own classes, machine learning
models will more easily be able to learn the difference between images that
contain real lenses, and images that contain lens imposters. Using Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) images, in the F814W filter, we compare the usage of binary and
multi-class classification models applied to the lens finding task. From our
findings, we conclude there is not a significant benefit to using the
multi-class model over a binary model. We will also present the results of a
simple lens search using a multi-class machine learning model, and potential
new lens candidates.

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.MM
Comments: Accepted by ICASSP 2020
\\
  Banding artifact, or false contouring, is a common video compression
impairment that tends to appear on large flat regions in encoded videos. These
staircase-shaped color bands can be very noticeable in high-definition videos.
Here we study this artifact, and propose a new distortion-specific no-reference
video quality model for predicting banding artifacts, called the Blind BANding
Detector (BBAND index). BBAND is inspired by human visual models. The proposed
detector can generate a pixel-wise banding visibility map and output a banding
severity score at both the frame and video levels. Experimental results show
that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art banding detection
algorithms and delivers better consistency with subjective evaluations.

Title: Segmentation-based Method combined with Dynamic Programming for Brain
  Midline Delineation
Authors: Shen Wang, Kongming Liang, Chengwei Pan, Chuyang Ye, Xiuli Li, Feng
  Liu, Yizhou Yu, Yizhou Wang
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  The midline related pathological image features are crucial for evaluating
the severity of brain compression caused by stroke or traumatic brain injury
(TBI). The automated midline delineation not only improves the assessment and
clinical decision making for patients with stroke symptoms or head trauma but
also reduces the time of diagnosis. Nevertheless, most of the previous methods
model the midline by localizing the anatomical points, which are hard to detect
or even missing in severe cases. In this paper, we formulate the brain midline
delineation as a segmentation task and propose a three-stage framework. The
proposed framework firstly aligns an input CT image into the standard space.
Then, the aligned image is processed by a midline detection network (MD-Net)
integrated with the CoordConv Layer and Cascade AtrousCconv Module to obtain
the probability map. Finally, we formulate the optimal midline selection as a
pathfinding problem to solve the problem of the discontinuity of midline
delineation. Experimental results show that our proposed framework can achieve
superior performance on one in-house dataset and one public dataset.

Title: Two-stage breast mass detection and segmentation system towards
  automated high-resolution full mammogram analysis
Authors: Yutong Yan, Pierre-Henri Conze, Gwenol\'e Quellec, Mathieu Lamard,

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Mammography is the primary imaging modality used for early detection and
diagnosis of breast cancer. Mammography analysis mainly refers to the
extraction of regions of interest around tumors, followed by a segmentation
step, which is essential to further classification of benign or malignant
tumors. Breast masses are the most important findings among breast
abnormalities. However, manual delineation of masses from native mammogram is a
time consuming and error-prone task. An integrated computer-aided diagnosis
system to assist radiologists in automatically detecting and segmenting breast
masses is therefore in urgent need. We propose a fully-automated approach that
guides accurate mass segmentation from full mammograms at high resolution
through a detection stage. First, mass detection is performed by an efficient
deep learning approach, You-Only-Look-Once, extended by integrating multi-scale
predictions to improve automatic candidate selection. Second, a convolutional
encoder-decoder network using nested and dense skip connections is employed to
fine-delineate candidate masses. Unlike most previous studies based on
segmentation from regions, our framework handles mass segmentation from native
full mammograms without user intervention. Trained on INbreast and DDSM-CBIS
public datasets, the pipeline achieves an overall average Dice of 80.44% on
high-resolution INbreast test images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
Our system shows promising accuracy as an automatic full-image mass
segmentation system. The comprehensive evaluation provided for both detection
and segmentation stages reveals strong robustness to the diversity of size,
shape and appearance of breast masses, towards better computer-aided diagnosis.

\\
  CT image denoising can be treated as an image-to-image translation task where
the goal is to learn the transform between a source domain $X$ (noisy images)
and a target domain $Y$ (clean images). Recently, cycle-consistent adversarial
denoising network (CCADN) has achieved state-of-the-art results by enforcing
cycle-consistent loss without the need of paired training data. Our detailed
analysis of CCADN raises a number of interesting questions. For example, if the
noise is large leading to significant difference between domain $X$ and domain
$Y$, can we bridge $X$ and $Y$ with an intermediate domain $Z$ such that both
the denoising process between $X$ and $Z$ and that between $Z$ and $Y$ are
easier to learn? As such intermediate domains lead to multiple cycles, how do
we best enforce cycle-consistency? Driven by these questions, we propose a
multi-cycle-consistent adversarial network (MCCAN) that builds intermediate
domains and enforces both local and global cycle-consistency. The global
cycle-consistency couples all generators together to model the whole denoising
process, while the local cycle-consistency imposes effective supervision on the
process between adjacent domains. Experiments show that both local and global
cycle-consistency are important for the success of MCCAN, which outperforms the
state-of-the-art.

  Structured convex optimization on weighted graphs finds numerous applications
in machine learning and computer vision. In this work, we propose a novel
adaptive preconditioning strategy for proximal algorithms on this problem
class. Our preconditioner is driven by a sharp analysis of the local linear
convergence rate depending on the "active set" at the current iterate. We show
that nested-forest decomposition of the inactive edges yields a guaranteed
local linear convergence rate. Further, we propose a practical greedy heuristic
which realizes such nested decompositions and show in several numerical
experiments that our reconditioning strategy, when applied to proximal gradient
or primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm, achieves competitive performances.
Our results suggest that local convergence analysis can serve as a guideline
for selecting variable metrics in proximal algorithms.

  Providing closed and well-connected boundaries of coronary artery is
essential to assist cardiologists in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease
(CAD). Recently, several deep learning-based methods have been proposed for
boundary detection and segmentation in a medical image. However, when applied
to coronary wall detection, they tend to produce disconnected and inaccurate
boundaries. In this paper, we propose a novel boundary detection method for
coronary arteries that focuses on the continuity and connectivity of the
boundaries. In order to model the spatial continuity of consecutive images, our
hybrid architecture takes a volume (i.e., a segment of the coronary artery) as
input and detects the boundary of the target slice (i.e., the central slice of
the segment). Then, to ensure closed boundaries, we propose a
contour-constrained weighted Hausdorff distance loss. We evaluate our method on
a dataset of 34 patients of coronary CT angiography scans with curved planar
reconstruction (CCTA-CPR) of the arteries (i.e., cross-sections). Experiment
results show that our method can produce smooth closed boundaries outperforming
the state-of-the-art accuracy.

  Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, $S\subseteq V$ is a dominating set if every $v\in
V\setminus S$ is adjacent to an element of $S$. The Minimum Dominating Set

that its decision version is $NP$-complete even when $G$ is a claw-free graph.
We give a complexity dichotomy for the Minimum Dominating Set problem for the
class of $(claw, H)$-free graphs when $H$ has at most six vertices. In an
intermediate step we show that the Minimum Dominating Set problem is
$NP$-complete for cubic graphs.

Title: Fillings of skew shapes avoiding diagonal patterns

Categories: math.CO cs.DM
Comments: 20 pages, 14 figures
\\
  A skew shape is the difference of two top-left justified Ferrers shapes
sharing the same top-left corner. We study integer fillings of skew shapes. As
our first main result, we show that for a specific hereditary class of skew
shapes, which we call D-free shapes, the fillings that avoid a north-east chain
of size $k$ are in bijection with fillings that avoid a south-east chain of the
same size. Since Ferrers shapes are a subclass of D-free shapes, this result
can be seen as a generalization of previous analogous results for Ferrers
shapes.
  As our second main result, we construct a bijection between 01-fillings of an
arbitrary skew shape that avoid a south-east chain of size 2, and the
01-fillings of the same shape that simultaneously avoid a north-east chain of
size 2 and a particular non-square subfilling. This generalizes a previous
result for transversal fillings.

  We consider uncertainty aware compressive sensing when the prior distribution

high dimensional objects conditioned on these measurements. We first show that
the conditional sampling problem is hard in general, and thus we consider
approximations to the problem. We develop a variational approach to conditional
sampling that composes a new generative model with the given generative model.
This allows us to utilize the sampling ability of the given generative model to
quickly generate samples from the conditional distribution.

  Spectrum Access
Authors: Kunlun Wang, Qingqing Wu, Wen Chen, Yang Yang, and Derrick Wing Kwan
  Ng
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, an energy-efficient cross-layer design framework is proposed
for cooperative relaying networks, which takes into account the influence of
spectrum utilization probability. Specifically, random arrival traffic is
considered and an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme is adopted in the
cooperative transmission system to improve the system performance. The average
packet dropping rate of the relay-buffer is studied at first. With the packet
dropping rate and stationary distribution of the system state, the closed-form
expression of the delay is derived. Then the energy efficiency for
relay-assisted transmission is investigated, which takes into account the
queueing process of the relay and the source. In this context, an energy
efficiency optimization problem is formulated to determine the optimum strategy
of power and time allocation for the relay-assisted cooperative system.
Finally, the energy efficient switching strategy between the relay assisted
transmission and the direct transmission is obtained, where packet
transmissions have different delay requirements. In addition, energy efficient
transmission policy with AMC is obtained. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed design improving the energy efficiency.

Authors: Masahito Hayashi and Kun Fang
Categories: quant-ph cs.IT math-ph math.IT math.MP
Comments: 16 pages, 2 figures; comments are welcome
\\
  We introduce a variant of randomness extraction framework in the context of
quantum coherence theory where free incoherent operations are allowed before
the incoherent measurement and the randomness extractors. This cryptographic
framework opens a new perspective to the study of quantum coherence
distillation by an exact one-shot relation, that is, the maximum number of
random bits extractable from a given quantum state is precisely equal to the
maximum number of coherent bits that can be distilled from the same state. This
relation enables us to derive tight second order expansions of both tasks in
the independent and identically distributed setting. Remarkably, the incoherent
operation classes that can empower coherence distillation for generic states
all admit the same second order expansions, indicating their operational
equivalence for coherence distillation in both asymptotic and large block
length regimes. As a by-product, we showcase an alternative proof of the strong
converse property of coherence distillation and randomness extraction from
their second order expansions.

Title: Low Complexity Iterative Receiver Design for Sparse Code Multiple Access
Authors: Fan Wei and Wen Chen
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is one of the most promising methods among
all the non-orthogonal multiple access techniques in the future 5G
communication. Compared with some other non-orthogonal multiple access
techniques such as low density signature (LDS), SCMA can achieve better
performance due to the shaping gain of the SCMA codewords. However, despite of
the sparsity of the codewords, the decoding complexity of the current message
passing algorithm (MPA) utilized by SCMA is still prohibitively high. In this
paper, by exploring the lattice structure of SCMA codewords, we propose a low
complexity decoding algorithm based on list sphere decoding (LSD). The LSD
avoids the exhaustive search for all possible hypotheses and only considers
signal within a hypersphere. As LSD can be viewed a depth-first tree search
algorithm, we further propose several methods to prune the redundancy visited
nodes in order to reduce the size of the search tree. Simulation results show
that the proposed algorithm can reduce the decoding complexity substantially
while the performance loss compared with the existing algorithm is negligible.

Title: Stochastic Frank-Wolfe for Constrained Finite-Sum Minimization
Authors: Geoffrey N\'egiar, Gideon Dresdner, Alicia Tsai, Laurent El Ghaoui,
  Francesco Locatello, Fabian Pedregosa
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
\\
  We propose a novel Stochastic Frank-Wolfe (a.k.a.\ Conditional Gradient)
algorithm with a fixed batch size tailored to the constrained optimization of a
finite sum of smooth objectives. The design of our method hinges on a
primal-dual interpretation of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.
  Recent work to design stochastic variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm falls
into two categories: algorithms with increasing batch size, and algorithms with
a given, constant, batch size. The former have faster convergence rates but are
impractical; the latter are practical but slower. The proposed method combines
the advantages of both: it converges for unit batch size, and has faster
theoretical worst-case rates than previous unit batch size algorithms. Our
experiments also show faster empirical convergence than previous unit batch
size methods for several tasks.
  Finally, we construct a stochastic estimator of the Frank-Wolfe gap. It
allows us to bound the true Frank-Wolfe gap, which in the convex setting bounds
the primal-dual gap in the convex case while in general is a measure of
stationarity. Our gap estimator can therefore be used as a practical stopping
criterion in all cases.

Title: State-only Imitation with Transition Dynamics Mismatch
Authors: Tanmay Gangwani, Jian Peng
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: ICLR 2020 camera-ready
\\
  Imitation Learning (IL) is a popular paradigm for training agents to achieve
complicated goals by leveraging expert behavior, rather than dealing with the
hardships of designing a correct reward function. With the environment modeled
as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), most of the existing IL algorithms are
contingent on the availability of expert demonstrations in the same MDP as the
one in which a new imitator policy is to be learned. This is uncharacteristic
of many real-life scenarios where discrepancies between the expert and the
imitator MDPs are common, especially in the transition dynamics function.
Furthermore, obtaining expert actions may be costly or infeasible, making the
recent trend towards state-only IL (where expert demonstrations constitute only
states or observations) ever so promising. Building on recent adversarial
imitation approaches that are motivated by the idea of divergence minimization,
we present a new state-only IL algorithm in this paper. It divides the overall
optimization objective into two subproblems by introducing an indirection step
and solves the subproblems iteratively. We show that our algorithm is
particularly effective when there is a transition dynamics mismatch between the
expert and imitator MDPs, while the baseline IL methods suffer from performance
degradation. To analyze this, we construct several interesting MDPs by
modifying the configuration parameters for the MuJoCo locomotion tasks from
OpenAI Gym.

Title: Weak Supervision in Convolutional Neural Network for Semantic
  Segmentation of Diffuse Lung Diseases Using Partially Annotated Dataset
Authors: Yuki Suzuki, Kazuki Yamagata, Yanagawa Masahiro, Shoji Kido, Noriyuki
  Tomiyama
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Computer-aided diagnosis system for diffuse lung diseases (DLDs) is necessary
for the objective assessment of the lung diseases. In this paper, we develop
semantic segmentation model for 5 kinds of DLDs. DLDs considered in this work
are consolidation, ground glass opacity, honeycombing, emphysema, and normal.
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most promising technique for
semantic segmentation among machine learning algorithms. While creating
annotated dataset for semantic segmentation is laborious and time consuming,
creating partially annotated dataset, in which only one chosen class is
annotated for each image, is easier since annotators only need to focus on one
class at a time during the annotation task. In this paper, we propose a new
weak supervision technique that effectively utilizes partially annotated
dataset. The experiments using partially annotated dataset composed 372 CT
images demonstrated that our proposed technique significantly improved
segmentation accuracy.

Title: Fast and Three-rious: Speeding Up Weak Supervision with Triplet Methods
Authors: Daniel Y. Fu, Mayee F. Chen, Frederic Sala, Sarah M. Hooper, Kayvon

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Weak supervision is a popular method for building machine learning models
without relying on ground truth annotations. Instead, it generates
probabilistic training labels by estimating the accuracies of multiple noisy
labeling sources (e.g., heuristics, crowd workers). Existing approaches use
latent variable estimation to model the noisy sources, but these methods can be
computationally expensive, scaling superlinearly in the data. In this work, we
show that, for a class of latent variable models highly applicable to weak
supervision, we can find a closed-form solution to model parameters, obviating
the need for iterative solutions like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We use
this insight to build FlyingSquid, a weak supervision framework that runs
orders of magnitude faster than previous weak supervision approaches and
requires fewer assumptions. In particular, we prove bounds on generalization
error without assuming that the latent variable model can exactly parameterize
the underlying data distribution. Empirically, we validate FlyingSquid on
benchmark weak supervision datasets and find that it achieves the same or
higher quality compared to previous approaches without the need to tune an SGD
procedure, recovers model parameters 170 times faster on average, and enables
new video analysis and online learning applications.

Title: Can We Find Near-Approximately-Stationary Points of Nonsmooth Nonconvex
  Functions?
Authors: Ohad Shamir
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
Comments: 18 pages
\\
  It is well-known that given a bounded, smooth nonconvex function, standard
gradient-based methods can find $\epsilon$-stationary points (where the
gradient norm is less than $\epsilon$) in $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$
iterations. However, many important nonconvex optimization problems, such as
those associated with training modern neural networks, are inherently not
smooth, making these results inapplicable. Moreover, as recently pointed out in
Zhang et al. [2020], it is generally impossible to provide finite-time
guarantees for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of nonsmooth functions.
Perhaps the most natural relaxation of this is to find points which are near
such $\epsilon$-stationary points. In this paper, we show that even this
relaxed goal is hard to obtain in general, given only black-box access to the
function values and gradients. We conclude with a discussion of the result and
its implications.

Title: Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection on Attributed Graphs
Authors: Atsutoshi Kumagai, Tomoharu Iwata, Yasuhiro Fujiwara
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  We propose a simple yet effective method for detecting anomalous instances on
an attribute graph with label information of a small number of instances.
Although with standard anomaly detection methods it is usually assumed that
instances are independent and identically distributed, in many real-world
applications, instances are often explicitly connected with each other,
resulting in so-called attributed graphs. The proposed method embeds nodes
(instances) on the attributed graph in the latent space by taking into account
their attributes as well as the graph structure based on graph convolutional
networks (GCNs). To learn node embeddings specialized for anomaly detection, in
which there is a class imbalance due to the rarity of anomalies, the parameters
of a GCN are trained to minimize the volume of a hypersphere that encloses the
node embeddings of normal instances while embedding anomalous ones outside the
hypersphere. This enables us to detect anomalies by simply calculating the
distances between the node embeddings and hypersphere center. The proposed
method can effectively propagate label information on a small amount of nodes
to unlabeled ones by taking into account the node's attributes, graph
structure, and class imbalance. In experiments with five real-world attributed
graph datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better
performance than various existing anomaly detection methods.

Title: Momentum-Net for Low-Dose CT Image Reconstruction
Authors: Siqi Ye, Yong Long, Il Yong Chun
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG eess.SP
Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, author-submitted paper to ICIP 2020
\\
  This paper applies the recent fast iterative neural network framework,
Momentum-Net, using appropriate models to low-dose X-ray computed tomography
(LDCT) image reconstruction. At each layer of the proposed Momentum-Net, the
model-based image reconstruction module solves the majorized penalized weighted
least-square problem, and the image refining module uses a four-layer
convolutional autoencoder. Experimental results with the NIH AAPM-Mayo Clinic
Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset show that the proposed Momentum-Net
architecture significantly improves image reconstruction accuracy, compared to
a state-of-the-art noniterative image denoising deep neural network (NN),
WavResNet (in LDCT). We also investigated the spectral normalization technique
that applies to image refining NN learning to satisfy the nonexpansive NN
property; however, experimental results show that this does not improve the
image reconstruction performance of Momentum-Net.

Title: MetFlow: A New Efficient Method for Bridging the Gap between Markov

Authors: Achille Thin, Nikita Kotelevskii, Jean-Stanislas Denain, Leo
  Grinsztajn, Alain Durmus, Maxim Panov and Eric Moulines
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO
\\
  In this contribution, we propose a new computationally efficient method to
combine Variational Inference (VI) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This
approach can be used with generic MCMC kernels, but is especially well suited
to \textit{MetFlow}, a novel family of MCMC algorithms we introduce, in which
proposals are obtained using Normalizing Flows. The marginal distribution
produced by such MCMC algorithms is a mixture of flow-based distributions, thus
drastically increasing the expressivity of the variational family. Unlike
previous methods following this direction, our approach is amenable to the
reparametrization trick and does not rely on computationally expensive reverse
kernels. Extensive numerical experiments show clear computational and
performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Title: 3D Phase Retrieval at Nano-Scale via Accelerated Wirtinger Flow
Authors: Zalan Fabian, Justin Haldar, Richard Leahy, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi
Categories: eess.IV cs.NA math.NA math.OC physics.optics
\\
  Imaging 3D nano-structures at very high resolution is crucial in a variety of
scientific fields. However, due to fundamental limitations of light propagation
we can only measure the object indirectly via 2D intensity measurements of the
3D specimen through highly nonlinear projection mappings where a variety of
information (including phase) is lost. Reconstruction therefore involves
inverting highly non-linear and seemingly non-invertible mappings. In this
paper, we introduce a novel technique where the 3D object is directly
reconstructed from an accurate non-linear propagation model. Furthermore, we
characterize the ambiguities of this model and leverage a priori knowledge to
mitigate their effect and also significantly reduce the required number of
measurements and hence the acquisition time. We demonstrate the performance of
our algorithm via numerical experiments aimed at nano-scale reconstruction of
3D integrated circuits. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees
for convergence to stationarity.

\\
  This paper presents a model order reduction (MOR) approach for high
dimensional problems in the analysis of financial risk. To understand the
financial risks and possible outcomes, we have to perform several thousand
simulations of the underlying product. These simulations are expensive and
create a need for efficient computational performance. Thus, to tackle this
problem, we establish a MOR approach based on a proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD) method. The study involves the computations of high dimensional
parametric convection-diffusion reaction partial differential equations (PDEs).
POD requires to solve the high dimensional model at some parameter values to
generate a reduced-order basis. We propose an adaptive greedy sampling
technique based on surrogate modeling for the selection of the sample parameter
set that is analyzed, implemented, and tested on the industrial data. The
results obtained for the numerical example of a floater with cap and floor
under the Hull-White model indicate that the MOR approach works well for
short-rate models.

\\
  A two-stage data-analysis method is proposed for total-reflection high-energy
positron diffraction (TRHEPD). TRHEPD is a novel experimental method for the
determination of surface structure, which has been extensively developed at the
Slow Positron Facility, Institute of Materials Structure Science, High Energy
Accelerator Research Organization (KEK). The data analysis is based on an
inverse problem in which the atomic positions of a surface structure are
determined from the experimental diffraction data (rocking curves). The
relevant forward problem is solved by the numerical solution of the partial
differential equation for quantum scattering of the positron. In the present
two-stage method, the first stage is a grid-based global search and the second
stage is a local search for the unique candidate for the atomic arrangement.
The numerical problem is solved on a supercomputer.

Title: Sparse dynamic tomography. A shearlet-based approach for iodine
  perfusion in plant stems
Authors: Tatiana A. Bubba, Tommi Heikkil\"a, Hanna Help, Simo Huotari, Yann
  Salmon and Samuli Siltanen
Categories: eess.IV cs.NA math.NA
\\
  In this paper we propose a motion-aware variational approach to reconstruct
moving objects from sparse dynamic data. The motivation of this work stems from
X-ray imaging of plants perfused with a liquid contrast agent, aimed at
increasing the contrast of the images and studying the phloem transport in
plants over time. The key idea of our approach is to deploy 3D shearlets as a
space-temporal prior, treating time as the third dimension. The rationale
behind this model is that a continuous evolution of a cartoon-like object is
well suited for the use of 3D shearlets. We provide a basic mathematical
analysis of the variational model for the image reconstruction. The numerical
minimization is carried out with primal-dual scheme coupled with an automated
choice of regularization parameter. We test our model on different measurement
setups: a simulated phantom especially designed to resemble a plant stem, with
spreading points to simulate a spreading contrast agent; a measured agarose gel
phantom to demonstrate iodide diffusion and geometry prior to imaging living
sample; a measured living tree grown \textit{in vitro} and perfused with a
liquid sugar-iodine-mix. The results, compared against a 2D static model, show
that our approach provides reconstructions that capture well the time dynamic
of the contrast agent onset and are encouraging to develop microCT as a tool to
study phloem transport using iodine tracer.

  The Quantum Internet, by enabling quantum communications among remote quantum
nodes, is a network capable of supporting functionalities with no direct
counterpart in the classical world. Indeed, with the network and communications
functionalities provided by the Quantum Internet, remote quantum devices can
communicate and cooperate for solving computational tasks by adopting a
distributed computing approach. The aim of this paper is to provide the reader
with an overview about the Quantum Internet as the fundamental underlying
infrastructure for the design and the realization of a distributed quantum
computing ecosystem. For this we first introduce the Quantum Internet. Then we
present a high-level system abstraction of a distributed quantum computing
ecosystem, by describing the constituting layers from a communication
engineering perspective. Finally we discuss the challenges connected to the
design of the aforementioned layers.

Title: SACBP: Belief Space Planning for Continuous-Time Dynamical Systems via
  Stochastic Sequential Action Control
Authors: Haruki Nishimura and Mac Schwager
Categories: math.OC cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: submitted to Internatinoal Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)
\\
  We propose a novel belief space planning technique for continuous dynamics by
viewing the belief system as a hybrid dynamical system with time-driven
switching. Our approach is based on the perturbation theory of differential
equations and extends Sequential Action Control to stochastic belief dynamics.
The resulting algorithm, which we name SACBP, does not require discretization
of spaces or time and synthesizes control signals in near real-time. SACBP is
an anytime algorithm that can handle general parametric Bayesian filters under
certain assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in an
active sensing scenario and a model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning
problem. In these challenging problems, we show that the algorithm
significantly outperforms other existing solution techniques including
approximate dynamic programming and local trajectory optimization.

Categories: physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech cs.SI stat.AP
Comments: 5 pages
\\
  Waiting times between two consecutive infection and recovery events in
spreading processes are often assumed to be exponentially distributed, which
results in Markovian (i.e., memoryless) continuous spreading dynamics. However,
this is not taking into account memory (correlation) effects and discrete
interactions that have been identified as relevant in social, transportation,
and disease dynamics. We introduce a novel framework to model (non-)Markovian
susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) stochastic processes that are evolving
either in continuous or discrete time on networks. We apply our simulation
framework to study hybrid SIR processes that describe infections as
discrete-time Markovian and recovery events as continuous-time non-Markovian
processes, which mimic the distribution of cell-cycle times. Our results
suggest that the effective-spreading-rate description of epidemic processes
fails to uniquely capture the behavior of such hybrid and also general
non-Markovian disease dynamics. Providing a unifying description of general
Markovian and non-Markovian disease outbreaks, we instead show that the mean
transmissibility produces the same phase diagrams independent of the underlying
inter-event-time distributions.

  A probabilistic generative network model with $n$ nodes and $m$ overlapping
layers is obtained as a superposition of $m$ mutually independent Bernoulli
random graphs of varying size and strength. When $n$ and $m$ are large and of
the same order of magnitude, the model admits a sparse limiting regime with a
tunable power-law degree distribution and nonvanishing clustering coefficient.
This article presents an asymptotic formula for the joint degree distribution
of adjacent nodes. This yields a simple analytical formula for the model
assortativity, and opens up ways to analyze rank correlation coefficients
suitable for random graphs with heavy-tailed degree distributions.

Title: A multi-layer network approach to modelling authorship influence on
  citation dynamics in physics journals
Authors: Vahan Nanumyan, Christoph Gote, Frank Schweitzer
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.SI physics.data-an
\\
  We provide a general framework to model the growth of networks consisting of
different coupled layers. Our aim is to estimate the impact of one such layer
on the dynamics of the others. As an application, we study a scientometric
network, where one layer consists of publications as nodes and citations as
links, whereas the second layer represents the authors. This allows to address
the question how characteristics of authors, such as their number of
publications or number of previous co-authors, impacts the citation dynamics of
a new publication. To test different hypotheses about this impact, our model
combines citation constituents and social constituents in different ways. We
then evaluate their performance in reproducing the citation dynamics in nine
different physics journals. For this, we develop a general method for
statistical parameter estimation and model selection that is applicable to
growing multi-layer networks. It takes both the parameter errors and the model
complexity into account and is computationally efficient and scalable to large
networks.
