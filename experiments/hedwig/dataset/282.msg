Title: Interactive Constrained MAP-Elites Analysis and Evaluation of the
  Expressiveness of the Feature Dimensions
Authors: Alberto Alvarez, Steve Dahlskog, Jose Font and Julian Togelius
Categories: cs.AI cs.NE
Comments: 10 pages, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Games. arXiv admin note:
  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1906.05175
\\
  We propose the Interactive Constrained MAP-Elites, a quality-diversity
solution for game content generation, implemented as a new feature of the
Evolutionary Dungeon Designer: a mixed-initiative co-creativity tool for
designing dungeons. The feature uses the MAP-Elites algorithm, an illumination
algorithm that segregates the population among several cells depending on their
scores with respect to different behavioral dimensions. Users can flexibly and
dynamically alternate between these dimensions anytime, thus guiding the
evolutionary process in an intuitive way, and then incorporate suggestions
produced by the algorithm in their room designs. At the same time, any
modifications performed by the human user will feed back into MAP-Elites,
closing a circular workflow of constant mutual inspiration. This paper presents
the algorithm followed by an in-depth analysis of its behaviour, with the aims
of evaluating the expressive range of all possible dimension combinations in
several scenarios, as well as discussing their influence in the fitness
landscape and in the overall performance of the mixed-initiative procedural
content generation.

Title: Experimental Studies in General Game Playing: An Experience Report
Authors: Jakub Kowalski, Marek Szyku{\l}a
Categories: cs.AI
Journal-ref: The AAAI 2020 Workshop on Reproducible AI - RAI2020
\\
  We describe nearly fifteen years of General Game Playing experimental
research history in the context of reproducibility and fairness of comparisons
between various GGP agents and systems designed to play games described by
different formalisms. We think our survey may provide an interesting
perspective of how chaotic methods were allowed when nothing better was
possible. Finally, from our experience-based view, we would like to propose a
few recommendations of how such specific heterogeneous branch of research
should be handled appropriately in the future. The goal of this note is to
point out common difficulties and problems in the experimental research in the
area. We hope that our recommendations will help in avoiding them in future
works and allow more fair and reproducible comparisons.

Title: Reward Design in Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for
  Packet Routing
Authors: Hangyu Mao, Zhibo Gong, and Zhen Xiao
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
Comments: cover https://openreview.net/forum?id=r15kjpHa-
\\
  In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), how to design a
suitable reward signal to accelerate learning and stabilize convergence is a
critical problem. The global reward signal assigns the same global reward to
all agents without distinguishing their contributions, while the local reward
signal provides different local rewards to each agent based solely on
individual behavior. Both of the two reward assignment approaches have some
shortcomings: the former might encourage lazy agents, while the latter might
produce selfish agents.
  In this paper, we study reward design problem in cooperative MARL based on
packet routing environments. Firstly, we show that the above two reward signals
are prone to produce suboptimal policies. Then, inspired by some observations
and considerations, we design some mixed reward signals, which are
off-the-shelf to learn better policies. Finally, we turn the mixed reward
signals into the adaptive counterparts, which achieve best results in our
experiments. Other reward signals are also discussed in this paper. As reward
design is a very fundamental problem in RL and especially in MARL, we hope that
MARL researchers can rethink the rewards used in their systems.

Title: Adversarial Machine Learning: Perspectives from Adversarial Risk
  Analysis
Authors: David Rios Insua, Roi Naveiro, Victor Gallego, Jason Poulos
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG stat.CO stat.ML
\\
  Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) is emerging as a major field aimed at the
protection of automated ML systems against security threats. The majority of
work in this area has built upon a game-theoretic framework by modelling a
conflict between an attacker and a defender. After reviewing game-theoretic
approaches to AML, we discuss the benefits that a Bayesian Adversarial Risk
Analysis perspective brings when defending ML based systems. A research agenda
is included.

Title: Knowledge Graphs and Knowledge Networks: The Story in Brief
Authors: Amit Sheth, Swati Padhee, Amelie Gyrard
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Knowledge Graphs (KGs) represent real-world noisy raw information in a
structured form, capturing relationships between entities. However, for dynamic
real-world applications such as social networks, recommender systems,
computational biology, relational knowledge representation has emerged as a
challenging research problem where there is a need to represent the changing
nodes, attributes, and edges over time. The evolution of search engine
responses to user queries in the last few years is partly because of the role
of KGs such as Google KG. KGs are significantly contributing to various AI
applications from link prediction, entity relations prediction, node
classification to recommendation and question answering systems. This article
is an attempt to summarize the journey of KG for AI.

Title: Online Residential Demand Response via Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits
Authors: Xin Chen, Yutong Nie, Na Li
Categories: cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Residential load demands have huge potential to be exploited to enhance the
efficiency and reliability of power system operation through demand response
(DR) programs. This paper studies the strategies to select the right customers
for residential DR from the perspective of load service entities (LSEs). One of
the main challenges to implement residential DR is that customer responses to
the incentives are uncertain and unknown, which are influenced by various
personal and environmental factors. To address this challenge, this paper
employs the contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) method to model the optimal
customer selection problem with uncertainty. Based on Thompson sampling
framework, an online learning and decision-making algorithm is proposed to
learn customer behaviors and select appropriate customers for load reduction.
This algorithm takes the contextual information into consideration and is
applicable to complicated DR settings. Numerical simulations are performed to
demonstrate the efficiency and learning effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

  Knowledge graph models world knowledge as concepts, entities, and the
relationships between them, which has been widely used in many real-world
tasks. CCKS 2019 held an evaluation track with 6 tasks and attracted more than
1,600 teams. In this paper, we give an overview of the knowledge graph
evaluation tract at CCKS 2019. By reviewing the task definition, successful
methods, useful resources, good strategies and research challenges associated
with each task in CCKS 2019, this paper can provide a helpful reference for
developing knowledge graph applications and conducting future knowledge graph
researches.

Title: BitTensor: An Intermodel Intelligence Measure
Authors: Jacob Steeves, Ala Shaabana, Matthew McAteer
Categories: cs.AI cs.DC cs.MA
\\
  A purely inter-model version of a machine intelligence benchmark would allow
us to measure intelligence directly as information without projecting that
information onto labeled datasets. We propose a framework in which other
learners measure the informational significance of their peers across a network
and use a digital ledger to negotiate the scores. However, the main benefits of
measuring intelligence with other learners are lost if the underlying scores
are dishonest. As a solution, we show how competition for connectivity in the
network can be used to force honest bidding. We first prove that selecting
inter-model scores using gradient descent is a regret-free strategy: one which
generates the best subjective outcome regardless of the behavior of others. We
then empirically show that when nodes apply this strategy, the network
converges to a ranking that correlates with the one found in a fully
coordinated and centralized setting. The result is a fair mechanism for
training an internet-wide, decentralized and incentivized machine learning
system, one which produces a continually hardening and expanding benchmark at
the generalized intersection of the participants.

Title: Integrating Acting, Planning and Learning in Hierarchical Operational
  Models
Authors: Sunandita Patra, James Mason, Amit Kumar, Malik Ghallab, Paolo
  Traverso, Dana Nau
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Accepted in ICAPS 2020 (30th International Conference on Automated
  Planning and Scheduling)
\\
  We present new planning and learning algorithms for RAE, the Refinement
Acting Engine. RAE uses hierarchical operational models to perform tasks in
dynamically changing environments. Our planning procedure, UPOM, does a
UCT-like search in the space of operational models in order to find a
near-optimal method to use for the task and context at hand. Our learning
strategies acquire, from online acting experiences and/or simulated planning
results, a mapping from decision contexts to method instances as well as a
heuristic function to guide UPOM. Our experimental results show that UPOM and
our learning strategies significantly improve RAE's performance in four test
domains using two different metrics: efficiency and success ratio.

Title: Two Decades of AI4NETS-AI/ML for Data Networks: Challenges & Research
  Directions
Authors: Pedro Casas
Categories: cs.AI cs.NI
\\
  The popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) -- and of Machine Learning
(ML) as an approach to AI, has dramatically increased in the last few years,
due to its outstanding performance in various domains, notably in image, audio,
and natural language processing. In these domains, AI success-stories are
boosting the applied field. When it comes to AI/ML for data communication
Networks (AI4NETS), and despite the many attempts to turn networks into
learning agents, the successful application of AI/ML in networking is limited.
There is a strong resistance against AI/ML-based solutions, and a striking gap
between the extensive academic research and the actual deployments of such
AI/ML-based systems in operational environments. The truth is, there are still
many unsolved complex challenges associated to the analysis of networking data
through AI/ML, which hinders its acceptability and adoption in the practice. In
this positioning paper I elaborate on the most important show-stoppers in
AI4NETS, and present a research agenda to tackle some of these challenges,
enabling a natural adoption of AI/ML for networking. In particular, I focus the
future research in AI4NETS around three major pillars: (i) to make AI/ML
immediately applicable in networking problems through the concepts of effective
learning, turning it into a useful and reliable way to deal with complex
data-driven networking problems; (ii) to boost the adoption of AI/ML at the
large scale by learning from the Internet-paradigm itself, conceiving novel
distributed and hierarchical learning approaches mimicking the distributed
topological principles and operation of the Internet itself; and (iii) to
exploit the softwarization and distribution of networks to conceive
AI/ML-defined Networks (AIDN), relying on the distributed generation and
re-usage of knowledge through novel Knowledge Delivery Networks (KDNs).

Title: The Fine-Grained Complexity of Computing the Tutte Polynomial of a
  Linear Matroid
Authors: Andreas Bj\"orklund, Petteri Kaski
Categories: cs.CC cs.DS math.CO
MSC-class: 68Q25 (Primary) 05A15, 05B35 (Secondary)
ACM-class: F.2.2; G.2.1; E.4
\\
  We show that computing the Tutte polynomial of a linear matroid of dimension
$k$ on $k^{O(1)}$ points over a field of $k^{O(1)}$ elements requires
$k^{\Omega(k)}$ time unless the #ETH---a counting extension of the Exponential
Time Hypothesis of Impagliazzo and Paturi [CCC 1999] due to Dell et al. [ACM
TALG 2014]---is false. This holds also for linear matroids that admit a
representation where every point is associated to a vector with at most two
nonzero coordinates. Moreover, we also show that the same is true for computing
the Tutte polynomial of a binary matroid of dimension $k$ on $k^{O(1)}$ points
with at most three nonzero coordinates in each point's vector. These two
results stand in sharp contrast to computing the Tutte polynomial of a
$k$-vertex graph (that is, the Tutte polynomial of a graphic matroid of
dimension $k$---which is representable in dimension $k$ over the binary field
so that every vector has exactly two nonzero coordinates), which is known to be
computable in $2^k k^{O(1)}$ time [Bj\"orklund et al., FOCS 2008]. Our
lower-bound proofs proceed in three steps: (i) a classic connection due to
Crapo and Rota [1970] between the number of tuples of codewords of full support
and the Tutte polynomial of the matroid associated with the code; (ii) an
earlier-established \#ETH-hardness of counting the solutions to a bipartite
$(d,2)$-CSP on $n$ vertices in $d^{o(n)}$ time; and (iii) new embeddings of
such CSP instances as questions about codewords of full support in a linear
code. We complement these lower bounds with a matching upper-bound algorithm
design that computes the Tutte polynomial of a linear matroid of dimension $k$
on $k^{O(1)}$ points in $k^{O(k)}$ arithmetic operations in the base field.

Title: Spatiotemporal fluctuation scaling law and metapopulation modeling of
  the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks
Authors: Zhanshan (Sam) Ma
Categories: cs.CE q-bio.PE
\\
  We comparatively analyzed the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the 2019-novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks to understand their epidemiological
characteristics. Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to
characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell (2001)
unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al.
(2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)]
to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL
analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific
heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for
cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections,
suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter
(M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds
(COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health
interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the
infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and
below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0
coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19
outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection
threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality
rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity
UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of
coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\theta} and M, borrowed
from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of
infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of
which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health
interventions.

Title: ASAP-SML: An Antibody Sequence Analysis Pipeline Using Statistical
  Testing and Machine Learning
Authors: Xinmeng Li, James A. Van Deventer, and Soha Hassoun
Categories: cs.CE
\\
  Antibodies are capable of potently and specifically binding individual
antigens and, in some cases, disrupting their functions. The key challenge in
generating antibody-based inhibitors is the lack of fundamental information
relating sequences of antibodies to their unique properties as inhibitors. We
develop a pipeline, Antibody Sequence Analysis Pipeline using Statistical
testing and Machine Learning (ASAP-SML), to identify features that distinguish
one set of antibody sequences from antibody sequences in a reference set. The
pipeline extracts feature fingerprints from sequences. The fingerprints
represent germline, CDR canonical structure, isoelectric point and frequent
positional motifs. Machine learning and statistical significance testing
techniques are applied to antibody sequences and extracted feature fingerprints
to identify distinguishing feature values and combinations thereof. To
demonstrate how it works, we applied the pipeline on sets of antibody sequences
known to bind or inhibit the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a
family of zinc-dependent enzymes that promote cancer progression and undesired
inflammation under pathological conditions, against reference datasets that do
not bind or inhibit MMPs. ASAP-SML identifies features and combinations of
feature values found in the MMP-targeting sets that are distinct from those in
the reference sets.

Title: Enhancing Industrial X-ray Tomography by Data-Centric Statistical
  Methods
Authors: Jarkko Suuronen, Muhammad Emzir, Sari Lasanen, Simo S\"arkk\"a, Lassi
  Roininen
Categories: cs.CE stat.ME
\\
  X-ray tomography has applications in various industrial fields such as
sawmill industry, oil and gas industry, chemical engineering, and geotechnical
engineering. In this article, we study Bayesian methods for the X-ray
tomography reconstruction. In Bayesian methods, the inverse problem of
tomographic reconstruction is solved with help of a statistical prior
distribution which encodes the possible internal structures by assigning
probabilities for smoothness and edge distribution of the object. We compare
Gaussian random field priors, that favour smoothness, to non-Gaussian total
variation, Besov, and Cauchy priors which promote sharp edges and high-contrast
and low-contrast areas in the object. We also present computational schemes for
solving the resulting high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problem with
100,000-1,000,000 unknowns. In particular, we study the applicability of a
no-U-turn variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods and of a more classical
adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm for this purpose. These methods also
enable full uncertainty quantification of the reconstructions. For faster
computations, we use maximum a posteriori estimates with limited-memory BFGS
optimisation algorithm. As the first industrial application, we consider
sawmill industry X-ray log tomography. The logs have knots, rotten parts, and
even possibly metallic pieces, making them good examples for non-Gaussian
priors. Secondly, we study drill-core rock sample tomography, an example from
oil and gas industry. We show that Cauchy priors produce smaller number of
artefacts than other choices, especially with sparse high-noise measurements,
and choosing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo enables systematic uncertainty
quantification.

Title: An energy stable one-field monolithic arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
  formulation for fluid-structure interaction
Authors: Yongxing Wang, Peter K. Jimack, Mark A. Walkley and Olivier Pironneau
Categories: cs.CE math.AP
\\
  In this article we present a one-field monolithic finite element method in
the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation for Fluid-Structure
Interaction (FSI) problems. The method only solves for one velocity field in
the whole FSI domain, and it solves in a monolithic manner so that the fluid
solid interface conditions are satisfied automatically. We prove that the
proposed scheme is unconditionally stable, through energy analysis, by
utilising a conservative formulation and an exact quadrature rule. We implement
the algorithm using both ${\bf F}$-scheme and ${\bf d}$-scheme, and demonstrate
that the former has the same formulation in two and three dimensions. Finally
several numerical examples are presented to validate this methodology,
including combination with remesh techniques to handle the case of very large
solid displacement.

Title: Natural Language QA Approaches using Reasoning with External Knowledge
Authors: Chitta Baral, Pratyay Banerjee, Kuntal Kumar Pal, Arindam Mitra
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, Work in Progress
\\
  Question answering (QA) in natural language (NL) has been an important aspect
of AI from its early days. Winograd's ``councilmen'' example in his 1972 paper
and McCarthy's Mr. Hug example of 1976 highlights the role of external
knowledge in NL understanding. While Machine Learning has been the go-to
approach in NL processing as well as NL question answering (NLQA) for the last
30 years, recently there has been an increasingly emphasized thread on NLQA
where external knowledge plays an important role. The challenges inspired by
Winograd's councilmen example, and recent developments such as the Rebooting AI
book, various NLQA datasets, research on knowledge acquisition in the NLQA
context, and their use in various NLQA models have brought the issue of NLQA
using ``reasoning'' with external knowledge to the forefront. In this paper, we

traditional fields of knowledge representation and reasoning and (b) the field
of NL understanding and NLQA.

Title: Synthetic Error Dataset Generation Mimicking Bengali Writing Pattern
Authors: Md. Habibur Rahman Sifat, Chowdhury Rafeed Rahman, Mohammad Rafsan,

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  While writing Bengali using English keyboard, users often make spelling
mistakes. The accuracy of any Bengali spell checker or paragraph correction
module largely depends on the kind of error dataset it is based on. Manual
generation of such error dataset is a cumbersome process. In this research, We
present an algorithm for automatic misspelled Bengali word generation from
correct word through analyzing Bengali writing pattern using QWERTY layout
English keyboard. As part of our analysis, we have formed a list of most
commonly used Bengali words, phonetically similar replaceable clusters,
frequently mispressed replaceable clusters, frequently mispressed insertion
prone clusters and some rules for Juktakkhar (constant letter clusters)
handling while generating errors.

Title: A Post-processing Method for Detecting Unknown Intent of Dialogue System
  via Pre-trained Deep Neural Network Classifier
Authors: Ting-En Lin, Hua Xu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Published in Knowledge-Based Systems 2019
DOI: 10.1016/j.knosys.2019.104979
\\
  With the maturity and popularity of dialogue systems, detecting user's
unknown intent in dialogue systems has become an important task. It is also one
of the most challenging tasks since we can hardly get examples, prior knowledge
or the exact numbers of unknown intents. In this paper, we propose SofterMax
and deep novelty detection (SMDN), a simple yet effective post-processing
method for detecting unknown intent in dialogue systems based on pre-trained
deep neural network classifiers. Our method can be flexibly applied on top of
any classifiers trained in deep neural networks without changing the model
architecture. We calibrate the confidence of the softmax outputs to compute the
calibrated confidence score (i.e., SofterMax) and use it to calculate the
decision boundary for unknown intent detection. Furthermore, we feed the
feature representations learned by the deep neural networks into traditional
novelty detection algorithm to detect unknown intents from different
perspectives. Finally, we combine the methods above to perform the joint
prediction. Our method classifies examples that differ from known intents as
unknown and does not require any examples or prior knowledge of it. We have
conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark dialogue datasets. The
results show that our method can yield significant improvements compared with
the state-of-the-art baselines

Title: ECSP: A New Task for Emotion-Cause Span-Pair Extraction and
  Classification
Authors: Hongliang Bi, Pengyuan Liu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Emotion cause analysis such as emotion cause extraction (ECE) and
emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) have gradually attracted the attention of
many researchers. However, there are still two shortcomings in the existing
research: 1) In most cases, emotion expression and cause are not the whole
clause, but the span in the clause, so extracting the clause-pair rather than
the span-pair greatly limits its applications in real-world scenarios; 2) It is
not enough to extract the emotion expression clause without identifying the
emotion categories, the presence of emotion clause does not necessarily convey
emotional information explicitly due to different possible causes. In this
paper, we propose a new task: Emotion-Cause Span-Pair extraction and
classification (ECSP), which aims to extract the potential span-pair of emotion
and corresponding causes in a document, and make emotion classification for
each pair. In the new ECSP task, ECE and ECPE can be regarded as two special
cases at the clause-level. We propose a span-based extract-then-classify (ETC)
model, where emotion and cause are directly extracted and paired from the
document under the supervision of target span boundaries, and corresponding
categories are then classified using their pair representations and localized
context. Experiments show that our proposed ETC model outperforms the SOTA
model of ECE and ECPE task respectively and gets a fair-enough results on ECSP
task.

Title: General-Purpose Communicative Function Recognition using a Hierarchical
  Network with Cascading Outputs and Maximum a Posteriori Path Estimation
Authors: Eug\'enio Ribeiro, Ricardo Ribeiro, and David Martins de Matos
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table
ACM-class: H.1.2; H.3.1; I.2.7
\\
  ISO 24617-2, the standard for dialog act annotation, defines a hierarchically
organized set of general-purpose communicative functions. The automatic
recognition of these functions, although practically unexplored, is relevant
for a dialog system, since they provide cues regarding the intention behind the
segments and how they should be interpreted. In this paper, we explore the
recognition of general-purpose communicative functions in the DialogBank, which
is a reference set of dialogs annotated according to the standard. To do so, we
adapt a state-of-the-art approach on flat dialog act recognition to deal with
the hierarchical classification problem. More specifically, we propose the use
of a hierarchical network with cascading outputs and maximum a posteriori path
estimation to predict the communicative function at each level of the
hierarchy, preserve the dependencies between the functions in the path, and
decide at which level to stop. Furthermore, since the amount of dialogs in the
DialogBank is reduced, we rely both on additional dialogs annotated using
mapping processes and on transfer learning to improve performance. The results
of our experiments show that the hierarchical approach outperforms a flat one
and that maximum a posteriori estimation outperforms an iterative prediction
approach based on masking.

Title: Generating Emotionally Aligned Responses in Dialogues using Affect
  Control Theory
Authors: Nabiha Asghar and Ivan Kobyzev and Jesse Hoey and Pascal Poupart and
  Muhammad Bilal Sheikh
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.HC
\\
  State-of-the-art neural dialogue systems excel at syntactic and semantic
modelling of language, but often have a hard time establishing emotional
alignment with the human interactant during a conversation. In this work, we
bring Affect Control Theory (ACT), a socio-mathematical model of emotions for
human-human interactions, to the neural dialogue generation setting. ACT makes
predictions about how humans respond to emotional stimuli in social situations.
Due to this property, ACT and its derivative probabilistic models have been
successfully deployed in several applications of Human-Computer Interaction,
including empathetic tutoring systems, assistive healthcare devices and
two-person social dilemma games. We investigate how ACT can be used to develop
affect-aware conversational agents, which produce emotionally aligned responses
to prompts and take into consideration the affective identities of the
interactants.

Title: Discovering linguistic (ir)regularities in word embeddings through
  max-margin separating hyperplanes
Authors: Noel Kennedy, Imogen Schofield, Dave C. Brodbelt, David B. Church, Dan
  G. O'Neill
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  We experiment with new methods for learning how related words are positioned
relative to each other in word embedding spaces. Previous approaches learned
constant vector offsets: vectors that point from source tokens to target tokens
with an assumption that these offsets were parallel to each other. We show that
the offsets between related tokens are closer to orthogonal than parallel, and
that they have low cosine similarities. We proceed by making a different
assumption; target tokens are linearly separable from source and un-labeled
tokens. We show that a max-margin hyperplane can separate target tokens and
that vectors orthogonal to this hyperplane represent the relationship between
source and targets. We find that this representation of the relationship
obtains the best results in dis-covering linguistic regularities. We experiment
with vector space models trained by a variety of algorithms (Word2vec:
CBOW/skip-gram, fastText, or GloVe), and various word context choices such as
linear word-order, syntax dependency grammars, and with and without knowledge
of word position. These experiments show that our model, SVMCos, is robust to a
range of experimental choices when training word embeddings.

Title: Multi-task Learning Based Neural Bridging Reference Resolution
Authors: Juntao Yu and Massimo Poesio
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  We propose a multi task learning-based neural model for bridging reference
resolution tackling two key challenges faced by bridging reference resolution.
The first challenge is the lack of large corpora annotated with bridging
references. To address this, we use multi-task learning to help bridging
reference resolution with coreference resolution. We show that substantial
improvements of up to 8 p.p. can be achieved on full bridging resolution with
this architecture. The second challenge is the different definitions of
bridging used in different corpora, meaning that hand-coded systems or systems
using special features designed for one corpus do not work well with other
corpora. Our neural model only uses a small number of corpus independent
features, thus can be applied easily to different corpora. Evaluations with
very different bridging corpora (ARRAU, ISNOTES, BASHI and SCICORP) suggest
that our architecture works equally well on all corpora, and achieves the SoTA
results on full bridging resolution for all corpora, outperforming the best
reported results by up to 34.9 percentage points.

  Working from a dataset of 118 billion messages running from the start of 2009
to the end of 2019, we identify and explore the relative daily use of over 150
languages on Twitter. We find that eight languages comprise 80% of all tweets,
with English, Japanese, Spanish, and Portuguese being the most dominant. To
quantify each language's level of being a Twitter `echo chamber' over time, we
compute the `contagion ratio': the balance of retweets to organic messages. We
find that for the most common languages on Twitter there is a growing tendency,
though not universal, to retweet rather than share new content. By the end of
2019, the contagion ratios for half of the top 30 languages, including English
and Spanish, had reached above 1---the naive contagion threshold. In 2019, the
top 5 languages with the highest average daily ratios were, in order, Thai
(7.3), Hindi, Tamil, Urdu, and Catalan, while the bottom 5 were Russian,
Swedish, Esperanto, Cebuano, and Finnish (0.26). Further, we show that over
time, the contagion ratios for most common languages are growing more strongly
than those of rare languages.

Title: Investigating the Decoders of Maximum Likelihood Sequence Models: A
  Look-ahead Approach
Authors: Yu-Siang Wang, Yen-Ling Kuo, Boris Katz
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We demonstrate how we can practically incorporate multi-step future
information into a decoder of maximum likelihood sequence models. We propose a
"k-step look-ahead" module to consider the likelihood information of a rollout
up to k steps. Unlike other approaches that need to train another value network
to evaluate the rollouts, we can directly apply this look-ahead module to
improve the decoding of any sequence model trained in a maximum likelihood
framework. We evaluate our look-ahead module on three datasets of varying
difficulties: IM2LATEX-100k OCR image to LaTeX, WMT16 multimodal machine
translation, and WMT14 machine translation. Our look-ahead module improves the
performance of the simpler datasets such as IM2LATEX-100k and WMT16 multimodal
machine translation. However, the improvement of the more difficult dataset
(e.g., containing longer sequences), WMT14 machine translation, becomes
marginal. Our further investigation using the k-step look-ahead suggests that
the more difficult tasks suffer from the overestimated EOS (end-of-sentence)
probability. We argue that the overestimated EOS probability also causes the
decreased performance of beam search when increasing its beam width. We tackle
the EOS problem by integrating an auxiliary EOS loss into the training to
estimate if the model should emit EOS or other words. Our experiments show that
improving EOS estimation not only increases the performance of our proposed
look-ahead module but also the robustness of the beam search.

Title: Pseudo Labeling and Negative Feedback Learning for Large-scale
  Multi-label Domain Classification
Authors: Joo-Kyung Kim and Young-Bum Kim
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: ICASSP 2020
\\
  In large-scale domain classification, an utterance can be handled by multiple
domains with overlapped capabilities. However, only a limited number of
ground-truth domains are provided for each training utterance in practice while
knowing as many as correct target labels is helpful for improving the model
performance. In this paper, given one ground-truth domain for each training
utterance, we regard domains consistently predicted with the highest
confidences as additional pseudo labels for the training. In order to reduce
prediction errors due to incorrect pseudo labels, we leverage utterances with
negative system responses to decrease the confidences of the incorrectly
predicted domains. Evaluating on user utterances from an intelligent
conversational system, we show that the proposed approach significantly
improves the performance of domain classification with hypothesis reranking.

contributes a new resource for Chinese Language Technology and for
Chinese-English translation, in the form of a set of TED talks (some originally
given in English, some in Chinese) that have been annotated with discourse
relations in the style of the Penn Discourse TreeBank, adapted to properties of
Chinese text that are not present in English. The resource is currently unique
in annotating discourse-level properties of planned spoken monologues rather
than of written text. An inter-annotator agreement study demonstrates that the

Title: Sentence Analogies: Exploring Linguistic Relationships and Regularities

Authors: Xunjie Zhu, Gerard de Melo
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  While important properties of word vector representations have been studied
extensively, far less is known about the properties of sentence vector
representations. Word vectors are often evaluated by assessing to what degree
they exhibit regularities with regard to relationships of the sort considered
in word analogies. In this paper, we investigate to what extent commonly used
sentence vector representation spaces as well reflect certain kinds of
regularities. We propose a number of schemes to induce evaluation data, based
on lexical analogy data as well as semantic relationships between sentences.
Our experiments consider a wide range of sentence embedding methods, including
ones based on BERT-style contextual embeddings. We find that different models
differ substantially in their ability to reflect such regularities.

  We present an empirical investigation of pre-trained Transformer-based
auto-regressive language models for the task of open-domain dialogue
generation. Training paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning is employed to
conduct the parameter learning. Corpora of News and Wikipedia in Chinese and
English are collected for the pre-training stage respectively. Dialogue context
and response are concatenated into a single sequence utilized as the input of
the models during the fine-tuning stage. A weighted joint prediction paradigm
for both context and response is designed to evaluate the performance of models
with or without the loss term for context prediction. Various of decoding
strategies such as greedy search, beam search, top-k sampling, etc. are
employed to conduct the response text generation. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the typical single-turn and multi-turn dialogue corpora such as
Weibo, Douban, Reddit, DailyDialog, and Persona-Chat. Detailed numbers of
automatic evaluation metrics on relevance and diversity of the generated
results for the languages models as well as the baseline approaches are

\\
  We propose an image encryption scheme based on quasi-resonant Rossby/drift
wave triads (related to elliptic surfaces) and Mordell elliptic curves (MECs).
By defining a total order on quasi-resonant triads, at a first stage we
construct quasi-resonant triads using auxiliary parameters of elliptic surfaces
in order to generate pseudo-random numbers. At a second stage, we employ a MEC
to construct a dynamic substitution box (S-box) for the plain-image. The
generated pseudo-random numbers and S-box are used respectively to provide
diffusion and confusion in the tested image. We test the proposed scheme
against well-known attacks by encrypting all gray images taken from the
USC-SIPI image database. Our experimental results indicate the high security of
the newly developed scheme. Finally, via extensive comparisons we show that the
new scheme outperforms other popular schemes.

Title: Balance Transfers and Bailouts in Credit Networks using Blockchains
Authors: Lalitha Muthu Subramanian, Roopa Vishwanathan, Kartick Kolachala
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  In this paper, we propose a technique for rebalancing link weights in
decentralized credit networks. Credit networks are peer-to-peer trust-based
networks that enable fast and inexpensive cross-currency transactions compared
to traditional bank wire transfers, which has led to their increasing
popularity and use. Although researchers have studied security of transactions
and privacy of users of such networks, and have invested significant efforts
into designing efficient routing algorithms for credit networks, comparatively
little work has been done in the area of {replenishing} credit links of users
in the network. Replenishing links at regular intervals in a credit network is
important to keep users solvent, the network viable with enough liquidity, and
to prevent transaction failures. This is achieved by a process called
{rebalancing} that enables a poorly funded user to create incoming as well as
outgoing credit links. We propose a system where a user with zero or no link
weights can create incoming links with existing, trusted users in the network,
in a procedure we call {balance transfer}, followed by creating outgoing links
to existing or new users that would like to join the network, a process we call
{bailout}. Both these processes together constitute our proposed rebalancing
mechanism. Our techniques would also serve to make the network more competitive
by offering users lower rates of interest, and enable users to earn routing
fees-based revenue by participating in high throughput transaction paths.

Title: Machine Learning based Anomaly Detection for 5G Networks
Authors: Jordan Lam, Robert Abbas
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Protecting the networks of tomorrow is set to be a challenging domain due to
increasing cyber security threats and widening attack surfaces created by the
Internet of Things (IoT), increased network heterogeneity, increased use of
virtualisation technologies and distributed architectures. This paper proposes
SDS (Software Defined Security) as a means to provide an automated, flexible
and scalable network defence system. SDS will harness current advances in
machine learning to design a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) using NAS
(Neural Architecture Search) to detect anomalous network traffic. SDS can be
applied to an intrusion detection system to create a more proactive and
end-to-end defence for a 5G network. To test this assumption, normal and
anomalous network flows from a simulated environment have been collected and
analyzed with a CNN. The results from this method are promising as the model
has identified benign traffic with a 100% accuracy rate and anomalous traffic
with a 96.4% detection rate. This demonstrates the effectiveness of network
flow analysis for a variety of common malicious attacks and also provides a
viable option for detection of encrypted malicious network traffic.

Title: Securing LSB embedding against structural steganalysis
Authors: Brian A. Powell
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures
\\
  This work explores the extent to which LSB embedding can be made secure
against structural steganalysis through a modification of cover image
statistics prior to message embedding. Natural images possess symmetries that
are expressed through approximately equal cardinalities of certain sets of
$k$-tuples of consecutive pixels. LSB embedding disturbs this balance and a
$k^{\rm th}$-order structural attack infers the presence of a hidden message
with a length in proportion to the size of the imbalance amongst sets of
$k$-tuples. To protect against $k^{\rm th}$-order structural attacks, cover
modifications involve the redistribution of $k$-tuples among the different sets
so that symmetries of the cover image are broken, then repaired through the act
of LSB embedding so that the stego image bears the statistics of the original
cover. To protect against all orders up to some order $k$, the statistics of
$n$-tuples must be preserved where $n$ is the least common multiple of all
orders $\leq k$. We find that this is only feasible for securing against up to
$3^{\rm rd}$-order attacks (Sample Pairs and Triples analyses) since
higher-order protections result in virtually zero embedding capacities.
Securing up to $3^{\rm rd}$-order requires redistribution of sextuplets: rather
than perform these $6^{\rm th}$-order cover modifications, which result in tiny
embedding capacities, we reduce the problem to the redistribution of triplets
in a manner that also preserves the statistics of pairs. This is done by
embedding into only certain pixels of each sextuplet, constraining the maximum
embedding rate to be $\leq 2/3$ bits per channel. Testing on a variety of image
formats, we report best performance for JPEG-compressed images with a mean
maximum embedding rate undetectable by $2^{\rm nd}$- and $3^{\rm rd}$-order
attacks of 0.21 bits per channel.

sophisticated Intrusion Detection Systems that are based on artificial
intelligence and advanced data analytic cannot keep pace with the rapid
development of new attacks. When standard detection mechanisms fail or do not
provide sufficient forensic information to investigate and mitigate attacks,
targeted threat hunting performed by competent personnel is used.
Unfortunately, many organization do not have enough security analysts to
perform threat hunting tasks and today the level of automation of threat
hunting is low.
  In this paper we describe a framework for agile threat hunting and forensic
investigation (ATHAFI), which automates the threat hunting process at multiple
levels. Adaptive targeted data collection, attack hypotheses generation,
hypotheses testing, and continuous threat intelligence feeds allow to perform
simple investigations in a fully automated manner. The increased level of
automation will significantly boost the analyst's productivity during
investigation of the harshest cases.
  Special Workflow Generation module adapts the threat hunting procedures
either to the latest Threat Intelligence obtained from external sources (e.g.
National CERT) or to the likeliest attack hypotheses generated by the Attack
Hypotheses Generation module. The combination of Attack Hypotheses Generation
and Workflows Generation enables intelligent adjustment of workflows, which
react to emerging threats effectively.

Title: Dynamic Backdoor Attacks Against Machine Learning Models
Authors: Ahmed Salem and Rui Wen and Michael Backes and Shiqing Ma and Yang
  Zhang
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Machine learning (ML) has made tremendous progress during the past decade and
is being adopted in various critical real-world applications. However, recent
research has shown that ML models are vulnerable to multiple security and
privacy attacks. In particular, backdoor attacks against ML models that have
recently raised a lot of awareness. A successful backdoor attack can cause
severe consequences, such as allowing an adversary to bypass critical
authentication systems.
  Current backdooring techniques rely on adding static triggers (with fixed
patterns and locations) on ML model inputs. In this paper, we propose the first
class of dynamic backdooring techniques: Random Backdoor, Backdoor Generating
Network (BaN), and conditional Backdoor Generating Network (c-BaN). Triggers
generated by our techniques can have random patterns and locations, which
reduce the efficacy of the current backdoor detection mechanisms. In
particular, BaN and c-BaN are the first two schemes that algorithmically
generate triggers, which rely on a novel generative network. Moreover, c-BaN is
the first conditional backdooring technique, that given a target label, it can
generate a target-specific trigger. Both BaN and c-BaN are essentially a
general framework which renders the adversary the flexibility for further
customizing backdoor attacks.
  We extensively evaluate our techniques on three benchmark datasets: MNIST,
CelebA, and CIFAR-10. Our techniques achieve almost perfect attack performance
on backdoored data with a negligible utility loss. We further show that our
techniques can bypass current state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against
backdoor attacks, including Neural Cleanse, ABS, and STRIP.

Title: Attacking the DeFi Ecosystem with Flash Loans for Fun and Profit
Authors: Kaihua Qin, Liyi Zhou, Benjamin Livshits, Arthur Gervais
Categories: cs.CR cs.CE cs.DC
\\
  Credit allows a lender to loan out surplus capital to a borrower. In the
traditional economy, credit bears the risk that the borrower may default on its
debt, the lender hence requires an upfront collateral from the borrower, plus
interest fee payments.
  Due to the atomicity of blockchain transactions, lenders can offer flash
loans, i.e. loans that are only valid within one transaction and must be repaid
by the end of that transaction. This concept has lead to a number of
interesting attack possibilities, some of which have been exploited recently
(February 2020).
  This paper is the first to explore the implication of flash loans for the
nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We analyze two existing attacks
vectors with significant ROIs (beyond 500k%), and then go on to formulate
finding flash loan-based attack parameters as an optimization problem over the
state of the underlying Ethereum blockchain as well as the state of the DeFi
ecosystem. Specifically, we show how two previously executed attacks can be
``boosted'' to result in a profit of 829.5k USD and 1.1M USD, respectively,
which is a boost of 2.37x and 1.73x, respectively.

Title: A Compiler Assisted Scheduler for Detecting and Mitigating Cache-Based
  Side Channel Attacks
Authors: Sharjeel Khan, Girish Mruru and Santosh Pande
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Detection and mitigation of side-channel attacks is a very important problem.
Although this is an active area of research, the solutions proposed in the
literature have limitations in that they do not work in a real-world
multi-tenancy setting on servers, have false positives or high overheads
limiting their applicability. In this work, we demonstrate a compiler guided
scheduler, Biscuit, which detects the cache-based side-channel attacks for
processes scheduled on multi-tenancy server farms with very high accuracy. At
the heart of the scheme is the generation and use of a cache miss model which
is inserted by the compiler at the entrances of loop nests to predict the
underlying cache misses. Such inserted beacons convey the cache miss
information to the scheduler at run time which uses it to co-schedule processes
such that their combined cache footprint does not exceed the maximum capacity
of the last level cache. The scheduled processes are then monitored for actual
vs predicted cache misses and when an anomaly is detected, the scheduler
performs a binary search to isolate the attacker. We show that Biscuit is able
to detect and mitigate Prime+Probe, Flush+Reload, and Flush+Flush attacks on
OpenSSL cryptography algorithms with an F-score of 1 and also detect and
mitigate degradation of service on the vision application suite with an F-score
of 0.92. Under no attack scenario, the scheme poses low overheads (up to a
maximum of 6\%). We believe that due to its ability to deal with multi-tenancy,
its attack detection precision, ability to mitigate and low overheads, such a
scheme is practicable.

Title: A Verifiable Quantum Secret Sharing Scheme Based on a Single Qubit
Authors: Dan-Li Zhi, Zhi-Hui Li, Zhao-Wei Han, Li-Juan Liu
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  To detect frauds from some internal participants or external attackers, some
verifiable threshold quantum secret sharing schemes have been proposed. In this
paper, we present a new verifiable threshold structure based on a single qubit
using bivariate polynomial. First, Alice chooses an asymmetric bivariate
polynomial and sends a pair of values from this polynomial to each participant.
Then Alice and participants implement in sequence unitary transformation on the
$d$-dimensional quantum state based on unbiased bases, where those unitary
transformations are contacted by this polynomial. Finally, security analysis
shows that the proposed scheme can detect the fraud from external and internal
attacks compared with the exiting schemes and is comparable to the recent
schemes.

Title: TEDL: A Text Encryption Method Based on Deep Learning
Authors: Xiang Li and Peng Wang
Categories: cs.CR cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Recent years have seen an increasing emphasis on information security, and
various encryption methods have been proposed. However, for symmetric
encryption methods, the well-known encryption techniques still rely on the key
space to guarantee security and suffer from frequent key updating. Aiming to
solve those problems, this paper proposes a novel text encryption method based
on deep learning called TEDL, where the secret key includes hyperparameters in
deep learning model and the core step of encryption is transforming input data
into weights trained under hyperparameters. Firstly, both communication parties
establish a word vector table by training a deep learning model according to
specified hyperparameters. Then, a self-update codebook is constructed on the
word vector table with the SHA-256 function and other tricks. When
communication starts, encryption and decryption are equivalent to indexing and
inverted indexing on the codebook, respectively, thus achieving the
transformation between plaintext and ciphertext. Results of experiments and
relevant analyses show that TEDL performs well for security, efficiency,
generality, and has a lower demand for the frequency of key redistribution.
Especially, as a supplement to current encryption methods, the time-consuming
process of constructing a codebook increases the difficulty of brute-force
attacks while not degrade the communication efficiency.

Title: DeepMAL -- Deep Learning Models for Malware Traffic Detection and
  Classification
Authors: Gonzalo Mar\'in, Pedro Casas, Germ\'an Capdehourat
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.NI
\\
  Robust network security systems are essential to prevent and mitigate the
harming effects of the ever-growing occurrence of network attacks. In recent
years, machine learning-based systems have gain popularity for network security
applications, usually considering the application of shallow models, which rely
on the careful engineering of expert, handcrafted input features. The main
limitation of this approach is that handcrafted features can fail to perform
well under different scenarios and types of attacks. Deep Learning (DL) models
can solve this limitation using their ability to learn feature representations
from raw, non-processed data. In this paper we explore the power of DL models
on the specific problem of detection and classification of malware network
traffic. As a major advantage with respect to the state of the art, we consider
raw measurements coming directly from the stream of monitored bytes as input to
the proposed models, and evaluate different raw-traffic feature
representations, including packet and flow-level ones. We introduce DeepMAL, a
DL model which is able to capture the underlying statistics of malicious
traffic, without any sort of expert handcrafted features. Using publicly
available traffic traces containing different families of malware traffic, we
show that DeepMAL can detect and classify malware flows with high accuracy,
outperforming traditional, shallow-like models.

\\
  With the evolution of computer systems, the amount of sensitive data to be
stored as well as the number of threats on these data grow up, making the data
confidentiality increasingly important to computer users. Currently, with
devices always connected to the Internet, the use of cloud data storage
services has become practical and common, allowing quick access to such data
wherever the user is. Such practicality brings with it a concern, precisely the
confidentiality of the data which is delivered to third parties for storage. In
the home environment, disk encryption tools have gained special attention from
users, being used on personal computers and also having native options in some
smartphone operating systems. The present work uses the data sealing, feature
provided by the Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) technology, for
file encryption. A virtual file system is created in which applications can
store their data, keeping the security guarantees provided by the Intel SGX
technology, before send the data to a storage provider. This way, even if the
storage provider is compromised, the data are safe. To validate the proposal,
the Cryptomator software, which is a free client-side encryption tool for cloud
files, was integrated with an Intel SGX application (enclave) for data sealing.
The results demonstrate that the solution is feasible, in terms of performance
and security, and can be expanded and refined for practical use and integration
with cloud synchronization services.

  Connected vehicle (CV) systems are cognizant of potential cyber attacks
because of increasing connectivity between its different components such as
vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and traffic management centers. However, it
is a challenge to detect security threats in real-time and develop appropriate
or effective countermeasures for a CV system because of the dynamic behavior of
such attacks, high computational power requirement, and a historical data
requirement for training detection models. To address these challenges,
statistical models, especially change point models, have potentials for
real-time anomaly detections. Thus, the objective of this study is to
investigate the efficacy of two change point models, Expectation Maximization
(EM) and two forms of Cumulative Summation (CUSUM) algorithms (i.e., typical
and adaptive), for real-time V2I cyber attack detection in a CV Environment. To
prove the efficacy of these models, we evaluated these two models for three
different type of cyber attack, denial of service (DOS), impersonation, and
false information, using basic safety messages (BSMs) generated from CVs
through simulation. Results from numerical analysis revealed that EM, CUSUM,
and adaptive CUSUM could detect these cyber attacks, DOS, impersonation, and
false information, with an accuracy of (99%, 100%, 100%), (98%, 10%, 100%), and
(100%, 98%, 100%) respectively.

Title: Secure Traffic Lights: Replay Attack Detection for Model-based Smart
  Traffic Controllers
Authors: Pratham Oza, Mahsa Foruhandeh, Ryan Gerdes and Thidapat Chantem
Categories: cs.CR cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Rapid urbanization calls for smart traffic management solutions that
incorporate sensors, distributed traffic controllers and V2X communication
technologies to provide fine-grained traffic control to mitigate congestion. As
in many other cyber-physical systems, smart traffic management systems
typically lack security measures. This allows numerous opportunities for
adversarial entities to craft attacks on the sensor networks, wireless data
sharing and/or the distributed traffic controllers. We show that such
vulnerabilities can be exploited to disrupt mobility in a large urban area and
cause unsafe conditions for drivers and the pedestrians on the roads.
Specifically, in this paper, we look into vulnerabilities in model-based
traffic controllers and show that, even with state-of-the-art attack detectors
in place, false-data injection can be used to hamper mobility. We demonstrate a
replay attack by modeling an isolated intersection in VISSIM, a popular traffic
simulator and also discuss countermeasures to thwart such attacks.

Title: Towards Probabilistic Verification of Machine Unlearning

  Right to be forgotten, also known as the right to erasure, is the right of
individuals to have their data erased from an entity storing it. The General
Data Protection Regulation in the European Union legally solidified the status
of this long held notion. As a consequence, there is a growing need for the
development of mechanisms whereby users can verify if service providers comply
with their deletion requests.
  In this work, we take the first step in proposing a formal framework to study
the design of such verification mechanisms for data deletion requests -- also
known as machine unlearning -- in the context of systems that provide machine
learning as a service. We propose a backdoor-based verification mechanism and
demonstrate its effectiveness in certifying data deletion with high confidence
using the above framework. Our mechanism makes a novel use of backdoor attacks
in ML as a basis for quantitatively inferring machine unlearning. In our
mechanism, each user poisons part of its training data by injecting a
user-specific backdoor trigger associated with a user-specific target label.
The prediction of target labels on test samples with the backdoor trigger is
then used as an indication of the user's data being used to train the ML model.
  We formalize the verification process as a hypothesis testing problem, and
provide theoretical guarantees on the statistical power of the hypothesis test.
We experimentally demonstrate that our approach has minimal effect on the
machine learning service but provides high confidence verification of
unlearning. We show that with a $30\%$ poison ratio and merely $20$ test
queries, our verification mechanism has both false positive and false negative
ratios below $10^{-5}$. Furthermore, we also show the effectiveness of our
approach by testing it against an adaptive adversary that uses a
state-of-the-art backdoor defense method.

Title: Scalable Uncertainty for Computer Vision with Functional Variational
  Inference
Authors: Eduardo D C Carvalho, Ronald Clark, Andrea Nicastro, Paul H J Kelly
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR 2020
\\
  As Deep Learning continues to yield successful applications in Computer
Vision, the ability to quantify all forms of uncertainty is a paramount
requirement for its safe and reliable deployment in the real-world. In this
work, we leverage the formulation of variational inference in function space,
where we associate Gaussian Processes (GPs) to both Bayesian CNN priors and
variational family. Since GPs are fully determined by their mean and covariance
functions, we are able to obtain predictive uncertainty estimates at the cost
of a single forward pass through any chosen CNN architecture and for any
supervised learning task. By leveraging the structure of the induced covariance
matrices, we propose numerically efficient algorithms which enable fast
training in the context of high-dimensional tasks such as depth estimation and
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions for
constructing regression loss functions whose probabilistic counterparts are
compatible with aleatoric uncertainty quantification.

  Disentanglement learning is crucial for obtaining disentangled
representations and controllable generation. Current disentanglement methods
face several inherent limitations: difficulty with high-resolution images,
primarily on learning disentangled representations, and non-identifiability due
to the unsupervised setting. To alleviate these limitations, we design new
architectures and loss functions based on StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2019), for
semi-supervised high-resolution disentanglement learning. We create two complex
high-resolution synthetic datasets for systematic testing. We investigate the
impact of limited supervision and find that using only 0.25%~2.5% of labeled
data is sufficient for good disentanglement on both synthetic and real
datasets. We propose new metrics to quantify generator controllability, and
observe there may exist a crucial trade-off between disentangled representation
learning and controllable generation. We also consider semantic fine-grained
image editing to achieve better generalization to unseen images.

Categories: cs.CV cs.GR
\\
  Recovering 3D human pose from 2D joints is a highly unconstrained problem. We
propose a novel neural network framework, PoseNet3D, that takes 2D joints as
input and outputs 3D skeletons and SMPL body model parameters. By casting our
learning approach in a student-teacher framework, we avoid using any 3D data
such as paired/unpaired 3D data, motion capture sequences, depth images or
multi-view images during training. We first train a teacher network that
outputs 3D skeletons, using only 2D poses for training. The teacher network
distills its knowledge to a student network that predicts 3D pose in SMPL
representation. Finally, both the teacher and the student networks are jointly
fine-tuned in an end-to-end manner using temporal, self-consistency and
adversarial losses, improving the accuracy of each individual network. Results
on Human3.6M dataset for 3D human pose estimation demonstrate that our approach
reduces the 3D joint prediction error by 18\% compared to previous unsupervised
methods. Qualitative results on in-the-wild datasets show that the recovered 3D
poses and meshes are natural, realistic, and flow smoothly over consecutive
frames.

Title: ReActNet: Towards Precise Binary Neural Network with Generalized
  Activation Functions
Authors: Zechun Liu and Zhiqiang Shen and Marios Savvides and Kwang-Ting Cheng
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  In this paper, we propose several ideas for enhancing a binary network to
close its accuracy gap from real-valued networks without incurring any
additional computational cost. We first construct a baseline network by
modifying and binarizing a compact real-valued network with parameter-free
shortcuts, bypassing all the intermediate convolutional layers including the
downsampling layers. This baseline network strikes a good trade-off between
accuracy and efficiency, achieving superior performance than most of existing
binary networks at approximately half of the computational cost. Through
extensive experiments and analysis, we observed that the performance of binary
networks is sensitive to activation distribution variations. Based on this
important observation, we propose to generalize the traditional Sign and PReLU
functions, denoted as RSign and RPReLU for the respective generalized
functions, to enable explicit learning of the distribution reshape and shift at
near-zero extra cost. Lastly, we adopt a distributional loss to further enforce
the binary network to learn similar output distributions as those of a
real-valued network. We show that after incorporating all these ideas, the
proposed ReActNet outperforms all the state-of-the-arts by a large margin.
Specifically, it outperforms Real-to-Binary Net and MeliusNet29 by 4.0% and
3.6% respectively for the top-1 accuracy and also reduces the gap to its
real-valued counterpart to within 3.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset.

Title: Super Resolution Using Segmentation-Prior Self-Attention Generative
  Adversarial Network
Authors: Yuxin Zhang, Zuquan Zheng, Roland Hu
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is intensively implemented to solve super
resolution (SR) tasks because of its superior performance. However, the problem
of super resolution is still challenging due to the lack of prior knowledge and
small receptive field of CNN. We propose the Segmentation-Piror Self-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (SPSAGAN) to combine segmentation-priors and
feature attentions into a unified framework. This combination is led by a
carefully designed weighted addition to balance the influence of feature and
segmentation attentions, so that the network can emphasize textures in the same
segmentation category and meanwhile focus on the long-distance feature
relationship. We also propose a lightweight skip connection architecture called
Residual-in-Residual Sparse Block (RRSB) to further improve the
super-resolution performance and save computation. Extensive experiments show
that SPSAGAN can generate more realistic and visually pleasing textures
compared to state-of-the-art SFTGAN and ESRGAN on many SR datasets.

Comments: 17 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Change detection is an important problem in vision field, especially for
aerial images. However, most works focus on traditional change detection, i.e.,
where changes happen, without considering the change type information, i.e.,
what changes happen. Although a few works have tried to apply semantic
information to traditional change detection, they either only give the label of
emerging objects without taking the change type into consideration, or set some
kinds of change subjectively without specifying semantic information. To make
use of semantic information and analyze change types comprehensively, we
propose a new task called semantic change pattern analysis for aerial images.
Given a pair of co-registered aerial images, the task requires a result
including both where and what changes happen. We then describe the metric
adopted for the task, which is clean and interpretable. We further provide the
first well-annotated aerial image dataset for this task. Extensive baseline
experiments are conducted as reference for following works. The aim of this
work is to explore high-level information based on change detection and
facilitate the development of this field with the publicly available dataset.

  To generate new images for a given category, most deep generative models
require abundant training images from this category, which are often too
expensive to acquire. To achieve the goal of generation based on only a few

conditional images from the same category and generate new images for this
category based on the fused features. The matching discriminator extends
conventional GAN discriminator by matching the feature of generated image with
the fused feature of conditional images. Extensive experiments on three

Title: Weight mechanism adding a constant in concatenation of series connect
Authors: Xiaojie Qi and Yindi Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 7 pages, 9 figures
\\
  It is a consensus that feature maps in the shallow layer are more related to
image attributes such as texture and shape, whereas abstract semantic
representation exists in the deep layer. Meanwhile, some image information will
be lost in the process of the convolution operation. Naturally, the direct
method is combining them together to gain lost detailed information through
concatenation or adding. In fact, the image representation flowed in feature
fusion can not match with the semantic representation completely, and the
semantic deviation in different layers also destroy the information
purification, that leads to useless information being mixed into the fusion
layers. Therefore, it is crucial to narrow the gap among the fused layers and
reduce the impact of noises during fusion. In this paper, we propose a method
named weight mechanism to reduce the gap between feature maps in concatenation
of series connection, and we get a better result of 0.80% mIoU improvement on
Massachusetts building dataset by changing the weight of the concatenation of
series connection in residual U-Net. Specifically, we design a new architecture
named fused U-Net to test weight mechanism, and it also gains 0.12% mIoU
improvement.

Title: Cross-modal Learning for Multi-modal Video Categorization
Authors: Palash Goyal, Saurabh Sahu, Shalini Ghosh, Chul Lee
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Multi-modal machine learning (ML) models can process data in multiple
modalities (e.g., video, audio, text) and are useful for video content analysis
in a variety of problems (e.g., object detection, scene understanding, activity
recognition). In this paper, we focus on the problem of video categorization
using a multi-modal ML technique. In particular, we have developed a novel
multi-modal ML approach that we call "cross-modal learning", where one modality
influences another but only when there is correlation between the modalities
--- for that, we first train a correlation tower that guides the main
multi-modal video categorization tower in the model. We show how this
cross-modal principle can be applied to different types of models (e.g., RNN,
Transformer, NetVLAD), and demonstrate through experiments how our proposed
multi-modal video categorization models with cross-modal learning out-perform
strong state-of-the-art baseline models.

\\
  Despite Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used in
various image-to-image translation tasks, they can be hardly applied on mobile
devices due to their heavy computation and storage cost. Traditional network
compression methods focus on visually recognition tasks, but never deal with
generation tasks. Inspired by knowledge distillation, a student generator of
fewer parameters is trained by inheriting the low-level and high-level
information from the original heavy teacher generator. To promote the
capability of student generator, we include a student discriminator to measure
the distances between real images, and images generated by student and teacher
generators. An adversarial learning process is therefore established to
optimize student generator and student discriminator. Qualitative and
quantitative analysis by conducting experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method can learn portable generative models with
strong performance.

Title: MobilePose: Real-Time Pose Estimation for Unseen Objects with Weak Shape
  Supervision
Authors: Tingbo Hou, Adel Ahmadyan, Liangkai Zhang, Jianing Wei, and Matthias
  Grundmann
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we address the problem of detecting unseen objects from RGB
images and estimating their poses in 3D. We propose two mobile friendly
networks: MobilePose-Base and MobilePose-Shape. The former is used when there
is only pose supervision, and the latter is for the case when shape supervision
is available, even a weak one. We revisit shape features used in previous
methods, including segmentation and coordinate map. We explain when and why
pixel-level shape supervision can improve pose estimation. Consequently, we add
shape prediction as an intermediate layer in the MobilePose-Shape, and let the
network learn pose from shape. Our models are trained on mixed real and
synthetic data, with weak and noisy shape supervision. They are ultra
lightweight that can run in real-time on modern mobile devices (e.g. 36 FPS on
Galaxy S20). Comparing with previous single-shot solutions, our method has
higher accuracy, while using a significantly smaller model (2~3% in model size
or number of parameters).

Title: TTPP: Temporal Transformer with Progressive Prediction for Efficient
  Action Anticipation
Authors: Wen Wang, Xiaojiang Peng, Yanzhou Su, Yu Qiao, Jian Cheng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Video action anticipation aims to predict future action categories from
observed frames. Current state-of-the-art approaches mainly resort to recurrent
neural networks to encode history information into hidden states, and predict
future actions from the hidden representations. It is well known that the
recurrent pipeline is inefficient in capturing long-term information which may
limit its performance in predication task. To address this problem, this paper
proposes a simple yet efficient Temporal Transformer with Progressive
Prediction (TTPP) framework, which repurposes a Transformer-style architecture
to aggregate observed features, and then leverages a light-weight network to
progressively predict future features and actions. Specifically, predicted
features along with predicted probabilities are accumulated into the inputs of
subsequent prediction. We evaluate our approach on three action datasets,
namely TVSeries, THUMOS-14, and TV-Human-Interaction. Additionally we also
conduct a comprehensive study for several popular aggregation and prediction
strategies. Extensive results show that TTPP not only outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods but also more efficient.

Title: Crowd Counting via Hierarchical Scale Recalibration Network
Authors: Zhikang Zou and Yifan Liu and Shuangjie Xu and Wei Wei and Shiping Wen
  and Pan Zhou
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ECAI2020
\\
  The task of crowd counting is extremely challenging due to complicated
difficulties, especially the huge variation in vision scale. Previous works
tend to adopt a naive concatenation of multi-scale information to tackle it,
while the scale shifts between the feature maps are ignored. In this paper, we
propose a novel Hierarchical Scale Recalibration Network (HSRNet), which
addresses the above issues by modeling rich contextual dependencies and
recalibrating multiple scale-associated information. Specifically, a Scale
Focus Module (SFM) first integrates global context into local features by
modeling the semantic inter-dependencies along channel and spatial dimensions
sequentially. In order to reallocate channel-wise feature responses, a Scale
Recalibration Module (SRM) adopts a step-by-step fusion to generate final
density maps. Furthermore, we propose a novel Scale Consistency loss to
constrain that the scale-associated outputs are coherent with groundtruth of
different scales. With the proposed modules, our approach can ignore various
noises selectively and focus on appropriate crowd scales automatically.
Extensive experiments on crowd counting datasets (ShanghaiTech, MALL,
WorldEXPO'10, and UCSD) show that our HSRNet can deliver superior results over
all state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, we extend experiments on an
extra vehicle dataset, whose results indicate that the proposed model is
generalized to other applications.

Title: CPM R-CNN: Calibrating Point-guided Misalignment in Object Detection
Authors: Bin Zhu, Qing Song, Lu Yang, Zhihui Wang, Chun Liu, Mengjie Hu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In object detection, offset-guided and point-guided regression dominate
anchor-based and anchor-free method separately. Recently, point-guided approach
is introduced to anchor-based method. However, we observe points predicted by
this way are misaligned with matched region of proposals and score of
localization, causing a notable gap in performance. In this paper, we propose
CPM R-CNN which contains three efficient modules to optimize anchor-based
point-guided method. According to sufficient evaluations on the COCO dataset,
CPM R-CNN is demonstrated efficient to improve the localization accuracy by
calibrating mentioned misalignment. Compared with Faster R-CNN and Grid R-CNN
based on ResNet-101 with FPN, our approach can substantially improve detection
mAP by 3.3% and 1.5% respectively without whistles and bells. Moreover, our
best model achieves improvement by a large margin to 49.9% on COCO test-dev.

Title: StyleGAN2 Distillation for Feed-forward Image Manipulation
Authors: Yuri Viazovetskyi, Vladimir Ivashkin, Evgeny Kashin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  StyleGAN2 is a state-of-the-art network in generating realistic images.
Besides, it was explicitly trained to have disentangled directions in latent
space, which allows efficient image manipulation by varying latent factors.
Editing existing images requires embedding a given image into the latent space
of StyleGAN2. Latent code optimization via backpropagation is commonly used for
qualitative embedding of real world images, although it is prohibitively slow
for many applications. We propose a way to distill a particular image
manipulation of StyleGAN2 into image-to-image network trained in paired way.
The resulting pipeline is an alternative to existing GANs, trained on unpaired
data. We provide results of human faces' transformation: gender swap,
aging/rejuvenation, style transfer and image morphing. We show that the quality
of generation using our method is comparable to StyleGAN2 backpropagation and
current state-of-the-art methods in these particular tasks.

Title: Generative Low-bitwidth Data Free Quantization
Authors: Shoukai Xu, Haokun Li, Bohan Zhuang, Jing Liu, Jiezhang Cao, Chuangrun
  Liang, Mingkui Tan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Neural network quantization is an effective way to compress deep models and
improve the execution latency and energy efficiency, so that they can be
deployed on mobile or embedded devices. Existing quantization methods require
original data for calibration or fine-tuning to get better performance.
However, in many real-world scenarios, the data may not be available due to
confidential or private issues, making existing quantization methods not
applicable. Moreover, due to the absence of original data, the recently
developed generative adversarial networks (GANs) can not be applied to generate
data. Although the full precision model may contain the entire data
information, such information alone is hard to exploit for recovering the
original data or generating new meaningful data. In this paper, we investigate
a simple-yet-effective method called Generative Low-bitwidth Data Free
Quantization to remove the data dependence burden. Specifically, we propose a
Knowledge Matching Generator to produce meaningful fake data by exploiting
classification boundary knowledge and distribution information in the
pre-trained model. With the help of generated data, we are able to quantize a
model by learning knowledge from the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments
on three data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. More
critically, our method achieves much higher accuracy on 4-bit quantization than
the existing data free quantization method.

\\
  Change detection is a basic task of remote sensing image processing. The
research objective is to identity the change information of interest and filter
out the irrelevant change information as interference factors. Recently, the
rise of deep learning has provided new tools for change detection, which have
yielded impressive results. However, the available methods focus mainly on the
difference information between multitemporal remote sensing images and lack
robustness to pseudo-change information. To overcome the lack of resistance of
current methods to pseudo-changes, in this paper, we propose a new method,
namely, dual attentive fully convolutional Siamese networks (DASNet) for change
detection in high-resolution images. Through the dual-attention mechanism,
long-range dependencies are captured to obtain more discriminant feature
representations to enhance the recognition performance of the model. Moreover,
the imbalanced sample is a serious problem in change detection, i.e. unchanged
samples are much more than changed samples, which is one of the main reasons
resulting in pseudo-changes. We put forward the weighted double margin
contrastive loss to address this problem by punishing the attention to
unchanged feature pairs and increase attention to changed feature pairs. The
experimental results of our method on the change detection dataset (CDD) and
the building change detection dataset (BCDD) demonstrate that compared with
other baseline methods, the proposed method realizes maximum improvements of
2.1\% and 3.6\%, respectively, in the F1 score. Our Pytorch implementation is
available at https://github.com/lehaifeng/DASNet.

Title: AlphaNet: An Attention Guided Deep Network for Automatic Image Matting
Authors: Rishab Sharma, Rahul Deora and Anirudha Vishvakarma
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
ACM-class: I.2.10; I.4.8; I.5.1
\\
  In this paper, we propose an end to end solution for image matting i.e
high-precision extraction of foreground objects from natural images. Image
matting and background detection can be achieved easily through chroma keying
in a studio setting when the background is either pure green or blue.
Nonetheless, image matting in natural scenes with complex and uneven depth
backgrounds remains a tedious task that requires human intervention. To achieve
complete automatic foreground extraction in natural scenes, we propose a method
that assimilates semantic segmentation and deep image matting processes into a
single network to generate detailed semantic mattes for image composition task.
The contribution of our proposed method is two-fold, firstly it can be
interpreted as a fully automated semantic image matting method and secondly as
a refinement of existing semantic segmentation models. We propose a novel model
architecture as a combination of segmentation and matting that unifies the
function of upsampling and downsampling operators with the notion of attention.
As shown in our work, attention guided downsampling and upsampling can extract
high-quality boundary details, unlike other normal downsampling and upsampling
techniques. For achieving the same, we utilized an attention guided
encoder-decoder framework which does unsupervised learning for generating an
attention map adaptively from the data to serve and direct the upsampling and
downsampling operators. We also construct a fashion e-commerce focused dataset
with high-quality alpha mattes to facilitate the training and evaluation for
image matting.

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  The availability of real-world datasets is the prerequisite to develop object
detection methods for autonomous driving. While ambiguity exists in object
labels due to error-prone annotation process or sensor observation noises,
current object detection datasets only provide deterministic annotations,
without considering their uncertainty. This precludes an in-depth evaluation
among different object detection methods, especially for those that explicitly
model predictive probability. In this work, we propose a generative model to
estimate bounding box label uncertainties from LiDAR point clouds, and define a
new representation of the probabilistic bounding box through spatial
distribution. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed model represents
uncertainties commonly seen in driving scenarios. Based on the spatial
distribution, we further propose an extension of IoU, called the Jaccard IoU
(JIoU), as a new evaluation metric that incorporates label uncertainty. The
experiments on the KITTI and the Waymo Open Datasets show that JIoU is superior
to IoU when evaluating probabilistic object detectors.

\\
  In this paper, we introduce SalsaNext for the semantic segmentation of a full
3D LiDAR point cloud in real-time. SalsaNext is the next version of SalsaNet
[1] which has an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder unit has a set
of ResNet blocks and the decoder part combines upsampled features from the
residual blocks. In contrast to SalsaNet, we have an additional layer in the
encoder and decoder, introduce the context module, switch from stride
convolution to average pooling and also apply central dropout treatment. To
directly optimize the Jaccard index, we further combine the weighted
cross-entropy loss with Lovasz-Softmax loss [2]. We provide a thorough
quantitative evaluation on the Semantic-KITTI dataset [3], which demonstrates
that the proposed SalsaNext outperforms other state-of-the-art semantic

Title: Adaptive Offline Quintuplet Loss for Image-Text Matching
Authors: Tianlang Chen, Jiajun Deng, Jiebo Luo
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Code will be released
\\
  Existing image-text matching approaches typically leverage triplet loss with
online hard negatives to train the model. For each image or text anchor in a
training mini-batch, the model is trained to distinguish between a positive and
the most confusing negative of the anchor mined from the mini-batch (i.e.
online hard negative). This strategy improves the model's capacity to discover
fine-grained correspondences and non-correspondences between image and text
inputs. However, the above training approach has the following drawbacks: (1)
the negative selection strategy still provides limited chances for the model to
learn from very hard-to-distinguish cases. (2) The trained model has weak
generalization capability from the training set to the testing set. (3) The
penalty lacks hierarchy and adaptiveness for hard negatives with different
``hardness'' degrees. In this paper, we propose solutions by sampling negatives
offline from the whole training set. It provides ``harder'' offline negatives
than online hard negatives for the model to distinguish. Based on the offline
hard negatives, a quintuplet loss is proposed to improve the model's
generalization capability to distinguish positives and negatives. In addition,
a novel loss function that combines the knowledge of positives, offline hard
negatives and online hard negatives is created. It leverages offline hard
negatives as intermediary to adaptively penalize them based on their distance
relations to the anchor. We evaluate the proposed training approach on three
state-of-the-art image-text models on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets.
Significant performance improvements are observed for all the models,
demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep image embedding provides a way to measure the semantic similarity of two
images. It plays a central role in many applications such as image search, face
verification, and zero-shot learning. It is desirable to have a universal deep
embedding model applicable to various domains of images. However, existing
methods mainly rely on training specialist embedding models each of which is
applicable to images from a single domain. In this paper, we study an important
but unexplored task: how to train a single universal image embedding model to
match the performance of several specialists on each specialist's domain.
Simply fusing the training data from multiple domains cannot solve this problem
because some domains become overfitted sooner when trained together using
existing methods. Therefore, we propose to distill the knowledge in multiple
specialists into a universal embedding to solve this problem. In contrast to
existing embedding distillation methods that distill the absolute distances
between images, we transform the absolute distances between images into a
probabilistic distribution and minimize the KL-divergence between the
distributions of the specialists and the universal embedding. Using several
public datasets, we validate that our proposed method accomplishes the goal of
universal image embedding.

Title: Transferring Cross-domain Knowledge for Video Sign Language Recognition
Authors: Dongxu Li, Xin Yu, Chenchen Xu, Lars Petersson, Hongdong Li
Categories: cs.CV cs.HC cs.MM
Comments: CVPR2020 preprint
\\
  Word-level sign language recognition (WSLR) is a fundamental task in sign
language interpretation. It requires models to recognize isolated sign words
from videos. However, annotating WSLR data needs expert knowledge, thus
limiting WSLR dataset acquisition. On the contrary, there are abundant
subtitled sign news videos on the internet. Since these videos have no
word-level annotation and exhibit a large domain gap from isolated signs, they
cannot be directly used for training WSLR models. We observe that despite the
existence of a large domain gap, isolated and news signs share the same visual
concepts, such as hand gestures and body movements. Motivated by this
observation, we propose a novel method that learns domain-invariant visual
concepts and fertilizes WSLR models by transferring knowledge of subtitled news
sign to them. To this end, we extract news signs using a base WSLR model, and
then design a classifier jointly trained on news and isolated signs to coarsely
align these two domain features. In order to learn domain-invariant features
within each class and suppress domain-specific features, our method further
resorts to an external memory to store the class centroids of the aligned news
signs. We then design a temporal attention based on the learnt descriptor to
improve recognition performance. Experimental results on standard WSLR datasets
show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
significantly. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on
automatically localizing signs from sign news, achieving 28.1 for AP@0.5.

  Merchandise categories inherently form a semantic hierarchy with different
levels of concept abstraction, especially for fine-grained categories. This
hierarchy encodes rich correlations among various categories across different
levels, which can effectively regularize the semantic space and thus make
predictions less ambiguous. However, previous studies of fine-grained image
retrieval primarily focus on semantic similarities or visual similarities. In a
real application, merely using visual similarity may not satisfy the need of
consumers to search merchandise with real-life images, e.g., given a red coat
as a query image, we might get a red suit in recall results only based on
visual similarity since they are visually similar. But the users actually want
a coat rather than suit even the coat is with different color or texture
attributes. We introduce this new problem based on photoshopping in real
practice. That's why semantic information are integrated to regularize the
margins to make "semantic" prior to "visual". To solve this new problem, we
propose a hierarchical adaptive semantic-visual tree (ASVT) to depict the
architecture of merchandise categories, which evaluates semantic similarities
between different semantic levels and visual similarities within the same
semantic class simultaneously. The semantic information satisfies the demand of
consumers for similar merchandise with the query while the visual information
optimizes the correlations within the semantic class. At each level, we set
different margins based on the semantic hierarchy and incorporate them as prior
information to learn a fine-grained feature embedding. To evaluate our
framework, we propose a new dataset named JDProduct, with hierarchical labels
collected from actual image queries and official merchandise images on an
online shopping application. Extensive experimental results on the public

Title: Trajectory Grouping with Curvature Regularization for Tubular Structure
  Tracking
Authors: Li Liu, Jiong Zhang, Da Chen, HUazhong Shu and Laurent D. Cohen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Tubular structure tracking is an important and difficult problem in the
fields of computer vision and medical image analysis. The minimal path models
have exhibited its power in tracing tubular structures, by which a centerline
can be naturally treated as a minimal path with a suitable geodesic metric.
However, existing minimal path-based tubular structure tracing models still
suffer from difficulty like the shortcuts and short branches combination
problems, especially when dealing with the images with a complicated
background. We introduce a new minima path-based model for minimally
interactive tubular structure centerline extraction in conjunction with a
perceptual grouping scheme. We take into account the prescribed tubular
trajectories and the relevant curvature-penalized geodesic distances for
minimal paths extraction in a graph-based optimization way. Experimental
results on both synthetic and real images prove that the proposed model indeed
obtains outperformance comparing to state-of-the-art minimal path-based tubular
structure tracing algorithms.

Title: Meta3D: Single-View 3D Object Reconstruction from Shape Priors in Memory
Authors: Shuo Yang, Min Xu, Hongxun Yao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Submitted to ECCV 2020
\\
  3D shape reconstruction from a single-view RGB image is an ill-posed problem
due to the invisible parts of the object to be reconstructed. Most of the
existing methods rely on large-scale data to obtain shape priors through tuning
parameters of reconstruction models. These methods might not be able to deal
with the cases with heavy object occlusions and noisy background since prior
information can not be retained completely or applied efficiently. In this
paper, we are the first to develop a memory-based meta-learning framework for
single-view 3D reconstruction. A write controller is designed to extract
shape-discriminative features from images and store image features and their
corresponding volumes into external memory. A read controller is proposed to
sequentially encode shape priors related to the input image and predict a
shape-specific refiner. Experimental results demonstrate that our Meta3D
outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a large margin through retaining
shape priors explicitly, especially for the extremely difficult cases.

Title: Object-Oriented Video Captioning with Temporal Graph and Prior Knowledge
  Building
Authors: Fangyi Zhu, Jenq-Nent Hwang, Zhanyu Ma, Guo Jun
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Traditional video captioning requests a holistic description of the video,
yet the detailed descriptions of the specific objects may not be available.
Besides, most methods adopt frame-level inter-object features and ambiguous
descriptions during training, which is difficult for learning the
vision-language relationships. Without associating the transition trajectories,
these image-based methods cannot understand the activities with visual
features. We propose a novel task, named object-oriented video captioning,
which focuses on understanding the videos in object-level. We re-annotate the
object-sentence pairs for more effective cross-modal learning. Thereafter, we
design the video-based object-oriented video captioning (OVC)-Net to reliably
analyze the activities along time with only visual features and capture the
vision-language connections under small datasets stably. To demonstrate the
effectiveness, we evaluate the method on the new dataset and compare it with
the state-of-the-arts for video captioning. From the experimental results, the
OVC-Net exhibits the ability of precisely describing the concurrent objects and
their activities in details.

Title: A Multi-scale CNN-CRF Framework for Environmental Microorganism Image
  Segmentation
Authors: Jinghua Zhang, Chen Li, Frank Kulwa, Xin Zhao, Changhao Sun, Zihan Li,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In order to assist researchers to identify Environmental Microorganisms (EMs)
effectively, a Multi-scale CNN-CRF (MSCC) framework for the EM image
segmentation is proposed in this paper. There are two parts in this framework:
The first is a novel pixel-level segmentation approach, using a newly
introduced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely "mU-Net-B3", with a dense
Conditional Random Field (CRF) post-processing. The second is a VGG-16 based
patch-level segmentation method with a novel "buffer" strategy, which further
improves the segmentation quality of the details of the EMs. In the experiment,
compared with the state-of-the-art methods on 420 EM images, the proposed MSCC
method reduces the memory requirement from 355 MB to 103 MB, improves the
overall evaluation indexes (Dice, Jaccard, Recall, Accuracy) from 85.24%,
77.42%, 82.27% and 96.76% to 87.13%, 79.74%, 87.12% and 96.91% respectively,
and reduces the volume overlap error from 22.58% to 20.26%. Therefore, the MSCC
method shows a big potential in the EM segmentation field.

Title: Better Captioning with Sequence-Level Exploration
Authors: Jia Chen, Qin Jin
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: accepted by CVPR 2020
\\
  Sequence-level learning objective has been widely used in captioning tasks to
achieve the state-of-the-art performance for many models. In this objective,
the model is trained by the reward on the quality of its generated captions
(sequence-level). In this work, we show the limitation of the current
sequence-level learning objective for captioning tasks from both theory and
empirical result. In theory, we show that the current objective is equivalent
to only optimizing the precision side of the caption set generated by the model
and therefore overlooks the recall side. Empirical result shows that the model
trained by this objective tends to get lower score on the recall side. We
propose to add a sequence-level exploration term to the current objective to
boost recall. It guides the model to explore more plausible captions in the
training. In this way, the proposed objective takes both the precision and
recall sides of generated captions into account. Experiments show the
effectiveness of the proposed method on both video and image captioning
datasets.

Title: Domain-Specific Image Super-Resolution with Progressive Adversarial
  Network
Authors: Wong Lone, Zhao Deli, Wan Shaohua, Zhang Bo
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) aims to improve resolution of small-size
low-quality image from a single one. With popularity of consumer electronics in
our daily life, this topic has become more and more attractive. In this paper,
we argue that the curse of dimensionality is the underlying reason of limiting
the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms. To address this issue, we
propose Progressive Adversarial Network (PAN) that is capable of coping with
this difficulty for domainspecific image super-resolution. The key principle of
PAN is that we do not apply any distance-based reconstruction errors as the
loss to be optimized, thus free from the restriction of the curse of
dimensionality. To maintain faithful reconstruction precision, we resort to
U-Net and progressive growing of neural architecture. The low-level features in
encoder can be transferred into decoder to enhance textural details with U-Net.
Progressive growing enhances image resolution gradually, thereby preserving
precision of recovered image. Moreover, to obtain high-fidelity outputs, we
leverage the framework of the powerful StyleGAN to perform adversarial
learning. Without the curse of dimensionality, our model can super-resolve
large-size images with remarkable photo-realistic details and few distortion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over
existing state-of-the-arts both quantitatively and qualitatively.

\\
  Detecting objects in 3D from a monocular camera has been successfully
demonstrated using various methods based on convolutional neural networks.
These methods have been demonstrated on rectilinear perspective images
equivalent to being taken by a pinhole camera, whose geometry is explicitly or
implicitly exploited. Such methods fail in images with alternative projections,
such as those acquired by fisheye cameras, even when provided with a labeled
training set of fisheye images and 3D bounding boxes. In this work, we show how
to adapt existing 3D object detection methods to images from fisheye cameras,
including in the case that no labeled fisheye data is available for training.
We significantly outperform existing art on a benchmark of synthetic data, and
we also experiment with an internal dataset of real fisheye images.

\\
  Temporal Color Constancy (CC) is a recently proposed approach that challenges
the conventional single-frame color constancy. The conventional approach is to
use a single frame - shot frame - to estimate the scene illumination color. In
temporal CC, multiple frames from the view finder sequence are used to estimate
the color. However, there are no realistic large scale temporal color constancy
datasets for method evaluation. In this work, a new temporal CC benchmark is
introduced. The benchmark comprises of (1) 600 real-world sequences recorded
with a high-resolution mobile phone camera, (2) a fixed train-test split which
ensures consistent evaluation, and (3) a baseline method which achieves high
accuracy in the new benchmark and the dataset used in previous works. Results
for more than 20 well-known color constancy methods including the recent
state-of-the-arts are reported in our experiments.

Title: Pixel-In-Pixel Net: Towards Efficient Facial Landmark Detection in the
  Wild
Authors: Haibo Jin, Shengcai Liao, Ling Shao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recently, heatmap regression based models become popular because of their
superior performance on locating facial landmarks. However, high-resolution
feature maps have to be either generated repeatedly or maintained through the
network for such models, which is computationally inefficient for practical
applications. Moreover, their generalization capabilities across domains are
rarely explored. To address these two problems, we propose Pixel-In-Pixel (PIP)
Net for facial landmark detection. The proposed model is equipped with a novel
detection head based on heatmap regression. Different from conventional heatmap
regression, the new detection head conducts score prediction on low-resolution
feature maps. To localize landmarks more precisely, it also conduct offset
predictions within each heatmap pixel. By doing this, the inference time is
largely reduced without losing accuracy. Besides, we also propose to leverage
unlabeled images to improve the generalization capbility of our model through
image translation based data distillation. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks show that PIP Net is comparable to state-of-the-arts while running
at $27.8$ FPS on a CPU.

Title: IMRAM: Iterative Matching with Recurrent Attention Memory for
  Cross-Modal Image-Text Retrieval
Authors: Hui Chen, Guiguang Ding, Xudong Liu, Zijia Lin, Ji Liu, Jungong Han
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 9 pages; Accepted by CVPR2020
\\
  Enabling bi-directional retrieval of images and texts is important for
understanding the correspondence between vision and language. Existing methods
leverage the attention mechanism to explore such correspondence in a
fine-grained manner. However, most of them consider all semantics equally and
thus align them uniformly, regardless of their diverse complexities. In fact,
semantics are diverse (i.e. involving different kinds of semantic concepts),
and humans usually follow a latent structure to combine them into
understandable languages. It may be difficult to optimally capture such
sophisticated correspondences in existing methods. In this paper, to address
such a deficiency, we propose an Iterative Matching with Recurrent Attention
Memory (IMRAM) method, in which correspondences between images and texts are
captured with multiple steps of alignments. Specifically, we introduce an
iterative matching scheme to explore such fine-grained correspondence
progressively. A memory distillation unit is used to refine alignment knowledge
from early steps to later ones. Experiment results on three benchmark datasets,
i.e. Flickr8K, Flickr30K, and MS COCO, show that our IMRAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance, well demonstrating its effectiveness. Experiments
on a practical business advertisement dataset, named \Ads{}, further validates
the applicability of our method in practical scenarios.

Title: Rectifying Pseudo Label Learning via Uncertainty Estimation for Domain
  Adaptive Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Zhedong Zheng and Yi Yang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables
\\
  This paper focuses on the unsupervised domain adaptation of transferring the
knowledge from the source domain to the target domain in the context of
semantic segmentation. Existing approaches usually regard the pseudo label as
the ground truth to fully exploit the unlabeled target-domain data. Yet the
pseudo labels of the target-domain data are usually predicted by the model
trained on the source domain. Thus, the generated labels inevitably contain the
incorrect prediction due to the discrepancy between the training domain and the
test domain, which could be transferred to the final adapted model and largely
compromises the training process. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes
to explicitly estimate the prediction uncertainty during training to rectify
the pseudo label learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation adaptation.
Given the input image, the model outputs the semantic segmentation prediction
as well as the uncertainty of the prediction. Specifically, we model the
uncertainty via the prediction variance and involve the uncertainty into the
optimization objective. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we
evaluate the proposed method on two prevalent synthetic-to-real semantic
segmentation benchmarks, i.e., GTA5 -> Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes, as
well as one cross-city benchmark, i.e., Cityscapes -> Oxford RobotCar. We
demonstrate through extensive experiments that the proposed approach (1)
dynamically sets different confidence thresholds according to the prediction
variance, (2) rectifies the learning from noisy pseudo labels, and (3) achieves
significant improvements over the conventional pseudo label learning and yields
competitive performance on all three benchmarks.

Title: DADA: Differentiable Automatic Data Augmentation
Authors: Yonggang Li and Guosheng Hu and Yongtao Wang and Timothy Hospedales
  and Neil M. Robertson and Yongxing Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Data augmentation (DA) techniques aim to increase data variability, and thus
train deep networks with better generalisation. The pioneering AutoAugment
automated the search for optimal DA policies with reinforcement learning.
However, AutoAugment is extremely computationally expensive, limiting its wide
applicability. Followup work such as PBA and Fast AutoAugment improved
efficiency, but optimization speed remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we
propose Differentiable Automatic Data Augmentation (DADA) which dramatically
reduces the cost. DADA relaxes the discrete DA policy selection to a
differentiable optimization problem via Gumbel-Softmax. In addition, we
introduce an unbiased gradient estimator, RELAX, leading to an efficient and
effective one-pass optimization strategy to learn an efficient and accurate DA
policy. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and
ImageNet datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of Auto DA in
pre-training for downstream detection problems. Results show our DADA is at
least one order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art while achieving
very comparable accuracy.

Title: Mind the Gap: Enlarging the Domain Gap in Open Set Domain Adaptation
Authors: Dongliang Chang, Aneeshan Sain, Zhanyu Ma, Yi-Zhe Song, Jun Guo
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to leverage labeled data from a source
domain to learn a classifier for an unlabeled target domain. Among its many
variants, open set domain adaptation (OSDA) is perhaps the most challenging, as
it further assumes the presence of unknown classes in the target domain. In
this paper, we study OSDA with a particular focus on enriching its ability to
traverse across larger domain gaps. Firstly, we show that existing
state-of-the-art methods suffer a considerable performance drop in the presence
of larger domain gaps, especially on a new dataset (PACS) that we re-purposed
for OSDA. We then propose a novel framework to specifically address the larger
domain gaps. The key insight lies with how we exploit the mutually beneficial
information between two networks; (a) to separate samples of known and unknown
classes, (b) to maximize the domain confusion between source and target domain
without the influence of unknown samples. It follows that (a) and (b) will
mutually supervise each other and alternate until convergence. Extensive
experiments are conducted on Office-31, Office-Home, and PACS datasets,
demonstrating the superiority of our method in comparison to other
state-of-the-arts. Code has been provided as part of supplementary material and
will be publicly released upon acceptance.

  The primary aim of single-image super-resolution is to construct a
high-resolution (HR) image from a corresponding low-resolution (LR) input. In
previous approaches, which have generally been supervised, the training
objective typically measures a pixel-wise average distance between the
super-resolved (SR) and HR images. Optimizing such metrics often leads to
blurring, especially in high variance (detailed) regions. We propose an
alternative formulation of the super-resolution problem based on creating
realistic SR images that downscale correctly. We present a novel
super-resolution algorithm addressing this problem, PULSE (Photo Upsampling via
Latent Space Exploration), which generates high-resolution, realistic images at
resolutions previously unseen in the literature. It accomplishes this in an
entirely self-supervised fashion and is not confined to a specific degradation
operator used during training, unlike previous methods (which require training
on databases of LR-HR image pairs for supervised learning). Instead of starting
with the LR image and slowly adding detail, PULSE traverses the high-resolution
natural image manifold, searching for images that downscale to the original LR
image. This is formalized through the "downscaling loss," which guides
exploration through the latent space of a generative model. By leveraging
properties of high-dimensional Gaussians, we restrict the search space to
guarantee that our outputs are realistic. PULSE thereby generates
super-resolved images that both are realistic and downscale correctly. We show
extensive experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in
the domain of face super-resolution (also known as face hallucination). Our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality at higher
resolutions and scale factors than previously possible.

  Detecting malignant pulmonary nodules at an early stage can allow medical
interventions which increases the survival rate of lung cancer patients. Using
computer vision techniques to detect nodules can improve the sensitivity and
the speed of interpreting chest CT for lung cancer screening. Many studies have
used CNNs to detect nodule candidates. Though such approaches have been shown
to outperform the conventional image processing based methods regarding the
detection accuracy, CNNs are also known to be limited to generalize on
under-represented samples in the training set and prone to imperceptible noise
perturbations. Such limitations can not be easily addressed by scaling up the
dataset or the models. In this work, we propose to add adversarial synthetic
nodules and adversarial attack samples to the training data to improve the
generalization and the robustness of the lung nodule detection systems. In
order to generate hard examples of nodules from a differentiable nodule
synthesizer, we use projected gradient descent (PGD) to search the latent code
within a bounded neighbourhood that would generate nodules to decrease the
detector response. To make the network more robust to unanticipated noise
perturbations, we use PGD to search for noise patterns that can trigger the
network to give over-confident mistakes. By evaluating on two different
benchmark datasets containing consensus annotations from three radiologists, we
show that the proposed techniques can improve the detection performance on real
CT data. To understand the limitations of both the conventional networks and
the proposed augmented networks, we also perform stress-tests on the false
positive reduction networks by feeding different types of artificially produced
patches. We show that the augmented networks are more robust to both
under-represented nodules as well as resistant to noise perturbations.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) is much more challenging than
traditional classification tasks due to the inherently subtle intra-class
object variations. Recent works mainly tackle this problem by focusing on how
to locate the most discriminative parts, more complementary parts, and parts of
various granularities. However, less effort has been placed to which
granularities are the most discriminative and how to fuse information cross
multi-granularity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for fine-grained
visual classification to tackle these problems. In particular, we propose: (i)
a novel progressive training strategy that adds new layers in each training
step to exploit information based on the smaller granularity information found
at the last step and the previous stage. (ii) a simple jigsaw puzzle generator
to form images contain information of different granularity levels. We obtain
state-of-the-art performances on several standard FGVC benchmark datasets,
where the proposed method consistently outperforms existing methods or delivers
competitive results. The code will be available at

Title: Active Fine-Tuning from gMAD Examples Improves Blind Image Quality
  Assessment
Authors: Zhihua Wang and Kede Ma
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages
\\
  The research in image quality assessment (IQA) has a long history, and
significant progress has been made by leveraging recent advances in deep neural
networks (DNNs). Despite high correlation numbers on existing IQA datasets,
DNN-based models may be easily falsified in the group maximum differentiation
(gMAD) competition with strong counterexamples being identified. Here we show
that gMAD examples can be used to improve blind IQA (BIQA) methods.
Specifically, we first pre-train a DNN-based BIQA model using multiple noisy
annotators, and fine-tune it on multiple subject-rated databases of
synthetically distorted images, resulting in a top-performing baseline model.
We then seek pairs of images by comparing the baseline model with a set of
full-reference IQA methods in gMAD. The resulting gMAD examples are most likely
to reveal the relative weaknesses of the baseline, and suggest potential ways
for refinement. We query ground truth quality annotations for the selected
images in a well controlled laboratory environment, and further fine-tune the
baseline on the combination of human-rated images from gMAD and existing
databases. This process may be iterated, enabling active and progressive
fine-tuning from gMAD examples for BIQA. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
active learning scheme on a large-scale unlabeled image set, and show that the
fine-tuned method achieves improved generalizability in gMAD, without
destroying performance on previously trained databases.

  The baseball game is often seen as many contests that are performed between
individuals. The duel between the pitcher and the batter, for example, is
considered the engine that drives the sport. The pitchers use a variety of
strategies to gain competitive advantage against the batter, who does his best
to figure out the ball trajectory and react in time for a hit. In this work, we
propose a system that captures the movements of the pitcher, the batter, and
the ball in a high level of detail, and discuss several ways how this
information may be processed to compute interesting statistics. We demonstrate
on a large database of videos that our methods achieve comparable results as
previous systems, while operating solely on video material. In addition,
state-of-the-art AI techniques are incorporated to augment the amount of
information that is made available for players, coaches, teams, and fans.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we propose a general framework in continual learning for
generative models: Feature-oriented Continual Learning (FoCL). Unlike previous
works that aim to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem by introducing
regularization in the parameter space or image space, FoCL imposes
regularization in the feature space. We show in our experiments that FoCL has
faster adaptation to distributional changes in sequentially arriving tasks, and
achieves the state-of-the-art performance for generative models in task
incremental learning. We discuss choices of combined regularization spaces
towards different use case scenarios for boosted performance, e.g., tasks that
have high variability in the background. Finally, we introduce a forgetfulness
measure that fairly evaluates the degree to which a model suffers from
forgetting. Interestingly, the analysis of our proposed forgetfulness score
also implies that FoCL tends to have a mitigated forgetting for future tasks.

\\
  Despite apparent human-level performances of deep neural networks (DNN), they
behave fundamentally differently from humans. They easily change predictions
when small corruptions such as blur and noise are applied on the input (lack of
robustness), and they often produce confident predictions on
out-of-distribution samples (improper uncertainty measure). While a number of
researches have aimed to address those issues, proposed solutions are typically
expensive and complicated (e.g. Bayesian inference and adversarial training).
Meanwhile, many simple and cheap regularization methods have been developed to
enhance the generalization of classifiers. Such regularization methods have
largely been overlooked as baselines for addressing the robustness and
uncertainty issues, as they are not specifically designed for that. In this
paper, we provide extensive empirical evaluations on the robustness and
uncertainty estimates of image classifiers (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) trained
with state-of-the-art regularization methods. Furthermore, experimental results

Title: Faster ILOD: Incremental Learning for Object Detectors based on Faster
  RCNN
Authors: Can Peng, Kun Zhao and Brian C. Lovell
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: This paper is submitted to Pattern Recognition Letters
\\
  The human vision and perception system is inherently incremental where new
knowledge is continually learned over time whilst existing knowledge is
retained. On the other hand, deep learning networks are ill-equipped for
incremental learning. When a well-trained network is adapted to new categories,
its performance on the old categories will dramatically degrade. To address
this problem, incremental learning methods have been explored to preserve the
old knowledge of deep learning models. However, the state-of-the-art
incremental object detector employs an external fixed region proposal method
that increases overall computation time and reduces accuracy compared to object
detectors such as Faster RCNN that use trainable Region Proposal Networks
(RPNs). The purpose of this paper is to design an efficient end-to-end
incremental object detector using knowledge distillation for object detectors
based on RPNs. We first evaluate and analyze the performance of RPN-based
detector with classic distillation towards incremental detection tasks. Then,
we introduce multi-network adaptive distillation that properly retains
knowledge from the old categories when fine-turning the model for new task.
Experiments on the benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and COCO, demonstrate that
the proposed incremental detector is more accurate as well as being 13 times
faster than the baseline detector.

Title: FarSee-Net: Real-Time Semantic Segmentation by Efficient Multi-scale
  Context Aggregation and Feature Space Super-resolution
Authors: Zhanpeng Zhang and Kaipeng Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: Accepted to ICRA 2020
\\
  Real-time semantic segmentation is desirable in many robotic applications
with limited computation resources. One challenge of semantic segmentation is
to deal with the object scale variations and leverage the context. How to
perform multi-scale context aggregation within limited computation budget is
important. In this paper, firstly, we introduce a novel and efficient module
called Cascaded Factorized Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CF-ASPP). It is a
lightweight cascaded structure for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to
efficiently leverage context information. On the other hand, for runtime
efficiency, state-of-the-art methods will quickly decrease the spatial size of
the inputs or feature maps in the early network stages. The final
high-resolution result is usually obtained by non-parametric up-sampling
operation (e.g. bilinear interpolation). Differently, we rethink this pipeline
and treat it as a super-resolution process. We use optimized super-resolution
operation in the up-sampling step and improve the accuracy, especially in
sub-sampled input image scenario for real-time applications. By fusing the
above two improvements, our methods provide better latency-accuracy trade-off
than the other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve 68.4% mIoU
at 84 fps on the Cityscapes test set with a single Nivida Titan X (Maxwell) GPU
card. The proposed module can be plugged into any feature extraction CNN and
benefits from the CNN structure development.

Title: ROSE: Real One-Stage Effort to Detect the Fingerprint Singular Point
  Based on Multi-scale Spatial Attention
Authors: Liaojun Pang, Jiong Chen, Fei Guo, Zhicheng Cao, and Heng Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Detecting the singular point accurately and efficiently is one of the most
important tasks for fingerprint recognition. In recent years, deep learning has
been gradually used in the fingerprint singular point detection. However,
current deep learning-based singular point detection methods are either
two-stage or multi-stage, which makes them time-consuming. More importantly,
their detection accuracy is yet unsatisfactory, especially in the case of the
low-quality fingerprint. In this paper, we make a Real One-Stage Effort to
detect fingerprint singular points more accurately and efficiently, and
therefore we name the proposed algorithm ROSE for short, in which the
multi-scale spatial attention, the Gaussian heatmap and the variant of focal
loss are applied together to achieve a higher detection rate. Experimental
results on the datasets FVC2002 DB1 and NIST SD4 show that our ROSE outperforms
the state-of-art algorithms in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate and
detection speed.

Title: Deconfounded Image Captioning: A Causal Retrospect
Authors: Xu Yang, Hanwang Zhang, Jianfei Cai
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The dataset bias in vision-language tasks is becoming one of the main
problems that hinder the progress of our community. However, recent studies
lack a principled analysis of the bias. In this paper, we present a novel
perspective: Deconfounded Image Captioning (DIC), to find out the cause of the
bias in image captioning, then retrospect modern neural image captioners, and
finally propose a DIC framework: DICv1.0. DIC is based on causal inference,
whose two principles: the backdoor and front-door adjustments, help us to
review previous works and design the effective models. In particular, we
showcase that DICv1.0 can strengthen two prevailing captioning models and
achieves a single-model 130.7 CIDEr-D and 128.4 c40 CIDEr-D on Karpathy split
and online split of the challenging MS-COCO dataset, respectively. Last but not
least, DICv1.0 is merely a natural derivation from our causal retrospect, which
opens a promising direction for image captioning.

Title: MCMC Guided CNN Training and Segmentation for Pancreas Extraction
Authors: Jinchan He, Xiaxia Yu, Chudong Cai, Yi Gao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Efficient organ segmentation is the precondition of various quantitative
analysis. Segmenting the pancreas from abdominal CT images is a challenging
task because of its high anatomical variability in shape, size and location.
What's more, the pancreas only occupies a small portion in abdomen, and the
organ border is very fuzzy. All these factors make the segmentation methods of
other organs less suitable for the pancreas segmentation. In this report, we
propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling guided convolutional neural
network (CNN) approach, in order to handle such difficulties in morphological
and photometric variabilities. Specifically, the proposed method mainly
contains three steps: First, registration is carried out to mitigate the body
weight and location variability. Then, an MCMC sampling is employed to guide
the sampling of 3D patches, which are fed to the CNN for training. At the same
time, the pancreas distribution is also learned for the subsequent
segmentation. Third, sampled from the learned distribution, an MCMC process
guides the segmentation process. Lastly, the patches based segmentation is
fused using a Bayesian voting scheme. This method is evaluated on the NIH
pancreatic datasets which contains 82 abdominal contrast-enhanced CT volumes.
Finally, we achieved a competitive result of 78.13% Dice Similarity Coefficient
value and 82.65% Recall value in testing data.

Title: Pacemaker: Intermediate Teacher Knowledge Distillation For On-The-Fly
  Convolutional Neural Network
Authors: Wonchul Son, Youngbin Kim, Wonseok Song, Youngsu Moon, Wonjun Hwang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  There is a need for an on-the-fly computational process with very low
performance system such as system-on-chip (SoC) and embedded device etc. This
paper presents pacemaker knowledge distillation as intermediate ensemble
teacher to use convolutional neural network in these systems. For on-the-fly
system, we consider student model using 1xN shape on-the-fly filter and teacher
model using normal NxN shape filter. We note three points about training
student model, caused by applying on-the-fly filter. First, same depth but
unavoidable thin model compression. Second, the large capacity gap and
parameter size gap due to only the horizontal field must be selected not the
vertical receptive. Third, the performance instability and degradation of
direct distilling. To solve these problems, we propose intermediate teacher,
named pacemaker, for an on-the-fly student. So, student can be trained from
pacemaker and original teacher step by step. Experiments prove our proposed
method make significant performance (accuracy) improvements: on CIFAR100, 5.39%
increased in WRN-40-4 than conventional knowledge distillation which shows even
low performance than baseline. And we solve train instability, occurred when
conventional knowledge distillation was applied without proposed method, by
reducing deviation range by applying proposed method pacemaker knowledge
distillation.

Title: Cross-Modal Food Retrieval: Learning a Joint Embedding of Food Images
  and Recipes with Semantic Consistency and Attention Mechanism
Authors: Hao Wang, Doyen Sahoo, Chenghao Liu, Ke Shu, Palakorn Achananuparp,
  Ee-peng Lim, Steven C. H. Hoi
Categories: cs.CV cs.MM
\\
  Cross-modal food retrieval is an important task to perform analysis of
food-related information, such as food images and cooking recipes. The goal is
to learn an embedding of images and recipes in a common feature space, so that
precise matching can be realized. Compared with existing cross-modal retrieval
approaches, two major challenges in this specific problem are: 1) the large
intra-class variance across cross-modal food data; and 2) the difficulties in
obtaining discriminative recipe representations. To address these problems, we
propose Semantic-Consistent and Attention-based Networks (SCAN), which
regularize the embeddings of the two modalities by aligning output semantic
probabilities. In addition, we exploit self-attention mechanism to improve the
embedding of recipes. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the
large-scale Recipe1M dataset, and the result shows that it outperforms the
state-of-the-art.

Title: BiDet: An Efficient Binarized Object Detector
Authors: Ziwei Wang, Ziyi Wu, Jiwen Lu and Jie Zhou
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Accepted by CVPR2020
\\
  In this paper, we propose a binarized neural network learning method called
BiDet for efficient object detection. Conventional network binarization methods
directly quantize the weights and activations in one-stage or two-stage
detectors with constrained representational capacity, so that the information
redundancy in the networks causes numerous false positives and degrades the
performance significantly. On the contrary, our BiDet fully utilizes the
representational capacity of the binary neural networks for object detection by
redundancy removal, through which the detection precision is enhanced with
alleviated false positives. Specifically, we generalize the information
bottleneck (IB) principle to object detection, where the amount of information
in the high-level feature maps is constrained and the mutual information
between the feature maps and object detection is maximized. Meanwhile, we learn
sparse object priors so that the posteriors are concentrated on informative
detection prediction with false positive elimination. Extensive experiments on
the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets show that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art binary neural networks by a sizable margin.

Title: Cross-View Tracking for Multi-Human 3D Pose Estimation at over 100 FPS
Authors: Long Chen, Haizhou Ai, Rui Chen, Zijie Zhuang, Shuang Liu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages with supplementary material; accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  Estimating 3D poses of multiple humans in real-time is a classic but still
challenging task in computer vision. Its major difficulty lies in the ambiguity
in cross-view association of 2D poses and the huge state space when there are
multiple people in multiple views. In this paper, we present a novel solution
for multi-human 3D pose estimation from multiple calibrated camera views. It
takes 2D poses in different camera coordinates as inputs and aims for the
accurate 3D poses in the global coordinate. Unlike previous methods that
associate 2D poses among all pairs of views from scratch at every frame, we
exploit the temporal consistency in videos to match the 2D inputs with 3D poses
directly in 3-space. More specifically, we propose to retain the 3D pose for
each person and update them iteratively via the cross-view multi-human
tracking. This novel formulation improves both accuracy and efficiency, as we
demonstrated on widely-used public datasets. To further verify the scalability
of our method, we propose a new large-scale multi-human dataset with 12 to 28
camera views. Without bells and whistles, our solution achieves 154 FPS on 12
cameras and 34 FPS on 28 cameras, indicating its ability to handle large-scale
real-world applications. The proposed dataset will be released soon.

Title: Pseudo-Convolutional Policy Gradient for Sequence-to-Sequence
  Lip-Reading
Authors: Mingshuang Luo, Shuang Yang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, Accepted in the 15th IEEE International Conference on
  Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2020)
\\
  Lip-reading aims to infer the speech content from the lip movement sequence
and can be seen as a typical sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem which
translates the input image sequence of lip movements to the text sequence of
the speech content. However, the traditional learning process of seq2seq models
always suffers from two problems: the exposure bias resulted from the strategy
of "teacher-forcing", and the inconsistency between the discriminative
optimization target (usually the cross-entropy loss) and the final evaluation
metric (usually the character/word error rate). In this paper, we propose a
novel pseudo-convolutional policy gradient (PCPG) based method to address these
two problems. On the one hand, we introduce the evaluation metric (refers to
the character error rate in this paper) as a form of reward to optimize the
model together with the original discriminative target. On the other hand,
inspired by the local perception property of convolutional operation, we
perform a pseudo-convolutional operation on the reward and loss dimension, so
as to take more context around each time step into account to generate a robust
reward and loss for the whole optimization. Finally, we perform a thorough
comparison and evaluation on both the word-level and sentence-level benchmarks.
The results show a significant improvement over other related methods, and
report either a new state-of-the-art performance or a competitive accuracy on
all these challenging benchmarks, which clearly proves the advantages of our
approach.

Title: Context-Aware Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Jinyu Yang, Weizhi An, Chaochao Yan, Peilin Zhao, Junzhou Huang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables
\\
  In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation in
the semantic segmentation. There are two primary issues in this field, i.e.,
what and how to transfer domain knowledge across two domains. Existing methods
mainly focus on adapting domain-invariant features (what to transfer) through
adversarial learning (how to transfer). Context dependency is essential for
semantic segmentation, however, its transferability is still not well
understood. Furthermore, how to transfer contextual information across two
domains remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we propose a cross-attention
mechanism based on self-attention to capture context dependencies between two
domains and adapt transferable context. To achieve this goal, we design two
cross-domain attention modules to adapt context dependencies from both spatial
and channel views. Specifically, the spatial attention module captures local
feature dependencies between each position in the source and target image. The
channel attention module models semantic dependencies between each pair of
cross-domain channel maps. To adapt context dependencies, we further
selectively aggregate the context information from two domains. The superiority
of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods is empirically proved on
"GTA5 to Cityscapes" and "SYNTHIA to Cityscapes".

DOI: 10.1109/TGRS.2020.2976658
\\
  Land cover classification of remote sensing images is a challenging task due
to limited amounts of annotated data, highly imbalanced classes, frequent
incorrect pixel-level annotations, and an inherent complexity in the semantic
segmentation task. In this article, we propose a novel architecture called the
dense dilated convolutions' merging network (DDCM-Net) to address this task.
The proposed DDCM-Net consists of dense dilated image convolutions merged with
varying dilation rates. This effectively utilizes rich combinations of dilated
convolutions that enlarge the network's receptive fields with fewer parameters
and features compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in the remote
sensing domain. Importantly, DDCM-Net obtains fused local- and global-context
information, in effect incorporating surrounding discriminative capability for
multiscale and complex-shaped objects with similar color and textures in very
high-resolution aerial imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness,
and flexibility of the proposed DDCM-Net on the publicly available ISPRS
Potsdam and Vaihingen data sets, as well as the DeepGlobe land cover data set.
Our single model, trained on three-band Potsdam and Vaihingen data sets,
achieves better accuracy in terms of both mean intersection over union (mIoU)
and F1-score compared with other published models trained with more than
three-band data. We further validate our model on the DeepGlobe data set,
achieving state-of-the-art result 56.2% mIoU with much fewer parameters and at
a lower computational cost compared with related recent work. Code available at

\\
  Recent breakthroughs in adversarial generative modeling have led to models
capable of producing video samples of high quality, even on large and complex
datasets of real-world video. In this work, we focus on the task of video
prediction, where given a sequence of frames extracted from a video, the goal
is to generate a plausible future sequence. We first improve the state of the
art by performing a systematic empirical study of discriminator decompositions
and proposing an architecture that yields faster convergence and higher
performance than previous approaches. We then analyze recurrent units in the
generator, and propose a novel recurrent unit which transforms its past hidden
state according to predicted motion-like features, and refines it to to handle
dis-occlusions, scene changes and other complex behavior. We show that this
recurrent unit consistently outperforms previous designs. Our final model leads
to a leap in the state-of-the-art performance, obtaining a test set Frechet
Video Distance of 25.7, down from 69.2, on the large-scale Kinetics-600

Title: On the Texture Bias for Few-Shot CNN Segmentation
Authors: Reza Azad, Abdur R Fayjie, Claude Kauffman, Ismail Ben Ayed, Marco
  Pedersoli, Jose Dolz
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Despite the initial belief that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are
driven by shapes to perform visual recognition tasks, recent evidence suggests
that texture bias in CNNs provides higher performing and more robust models.
This contrasts with the perceptual bias in the human visual cortex, which has a
stronger preference towards shape components. Perceptual differences may
explain why CNNs achieve human-level performance when large labeled datasets
are available, but their performance significantly degrades in low-labeled data
scenarios, such as few-shot semantic segmentation. To remove the texture bias
in the context of few-shot learning, we propose a novel architecture that
integrates a set of difference of Gaussians (DoG) to attenuate high-frequency
local components in the feature space. This produces a set of modified feature
maps, whose high-frequency components are diminished at different standard
deviation values of the Gaussian distribution in the spatial domain. As this
results in multiple feature maps for a single image, we employ a bi-directional
convolutional long-short-term-memory to efficiently merge the multi scale-space
representations. We perform extensive experiments on two well-known few-shot
segmentation benchmarks -Pascal i5 and FSS-1000- and demonstrate that our
method outperforms significantly state-of-the-art approaches. The code is

Title: When Person Re-identification Meets Changing Clothes

Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables
\\
  Person re-identification (Reid) is now an active research topic for AI-based
video surveillance applications such as specific person search, but the
practical issue that the target person(s) may change clothes (clothes
inconsistency problem) has been overlooked for long. For the first time, this
paper systematically studies this problem. We first overcome the difficulty of
lack of suitable dataset, by collecting a small yet representative real dataset
for testing whilst building a large realistic synthetic dataset for training
and deeper studies. Facilitated by our new datasets, we are able to conduct
various interesting new experiments for studying the influence of clothes
inconsistency. We find that changing clothes makes Reid a much harder problem
in the sense of bringing difficulties to learning effective representations and
also challenges the generalization ability of previous Reid models to identify
persons with unseen (new) clothes. Representative existing Reid models are
adopted to show informative results on such a challenging setting, and we also
provide some preliminary efforts on improving the robustness of existing models
on handling the clothes inconsistency issue in the data. We believe that this
study can be inspiring and helpful for encouraging more researches in this
direction.

\\
  Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a vital role in face recognition systems. Most
state-of-the-art FAS methods 1) rely on stacked convolutions and
expert-designed network, which is weak in describing detailed fine-grained
information and easily being ineffective when the environment varies (e.g.,
different illumination), and 2) prefer to use long sequence as input to extract
dynamic features, making them difficult to deploy into scenarios which need
quick response. Here we propose a novel frame level FAS method based on Central
Difference Convolution (CDC), which is able to capture intrinsic detailed
patterns via aggregating both intensity and gradient information. A network
built with CDC, called the Central Difference Convolutional Network (CDCN), is
able to provide more robust modeling capacity than its counterpart built with
vanilla convolution. Furthermore, over a specifically designed CDC search
space, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is utilized to discover a more powerful
network structure (CDCN++), which can be assembled with Multiscale Attention
Fusion Module (MAFM) for further boosting performance. Comprehensive
experiments are performed on six benchmark datasets to show that 1) the
proposed method not only achieves superior performance on intra-dataset testing
(especially 0.2% ACER in Protocol-1 of OULU-NPU dataset), 2) it also
generalizes well on cross-dataset testing (particularly 6.5% HTER from
CASIA-MFSD to Replay-Attack datasets). The codes are available at

  Fashion retrieval is the challenging task of finding an exact match for
fashion items contained within an image. Difficulties arise from the
fine-grained nature of clothing items, very large intra-class and inter-class
variance. Additionally, query and source images for the task usually come from
different domains - street photos and catalogue photos respectively. Due to
these differences, a significant gap in quality, lighting, contrast, background
clutter and item presentation exists between domains. As a result, fashion
retrieval is an active field of research both in academia and the industry.
  Inspired by recent advancements in Person Re-Identification research, we
adapt leading ReID models to be used in fashion retrieval tasks. We introduce a
simple baseline model for fashion retrieval, significantly outperforming
previous state-of-the-art results despite a much simpler architecture. We
conduct in-depth experiments on Street2Shop and DeepFashion datasets and
validate our results. Finally, we propose a cross-domain (cross-dataset)
evaluation method to test the robustness of fashion retrieval models.

\\
  Supermarkets need to ensure clean and safe environments for both shoppers and
employees. Slips, trips, and falls can result in injuries that have a physical
as well as financial cost. Timely detection of hazardous conditions such as
spilled liquids or fallen items on supermarket floors can reduce the chances of
serious injuries. This paper presents EdgeLite, a novel, lightweight deep
learning model for easy deployment and inference on resource-constrained
devices. We describe the use of EdgeLite on two edge devices for detecting
supermarket floor hazards. On a hazard detection dataset that we developed,
EdgeLite, when deployed on edge devices, outperformed six state-of-the-art
object detection models in terms of accuracy while having comparable memory
usage and inference time.

Title: The Utility of Feature Reuse: Transfer Learning in Data-Starved Regimes
Authors: Edward Verenich, Alvaro Velasquez, M.G. Sarwar Murshed, Faraz Hussain

Comments: 3 pages, 1 figure, conference
\\
  The use of transfer learning with deep neural networks has increasingly
become widespread for deploying well-tested computer vision systems to newer
domains, especially those with limited datasets. We describe a transfer
learning use case for a domain with a data-starved regime, having fewer than
100 labeled target samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of convolutional
feature extraction and fine-tuning of overparameterized models with respect to
the size of target training data, as well as their generalization performance
on data with covariate shift, or out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our
experiments show that both overparameterization and feature reuse contribute to
successful application of transfer learning in training image classifiers in
data-starved regimes.

Title: iFAN: Image-Instance Full Alignment Networks for Adaptive Object
  Detection
Authors: Chenfan Zhuang, Xintong Han, Weilin Huang, Matthew R. Scott
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  Training an object detector on a data-rich domain and applying it to a
data-poor one with limited performance drop is highly attractive in industry,
because it saves huge annotation cost. Recent research on unsupervised domain
adaptive object detection has verified that aligning data distributions between
source and target images through adversarial learning is very useful. The key
is when, where and how to use it to achieve best practice. We propose
Image-Instance Full Alignment Networks (iFAN) to tackle this problem by
precisely aligning feature distributions on both image and instance levels: 1)
Image-level alignment: multi-scale features are roughly aligned by training
adversarial domain classifiers in a hierarchically-nested fashion. 2) Full
instance-level alignment: deep semantic information and elaborate instance
representations are fully exploited to establish a strong relationship among
categories and domains. Establishing these correlations is formulated as a
metric learning problem by carefully constructing instance pairs.
Above-mentioned adaptations can be integrated into an object detector (e.g.
Faster RCNN), resulting in an end-to-end trainable framework where multiple
alignments can work collaboratively in a coarse-tofine manner. In two domain
adaptation tasks: synthetic-to-real (SIM10K->Cityscapes) and normal-to-foggy
weather (Cityscapes->Foggy Cityscapes), iFAN outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods with a boost of 10%+ AP over the source-only baseline.

Title: Accurate Temporal Action Proposal Generation with Relation-Aware Pyramid
  Network
Authors: Jialin Gao, Zhixiang Shi, Jiani Li, Guanshuo Wang, Yufeng Yuan,
  Shiming Ge, and Xi Zhou
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: accepted by AAAI-20
\\
  Accurate temporal action proposals play an important role in detecting
actions from untrimmed videos. The existing approaches have difficulties in
capturing global contextual information and simultaneously localizing actions
with different durations. To this end, we propose a Relation-aware pyramid
Network (RapNet) to generate highly accurate temporal action proposals. In
RapNet, a novel relation-aware module is introduced to exploit bi-directional
long-range relations between local features for context distilling. This
embedded module enhances the RapNet in terms of its multi-granularity temporal
proposal generation ability, given predefined anchor boxes. We further
introduce a two-stage adjustment scheme to refine the proposal boundaries and
measure their confidence in containing an action with snippet-level actionness.
Extensive experiments on the challenging ActivityNet and THUMOS14 benchmarks
demonstrate our RapNet generates superior accurate proposals over the existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Embedding Propagation: Smoother Manifold for Few-Shot Classification
Authors: Pau Rodr\'iguez, Issam Laradji, Alexandre Drouin, Alexandre Lacoste
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Few-shot classification is challenging because the data distribution of the
training set can be widely different to the distribution of the test set as
their classes are disjoint. This distribution shift often results in poor
generalization. Manifold smoothing has been shown to address the distribution
shift problem by extending the decision boundaries and reducing the noise of
the class representations. Moreover, manifold smoothness is a key factor for
semi-supervised learning and transductive learning algorithms. In this work, we
present embedding propagation as an unsupervised non-parametric regularizer for
manifold smoothing. Embedding propagation leverages interpolations between the
extracted features of a neural network based on a similarity graph. We
empirically show that embedding propagation yields a smoother embedding
manifold. We also show that incorporating embedding propagation to a
transductive classifier leads to new state-of-the-art results in mini-Imagenet,
tiered-Imagenet, and CUB. Furthermore, we show that embedding propagation
results in additional improvement in performance for semi-supervised learning
scenarios.

Title: BirdNet+: End-to-End 3D Object Detection in LiDAR Bird's Eye View
Authors: Alejandro Barrera, Carlos Guindel, Jorge Beltr\'an and Fernando
  Garc\'ia
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Intelligent
  Transportation Systems (ITSC2020)
\\
  On-board 3D object detection in autonomous vehicles often relies on geometry
information captured by LiDAR devices. Albeit image features are typically
preferred for detection, numerous approaches take only spatial data as input.
Exploiting this information in inference usually involves the use of compact
representations such as the Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection, which entails a
loss of information and thus hinders the joint inference of all the parameters
of the objects' 3D boxes. In this paper, we present a fully end-to-end 3D
object detection framework that can infer oriented 3D boxes solely from BEV
images by using a two-stage object detector and ad-hoc regression branches,
eliminating the need for a post-processing stage. The method outperforms its
predecessor (BirdNet) by a large margin and obtains state-of-the-art results on
the KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark for all the categories in evaluation.

Title: Domain Adversarial Training for Infrared-colour Person Re-Identification
Authors: Nima Mohammadi Meshky, Sara Iodice, Krystian Mikolajczyk
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Journal-ref: ICDP 2019
\\
  Person re-identification (re-ID) is a very active area of research in
computer vision, due to the role it plays in video surveillance. Currently,
most methods only address the task of matching between colour images. However,
in poorly-lit environments CCTV cameras switch to infrared imaging, hence
developing a system which can correctly perform matching between infrared and
colour images is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a part-feature
extraction network to better focus on subtle, unique signatures on the person
which are visible across both infrared and colour modalities. To train the
model we propose a novel variant of the domain adversarial feature-learning
framework. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Semantic Object Prediction and Spatial Sound Super-Resolution with
  Binaural Sounds

\\
  Humans can robustly recognize and localize objects by integrating visual and
auditory cues. While machines are able to do the same now with images, less
work has been done with sounds. This work develops an approach for dense
semantic labelling of sound-making objects, purely based on binaural sounds. We
propose a novel sensor setup and record a new audio-visual dataset of street
scenes with eight professional binaural microphones and a 360 degree camera.
The co-existence of visual and audio cues is leveraged for supervision
transfer. In particular, we employ a cross-modal distillation framework that
consists of a vision `teacher' method and a sound `student' method -- the
student method is trained to generate the same results as the teacher method.
This way, the auditory system can be trained without using human annotations.
We also propose two auxiliary tasks namely, a) a novel task on Spatial Sound
Super-resolution to increase the spatial resolution of sounds, and b) dense
depth prediction of the scene. We then formulate the three tasks into one
end-to-end trainable multi-tasking network aiming to boost the overall
performance. Experimental results on the dataset show that 1) our method
achieves promising results for semantic prediction and the two auxiliary tasks;
and 2) the three tasks are mutually beneficial -- training them together
achieves the best performance and 3) the number and orientations of microphones
are both important. The data and code will be released to facilitate the
research in this new direction.

\\
  We consider the problem of estimating a parametric model of 3D human mesh
from a single image. While there has been substantial recent progress in this
area with direct regression of model parameters, these methods only implicitly
exploit the human body kinematic structure, leading to sub-optimal use of the
model prior. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a new technique for
regression of human parametric model that is explicitly informed by the known
hierarchical structure, including joint interdependencies of the model. This
results in a strong prior-informed design of the regressor architecture and an
associated hierarchical optimization that is flexible to be used in conjunction
with the current standard frameworks for 3D human mesh recovery. We demonstrate
these aspects by means of extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets,
showing how our proposed new design outperforms several existing and popular
methods, establishing new state-of-the-art results. With our explicit
consideration of joint interdependencies, our proposed method is equipped to
infer joints even under data corruptions, which we demonstrate with experiments
under varying degrees of occlusion.

Title: Motion-Attentive Transition for Zero-Shot Video Object Segmentation
Authors: Tianfei Zhou, Shunzhou Wang, Yi Zhou, Yazhou Yao, Jianwu Li, Ling Shao
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: AAAI 2020. Code: https://github.com/tfzhou/MATNet
\\
  In this paper, we present a novel Motion-Attentive Transition Network
(MATNet) for zero-shot video object segmentation, which provides a new way of
leveraging motion information to reinforce spatio-temporal object
representation. An asymmetric attention block, called Motion-Attentive
Transition (MAT), is designed within a two-stream encoder, which transforms
appearance features into motion-attentive representations at each convolutional
stage. In this way, the encoder becomes deeply interleaved, allowing for
closely hierarchical interactions between object motion and appearance. This is
superior to the typical two-stream architecture, which treats motion and
appearance separately in each stream and often suffers from overfitting to
appearance information. Additionally, a bridge network is proposed to obtain a
compact, discriminative and scale-sensitive representation for multi-level
encoder features, which is further fed into a decoder to achieve segmentation
results. Extensive experiments on three challenging public benchmarks (i.e.
DAVIS-16, FBMS and Youtube-Objects) show that our model achieves compelling
performance against the state-of-the-arts.

Title: SOIC: Semantic Online Initialization and Calibration for LiDAR and
  Camera
Authors: Weimin Wang, Shohei Nobuhara, Ryosuke Nakamura, Ken Sakurada
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  This paper presents a novel semantic-based online extrinsic calibration
approach, SOIC (so, I see), for Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and camera
sensors. Previous online calibration methods usually need prior knowledge of
rough initial values for optimization. The proposed approach removes this
limitation by converting the initialization problem to a Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) problem with the introduction of semantic centroids (SCs). The
closed-form solution of this PnP problem has been well researched and can be
found with existing PnP methods. Since the semantic centroid of the point cloud
usually does not accurately match with that of the corresponding image, the
accuracy of parameters are not improved even after a nonlinear refinement
process. Thus, a cost function based on the constraint of the correspondence
between semantic elements from both point cloud and image data is formulated.
Subsequently, optimal extrinsic parameters are estimated by minimizing the cost
function. We evaluate the proposed method either with GT or predicted semantics
on KITTI dataset. Experimental results and comparisons with the baseline method
verify the feasibility of the initialization strategy and the accuracy of the
calibration approach. In addition, we release the source code at
https://github.com/--/SOIC.

Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020. Winner of the ICCV-2019 PIC Challenge on both
  HOIW and PIC tracks. Code: https://github.com/tfzhou/C-HOI
\\
  Rapid progress has been witnessed for human-object interaction (HOI)
recognition, but most existing models are confined to single-stage reasoning
pipelines. Considering the intrinsic complexity of the task, we introduce a
cascade architecture for a multi-stage, coarse-to-fine HOI understanding. At
each stage, an instance localization network progressively refines HOI
proposals and feeds them into an interaction recognition network. Each of the
two networks is also connected to its predecessor at the previous stage,
enabling cross-stage information propagation. The interaction recognition
network has two crucial parts: a relation ranking module for high-quality HOI
proposal selection and a triple-stream classifier for relation prediction. With
our carefully-designed human-centric relation features, these two modules work
collaboratively towards effective interaction understanding. Further beyond
relation detection on a bounding-box level, we make our framework flexible to
perform fine-grained pixel-wise relation segmentation; this provides a new
glimpse into better relation modeling. Our approach reached the $1^{st}$ place
in the ICCV2019 Person in Context Challenge, on both relation detection and
segmentation tasks. It also shows promising results on V-COCO.

Title: Restore from Restored: Video Restoration with Pseudo Clean Video
Authors: Seunghwan Lee, Seobin Park, Donghyeon Cho, Jiwon Kim, Tae Hyun Kim
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we propose a self-supervised video denoising method called
"restore-from-restored" that fine-tunes a baseline network by using a pseudo
clean video at the test phase. The pseudo clean video can be obtained by
applying an input noisy video to the pre-trained baseline network. By adopting
a fully convolutional network (FCN) as the baseline, we can restore videos
without accurate optical flow and registration due to its translation-invariant
property unlike many conventional video restoration methods. Moreover, the
proposed method can take advantage of the existence of many similar patches
across consecutive frames (i.e., patch-recurrence), which can boost performance
of the baseline network by a large margin. We analyze the restoration
performance of the FCN fine-tuned with the proposed self-supervision-based
training algorithm, and demonstrate that FCN can utilize recurring patches
without the need for registration among adjacent frames. The proposed method
can be applied to any FCN-based denoising models. In our experiments, we apply
the proposed method to the state-of-the-art denoisers, and our results indicate
a considerable improvementin task performance.

Title: Knowledge distillation via adaptive instance normalization
Authors: Jing Yang, Brais Martinez, Adrian Bulat, Georgios Tzimiropoulos
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper addresses the problem of model compression via knowledge
distillation. To this end, we propose a new knowledge distillation method based
on transferring feature statistics, specifically the channel-wise mean and
variance, from the teacher to the student. Our method goes beyond the standard
way of enforcing the mean and variance of the student to be similar to those of
the teacher through an $L_2$ loss, which we found it to be of limited
effectiveness. Specifically, we propose a new loss based on adaptive instance
normalization to effectively transfer the feature statistics. The main idea is
to transfer the learned statistics back to the teacher via adaptive instance
normalization (conditioned on the student) and let the teacher network
"evaluate" via a loss whether the statistics learned by the student are
reliably transferred. We show that our distillation method outperforms other
state-of-the-art distillation methods over a large set of experimental settings
including different (a) network architectures, (b) teacher-student capacities,
(c) datasets, and (d) domains.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Self-supervised learning has advanced rapidly, with several results beating
supervised models for pre-training feature representations. While the focus of
most of these works has been new loss functions or tasks, little attention has
been given to the data transformations that build the foundation of learning
representations with desirable invariances. In this work, we introduce a
framework for multi-modal data transformations that preserve semantics and
induce the learning of high-level representations across modalities. We do this
by combining two steps: inter-modality slicing, and intra-modality
augmentation. Using a contrastive loss as the training task, we show that
choosing the right transformations is key and that our method yields
state-of-the-art results on downstream video and audio classification tasks
such as HMDB51, UCF101 and DCASE2014 with Kinetics-400 pretraining.

Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.HC
\\
  The U.S. Child Welfare System (CWS) is charged with improving outcomes for
foster youth; yet, they are overburdened and underfunded. To overcome this
limitation, several states have turned towards algorithmic decision-making
systems to reduce costs and determine better processes for improving CWS
outcomes. Using a human-centered algorithmic design approach, we synthesize 50
peer-reviewed publications on computational systems used in CWS to assess how
they were being developed, common characteristics of predictors used, as well
as the target outcomes. We found that most of the literature has focused on
risk assessment models but does not consider theoretical approaches (e.g.,
child-foster parent matching) nor the perspectives of caseworkers (e.g., case
notes). Therefore, future algorithms should strive to be context-aware and
theoretically robust by incorporating salient factors identified by past
research. We provide the HCI community with research avenues for developing
human-centered algorithms that redirect attention towards more equitable
outcomes for CWS.

Title: The Residence History Inference Problem
Authors: Derek Ruths, Caitrin Armstrong
Categories: cs.CY
\\
  The use of online user traces for studies of human mobility has received
significant attention in recent years. This growing body of work, and the more
general importance of human migration patterns to government and industry,
motivates the need for a formalized approach to the computational modeling of
human mobility - in particular how and when individuals change their place of
residence - from online traces. Prior work on this topic has skirted the
underlying computational modeling of residence inference, focusing on migration
patterns themselves. As a result, to our knowledge, all prior work has employed
heuristics to compute something like residence histories. Here, we formalize
the residence assignment problem, which seeks, under constraints associated
with the minimum length-of-stay at a residence, the most parsimonious sequence
of residence periods and places that explains the movement history of an
individual. Here we provide an exact solution for this problem and establish
its algorithmic complexity. Because the calculation of optimal residence
histories (under the assumptions of the model) is tractable, we believe that
this method will be a valuable tool for future work on this topic.

Categories: cs.CY cs.LG math.OC
\\
  Modelling human function learning has been the subject of in-tense research
in cognitive sciences. The topic is relevant in black-box optimization where
information about the objective and/or constraints is not available and must be
learned through function evaluations. In this paper we focus on the relation
between the behaviour of humans searching for the maximum and the probabilistic
model used in Bayesian Optimization. As surrogate models of the unknown
function both Gaussian Processes and Random Forest have been considered: the
Bayesian learning paradigm is central in the development of active learning
approaches balancing exploration/exploitation in uncertain conditions towards
effective generalization in large decision spaces. In this paper we analyse
experimentally how Bayesian Optimization compares to humans searching for the
maximum of an unknown 2D function. A set of controlled experiments with 60
subjects, using both surrogate models, confirm that Bayesian Optimization
provides a general model to represent individual patterns of active learning in
humans

Categories: cs.DB
\\
  We envisage future context-aware applications will dynamically adapt their
behaviors to various context data from sources in wide-area networks, such as
the Internet. Facing the changing context and the sheer number of context
sources, a data management system that supports effective source organization
and efficient data lookup becomes crucial to the easy development of
context-aware applications. In this paper, we propose the design of a new
context data management system that is equipped with query processing
capabilities. We encapsulate the context sources into physical spaces belonging
to different context spaces and organize them as peers in semantic overlay
networks. Initial evaluation results of an experimental system prototype
demonstrate the effectiveness of our design

Title: NoSQL Databases: Yearning for Disambiguation

\\
  The demanding requirements of the new Big Data intensive era raised the need
for flexible storage systems capable of handling huge volumes of unstructured
data and of tackling the challenges that traditional databases were facing.
NoSQL Databases, in their heterogeneity, are a powerful and diverse set of
databases tailored to specific industrial and business needs. However, the lack
of theoretical background creates a lack of consensus even among experts about
many NoSQL concepts, leading to ambiguity and confusion. In this paper, we
present a survey of NoSQL databases and their classification by data model
type. We also conduct a benchmark in order to compare different NoSQL databases
and distinguish their characteristics. Additionally, we present the major areas
of ambiguity and confusion around NoSQL databases and their related concepts,
and attempt to disambiguate them.

Title: Distributed macroscopic traffic simulation with Open Traffic Models
Authors: Gabriel Gomes, Juliette Ugirumurera, Xiaoye Li

Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted to IEEE ITSC 2020
\\
  This paper presents OTM-MPI, an extension of the Open Traffic Models platform
(OTM) for running macroscopic traffic simulations in high-performance computing
environments. Macroscopic simulations are appropriate for studying regional
traffic scenarios when aggregate trends are of interest, rather than individual
vehicle traces. They are also appropriate for studying the routing behavior of
classes of vehicles, such as app-informed vehicles. The network partitioning
was performed with METIS. Inter-process communication was done with MPI
(message-passing interface). Results are provided for two networks: one
realistic network which was obtained from Open Street Maps for Chattanooga, TN,
and another larger synthetic grid network. The software recorded a speed-up
ratio of 198 using 256 cores for Chattanooga, and 475 with 1,024 cores for the
synthetic network.

\\
  Function as a Service (FaaS) has been gaining popularity as a way to deploy
computations to serverless backends in the cloud. This paradigm shifts the
complexity of allocating and provisioning resources to the cloud provider,
which has to provide the illusion of always-available resources (i.e., fast
function invocations without cold starts) at the lowest possible resource cost.
Doing so requires the provider to deeply understand the characteristics of the
FaaS workload. Unfortunately, there has been little to no public information on
these characteristics. Thus, in this paper, we first characterize the entire
production FaaS workload from Microsoft Azure Functions. We show for example
that most functions are invoked very infrequently, but there is an
8-order-of-magnitude range of invocation frequencies. Using observations from
our characterization, we then propose a practical resource management policy
that significantly reduces the number of function coldstarts,while spending
fewerresources than state-of-the-practice policies.

Title: Step on the Gas? A Better Approach for Recommending the Ethereum Gas
  Price
Authors: Sam M. Werner and Paul J. Pritz and Daniel Perez
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  In the Ethereum network, miners are incentivized to include transactions in a
block depending on the gas price specified by the sender. The sender of a
transaction therefore faces a trade-off between timely inclusion and cost of
his transaction. Existing recommendation mechanisms aggregate recent gas price
data on a per-block basis to suggest a gas price. We perform an empirical
analysis of historic block data to motivate the use of a predictive model for
gas price recommendation. Subsequently, we propose a novel mechanism that
combines a deep-learning based price forecasting model as well as an algorithm
parameterized by a user-specific urgency value to recommend gas prices. In a
comprehensive evaluation on real-world data, we show that our approach results
on average in costs savings of more than 50% while only incurring an inclusion
delay of 1.3 blocks, when compared to the gas price recommendation mechanism of
the most widely used Ethereum client.

\\
  Autonomous vehicles need safe development and testing environments. Many
traffic scenarios are such that they cannot be tested in the real world. We see
hybrid photorealistic simulation as a viable tool for developing AI (artificial
intelligence) software for autonomous driving. We present a machine learning
environment for detecting autonomous vehicle corner case behavior. Our
environment is based on connecting the CARLA simulation software to TensorFlow
machine learning framework and custom AI client software. The AI client
software receives data from a simulated world via virtual sensors and
transforms the data into information using machine learning models. The AI
clients control vehicles in the simulated world. Our environment monitors the
state assumed by the vehicle AIs to the ground truth state derived from the
simulation model. Our system can search for corner cases where the vehicle AI
is unable to correctly understand the situation. In our paper, we present the
overall hybrid simulator architecture and compare different configurations. We
present performance measurements from real setups, and outline the main
parameters affecting the hybrid simulator performance.

Title: Aion: Better Late than Never in Event-Time Streams
Authors: S\'ergio Esteves, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales, Rodrigo Rodrigues,

Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 14 pages, 28 figures
\\
  Processing data streams in near real-time is an increasingly important task.
In the case of event-timestamped data, the stream processing system must
promptly handle late events that arrive after the corresponding window has been
processed. To enable this late processing, the window state must be maintained
for a long period of time. However, current systems maintain this state in
memory, which either imposes a maximum period of tolerated lateness, or causes
the system to degrade performance or even crash when the system memory runs
out.
  In this paper, we propose AION, a comprehensive solution for handling late
events in an efficient manner, implemented on top of Flink. In designing AION,
we go beyond a naive solution that transfers state between memory and
persistent storage on demand. In particular, we introduce a proactive caching
scheme, where we leverage the semantics of stream processing to anticipate the
need for bringing data to memory. Furthermore, we propose a predictive cleanup
scheme to permanently discard window state based on the likelihood of receiving
more late events, to prevent storage consumption from growing without bounds.
  Our evaluation shows that AION is capable of maintaining sustainable levels
of memory utilization while still preserving high throughput, low latency, and
low staleness.

\\
  In this paper, we propose a new localization framework in which mobile users
or smart agents can cooperate to build accurate location services without
sacrificing privacy, in particular, information related to their trajectories.
The proposed framework is called Federated Localization (FedLoc), simply
because it adopts the recently proposed federated learning. Apart from the new
FedLoc framework, this paper can be deemed as an overview paper, in which we
review the state-of-the-art federated learning framework, two widely used
learning models, various distributed model hyper-parameter optimization
schemes, and some practical use cases that fall under the FedLoc framework. The
use cases, summarized from a mixture of standard, recently published, and
unpublished works, cover a broad range of location services, including
collaborative static localization/fingerprinting, indoor target tracking,
outdoor navigation using low-sampling GPS, and spatio-temporal wireless traffic
data modeling and prediction. The obtained primary results confirm that the
proposed FedLoc framework well suits data-driven, machine learning-based
localization and spatio-temporal data modeling. Future research directions are
discussed at the end of this paper.

  The amount of data in real-time, such as time series and streaming data,
available today continues to grow. Being able to analyze this data the moment
it arrives can bring an immense added value. However, it also requires a lot of
computational effort and new acceleration techniques. As a possible solution to
this problem, this paper proposes a hardware architecture for Typicality and
Eccentricity Data Analytic (TEDA) algorithm implemented on Field Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGA) for use in data streaming anomaly detection. TEDA is based
on a new approach to outlier detection in the data stream context. In order to
validate the proposals, results of the occupation and throughput of the
proposed hardware are presented. Besides, the bit accurate simulation results
are also presented. The project aims to Xilinx Virtex-6 xc6vlx240t-1ff1156 as
the target FPGA.

Title: Lightweight Inter-transaction Caching with Precise Clocks and Dynamic
  Self-invalidation

  Gehrke, Alvin R. Lebeck
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Distributed, transactional storage systems scale by sharding data across
servers. However, workload-induced hotspots result in contention, leading to
higher abort rates and performance degradation.
  We present KAIROS, a transactional key-value storage system that leverages
client-side inter-transaction caching and sharded transaction validation to
balance the dynamic load and alleviate workload-induced hotspots in the system.
KAIROS utilizes precise synchronized clocks to implement self-invalidating
leases for cache consistency and avoids the overhead and potential hotspots due
to maintaining sharing lists or sending invalidations.
  Experiments show that inter-transaction caching alone provides 2.35x the
throughput of a baseline system with only intra-transaction caching; adding
sharded validation further improves the throughput by a factor of 3.1 over
baseline. We also show that lease-based caching can operate at a 30% higher
scale while providing 1.46x the throughput of the state-of-the-art explicit
invalidation-based caching.

Title: I-ViSE: Interactive Video Surveillance as an Edge Service using
  Unsupervised Feature Queries
Authors: Seyed Yahya Nikouei, Yu Chen, Alexander Aved, Erik Blasch
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: R1 is under review by the IEEE Internet of Things Journal
\\
  Situation AWareness (SAW) is essential for many mission critical
applications. However, SAW is very challenging when trying to immediately
identify objects of interest or zoom in on suspicious activities from thousands
of video frames. This work aims at developing a queryable system to instantly
select interesting content. While face recognition technology is mature, in
many scenarios like public safety monitoring, the features of objects of
interest may be much more complicated than face features. In addition, human
operators may not be always able to provide a descriptive, simple, and accurate
query. Actually, it is more often that there are only rough, general
descriptions of certain suspicious objects or accidents. This paper proposes an
Interactive Video Surveillance as an Edge service (I-ViSE) based on
unsupervised feature queries. Adopting unsupervised methods that do not reveal
any private information, the I-ViSE scheme utilizes general features of a human
body and color of clothes. An I-ViSE prototype is built following the edge-fog
computing paradigm and the experimental results verified the I-ViSE scheme
meets the design goal of scene recognition in less than two seconds.

\\
  Computational memory (CM) is a promising approach for accelerating inference
on neural networks (NN) by using enhanced memories that, in addition to storing
data, allow computations on them. One of the main challenges of this approach
is defining a hardware/software interface that allows a compiler to map NN
models for efficient execution on the underlying CM accelerator. This is a
non-trivial task because efficiency dictates that the CM accelerator is
explicitly programmed as a dataflow engine where the execution of the different
NN layers form a pipeline. In this paper, we present our work towards a
software stack for executing ML models on such a multi-core CM accelerator. We
describe an architecture for the hardware and software, and focus on the
problem of implementing the appropriate control logic so that data dependencies
are respected. We propose a solution to the latter that is based on polyhedral
compilation.

  This article presents an automatic approach to quickly derive a good solution
for hardware resource partition and task granularity for task-based parallel
applications on heterogeneous many-core architectures. Our approach employs a
performance model to estimate the resulting performance of the target
application under a given resource partition and task granularity
configuration. The model is used as a utility to quickly search for a good
configuration at runtime. Instead of hand-crafting an analytical model that
requires expert insights into low-level hardware details, we employ machine
learning techniques to automatically learn it. We achieve this by first
learning a predictive model offline using training programs. The learnt model
can then be used to predict the performance of any unseen program at runtime.
We apply our approach to 39 representative parallel applications and evaluate
it on two representative heterogeneous many-core platforms: a CPU-XeonPhi
platform and a CPU-GPU platform. Compared to the single-stream version, our
approach achieves, on average, a 1.6x and 1.1x speedup on the XeonPhi and the
GPU platform, respectively. These results translate to over 93% of the
performance delivered by a theoretically perfect predictor.

  We prove that if $G$ is a sparse graph --- it belongs to a fixed class of
bounded expansion $\mathcal{C}$ --- and $d\in \mathbb{N}$ is fixed, then the
$d$th power of $G$ can be partitioned into cliques so that contracting each of
these clique to a single vertex again yields a sparse graph. This result has
several graph-theoretic and algorithmic consequences for powers of sparse
graphs, including bounds on their subchromatic number and efficient
approximation algorithms for the chromatic number and the clique number.

\\
  We consider minimally unsatisfiable 2-CNFs, i.e., minimally unsatisfiable
conjunctive normal forms, where each clause contains at most 2 literals (short
2-MUs). Characterisations of 2-MUs in the literature have been restricted to
the nonsingular case (where every variable occurs positively and negatively at
least twice), and those with a unit-clause. We provide the full classification
of 2-MUs, and obtain polytime isomorphism decision.
  The main tool used here is the implication digraph, which allows to reduce
the problem of determining the isomorphism types of 2-MUs to the isomorphism
types of "weak double cycles" (WDCs), obtained from the digraph versions of
undirected cycles by splitting vertices and arcs. We show that these digraphs
have at most one skew-symmetry, and thus the skew-symmetric WDCs can be
considered as 2-CNFs.

Title: The Game of Cops and Eternal Robbers
Authors: Anthony Bonato, Melissa Hugan, Trent Marbach, Fionn Mc Inerney
Categories: cs.DM math.CO
\\
  We introduce the game of Cops and Eternal Robbers played on graphs, where
there are infinitely many robbers that appear sequentially over distinct plays
of the game. A positive integer $t$ is fixed, and the cops are required to
capture the robber in at most $t$ time-steps in each play. The associated
optimization parameter is the eternal cop number, denoted by $c_t^{\infty},$
which equals the eternal domination number in the case $t=1,$ and the cop
number for sufficiently large $t.$ We study the complexity of Cops and Eternal
Robbers, and show that game is NP-hard when $t$ is a fixed constant and
EXPTIME-complete for large values of $t$. We determine precise values of
$c_t^{\infty}$ for paths and cycles. The eternal cop number is studied for
retracts, and this approach is applied to give bounds for trees, as well as for
strong and Cartesian grids.

Title: Multiset Synchronization with Counting Cuckoo Filters
Authors: Shangsen Li, Lailong Luo, Deke Guo
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Set synchronization is a fundamental task in distributed applications and
implementations. Existing methods that synchronize simple sets are mainly based
on compact data structures such as Bloom filter and its variants. However,
these methods are infeasible to synchronize a pair of multisets which allow an
element to appear for multiple times. To this end, in this paper, we propose to
leverage the counting cuckoo filter (CCF), a novel variant of cuckoo filter, to
represent and thereafter synchronize a pair of multisets. The cuckoo filter
(CF) is a minimized hash table that uses cuckoo hashing to resolve collisions.
CF has an array of buckets, each of which has multiple slots to store element
fingerprints. Based on CF, CCF extends each slot as two fields, the fingerprint
field and the counter field. The fingerprint field records the fingerprint of
element which is stored by this slot; while the counter field counts the
multiplicity of the stored element. With such a design, CCF is competent to
represent any multiset. After generating and exchanging the respective CCFs
which represent the local multi-sets, we propose the query-based and the
decoding-based methods to identify the different elements between the given
multisets. The comprehensive evaluation results indicate that CCF outperforms
the counting Bloom filter (CBF) when they are used to synchronize multisets, in
terms of both synchronization accuracy and the space-efficiency, at the cost of
a little higher time-consumption.

  Tries are general purpose data structures for information retrieval. The most
significant parameter of a trie is its height $H$ which equals the length of
the longest common prefix of any two string in the set $A$ over which the trie
is built. Analytical investigations of random tries suggest that ${\bf E}(H)\in
O(\log(\|A\|))$, although $H$ is unbounded in the worst case. Moreover, sharp
results on the distribution function of $H$ are known for many different random
string sources. But because of the inherent weakness of the modeling behind
average-case analysis---analyses being dominated by random data---these results
can utterly explain the fact that in many practical situations the trie height
is logarithmic. We propose a new semi-random string model and perform a
smoothed analysis in order to give a mathematically more rigorous explanation
for the practical findings. The perturbation functions which we consider are
based on probabilistic finite automata (PFA) and we show that the transition
probabilities of the representing PFA completely characterize the asymptotic
growth of the smoothed trie height. Our main result is of dichotomous
nature---logarithmic or unbounded---and is certainly not surprising at first
glance, but we also give quantitative upper and lower bounds, which are derived
using multivariate generating function in order to express the computations of
the perturbing PFA. A direct consequence is the logarithmic trie height for
edit perturbations(i.e., random insertions, deletions and substitutions).

the first result concerning structural parameterizations of this problem. We
show that the problem is FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover number on
general graphs, and on chordal graphs when parameterized by the number of
colors. Additionally, we observe that our algorithm for graphs of bounded
clique-width can be adapted to solve the Fall Coloring problem within the same
runtime bound.

alternative, but equivalent, interpretation of this result is that, for every
$n$, there exists a graph $U_n$ with $n^{1+o(1)}$ vertices such that every
$n$-vertex planar graph is an induced subgraph of $U_n$. These results
generalize to bounded genus graphs, apex-minor-free graphs, bounded-degree
graphs from minor closed families, and $k$-planar graphs.

Title: Dependently Typed Knowledge Graphs
Authors: Zhangsheng Lai, Aik Beng Ng, Liang Ze Wong, Simon See, and Shaowei Lin
Categories: cs.FL cs.AI cs.DB
\\
  Reasoning over knowledge graphs is traditionally built upon a hierarchy of
languages in the Semantic Web Stack. Starting from the Resource Description
Framework (RDF) for knowledge graphs, more advanced constructs have been
introduced through various syntax extensions to add reasoning capabilities to
knowledge graphs. In this paper, we show how standardized semantic web
technologies (RDF and its query language SPARQL) can be reproduced in a unified
manner with dependent type theory. In addition to providing the basic
functionalities of knowledge graphs, dependent types add expressiveness in
encoding both entities and queries, explainability in answers to queries
through witnesses, and compositionality and automation in the construction of
witnesses. Using the Coq proof assistant, we demonstrate how to build and query
dependently typed knowledge graphs as a proof of concept for future works in
this direction.

Title: STD-Net: Structure-preserving and Topology-adaptive Deformation Network
  for 3D Reconstruction from a Single Image
Authors: Aihua Mao, Canglan Dai, Lin Gao, Ying He, Yong-jin Liu
Categories: cs.GR cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages,5 figures
\\
  3D reconstruction from a single view image is a long-standing prob-lem in
computer vision. Various methods based on different shape representations(such
as point cloud or volumetric representations) have been proposed. However,the
3D shape reconstruction with fine details and complex structures are still
chal-lenging and have not yet be solved. Thanks to the recent advance of the
deepshape representations, it becomes promising to learn the structure and
detail rep-resentation using deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a
novel methodcalled STD-Net to reconstruct the 3D models utilizing the mesh
representationthat is well suitable for characterizing complex structure and
geometry details.To reconstruct complex 3D mesh models with fine details, our
method consists of(1) an auto-encoder network for recovering the structure of
an object with bound-ing box representation from a single image, (2) a
topology-adaptive graph CNNfor updating vertex position for meshes of complex
topology, and (3) an unifiedmesh deformation block that deforms the structural
boxes into structure-awaremeshed models. Experimental results on the images
from ShapeNet show that ourproposed STD-Net has better performance than other
state-of-the-art methods onreconstructing 3D objects with complex structures
and fine geometric details.

Title: Style-compatible Object Recommendation for Multi-room Indoor Scene
  Synthesis

\\
  \begin{abstract} Traditional indoor scene synthesis methods often take a
two-step approach: object selection and object arrangement. Current
state-of-the-art object selection approaches are based on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and can produce realistic scenes for a single room. However,
they cannot be directly extended to synthesize style-compatible scenes for
multiple rooms with different functions. To address this issue, we treat the
object selection problem as combinatorial optimization based on a Labeled LDA
(L-LDA) model. We first calculate occurrence probability distribution of object
categories according to a topic model, and then sample objects from each
category considering their function diversity along with style compatibility,
while regarding not only separate rooms, but also associations among rooms.
User study shows that our method outperforms the baselines by incorporating
multi-function and multi-room settings with style constraints, and sometimes
even produces plausible scenes comparable to those produced by professional
designers.

Title: SkillCheck: An Incentive-based Certification System using Blockchains
Authors: Jay Gupta and Swaprava Nath
Categories: cs.GT cs.CR econ.GN q-fin.EC
Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Skill verification is a central problem in workforce hiring. Companies and
academia often face the difficulty of ascertaining the skills of an applicant
since the certifications of the skills claimed by a candidate are generally not
immediately verifiable and costly to test. Blockchains have been proposed in
the literature for skill verification and tamper-proof information storage in a
decentralized manner. However, most of these approaches deal with storing the
certificates issued by traditional universities on the blockchain. Among the
few techniques that consider the certification procedure itself, questions like
(a) scalability with limited staff, (b) uniformity of grades over multiple
evaluators, or (c) honest effort extraction from the evaluators are usually not
addressed. We propose a blockchain-based platform named SkillCheck, which
considers the questions above, and ensure several desirable properties. The
platform incentivizes effort in grading via payments with tokens which it
generates from the payments of the users of the platform, e.g., the recruiters
and test-takers. We provide a detailed description of the design of the
platform along with the provable properties of the algorithm.

\\
  We examine the problem of assigning plots of land to prospective buyers who
prefer living next to their friends. They care not only about the plot they
receive, but also about their neighbors. This externality results in a highly
non-trivial problem structure, as both friendship and land value play a role in
determining agent behavior. We examine mechanisms that guarantee truthful
reporting of both land values and friendships. We propose variants of random
serial dictatorship (RSD) that can offer both truthfulness and welfare
guarantees. Interestingly, our social welfare guarantees are parameterized by
the value of friendship: if these values are low, enforcing truthful behavior
results in poor welfare guarantees and imposes significant constraints on
agents' choices; if they are high, we achieve good approximation to the optimal
social welfare.

Title: Mechanism design for large scale systems
Authors: Meng Zhang and Deepanshu Vasal
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  In this paper, we consider infinite number of non atomic self-interested
agents with private valuation of a divisible good. We design a pricing
mechanism that is easy to implement, is individually rational, weakly budget
balanced and incentive compatible. In this mechanism, agents send reports of
their types, based on which, the designer solves a constrained optimization
problem through Lagrange's mechanism. The resulting optimal allocation and
Lagrange's multiplier is sent as the allocation and prices to the respective
agent. We show that reporting one's type truthfully is a dominant strategy of
the players in this mechanism. We then extend this idea to the dynamic case,
when player's types are dynamically evolving as a controlled Markov process. In
this case, in each time period, reporting one's type is a dominant strategy of
the players.

\\
  Online social interactions in multiplayer games can be supportive and
positive or toxic and harmful; however, few methods can easily assess
interpersonal interaction quality in games. We use behavioural traces to
predict affiliation between dyadic strangers, facilitated through their social
interactions in an online gaming setting. We collected audio, video, in-game,
and self-report data from 23 dyads, extracted 75 features, trained Random
Forest and Support Vector Machine models, and evaluated their performance
predicting binary (high/low) as well as continuous affiliation toward a
partner. The models can predict both binary and continuous affiliation with up
to 79.1% accuracy (F1) and 20.1% explained variance (R2) on unseen data, with
features based on verbal communication demonstrating the highest potential. Our
findings can inform the design of multiplayer games and game communities, and
guide the development of systems for matchmaking and mitigating toxic behaviour
in online games.

  Hands-on training is an effective way to practice theoretical cybersecurity

application of visual analytics principles to the design, execution, and
evaluation of training sessions. We propose a conceptual model employing visual
analytics that supports the sensemaking activities of users involved in various
phases of the training life cycle. The model emerged from our long-term
experience in designing and organizing diverse hands-on cybersecurity training
sessions. It provides a classification of visualizations and can be used as a
framework for developing novel visualization tools supporting phases of the
training life-cycle. We demonstrate the model application on examples covering
two types of cybersecurity training programs.

\\
  The gaze behavior of virtual avatars is critical to social presence and
perceived eye contact during social interactions in Virtual Reality. Virtual
Reality headsets are being designed with integrated eye tracking to enable
compelling virtual social interactions. This paper shows that the near
infra-red cameras used in eye tracking capture eye images that contain iris
patterns of the user. Because iris patterns are a gold standard biometric, the
current technology places the user's biometric identity at risk. Our first
contribution is an optical defocus based hardware solution to remove the iris
biometric from the stream of eye tracking images. We characterize the
performance of this solution with different internal parameters. Our second
contribution is a psychophysical experiment with a same-different task that
investigates the sensitivity of users to a virtual avatar's eye movements when
this solution is applied. By deriving detection threshold values, our findings
provide a range of defocus parameters where the change in eye movements would
go unnoticed in a conversational setting. Our third contribution is a
perceptual study to determine the impact of defocus parameters on the perceived
eye contact, attentiveness, naturalness, and truthfulness of the avatar. Thus,
if a user wishes to protect their iris biometric, our approach provides a
solution that balances biometric protection while preventing their conversation
partner from perceiving a difference in the user's virtual avatar. This work is
the first to develop secure eye tracking configurations for VR/AR/XR
applications and motivates future work in the area.

\\
  Entity summarization is the problem of computing an optimal compact summary
for an entity by selecting a size-constrained subset of triples from RDF data.
Entity summarization supports a multiplicity of applications and has led to
fruitful research. However, there is a lack of evaluation efforts that cover
the broad spectrum of existing systems. One reason is a lack of benchmarks for
evaluation. Some benchmarks are no longer available, while others are small and
have limitations. In this paper, we create an Entity Summarization BenchMark
(ESBM) which overcomes the limitations of existing benchmarks and meets
standard desiderata for a benchmark. Using this largest available benchmark for
evaluating general-purpose entity summarizers, we perform the most extensive
experiment to date where 9~existing systems are compared. Considering that all
of these systems are unsupervised, we also implement and evaluate a supervised
learning based system for reference.

Title: Price-aware Recommendation with Graph Convolutional Networks
Authors: Yu Zheng, Chen Gao, Xiangnan He, Yong Li, Depeng Jin
Categories: cs.IR
Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, to appear in ICDE2020
\\
  In recent years, much research effort on recommendation has been devoted to
mining user behaviors, i.e., collaborative filtering, along with the general
information which describes users or items, e.g., textual attributes,
categorical demographics, product images, and so on. Price, an important factor
in marketing --- which determines whether a user will make the final purchase
decision on an item --- surprisingly, has received relatively little scrutiny.
  In this work, we aim at developing an effective method to predict user
purchase intention with the focus on the price factor in recommender systems.
The main difficulties are two-fold: 1) the preference and sensitivity of a user
on item price are unknown, which are only implicitly reflected in the items
that the user has purchased, and 2) how the item price affects a user's
intention depends largely on the product category, that is, the perception and
affordability of a user on item price could vary significantly across
categories. Towards the first difficulty, we propose to model the transitive
relationship between user-to-item and item-to-price, taking the inspiration
from the recently developed Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). The key idea is
to propagate the influence of price on users with items as the bridge, so as to
make the learned user representations be price-aware. For the second
difficulty, we further integrate item categories into the propagation progress
and model the possible pairwise interactions for predicting user-item
interactions. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our GCN-based method in learning the
price-aware preference of users. Further analysis reveals that modeling the
price awareness is particularly useful for predicting user preference on items
of unexplored categories.

Title: SIR Analysis via Signal Fractions
Authors: Martin Haenggi
Categories: cs.IT cs.NI math.IT
\\
  The analysis of signal-to-interference ratios (SIRs) in wireless networks is
instrumental to derive important performance metrics, including reliability,
throughput, and delay. While a host of results on SIR distributions are now
available, they are often not straightforwards to interpret, bound, visualize,
and compare. In this letter, we offer an alternative path towards the analysis
and visualization of the SIR distribution. The quantity at the core of this
approach is the signal fraction (SF), which is the ratio of the signal power to
the total received power. A key advantage is that the SF is constrained to
[0,1]. We exemplify the benefits of the SF-based approach by reviewing known
results for Poisson cellular networks. In the process, we derive new
approximation and bounding techniques that are generally applicable.

Title: New Constructions of Complementary Sequence Pairs over $4^q$-QAM
Authors: Zilong Wang, Erzhong Xue, Guang Gong
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  The previous constructions of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) Golay
complementary sequences (GCSs) were generalized as $4^q $-QAM GCSs of length
$2^{m}$ by Li (the generalized cases I-III for $q\ge 2$) in 2010 and Liu (the
generalized cases IV-V for $q\ge 3$) in 2013 respectively. Those sequences are
represented as the weighted sum of $q$ quaternary standard GCSs. In this paper,
we present two new constructions for $ 4^q $-QAM GCSs of length $2^{m}$, where
the proposed sequences are also represented as the weighted sum of $q$
quaternary standard GCSs. It is shown that the generalized cases I-V are
special cases of these two constructions. In particular, if $q$ is a composite
number, a great number of new GCSs other than the sequences in the generalized
cases I-V will arise. For example, in the case $q=4$, the number of new GCSs is
seven times more than those in the generalized cases IV-V. In the case $q=6$,
the ratio of the number of new GCSs and the generalized cases IV-V is greater
than six and will increase in proportion with $m$. Moreover, our proof implies
all the mentioned GCSs over QAM in this paper can be regarded as projections of
Golay complementary arrays of size $2\times2\times\cdots\times2$.

Title: MIMO Amplify-and-Forward Precoding for Networked Control Systems
Authors: Fan Zhang, Vincent K. N. Lau, Gong Zhang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 17 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables
\\
  In this paper, we consider a MIMO networked control system (NCS) in which a
sensor amplifies and forwards the observed MIMO plant state to a remote
controller via a MIMO fading channel. We focus on the MIMO amplify-and-forward
(AF) precoding design at the sensor to minimize a weighted average state
estimation error at the remote controller subject to an average communication
power gain constraint of the sensor. The MIMO AF precoding design is formulated
as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). To deal with
the curse of dimensionality associated with the MDP, we propose a novel
continuous-time perturbation approach and derive an asymptotically optimal
closed-form priority function for the MDP. Based on this, we derive a
closed-form first-order optimal dynamic MIMO AF precoding solution, and the
solution has an event-driven control structure. Specifically, the sensor
activates the strongest eigenchannel to deliver a dynamically weighted
combination of the plant states to the controller when the accumulated state
estimation error exceeds a dynamic threshold. We further establish technical
conditions for ensuring the stability of the MIMO NCS, and show that the mean
square error of the plant state estimation is
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\bar{F}}\right)$, where $\bar{F}$ is the maximum AF
gain of the MIMO AF precoding.

  This paper investigates the application of non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) to satellite communication network over Shadowed-Rician fading channels.
The impact of imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) on
NOMA-based satellite network is taken into consideration from the perspective
of practical scenarios. We first derive new exact expressions of outage
probability for the p-th terrestrial user and provide the corresponding
asymptotic analysis results. The diversity order of zero and p are achieved by
the p-th terrestrial user with ipSIC and perfect successive interference
cancellation (pSIC), respectively. Finally, the presented simulation results
show that: 1) On the condition of pSIC, the outage behaviors of NOMA-based
satellite network are superior to that of orthogonal multiple access; 2) With
the value of residual interference increasing, the outage performance of
terrestrial users with ipSIC is becoming worse seriously; and 3) Infrequent
light shadowing of Shadowed-Rician fading brings the better outage probability
compared to frequent heavy and average shadowing.

\\
  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology which meets
the demands of massive connectivity in future wireless networks. Sparse code
multiple access (SCMA) is a popular code-domain NOMA technique. The
effectiveness of SCMA comes from: (1) the multi-dimensional sparse codebooks
offering high shaping gain and (2) sophisticated multi-user detection based on
message passing algorithm (MPA). The codebooks of the users play the main role
in determining the performance of SCMA system. This paper presents a framework
to design the codebooks by taking into account the entire system including the
SCMA encoder and the MPA-based detector. The symbol-error rate (SER) is
considered as the design criterion which needs to be minimized. Differential
evolution (DE) is used to carry out the minimization of the SER over the
codebooks. The simulation results are presented for various channel models.

\\
  This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless sensor
network, in which one UAV flies in the sky to collect the data transmitted from
a set of sensors via distributed beamforming. We consider the delay-sensitive
application scenario, in which the sensors transmit the common/shared messages
by using fixed data rates and adaptive transmit powers. Under this setup, we
jointly optimize the UAV's trajectory design and the sensors' transmit power
allocation, in order to minimize the transmission outage probability, subject
to the UAV's flight speed constraints and the sensors' individual average power
constraints. However, the formulated outage probability minimization problem is
non-convex and thus difficult to be optimally solved in general. To tackle this
issue, we first consider the special problem in the ideal case with the UAV's
flight speed constraints ignored, for which the well-structured optimal
solution is obtained to reveal the fundamental performance upper bound. Next,
for the general problem with the UAV's flight speed constraints considered, we
propose an efficient algorithm to solve it sub-optimally by using the
techniques of convex optimization and approximation. Finally, numerical results
show that our proposed design achieves significantly reduced outage probability
than other benchmark schemes.

metric, whereas the average error probability is bounded by modifying
Feinsteins Lemma. We derive an achievable strong secrecy rate region by
utilizing the resolvability theory for the multiple-access channel in terms of
information-spectrum methods.

Title: Advanced Receiver Architectures for Millimeter Wave Communications with

\\
  Deploying large antenna arrays coupled with high-speed and high-resolution
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) leads to the high implementation cost and
excessive power consumption in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication
receivers. Although using low-resolution ADCs is a promising solution to
address this problem, the performance degradation due to non-negligible
quantization error and the large number of radio frequency (RF) chains are not
desirable. In this article, we discuss advanced receiver architectures with
low-resolution ADCs that further improve the spectral and energy efficiency
tradeoff. To reduce both the number of RF chains and ADC bits, hybrid
analog-and-digital beamforming is jointly considered with low-resolution ADCs.
We explore the challenges in designing such a receiver and present key insights
on how this advanced architecture overcomes such challenges. As an alternative
low-resolution ADC receiver, we also introduce a receiver with learning-based
detection. Such a receiver does not require explicit channel estimation,
thereby is suitable for one-bit ADC systems. Finally, future challenges and
research issues are discussed.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Based Cooperative Coded Caching under Dynamic
  Popularities in Ultra-Dense Networks

\\
  For ultra-dense networks with wireless backhaul, caching strategy at small
base stations (SBSs), usually with limited storage, is critical to meet massive
high data rate requests. Since the content popularity profile varies with time
in an unknown way, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) to design a
cooperative caching strategy with maximum-distance separable (MDS) coding. We
model the MDS coding based cooperative caching as a Markov decision process to
capture the popularity dynamics and maximize the long-term expected cumulative
traffic load served directly by the SBSs without accessing the macro base
station. For the formulated problem, we first find the optimal solution for a
small-scale system by embedding the cooperative MDS coding into Q-learning. To
cope with the large-scale case, we approximate the state-action value function
heuristically. The approximated function includes only a small number of
learnable parameters and enables us to propose a fast and efficient
action-selection approach, which dramatically reduces the complexity. Numerical
results verify the optimality/near-optimality of the proposed RL based
algorithms and show the superiority compared with the baseline schemes. They
also exhibit good robustness to different environments.

Title: Phase Transition Analysis for Covariance Based Massive Random Access
  with Massive MIMO
Authors: Zhilin Chen, Foad Sohrabi, Ya-Feng Liu, Wei Yu
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 19 pages, 14 figures
\\
  This paper considers the massive random access problem in which a large
number of sporadically active devices wish to communicate with a base-station
(BS) equipped with a large number of antennas. Each device is preassigned a
unique signature sequence, and the BS identifies the active devices in the
random access by detecting which sequences are transmitted. This device
activity detection problem can be formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) problem with the sample covariance matrix of the received signal being a
sufficient statistic. The aim of this paper is to characterize the parameter
space in which this covariance based approach would be able to successfully
recover the device activities in the massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) regime. Through an analysis of the asymptotic behaviors of MLE via its
associated Fisher information matrix, this paper derives a necessary and
sufficient condition on the Fisher information matrix to ensure a vanishing
detection error rate as the number of antennas goes to infinity, based on which
a numerical phase transition analysis is obtained. This condition is also
examined from a perspective of covariance matching that relates the phase
transition analysis in this paper to a recently derived scaling law.
Furthermore, this paper provides a characterization of the distribution of the
estimation error in MLE, based on which the error probabilities in device
activity detection can be accurately predicted. Finally, this paper studies a
random access scheme with joint device activity and data detection and analyzes
its performance in a similar way. Simulation results validate the analysis.

Title: Capacity of Continuous Channels with Memory via Directed Information
  Neural Estimator
Authors: Ziv Aharoni and Dor Tsur and Ziv Goldfeld and Haim Henry Permuter
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
\\
  Calculating the capacity (with or without feedback) of channels with memory
and continuous alphabets is a challenging task. It requires optimizing the
directed information rate over all channel input distributions. The objective
is a multi-letter expression, whose analytic solution is only known for a few
specific cases. When no analytic solution is present or the channel model is
unknown, there is no unified framework for calculating or even approximating
capacity. This work proposes a novel capacity estimation algorithm that treats
the channel as a `black-box', both when feedback is or is not present. The
algorithm has two main ingredients: (i) a neural distribution transformer (NDT)
model that shapes a noise variable into the channel input distribution, which
we are able to sample, and (ii) the directed information neural estimator
(DINE) that estimates the communication rate of the current NDT model. These
models are trained by an alternating maximization procedure to both estimate
the channel capacity and obtain an NDT for the optimal input distribution. The
method is demonstrated on the moving average additive Gaussian noise channel,
where it is shown that both the capacity and feedback capacity are estimated
without knowledge of the channel transition kernel. The proposed estimation
framework opens the door to a myriad of capacity approximation results for
continuous alphabet channels that were inaccessible until now.

Title: Anti-Aging Scheduling in Single-Server Queues: A Systematic and
  Comparative Study
Authors: Zhongdong Liu, Liang Huang, Bin Li, and Bo Ji
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted to IEEE INFOCOM 2020 Age of Information (AoI) Workshop
\\
  The Age-of-Information (AoI) is a new performance metric recently proposed
for measuring the freshness of information in information-update systems. In
this work, we conduct a systematic and comparative study to investigate the
impact of scheduling policies on the AoI performance in single-server queues
and provide useful guidelines for the design of AoI-efficient scheduling
policies. Specifically, we first perform extensive simulations to demonstrate
that the update-size information can be leveraged for achieving a substantially
improved AoI compared to non-size-based (or arrival-time-based) policies. Then,
by utilizing both the update-size and arrival-time information, we propose
three AoI-based policies. Observing improved AoI performance of policies that
allow service preemption and that prioritize informative updates, we further
propose preemptive, informative, AoI-based scheduling policies. Our simulation
results show that such policies empirically achieve the best AoI performance
among all the considered policies. Interestingly, we also prove sample-path
equivalence between some size-based policies and AoI-based policies. This
provides an intuitive explanation for why some size-based policies, such as
Shortest-Remaining-Processing-Time (SRPT), achieve a very good AoI performance.

Title: AutoML-Zero: Evolving Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch
Authors: Esteban Real, Chen Liang, David R. So, and Quoc V. Le
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE stat.ML
ACM-class: I.2.2; I.2.6
\\
  Machine learning research has advanced in multiple aspects, including model
structures and learning methods. The effort to automate such research, known as
AutoML, has also made significant progress. However, this progress has largely
focused on the architecture of neural networks, where it has relied on
sophisticated expert-designed layers as building blocks---or similarly
restrictive search spaces. Our goal is to show that AutoML can go further: it
is possible today to automatically discover complete machine learning
algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as building blocks. We
demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces
human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this space,
evolutionary search can still discover two-layer neural networks trained by
backpropagation. These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving
directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques
emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized
gradients, and weight averaging. Moreover, evolution adapts algorithms to
different task types: e.g., dropout-like techniques appear when little data is
available. We believe these preliminary successes in discovering machine
learning algorithms from scratch indicate a promising new direction for the
field.

Title: Dropout: Explicit Forms and Capacity Control
Authors: Raman Arora, Peter Bartlett, Poorya Mianjy, Nathan Srebro
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We investigate the capacity control provided by dropout in various machine
learning problems. First, we study dropout for matrix completion, where it
induces a data-dependent regularizer that, in expectation, equals the weighted
trace-norm of the product of the factors. In deep learning, we show that the
data-dependent regularizer due to dropout directly controls the Rademacher
complexity of the underlying class of deep neural networks. These developments
enable us to give concrete generalization error bounds for the dropout
algorithm in both matrix completion as well as training deep neural networks.
We evaluate our theoretical findings on real-world datasets, including
MovieLens, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST.

Title: Contextual Blocking Bandits
Authors: Soumya Basu, Orestis Papadigenopoulos, Constantine Caramanis, Sanjay
  Shakkottai
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We study a novel variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, where at each
time step, the player observes a context that determines the arms' mean
rewards. However, playing an arm blocks it (across all contexts) for a fixed
number of future time steps. This model extends the blocking bandits model
(Basu et al., NeurIPS19) to a contextual setting, and captures important
scenarios such as recommendation systems or ad placement with diverse users,
and processing diverse pool of jobs. This contextual setting, however,
invalidates greedy solution techniques that are effective for its
non-contextual counterpart.
  Assuming knowledge of the mean reward for each arm-context pair, we design a
randomized LP-based algorithm which is $\alpha$-optimal in (large enough) $T$
time steps, where $\alpha = \tfrac{d_{\max}}{2d_{\max}-1}\left(1-
\epsilon\right)$ for any $\epsilon >0$, and $d_{max}$ is the maximum delay of
the arms. In the bandit setting, we show that a UCB based variant of the above
online policy guarantees $\mathcal{O}\left(\log T\right)$ regret w.r.t. the
$\alpha$-optimal strategy in $T$ time steps, which matches the
$\Omega(\log(T))$ regret lower bound in this setting. Due to the time
correlation caused by the blocking of arms, existing techniques for upper
bounding regret fail. As a first, in the presence of such temporal
correlations, we combine ideas from coupling of non-stationary Markov chains
and opportunistic sub-sampling with suboptimality charging techniques from
combinatorial bandits to prove our regret upper bounds.

Title: A Farewell to Arms: Sequential Reward Maximization on a Budget with a
  Giving Up Option
Authors: P Sharoff, Nishant A. Mehta, Ravi Ganti
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 16 pages, AISTATS 2020
\\
  We consider a sequential decision-making problem where an agent can take one
action at a time and each action has a stochastic temporal extent, i.e., a new
action cannot be taken until the previous one is finished. Upon completion, the
chosen action yields a stochastic reward. The agent seeks to maximize its
cumulative reward over a finite time budget, with the option of "giving up" on
a current action --- hence forfeiting any reward -- in order to choose another
action. We cast this problem as a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandits
problem with stochastic consumption of resource. For this problem, we first
establish that the optimal arm is the one that maximizes the ratio of the
expected reward of the arm to the expected waiting time before the agent sees
the reward due to pulling that arm. Using a novel upper confidence bound on
this ratio, we then introduce an upper confidence based-algorithm, WAIT-UCB,
for which we establish logarithmic, problem-dependent regret bound which has an
improved dependence on problem parameters compared to previous works.
Simulations on various problem configurations comparing WAIT-UCB against the
state-of-the-art algorithms are also presented.

Title: Training Deep Energy-Based Models with f-Divergence Minimization
Authors: Lantao Yu, Yang Song, Jiaming Song, Stefano Ermon
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep energy-based models (EBMs) are very flexible in distribution
parametrization but computationally challenging because of the intractable
partition function. They are typically trained via maximum likelihood, using
contrastive divergence to approximate the gradient of the KL divergence between
data and model distribution. While KL divergence has many desirable properties,
other f-divergences have shown advantages in training implicit density
generative models such as generative adversarial networks. In this paper, we
propose a general variational framework termed f-EBM to train EBMs using any
desired f-divergence. We introduce a corresponding optimization algorithm and
prove its local convergence property with non-linear dynamical systems theory.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of f-EBM over contrastive
divergence, as well as the benefits of training EBMs using f-divergences other
than KL.

Title: Deep learning for prediction of population health costs
Authors: Philipp Drewe-Boss, Dirk Enders, Jochen Walker, Uwe Ohler
Categories: cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML
\\
  Accurate prediction of healthcare costs is important for optimally managing
health costs. However, methods leveraging the medical richness from data such
as health insurance claims or electronic health records are missing. Here, we
developed a deep neural network to predict future cost from health insurance
claims records. We applied the deep network and a ridge regression model to a
sample of 1.4 million German insurants to predict total one-year health care
costs. Both methods were compared to Morbi-RSA models with various performance
measures and were also used to predict patients with a change in costs and to
identify relevant codes for this prediction. We showed that the neural network
outperformed the ridge regression as well as all Morbi-RSA models for cost
prediction. Further, the neural network was superior to ridge regression in
predicting patients with cost change and identified more specific codes. In
summary, we showed that our deep neural network can leverage the full
complexity of the patient records and outperforms standard approaches. We
suggest that the better performance is due to the ability to incorporate
complex interactions in the model and that the model might also be used for
predicting other health phenotypes.

  One of the challenging aspects of applying machine learning is the need to
identify the algorithms that will perform best for a given dataset. This
process can be difficult, time consuming and often requires a great deal of
domain knowledge. We present Sommelier, an expert system for recommending the
machine learning algorithms that should be applied on a previously unseen
dataset. Sommelier is based on word embedding representations of the domain
knowledge extracted from a large corpus of academic publications. When
presented with a new dataset and its problem description, Sommelier leverages a
recommendation model trained on the word embedding representation to provide a
ranked list of the most relevant algorithms to be used on the dataset. We
demonstrate Sommelier's effectiveness by conducting an extensive evaluation on
121 publicly available datasets and 53 classification algorithms. The top
algorithms recommended for each dataset by Sommelier were able to achieve on
average 97.7% of the optimal accuracy of all surveyed algorithms.

  Distributed training is useful to train complicated models to shorten the
training time. As each of the workers only sees a small fraction of data,
workers need to synchronize on the parameter updates. One of the central
questions in distributed training is how to parsimoniously synchronize
parameters while preserving model quality. To address this problem, we propose
the \textbf{ShadowSync} framework, in which we isolate synchronization from
training and run it in the background. In contrast to common strategies
including synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD), asynchronous SGD, and
model averaging on independently trained sub-models, where synchronization
happens in the foreground, ShadowSync synchronization is neither part of the
backward pass, nor happens every $k$ iterations.
  Our framework is generic to host various types of synchronization algorithms,
and we propose 3 approaches under this theme. The superiority of ShadowSync is
confirmed by experiments on training deep neural networks for
click-through-rate prediction. Our methods all succeed in making the training
throughput linearly scale with the number of trainers. Comparing to their
foreground counterparts, our methods exhibit neutral to better model quality
and better scalability when we keep the number of parameter servers the same.
In our training system which expresses both replication and Hogwild
parallelism, ShadowSync also accomplishes the highest example level parallelism
number comparing to the prior arts.

\\
  The classical development of neural networks has been primarily for mappings
between a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and a set of classes, or between
two finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The purpose of this work is to
generalize neural networks so that they can learn mappings between
infinite-dimensional spaces (operators). The key innovation in our work is that
a single set of network parameters, within a carefully designed network
architecture, may be used to describe mappings between infinite-dimensional
spaces and between different finite-dimensional approximations of those spaces.
We formulate approximation of the infinite-dimensional mapping by composing
nonlinear activation functions and a class of integral operators. The kernel
integration is computed by message passing on graph networks. This approach has
substantial practical consequences which we will illustrate in the context of
mappings between input data to partial differential equations (PDEs) and their
solutions. In this context, such learned networks can generalize among
different approximation methods for the PDE (such as finite difference or
finite element methods) and among approximations corresponding to different
underlying levels of resolution and discretization. Experiments confirm that
the proposed graph kernel network does have the desired properties and show
competitive performance compared to the state of the art solvers.

  Algorithms with Approximate Regret Bounds
Authors: Ehsan Emamjomeh-Zadeh, Chen-Yu Wei, Haipeng Luo, David Kempe
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We revisit the problem of online learning with sleeping experts/bandits: in
each time step, only a subset of the actions are available for the algorithm to
choose from (and learn about). The work of Kleinberg et al. [2010] showed that
there exist no-regret algorithms which perform no worse than the best ranking
of actions asymptotically. Unfortunately, achieving this regret bound appears
computationally hard: Kanade and Steinke [2014] showed that achieving this
no-regret performance is at least as hard as PAC-learning DNFs, a notoriously
difficult problem. In the present work, we relax the original problem and study
computationally efficient no-approximate-regret algorithms: such algorithms may
exceed the optimal cost by a multiplicative constant in addition to the
additive regret. We give an algorithm that provides a no-approximate-regret
guarantee for the general sleeping expert/bandit problems. For several
canonical special cases of the problem, we give algorithms with significantly
better approximation ratios; these algorithms also illustrate different
techniques for achieving no-approximate-regret guarantees.

  Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization (CMTF) facilitates the integration and
analysis of multiple data sources and helps discover meaningful information.
Nonnegative CMTF (N-CMTF) has been employed in many applications for
identifying latent patterns, prediction, and recommendation. However, due to
the added complexity with coupling between tensor and matrix data, existing
N-CMTF algorithms exhibit poor computation efficiency. In this paper, a
computationally efficient N-CMTF factorization algorithm is presented based on
the column-wise element selection, preventing frequent gradient updates.
Theoretical and empirical analyses show that the proposed N-CMTF factorization
algorithm is not only more accurate but also more computationally efficient
than existing algorithms in approximating the tensor as well as in identifying
the underlying nature of factors.

Title: Scalable Approximate Inference and Some Applications
Authors: Jun Han
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: PhD thesis, Dartmouth College (2019)
\\
  Approximate inference in probability models is a fundamental task in machine
learning. Approximate inference provides powerful tools to Bayesian reasoning,
decision making, and Bayesian deep learning. The main goal is to estimate the
expectation of interested functions w.r.t. a target distribution. When it comes
to high dimensional probability models and large datasets, efficient
approximate inference becomes critically important. In this thesis, we propose
a new framework for approximate inference, which combines the advantages of
these three frameworks and overcomes their limitations. Our proposed four
algorithms are motivated by the recent computational progress of Stein's
method. Our proposed algorithms are applied to continuous and discrete
distributions under the setting when the gradient information of the target
distribution is available or unavailable. Theoretical analysis is provided to
prove the convergence of our proposed algorithms. Our adaptive IS algorithm
iteratively improves the importance proposal by functionally decreasing the KL
divergence between the updated proposal and the target. When the gradient of
the target is unavailable, our proposed sampling algorithm leverages the
gradient of a surrogate model and corrects induced bias with importance
weights, which significantly outperforms other gradient-free sampling
algorithms. In addition, our theoretical results enable us to perform the
goodness-of-fit test on discrete distributions. At the end of the thesis, we
propose an importance-weighted method to efficiently aggregate local models in
distributed learning with one-shot communication. Results on simulated and real
datasets indicate the statistical efficiency and wide applicability of our
algorithm.

Title: An Active Learning Framework for Constructing High-fidelity Mobility
  Maps
Authors: Gary R. Marple, David Gorsich, Paramsothy Jayakumar, Shravan

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A mobility map, which provides maximum achievable speed on a given terrain,
is essential for path planning of autonomous ground vehicles in off-road
settings. While physics-based simulations play a central role in creating
next-generation, high-fidelity mobility maps, they are cumbersome and
expensive. For instance, a typical simulation can take weeks to run on a
supercomputer and each map requires thousands of such simulations. Recent work
at the U.S. Army CCDC Ground Vehicle Systems Center has shown that trained
machine learning classifiers can greatly improve the efficiency of this
process. However, deciding which simulations to run in order to train the
classifier efficiently is still an open problem. According to PAC learning
theory, data that can be separated by a classifier is expected to require
$\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ randomly selected points (simulations) to train the
classifier with error less than $\epsilon$. In this paper, building on existing
algorithms, we introduce an active learning paradigm that substantially reduces
the number of simulations needed to train a machine learning classifier without
sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results suggest that our sampling algorithm
can train a neural network, with higher accuracy, using less than half the
number of simulations when compared to random sampling.

Title: The Variational InfoMax Learning Objective
Authors: Vincenzo Crescimanna, Bruce Graham
Categories: cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
\\
  Bayesian Inference and Information Bottleneck are the two most popular
objectives for neural networks, but they can be optimised only via a
variational lower bound: the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB). In this
manuscript we show that the two objectives are actually equivalent to the
InfoMax: maximise the information between the data and the labels. The InfoMax
representation of the two objectives is not relevant only per se, since it
helps to understand the role of the network capacity, but also because it
allows us to derive a variational objective, the Variational InfoMax (VIM),
that maximises them directly without resorting to any lower bound. The
theoretical improvement of VIM over VIB is highlighted by the computational
experiments, where the model trained by VIM improves the VIB model in three
different tasks: accuracy, robustness to noise and representation quality.

Title: Ternary Compression for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning
Authors: Jinjin Xu, Wenli Du, Ran Cheng, Wangli He, Yaochu Jin
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC stat.ML
\\
  Learning over massive data stored in different locations is essential in many
real-world applications. However, sharing data is full of challenges due to the
increasing demands of privacy and security with the growing use of smart mobile
devices and IoT devices. Federated learning provides a potential solution to
privacy-preserving and secure machine learning, by means of jointly training a
global model without uploading data distributed on multiple devices to a
central server. However, most existing work on federated learning adopts
machine learning models with full-precision weights, and almost all these
models contain a large number of redundant parameters that do not need to be
transmitted to the server, consuming an excessive amount of communication
costs. To address this issue, we propose a federated trained ternary
quantization (FTTQ) algorithm, which optimizes the quantized networks on the
clients through a self-learning quantization factor. A convergence proof of the
quantization factor and the unbiasedness of FTTQ is given. In addition, we
propose a ternary federated averaging protocol (T-FedAvg) to reduce the
upstream and downstream communication of federated learning systems. Empirical
experiments are conducted to train widely used deep learning models on publicly
available datasets, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of FTTQ and
T-FedAvg compared with the canonical federated learning algorithms in reducing
communication costs and maintaining the learning performance.

Title: Efficient Nonnegative Tensor Factorization via Saturating Coordinate

\\
  With the advancements in computing technology and web-based applications,
data is increasingly generated in multi-dimensional form. This data is usually
sparse due to the presence of a large number of users and fewer user
interactions. To deal with this, the Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF)
based methods have been widely used. However existing factorization algorithms
are not suitable to process in all three conditions of size, density, and rank
of the tensor. Consequently, their applicability becomes limited. In this
paper, we propose a novel fast and efficient NTF algorithm using the element
selection approach. We calculate the element importance using Lipschitz
continuity and propose a saturation point based element selection method that
chooses a set of elements column-wise for updating to solve the optimization
problem. Empirical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm is scalable in
terms of tensor size, density, and rank in comparison to the relevant
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization: A Survey

Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Combinatorial optimization (CO) is the workhorse of numerous important
applications in operations research, engineering and other fields and, thus,
has been attracting enormous attention from the research community for over a
century. Many efficient solutions to common problems involve using hand-crafted
heuristics to sequentially construct a solution. Therefore, it is intriguing to
see how a combinatorial optimization problem can be formulated as a sequential
decision making process and whether efficient heuristics can be implicitly
learned by a reinforcement learning agent to find a solution. This survey
explores the synergy between CO and reinforcement learning (RL) framework,
which can become a promising direction for solving combinatorial problems.

  We investigate online nonlinear regression with continually running recurrent
neural network networks (RNNs), i.e., RNN-based online learning. For RNN-based
online learning, we introduce an efficient first-order training algorithm that
theoretically guarantees to converge to the optimum network parameters. Our
algorithm is truly online such that it does not make any assumption on the
learning environment to guarantee convergence. Through numerical simulations,
we verify our theoretical results and illustrate significant performance
improvements achieved by our algorithm with respect to the state-of-the-art RNN
training methods.

Title: RCC-Dual-GAN: An Efficient Approach for Outlier Detection with Few
  Identified Anomalies
Authors: Zhe Li, Chunhua Sun, Chunli Liu, Xiayu Chen, Meng Wang, Yezheng Liu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Outlier detection is an important task in data mining and many technologies
have been explored in various applications. However, due to the default
assumption that outliers are non-concentrated, unsupervised outlier detection
may not correctly detect group anomalies with higher density levels. As for the
supervised outlier detection, although high detection rates and optimal
parameters can usually be achieved, obtaining sufficient and correct labels is
a time-consuming task. To address these issues, we focus on semi-supervised
outlier detection with few identified anomalies, in the hope of using limited
labels to achieve high detection accuracy. First, we propose a novel detection
model Dual-GAN, which can directly utilize the potential information in
identified anomalies to detect discrete outliers and partially identified group
anomalies simultaneously. And then, considering the instances with similar
output values may not all be similar in a complex data structure, we replace
the two MO-GAN components in Dual-GAN with the combination of RCC and M-GAN
(RCC-Dual-GAN). In addition, to deal with the evaluation of Nash equilibrium
and the selection of optimal model, two evaluation indicators are created and
introduced into the two models to make the detection process more intelligent.
Extensive experiments on both benchmark datasets and two practical tasks
demonstrate that our proposed approaches (i.e., Dual-GAN and RCC-Dual-GAN) can
significantly improve the accuracy of outlier detection even with only a few
identified anomalies. Moreover, compared with the two MO-GAN components in
Dual-GAN, the network structure combining RCC and M-GAN has greater stability
in various situations.

Title: Explaining Knowledge Distillation by Quantifying the Knowledge
Authors: Xu Cheng, Zhefan Rao, Yilan Chen, Quanshi Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  This paper presents a method to interpret the success of knowledge
distillation by quantifying and analyzing task-relevant and task-irrelevant
visual concepts that are encoded in intermediate layers of a deep neural
network (DNN). More specifically, three hypotheses are proposed as follows. 1.
Knowledge distillation makes the DNN learn more visual concepts than learning
from raw data. 2. Knowledge distillation ensures that the DNN is prone to
learning various visual concepts simultaneously. Whereas, in the scenario of
learning from raw data, the DNN learns visual concepts sequentially. 3.
Knowledge distillation yields more stable optimization directions than learning
from raw data. Accordingly, we design three types of mathematical metrics to
evaluate feature representations of the DNN. In experiments, we diagnosed
various DNNs, and above hypotheses were verified.

\\
  The large capacity of neural networks enables them to learn complex
functions. To avoid overfitting, networks however require a lot of training
data that can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. A common practical
approach to attenuate overfitting is the use of network regularization
techniques. We propose a novel regularization method that progressively
penalizes the magnitude of activations during training. The combined activation
signals produced by all neurons in a given layer form the representation of the
input image in that feature space. We propose to regularize this representation
in the last feature layer before classification layers. Our method's effect on
generalization is analyzed with label randomization tests and cumulative
ablations. Experimental results show the advantages of our approach in
comparison with commonly-used regularizers on standard benchmark datasets.

Title: Modeling of Spatio-Temporal Hawkes Processes with Randomized Kernels
Authors: Fatih Ilhan, Suleyman Serdar Kozat
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We investigate spatio-temporal event analysis using point processes.
Inferring the dynamics of event sequences spatiotemporally has many practical
applications including crime prediction, social media analysis, and traffic
forecasting. In particular, we focus on spatio-temporal Hawkes processes that
are commonly used due to their capability to capture excitations between event
occurrences. We introduce a novel inference framework based on randomized
transformations and gradient descent to learn the process. We replace the
spatial kernel calculations by randomized Fourier feature-based
transformations. The introduced randomization by this representation provides
flexibility while modeling the spatial excitation between events. Moreover, the
system described by the process is expressed within closed-form in terms of
scalable matrix operations. During the optimization, we use maximum likelihood
estimation approach and gradient descent while properly handling positivity and
orthonormality constraints. The experiment results show the improvements
achieved by the introduced method in terms of fitting capability in synthetic
and real datasets with respect to the conventional inference methods in the
spatio-temporal Hawkes process literature. We also analyze the triggering
interactions between event types and how their dynamics change in space and
time through the interpretation of learned parameters.

Title: Geometry and Topology of Deep Neural Networks' Decision Boundaries
Authors: Bo Liu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Geometry and topology of decision regions are closely related with
classification performance and robustness against adversarial attacks. In this
paper, we use differential geometry and topology to explore theoretically the
geometrical and topological properties of decision regions produced by deep
neural networks (DNNs). The goals are to obtain some geometrical and
topological properties of decision regions for given DNN models, and provide
some principled guidances to designing and regularizing DNNs. At first, we give
the curvatures of decision boundaries in terms of network weights. Based on the
rotation index theorem and Gauss-Bonnet-Chern theorem, we then propose methods
to identify the closeness and connectivity of given decision boundaries, and
obtain the Euler characteristics of closed ones, all without the need to solve
decision boundaries explicitly. Finally, we give necessary conditions on
network architectures in order to produce closed decision boundaries, and
sufficient conditions on network weights for producing zero curvature (flat or
developable) decision boundaries.

Title: Inverse Feature Learning: Feature learning based on Representation
  Learning of Error
Authors: Behzad Ghazanfari, Fatemeh Afghah, MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This paper proposes inverse feature learning as a novel supervised feature
learning technique that learns a set of high-level features for classification
based on an error representation approach. The key contribution of this method
is to learn the representation of error as high-level features, while current
representation learning methods interpret error by loss functions which are
obtained as a function of differences between the true labels and the predicted
ones. One advantage of such learning method is that the learned features for
each class are independent of learned features for other classes; therefore,
this method can learn simultaneously meaning that it can learn new classes
without retraining. Error representation learning can also help with
generalization and reduce the chance of over-fitting by adding a set of
impactful features to the original data set which capture the relationships
between each instance and different classes through an error generation and
analysis process. This method can be particularly effective in data sets, where
the instances of each class have diverse feature representations or the ones
with imbalanced classes. The experimental results show that the proposed method
results in significantly better performance compared to the state-of-the-art
classification techniques for several popular data sets. We hope this paper can
open a new path to utilize the proposed perspective of error representation
learning in different feature learning domains.

Comments: Key-words: Anomaly detection, Mondrian forest, isolation forest,
  random forest, iMondrian forest
\\
  We propose a new method, named isolation Mondrian forest (iMondrian forest),
for batch and online anomaly detection. The proposed method is a novel hybrid
of isolation forest and Mondrian forest which are existing methods for batch
anomaly detection and online random forest, respectively. iMondrian forest
takes the idea of isolation, using the depth of a node in a tree, and
implements it in the Mondrian forest structure. The result is a new data
structure which can accept streaming data in an online manner while being used
for anomaly detection. Our experiments show that iMondrian forest mostly
performs better than isolation forest in batch settings and has better or
comparable performance against other batch and online anomaly detection
methods.

\\
  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) have proven to be a powerful
modeling tool for approximating (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation)
irregularly sampled time series data. However, their performance degrades
substantially when applied to real-world data, especially long-term data with
complex behaviors (e.g., long-term trend across years, mid-term seasonality
across months, and short-term local variation across days). To address the
modeling of such complex data with different behaviors at different frequencies
(time spans), we propose a novel progressive learning paradigm of NODEs for
long-term time series forecasting. Specifically, following the principle of
curriculum learning, we gradually increase the complexity of data and network
capacity as training progresses. Our experiments with both synthetic data and
real traffic data (PeMS Bay Area traffic data) show that our training
methodology consistently improves the performance of vanilla NODEs by over 64%.

Title: Removing Disparate Impact of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient
  Descent on Model Accuracy
Authors: Depeng Xu, Wei Du and Xintao Wu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.CY stat.ML
\\
  When we enforce differential privacy in machine learning, the utility-privacy
trade-off is different w.r.t. each group. Gradient clipping and random noise
addition disproportionately affect underrepresented and complex classes and
subgroups, which results in inequality in utility loss. In this work, we
analyze the inequality in utility loss by differential privacy and propose a
modified differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD), called
DPSGD-F, to remove the potential disparate impact of differential privacy on
the protected group. DPSGD-F adjusts the contribution of samples in a group
depending on the group clipping bias such that differential privacy has no
disparate impact on group utility. Our experimental evaluation shows how group
sample size and group clipping bias affect the impact of differential privacy
in DPSGD, and how adaptive clipping for each group helps to mitigate the
disparate impact caused by differential privacy in DPSGD-F.

Title: Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning with Neural Networks: Global
  Optimality and Convergence Rate
Authors: Yufeng Zhang, Qi Cai, Zhuoran Yang, Zhaoran Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) demonstrates tremendous
success in practice, especially when combined with neural networks. Different
from reinforcement learning, GAIL learns both policy and reward function from
expert (human) demonstration. Despite its empirical success, it remains unclear
whether GAIL with neural networks converges to the globally optimal solution.
The major difficulty comes from the nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization
structure. To bridge the gap between practice and theory, we analyze a
gradient-based algorithm with alternating updates and establish its sublinear
convergence to the globally optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis establishes the global optimality and convergence rate of GAIL with
neural networks for the first time.

Title: On the Robustness of Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jieyu Lin, Kristina Dzeparoska, Sai Qian Zhang, Alberto Leon-Garcia,
  Nicolas Papernot
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL), agents learn to
cooperatively take actions as a team to maximize a total team reward. We
analyze the robustness of c-MARL to adversaries capable of attacking one of the
agents on a team. Through the ability to manipulate this agent's observations,
the adversary seeks to decrease the total team reward.
  Attacking c-MARL is challenging for three reasons: first, it is difficult to
estimate team rewards or how they are impacted by an agent mispredicting;
second, models are non-differentiable; and third, the feature space is
low-dimensional. Thus, we introduce a novel attack. The attacker first trains a
policy network with reinforcement learning to find a wrong action it should
encourage the victim agent to take. Then, the adversary uses targeted
adversarial examples to force the victim to take this action.
  Our results on the StartCraft II multi-agent benchmark demonstrate that
c-MARL teams are highly vulnerable to perturbations applied to one of their
agent's observations. By attacking a single agent, our attack method has highly
negative impact on the overall team reward, reducing it from 20 to 9.4. This
results in the team's winning rate to go down from 98.9% to 0%.

  Network data can be conveniently modeled as a graph signal, where data values
are assigned to nodes of a graph that describes the underlying network
topology. Successful learning from network data is built upon methods that
effectively exploit this graph structure. In this work, we overview graph
convolutional filters, which are linear, local and distributed operations that
adequately leverage the graph structure. We then discuss graph neural networks
(GNNs), built upon graph convolutional filters, that have been shown to be
powerful nonlinear learning architectures. We show that GNNs are permutation
equivariant and stable to changes in the underlying graph topology, allowing
them to scale and transfer. We also introduce GNN extensions using edge-varying
and autoregressive moving average graph filters and discuss their properties.
Finally, we study the use of GNNs in learning decentralized controllers for
robot swarm and in addressing the recommender system problem.

  We develop an effective generation of adversarial attacks on neural models
that output a sequence of probability distributions rather than a sequence of
single values. This setting includes the recently proposed deep probabilistic
autoregressive forecasting models that estimate the probability distribution of
a time series given its past and achieve state-of-the-art results in a diverse
set of application domains. The key technical challenge we address is
effectively differentiating through the Monte-Carlo estimation of statistics of
the joint distribution of the output sequence. Additionally, we extend prior
work on probabilistic forecasting to the Bayesian setting which allows
conditioning on future observations, instead of only on past observations. We
demonstrate that our approach can successfully generate attacks with small
input perturbations in two challenging tasks where robust decision making is
crucial: stock market trading and prediction of electricity consumption.

\\
  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) is currently the method of choice
both for generative, as well as for discriminative learning in computer vision
and machine learning. The success of DCNNs can be attributed to the careful
selection of their building blocks (e.g., residual blocks, rectifiers,
sophisticated normalization schemes, to mention but a few). In this paper, we
propose $\Pi$-Nets, a new class of DCNNs. $\Pi$-Nets are polynomial neural
networks, i.e., the output is a high-order polynomial of the input. $\Pi$-Nets
can be implemented using special kind of skip connections and their parameters
can be represented via high-order tensors. We empirically demonstrate that
$\Pi$-Nets have better representation power than standard DCNNs and they even
produce good results without the use of non-linear activation functions in a
large battery of tasks and signals, i.e., images, graphs, and audio. When used
in conjunction with activation functions, $\Pi$-Nets produce state-of-the-art
results in challenging tasks, such as image generation. Lastly, our framework
elucidates why recent generative models, such as StyleGAN, improve upon their
predecessors, e.g., ProGAN.

Title: Multivariate Boosted Trees and Applications to Forecasting and Control
Authors: Lorenzo Nespoli, Vasco Medici
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Gradient boosted trees are competition-winning, general-purpose,
non-parametric regressors, which exploit sequential model fitting and gradient
descent to minimize a specific loss function. The most popular implementations
are tailored to univariate regression and classification tasks, precluding the
possibility of capturing multivariate target cross-correlations and applying
conditional penalties to the predictions. In this paper, we present a
computationally efficient algorithm for fitting multivariate boosted trees. We
show that multivariate trees can outperform their univariate counterpart when
the predictions are correlated. Furthermore, the algorithm allows to
arbitrarily regularize the predictions, so that properties like smoothness,
consistency and functional relations can be enforced. We present applications
and numerical results related to forecasting and control.

Title: Improving Training on Noisy Stuctured Labels

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages main text, 13 pages total
\\
  Fine-grained annotations---e.g. dense image labels, image segmentation and
text tagging---are useful in many ML applications but they are labor-intensive
to generate. Moreover there are often systematic, structured errors in these
fine-grained annotations. For example, a car might be entirely unannotated in
the image, or the boundary between a car and street might only be coarsely
annotated. Standard ML training on data with such structured errors produces
models with biases and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
framework of Error-Correcting Networks (ECN) to address the challenge of
learning in the presence structured error in fine-grained annotations. Given a
large noisy dataset with commonly occurring structured errors, and a much
smaller dataset with more accurate annotations, ECN is able to substantially
improve the prediction of fine-grained annotations compared to standard
approaches for training on noisy data. It does so by learning to leverage the
structures in the annotations and in the noisy labels. Systematic experiments
on image segmentation and text tagging demonstrate the strong performance of
ECN in improving training on noisy structured labels.

Title: Risk Analysis of Divide-and-Conquer ERM
Authors: Yong Liu and Lizhong Ding and Weiping Wang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Theoretical analysis of the divide-and-conquer based distributed learning
with least square loss in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) have
recently been explored within the framework of learning theory. However, the
studies on learning theory for general loss functions and hypothesis spaces
remain limited. To fill the gap, we study the risk performance of distributed
empirical risk minimization (ERM) for general loss functions and hypothesis
spaces. The main contributions are two-fold. First, we derive two risk bounds
of optimal rates under certain basic assumptions on the hypothesis space, as
well as the smoothness, Lipschitz continuity, strong convexity of the loss
function. Second, we further develop two more general risk bounds for
distributed ERM without the restriction of strong convexity

Title: Nearly Optimal Risk Bounds for Kernel K-Means
Authors: Yong Liu and Lizhong Ding and Hua Zhang and Wenqi Ren and Xiao Zhang

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we study the statistical properties of the kernel $k$-means
and obtain a nearly optimal excess risk bound, substantially improving the
state-of-art bounds in the existing clustering risk analyses. We further
analyze the statistical effect of computational approximations of the
Nystr\"{o}m kernel $k$-means, and demonstrate that it achieves the same
statistical accuracy as the exact kernel $k$-means considering only $\sqrt{nk}$
Nystr\"{o}m landmark points. To the best of our knowledge, such sharp excess
risk bounds for kernel (or approximate kernel) $k$-means have never been seen
before.

Title: COPT: Coordinated Optimal Transport on Graphs
Authors: Yihe Dong, Will Sawin
Categories: cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML
\\
  We introduce COPT, a novel distance metric between graphs defined via an
optimization routine, computing a coordinated pair of optimal transport maps
simultaneously. This is an unsupervised way to learn general-purpose graph
representations, it can be used for both graph sketching and graph comparison.
COPT involves simultaneously optimizing dual transport plans, one between the
vertices of two graphs, and another between graph signal probability
distributions. We show both theoretically and empirically that our method
preserves important global structural information on graphs, in particular
spectral information, making it well-suited for tasks on graphs including
retrieval, classification, summarization, and visualization.

Title: A working likelihood approach to support vector regression with a
  data-driven insensitivity parameter
Authors: Jinran Wu and You-Gan Wang
Categories: cs.LG stat.CO stat.ML
\\
  The insensitive parameter in support vector regression determines the set of
support vectors that greatly impacts the prediction. A data-driven approach is
proposed to determine an approximate value for this insensitive parameter by
minimizing a generalized loss function originating from the likelihood
principle. This data-driven support vector regression also statistically
standardizes samples using the scale of noises. Nonlinear and linear numerical
simulations with three types of noises ($\epsilon$-Laplacian distribution,
normal distribution, and uniform distribution), and in addition, five real
benchmark data sets, are used to test the capacity of the proposed method.
Based on all of the simulations and the five case studies, the proposed support
vector regression using a working likelihood, data-driven insensitive parameter
is superior and has lower computational costs.

\\
  Balancing performance and safety is crucial to deploying autonomous vehicles
in multi-agent environments. In particular, autonomous racing is a domain that
penalizes safe but conservative policies, highlighting the need for robust,
adaptive strategies. Current approaches either make simplifying assumptions
about other agents or lack robust mechanisms for online adaptation. This work
makes algorithmic contributions to both challenges. First, to generate a
realistic, diverse set of opponents, we develop a novel method for self-play
based on replica-exchange Markov chain Monte Carlo. Second, we propose a
distributionally robust bandit optimization procedure that adaptively adjusts
risk aversion relative to uncertainty in beliefs about opponents' behaviors. We
rigorously quantify the tradeoffs in performance and robustness when
approximating these computations in real-time motion-planning, and we
demonstrate our methods experimentally on autonomous vehicles that achieve
scaled speeds comparable to Formula One racecars.

  Structure Evolution

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, under review as conference paper
\\
  Time series prediction is an important problem in machine learning. Previous
methods for time series prediction did not involve additional information. With
a lot of dynamic knowledge graphs available, we can use this additional
information to predict the time series better. Recently, there has been a focus
on the application of deep representation learning on dynamic graphs. These
methods predict the structure of the graph by reasoning over the interactions
in the graph at previous time steps. In this paper, we propose a new framework
to incorporate the information from dynamic knowledge graphs for time series
prediction. We show that if the information contained in the graph and the time
series data are closely related, then this inter-dependence can be used to
predict the time series with improved accuracy. Our framework, DArtNet, learns
a static embedding for every node in the graph as well as a dynamic embedding
which is dependent on the dynamic attribute value (time-series). Then it
captures the information from the neighborhood by taking a relation specific
mean and encodes the history information using RNN. We jointly train the model
link prediction and attribute prediction. We evaluate our method on five
specially curated datasets for this problem and show a consistent improvement
in time series prediction results.

Title: $Q^\star$ Approximation Schemes for Batch Reinforcement Learning: A
  Theoretical Comparison
Authors: Tengyang Xie, Nan Jiang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  We prove performance guarantees of two algorithms for approximating $Q^\star$
in batch reinforcement learning. Compared to classical iterative methods such
as Fitted Q-Iteration---whose performance loss incurs quadratic dependence on
horizon---these methods estimate (some forms of) the Bellman error and enjoy
linear-in-horizon error propagation, a property established for the first time
for algorithms that rely solely on batch data and output stationary policies.
One of the algorithms uses a novel and explicit importance-weighting correction
to overcome the infamous "double sampling" difficulty in Bellman error
estimation, and does not use any squared losses. Our analyses reveal its
distinct characteristics and potential advantages compared to classical
algorithms.

Title: Causal Interpretability for Machine Learning -- Problems, Methods and
  Evaluation
Authors: Raha Moraffah, Mansooreh Karami, Ruocheng Guo, Adrienne Ragliny, Huan

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Machine learning models have had discernible achievements in a myriad of
applications. However, most of these models are black-boxes, and it is obscure
how the decisions are made by them. This makes the models unreliable and
untrustworthy. To provide insights into the decision making processes of these
models, a variety of traditional interpretable models have been proposed.
Moreover, to generate more human-friendly explanations, recent work on
interpretability tries to answer questions related to causality such as \Why
does this model makes such decisions?" or \Was it a specific feature that
caused the decision made by the model?". In this work, models that aim to
answer causal questions are referred to as causal interpretable models. The
existing surveys have covered concepts and methodologies of traditional
interpretability. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey on causal
interpretable models from the aspects of the problems and methods. In addition,
this survey provides in-depth insights into the existing evaluation metrics for
measuring interpretability, which can help practitioners understand for what
scenarios each evaluation metric is suitable.

Title: Robust Learning from Discriminative Feature Feedback
Authors: Sanjoy Dasgupta and Sivan Sabato
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: To appear in AISTATS 2020
\\
  Recent work introduced the model of learning from discriminative feature
feedback, in which a human annotator not only provides labels of instances, but
also identifies discriminative features that highlight important differences
between pairs of instances. It was shown that such feedback can be conducive to
learning, and makes it possible to efficiently learn some concept classes that
would otherwise be intractable. However, these results all relied upon perfect
annotator feedback. In this paper, we introduce a more realistic, robust
version of the framework, in which the annotator is allowed to make mistakes.
We show how such errors can be handled algorithmically, in both an adversarial
and a stochastic setting. In particular, we derive regret bounds in both
settings that, as in the case of a perfect annotator, are independent of the
number of features. We show that this result cannot be obtained by a naive
reduction from the robust setting to the non-robust setting.

Title: Metric Learning for Ordered Labeled Trees with pq-grams
Authors: Hikaru Shindo, Masaaki Nishino, Yasuaki Kobayashi, Akihiro Yamamoto
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted at ECAI 2020 (full paper)
\\
  Computing the similarity between two data points plays a vital role in many
machine learning algorithms. Metric learning has the aim of learning a good
metric automatically from data. Most existing studies on metric learning for
tree-structured data have adopted the approach of learning the tree edit
distance. However, the edit distance is not amenable for big data analysis
because it incurs high computation cost. In this paper, we propose a new metric
learning approach for tree-structured data with pq-grams. The pq-gram distance
is a distance for ordered labeled trees, and has much lower computation cost
than the tree edit distance. In order to perform metric learning based on
pq-grams, we propose a new differentiable parameterized distance, weighted
pq-gram distance. We also propose a way to learn the proposed distance based on
Large Margin Nearest Neighbors (LMNN), which is a well-studied and practical
metric learning scheme. We formulate the metric learning problem as an
optimization problem and use the gradient descent technique to perform metric
learning. We empirically show that the proposed approach not only achieves
competitive results with the state-of-the-art edit distance-based methods in
various classification problems, but also solves the classification problems
much more rapidly than the edit distance-based methods.

Title: Wide-minima Density Hypothesis and the Explore-Exploit Learning Rate
  Schedule
Authors: Nikhil Iyer, V Thejas, Nipun Kwatra, Ramachandran Ramjee, Muthian
  Sivathanu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  While the generalization properties of neural networks are not yet well
understood, several papers argue that wide minima generalize better than narrow
minima. In this paper, through detailed experiments that not only corroborate
the generalization properties of wide minima, we also provide empirical
evidence for a new hypothesis that the density of wide minima is likely lower
than the density of narrow minima.
  Further, motivated by this hypothesis, we design a novel explore-exploit
learning rate schedule. On a variety of image and natural language datasets,
compared to their original hand-tuned learning rate baselines, we show that our
explore-exploit schedule can result in either up to 0.5\% higher absolute
accuracy using the original training budget or up to 44\% reduced training time
while achieving the original reported accuracy.

Title: When can Wasserstein GANs minimize Wasserstein Distance?
Authors: Yuanzhi Li, Zehao Dou
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 45 pages
\\
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are widely used models to learn
complex real-world distributions. In GANs, the training of the generator
usually stops when the discriminator can no longer distinguish the generator's
output from the set of training examples. A central question of GANs is that
when the training stops, whether the generated distribution is actually close
to the target distribution. Previously, it was found that such closeness can
only be achieved when there is a strict capacity trade-off between the
generator and discriminator: Neither of the two models can be too powerful than
the other. In this paper, we established one of the first theoretical results
in explaining this trade-off. We show that when the generator is a class of
two-layer neural networks, then it is necessary and sufficient for the
discriminator to be a one-layer network with ReLU-type activation functions.
With this trade-off, using polynomially many training examples, when the
training stops, the generator will indeed output a distribution that is
inverse-polynomially close to the target. Our result also sheds light on how
GANs training can find such a generator efficiently.

Title: Efficiency and Equity are Both Essential: A Generalized Traffic Signal
  Controller with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Shengchao Yan, Jingwei Zhang, Daniel Buescher, Wolfram Burgard
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  Traffic signal controllers play an essential role in the traffic system,
while the current majority of them are not sufficiently flexible or adaptive to
make optimal traffic schedules. In this paper we present an approach to learn
policies for the signal controllers using deep reinforcement learning. Our
method uses a novel formulation of the reward function that simultaneously
considers efficiency and equity. We furthermore present a general approach to
find the bound for the proposed equity factor. Moreover, we introduce the
adaptive discounting approach that greatly stabilizes learning, which helps to
keep high flexibility of green light duration. The experimental evaluations on
both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed algorithm
achieves state-of-the-art performance (previously held by traditional
non-learning methods) on a wide range of traffic situations. A video of our
experimental results can be found at: https://youtu.be/3rc5-ac3XX0

Title: Supervised Domain Adaptation using Graph Embedding
Authors: Lukas Hedegaard, Omar Ali Sheikh-Omar and Alexandros Iosifidis
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Getting deep convolutional neural networks to perform well requires a large
amount of training data. When the available labelled data is small, it is often
beneficial to use transfer learning to leverage a related larger dataset
(source) in order to improve the performance on the small dataset (target).
Among the transfer learning approaches, domain adaptation methods assume that
distributions between the two domains are shifted and attempt to realign them.
In this paper, we consider the domain adaptation problem from the perspective
of dimensionality reduction and propose a generic framework based on graph
embedding. Instead of solving the generalised eigenvalue problem, we formulate
the graph-preserving criterion as a loss in the neural network and learn a
domain-invariant feature transformation in an end-to-end fashion. We show that
the proposed approach leads to a powerful Domain Adaptation framework; a simple
LDA-inspired instantiation of the framework leads to state-of-the-art
performance on two of the most widely used Domain Adaptation benchmarks,
Office31 and MNIST to USPS datasets.

Title: Zooming for Efficient Model-Free Reinforcement Learning in Metric Spaces
Authors: Ahmed Touati, Adrien Ali Taiga, Marc G. Bellemare
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Despite the wealth of research into provably efficient reinforcement learning
algorithms, most works focus on tabular representation and thus struggle to
handle exponentially or infinitely large state-action spaces. In this paper, we
consider episodic reinforcement learning with a continuous state-action space
which is assumed to be equipped with a natural metric that characterizes the
proximity between different states and actions. We propose ZoomRL, an online
algorithm that leverages ideas from continuous bandits to learn an adaptive
discretization of the joint space by zooming in more promising and frequently
visited regions while carefully balancing the exploitation-exploration
trade-off. We show that ZoomRL achieves a worst-case regret
$\tilde{O}(H^{\frac{5}{2}} K^{\frac{d+1}{d+2}})$ where $H$ is the planning
horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes and $d$ is the covering dimension of the
space with respect to the metric. Moreover, our algorithm enjoys improved
metric-dependent guarantees that reflect the geometry of the underlying space.
Finally, we show that our algorithm is robust to small misspecification errors.

Title: Stable Policy Optimization via Off-Policy Divergence Regularization
Authors: Ahmed Touati, Amy Zhang, Joelle Pineau, Pascal Vincent
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) are among the most successful policy gradient approaches in deep
reinforcement learning (RL). While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of challenging tasks, there is room for
improvement in the stabilization of the policy learning and how the off-policy
data are used. In this paper we revisit the theoretical foundations of these
algorithms and propose a new algorithm which stabilizes the policy improvement
through a proximity term that constrains the discounted state-action visitation
distribution induced by consecutive policies to be close to one another. This
proximity term, expressed in terms of the divergence between the visitation
distributions, is learned in an off-policy and adversarial manner. We
empirically show that our proposed method can have a beneficial effect on
stability and improve final performance in benchmark high-dimensional control
tasks.

Title: Sets Clustering

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The input to the \emph{sets-$k$-means} problem is an integer $k\geq 1$ and a
set $\mathcal{P}=\{P_1,\cdots,P_n\}$ of sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The goal is to
compute a set $C$ of $k$ centers (points) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that minimizes the
sum $\sum_{P\in \mathcal{P}} \min_{p\in P, c\in C}\left\| p-c \right\|^2$ of
squared distances to these sets. An \emph{$\varepsilon$-core-set} for this
problem is a weighted subset of $\mathcal{P}$ that approximates this sum up to
$1\pm\varepsilon$ factor, for \emph{every} set $C$ of $k$ centers in
$\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that such a core-set of $O(\log^2{n})$ sets always
exists, and can be computed in $O(n\log{n})$ time, for every input
$\mathcal{P}$ and every fixed $d,k\geq 1$ and $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. The
result easily generalized for any metric space, distances to the power of
$z>0$, and M-estimators that handle outliers. Applying an inefficient but
optimal algorithm on this coreset allows us to obtain the first PTAS
($1+\varepsilon$ approximation) for the sets-$k$-means problem that takes time
near linear in $n$. This is the first result even for sets-mean on the plane
($k=1$, $d=2$). Open source code and experimental results for document
classification and facility locations are also provided.

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  An adversarial attack paradigm explores various scenarios for vulnerability
of machine and especially deep learning models: we can apply minor changes to
the model input to force a classifier's failure for a particular example. Most
of the state of the art frameworks focus on adversarial attacks for images and
other structured model inputs. The adversarial attacks for categorical
sequences can also be harmful if they are successful. However, successful
attacks for inputs based on categorical sequences should address the following
challenges: (1) non-differentiability of the target function, (2) constraints
on transformations of initial sequences, and (3) diversity of possible
problems. We handle these challenges using two approaches. The first approach
adopts Monte-Carlo methods and allows usage in any scenario, the second
approach uses a continuous relaxation of models and target metrics, and thus
allows using general state of the art methods on adversarial attacks with
little additional effort. Results for money transactions, medical fraud, and
NLP datasets suggest the proposed methods generate reasonable adversarial
sequences that are close to original ones, but fool machine learning models
even for blackbox adversarial attacks.

Title: Human AI interaction loop training: New approach for interactive
  reinforcement learning
Authors: Neda Navidi
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) in various decision-making tasks of machine
learning provides effective results with an agent learning from a stand-alone
reward function. However, it presents unique challenges with large amounts of
environment states and action spaces, as well as in the determination of
rewards. This complexity, coming from high dimensionality and continuousness of
the environments considered herein, calls for a large number of learning trials
to learn about the environment through Reinforcement Learning. Imitation
Learning (IL) offers a promising solution for those challenges using a teacher.
In IL, the learning process can take advantage of human-sourced assistance
and/or control over the agent and environment. A human teacher and an agent
learner are considered in this study. The teacher takes part in the agent
training towards dealing with the environment, tackling a specific objective,
and achieving a predefined goal. Within that paradigm, however, existing IL
approaches have the drawback of expecting extensive demonstration information
in long-horizon problems. This paper proposes a novel approach combining IL
with different types of RL methods, namely state action reward state action
(SARSA) and asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) agents, to overcome the
problems of both stand-alone systems. It is addressed how to effectively
leverage the teacher feedback, be it direct binary or indirect detailed for the
agent learner to learn sequential decision-making policies. The results of this
study on various OpenAI Gym environments show that this algorithmic method can
be incorporated with different combinations, significantly decreases both human
endeavor and tedious exploration process.

  We present a modular neural network architecture Main that learns algorithms
given a set of input-output examples. Main consists of a neural controller that
interacts with a variable-length input tape and learns to compose modules
together with their corresponding argument choices. Unlike previous approaches,
Main uses a general domain-agnostic mechanism for selection of modules and
their arguments. It uses a general input tape layout together with a parallel
history tape to indicate most recently used locations. Finally, it uses a

policies that generalizes perfectly to inputs of much longer lengths than the

Title: Collaborative Learning of Semi-Supervised Clustering and Classification
  for Labeling Uncurated Data
Authors: Sara Mousavi, Dylan Lee, Tatianna Griffin, Dawnie Steadman, and Audris
  Mockus
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Domain-specific image collections present potential value in various areas of
science and business but are often not curated nor have any way to readily
extract relevant content. To employ contemporary supervised image analysis
methods on such image data, they must first be cleaned and organized, and then
manually labeled for the nomenclature employed in the specific domain, which is
a time consuming and expensive endeavor. To address this issue, we designed and
implemented the Plud system. Plud provides an iterative semi-supervised
workflow to minimize the effort spent by an expert and handles realistic large
collections of images. We believe it can support labeling datasets regardless
of their size and type. Plud is an iterative sequence of unsupervised
clustering, human assistance, and supervised classification. With each
iteration 1) the labeled dataset grows, 2) the generality of the classification
method and its accuracy increases, and 3) manual effort is reduced. We
evaluated the effectiveness of our system, by applying it on over a million
images documenting human decomposition. In our experiment comparing manual
labeling with labeling conducted with the support of Plud, we found that it
reduces the time needed to label data and produces highly accurate models for
this new domain.

Title: Finding Input Characterizations for Output Properties in ReLU Neural
  Networks
Authors: Saket Dingliwal, Divyansh Pareek, Jatin Arora
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 5 page
\\
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as a powerful mechanism and are
being increasingly deployed in real-world safety-critical domains. Despite the
widespread success, their complex architecture makes proving any formal
guarantees about them difficult. Identifying how logical notions of high-level
correctness relate to the complex low-level network architecture is a
significant challenge. In this project, we extend the ideas presented in and
introduce a way to bridge the gap between the architecture and the high-level
specifications. Our key insight is that instead of directly proving the safety
properties that are required, we first prove properties that relate closely to
the structure of the neural net and use them to reason about the safety
properties. We build theoretical foundations for our approach, and empirically
evaluate the performance through various experiments, achieving promising
results than the existing approach by identifying a larger region of input
space that guarantees a certain property on the output.

Title: How to Train Your Super-Net: An Analysis of Training Heuristics in
  Weight-Sharing NAS
Authors: Kaicheng Yu and Rene Ranftl and Mathieu Salzmann
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Weight sharing promises to make neural architecture search (NAS) tractable
even on commodity hardware. Existing methods in this space rely on a diverse
set of heuristics to design and train the shared-weight backbone network,
a.k.a. the super-net. Since heuristics and hyperparameters substantially vary
across different methods, a fair comparison between them can only be achieved
by systematically analyzing the influence of these factors. In this paper, we
therefore provide a systematic evaluation of the heuristics and hyperparameters
that are frequently employed by weight-sharing NAS algorithms. Our analysis
uncovers that some commonly-used heuristics for super-net training negatively
impact the correlation between super-net and stand-alone performance, and
evidences the strong influence of certain hyperparameters and architectural
choices. Our code and experiments set a strong and reproducible baseline that
future works can build on.

Title: Deep Inverse Feature Learning: A Representation Learning of Error
Authors: Behzad Ghazanfari, Fatemeh Afghah
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  This paper introduces a novel perspective about error in machine learning and
proposes inverse feature learning (IFL) as a representation learning approach
that learns a set of high-level features based on the representation of error
for classification or clustering purposes. The proposed perspective about error
representation is fundamentally different from current learning methods, where
in classification approaches they interpret the error as a function of the
differences between the true labels and the predicted ones or in clustering
approaches, in which the clustering objective functions such as compactness are
used. Inverse feature learning method operates based on a deep clustering
approach to obtain a qualitative form of the representation of error as
features. The performance of the proposed IFL method is evaluated by applying
the learned features along with the original features, or just using the
learned features in different classification and clustering techniques for
several data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method leads
to promising results in classification and especially in clustering. In
classification, the proposed features along with the primary features improve
the results of most of the classification methods on several popular data sets.
In clustering, the performance of different clustering methods is considerably
improved on different data sets. There are interesting results that show some
few features of the representation of error capture highly informative aspects
of primary features. We hope this paper helps to utilize the error
representation learning in different feature learning domains.

Title: Variational Inference for Deep Probabilistic Canonical Correlation
  Analysis
Authors: Mahdi Karami, Dale Schuurmans
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures
\\
  In this paper, we propose a deep probabilistic multi-view model that is
composed of a linear multi-view layer based on probabilistic canonical
correlation analysis (CCA) description in the latent space together with deep
generative networks as observation models. The network is designed to decompose
the variations of all views into a shared latent representation and a set of
view-specific components where the shared latent representation is intended to
describe the common underlying sources of variation among the views. An
efficient variational inference procedure is developed that approximates the
posterior distributions of the latent probabilistic multi-view layer while
taking into account the solution of probabilistic CCA. A generalization to
models with arbitrary number of views is also proposed. The empirical studies
confirm that the proposed deep generative multi-view model can successfully
extend deep variational inference to multi-view learning while it efficiently
integrates the relationship between multiple views to alleviate the difficulty
of learning.

Title: A scheme for automatic differentiation of complex loss functions
Authors: Chu Guo, Dario Poletti
Categories: cs.LG
Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure, 1 table
\\
  For a real function, automatic differentiation is such a standard algorithm
used to efficiently compute its gradient, that it is integrated in various
neural network frameworks. However, despite the recent advances in using
complex functions in machine learning and the well-established usefulness of
automatic differentiation, the support of automatic differentiation for complex
functions is not as well-established and widespread as for real functions. In
this work we propose an efficient and seamless scheme to implement automatic
differentiation for complex functions, which is a compatible generalization of
the current scheme for real functions. This scheme can significantly simplify
the implementation of neural networks which use complex numbers.

Title: Propagating Asymptotic-Estimated Gradients for Low Bitwidth Quantized
  Neural Networks

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Journal of
  Selected Topics in Signal Processing

DOI: 10.1109/JSTSP.2020.2966327
\\
  The quantized neural networks (QNNs) can be useful for neural network
acceleration and compression, but during the training process they pose a
challenge: how to propagate the gradient of loss function through the graph
flow with a derivative of 0 almost everywhere. In response to this
non-differentiable situation, we propose a novel Asymptotic-Quantized Estimator
(AQE) to estimate the gradient. In particular, during back-propagation, the
graph that relates inputs to output remains smoothness and differentiability.
At the end of training, the weights and activations have been quantized to
low-precision because of the asymptotic behaviour of AQE. Meanwhile, we propose
a M-bit Inputs and N-bit Weights Network (MINW-Net) trained by AQE, a quantized
neural network with 1-3 bits weights and activations. In the inference phase,
we can use XNOR or SHIFT operations instead of convolution operations to
accelerate the MINW-Net. Our experiments on CIFAR datasets demonstrate that our
AQE is well defined, and the QNNs with AQE perform better than that with
Straight-Through Estimator (STE). For example, in the case of the same ConvNet
that has 1-bit weights and activations, our MINW-Net with AQE can achieve a
prediction accuracy 1.5\% higher than the Binarized Neural Network (BNN) with
STE. The MINW-Net, which is trained from scratch by AQE, can achieve comparable
classification accuracy as 32-bit counterparts on CIFAR test sets. Extensive
experimental results on ImageNet dataset show great superiority of the proposed
AQE and our MINW-Net achieves comparable results with other state-of-the-art
QNNs.

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 15 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Abstraction is crucial for effective sequential decision making in domains
with large state spaces. In this work, we propose a variational information
bottleneck method for learning approximate bisimulations, a type of state
abstraction. We use a deep neural net encoder to map states onto continuous
embeddings. The continuous latent space is then compressed into a discrete
representation using an action-conditioned hidden Markov model, which is
trained end-to-end with the neural network. Our method is suited for
environments with high-dimensional states and learns from a stream of
experience collected by an agent acting in a Markov decision process. Through a
learned discrete abstract model, we can efficiently plan for unseen goals in a
multi-goal Reinforcement Learning setting. We test our method in simplified
robotic manipulation domains with image states. We also compare it against
previous model-based approaches to finding bisimulations in discrete
grid-world-like environments.

\\
  Random access machines (RAMs) and random access stored-program machines
(RASPs) are models of computing that are closer to the architecture of
real-world computers than Turing machines (TMs). They are also convenient in
complexity analysis of algorithms. The relationships between RAMs, RASPs and
TMs are well-studied. However, a clear relationships between their quantum
counterparts are still missing in the literature.
  We fill in this gap by formally defining the models of quantum random access
machines (QRAMs) and quantum random access stored-program machines (QRASPs) and
clarifying the relationships between QRAMs, QRASPs and quantum Turing machines
(QTMs). In particular, we prove:
  1. A $T(n)$-time QRAM (resp. QRASP) can be simulated by an $O(T(n))$-time
QRASP (resp. QRAM).
  2. A $T(n)$-time QRAM under the logarithmic (resp. constant) cost criterion
can be simulated by an $\tilde O(T(n)^4)$-time (resp. $\tilde O(T(n)^8)$-time)
QTM.
  3. A $T(n)$-time QTM can be simulated within error $\varepsilon > 0$ by an
$O(T(n)^2 \operatorname{polylog}(T(n), 1/\varepsilon))$-time QRAM (under both
the logarithmic and constant cost criterions).
  As a corollary, we have: $\textbf{P} \subseteq \textbf{EQRAMP} \subseteq
\textbf{EQP} \subseteq \textbf{BQP} = \textbf{BQRAMP}$, where $\textbf{EQRAMP}$
and $\textbf{BQRAMP}$ stand for the sets of problems that can be solved by
polynomial-time QRAMs with certainty and bounded-error, respectively.

Title: Formal Verification of Cyber-Physical Systems using Theorem Proving
  (Invited Paper)
Authors: Adnan Rashid, Umair Siddique and Sofiene Tahar

Comments: 15 Pages, Seventh International Workshop on Formal Techniques for
  Safety-Critical Systems, Shenzhen, China
\\
  Due to major breakthroughs in software and engineering technologies, embedded
systems are increasingly being utilized in areas ranging from aerospace and
next-generation transportation systems, to smart grid and smart cities, to
health care systems, and broadly speaking to what is known as Cyber-Physical
Systems (CPS). A CPS is primarily composed of several electronic, communication
and controller modules and some actuators and sensors. The mix of heterogeneous
underlying smart technologies poses a number of technical challenges to the
design and more severely to the verification of such complex infrastructure. In
fact, a CPS shall adhere to strict safety, reliability, performance and
security requirements, where one needs to capture both physical and random
aspects of the various CPS modules and then analyze their interrelationship
across interlinked continuous and discrete dynamics. Often times however,
system bugs remain uncaught during the analysis and in turn cause unwanted
scenarios that may have serious consequences in safety-critical applications.
In this paper, we introduce some of the challenges surrounding the design and
verification of contemporary CPS with the advent of smart technologies. In
particular, we survey recent developments in the use of theorem proving, a
formal method, for the modeling, analysis and verification of CPS, and overview
some real world CPS case studies from the automotive, avionics and healthtech
domains from system level to physical components.

Title: Strategic Abilities of Asynchronous Agents: Semantic Paradoxes and How
  to Tame Them
Authors: Wojciech Jamroga, Wojciech Penczek, and Teofil Sidoruk
Categories: cs.LO cs.MA
\\
  Recently, we proposed a framework for verification of agents' abilities in
asynchronous multi-agent systems, together with an algorithm for automated
reduction of models. The semantics was built on the modeling tradition of
distributed systems. As we show here, this can sometimes lead to paradoxical
interpretation of formulas when reasoning about the outcome of strategies.
First, the semantics disregards finite paths, and thus yields counterintuitive
evaluation of strategies with deadlocks. Secondly, the semantic representations
do not allow to capture the asymmetry between active agents and the recipients
of their choices. We propose how to avoid the problems by a suitable change of
the semantics, and prove that the model reduction scheme still works in the
modified framework.

Title: A Uniform Treatment of Aggregates and Constraints in Hybrid ASP
Authors: Pedro Cabalar and Jorge Fandinno and Torsten Schaub and Philipp Wanko
Categories: cs.LO cs.AI
ACM-class: I.2.4
\\
  Characterizing hybrid ASP solving in a generic way is difficult since one
needs to abstract from specific theories. Inspired by lazy SMT solving, this is
usually addressed by treating theory atoms as opaque. Unlike this, we propose a
slightly more transparent approach that includes an abstract notion of a term.
Rather than imposing a syntax on terms, we keep them abstract by stipulating
only some basic properties. With this, we further develop a semantic framework
for hybrid ASP solving and provide aggregate functions for theory variables
that adhere to different semantic principles, show that they generalize
existing aggregate semantics in ASP and how we can rely on off-the-shelf hybrid
solvers for implementation.

Title: Teaching Temporal Logics to Neural Networks

Categories: cs.LO cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We show that a deep neural network can learn the semantics of linear-time
temporal logic (LTL). As a challenging task that requires deep understanding of
the LTL semantics, we show that our network can solve the trace generation
problem for LTL: given a satisfiable LTL formula, find a trace that satisfies
the formula. We frame the trace generation problem for LTL as a translation
task, i.e., to translate from formulas to satisfying traces, and train an
off-the-shelf implementation of the Transformer, a recently introduced deep
learning architecture proposed for solving natural language processing tasks.
We provide a detailed analysis of our experimental results, comparing multiple
hyperparameter settings and formula representations. After training for several
hours on a single GPU the results were surprising: the Transformer returns the
syntactically equivalent trace in 89% of the cases on a held-out test set. Most
of the "mispredictions", however, (and overall more than 99% of the predicted
traces) still satisfy the given LTL formula. In other words, the Transformer
generalized from imperfect training data to the semantics of LTL.

\\
  Airline scheduling poses some of the most challenging problems in the entire
Operations Research (OR) domain. In that, crew scheduling (CS) constitutes one
of the most important and challenging planning activities. Notably, the crew
operating cost is the second-largest component of an airline's total operating
cost (after the fuel cost). Hence, its optimization promises enormous benefits,
and even marginal improvements may translate to annual savings worth millions
of dollars for an airline. However, CS is a combination of complex
combinatorial optimization problems (with NP-hard computational complexity),
namely \textit{crew pairing} and \textit{crew assignment}, which are solved
sequentially. Here, \textit{crew pairing optimization} aims at generating a set
of flight sequences (each called a crew pairing) to cover a finite set of
flight legs from an airline's timetable at minimum cost, while satisfying
several legality constraints linked to the federations' safety rules,
airline-specific regulations, labor laws, etc. Subsequently, \textit{crew
assignment} aims at assigning crew members to these optimal crew pairings. This
research focuses on the critically fundamental step of CS, in that, a crew
pairing optimization problem (CPOP) is formulated, and an optimization
framework to solve the posed CPOP has been proposed. The distinctive
contribution of this research relates to \textit{its tackling of a large-scale
complex flight network for an airline (leading to more than a billion legal
pairings/variables), and validation of the results by the research consortium's
Industrial partner, GE Aviation}.

Comments: https://ensmallen.org/
\\
  This report provides an introduction to the ensmallen numerical optimization
library, as well as a deep dive into the technical details of how it works. The
library provides a fast and flexible C++ framework for mathematical
optimization of arbitrary user-supplied functions. A large set of pre-built
optimizers is provided, including many variants of Stochastic Gradient Descent
and Quasi-Newton optimizers. Several types of objective functions are
supported, including differentiable, separable, constrained, and categorical
objective functions. Implementation of a new optimizer requires only one
method, while a new objective function requires typically only one or two C++
methods. Through internal use of C++ template metaprogramming, ensmallen
provides support for arbitrary user-supplied callbacks and automatic inference
of unsupplied methods without any runtime overhead. Empirical comparisons show
that ensmallen outperforms other optimization frameworks (such as Julia and
SciPy), sometimes by large margins. The library is available at
https://ensmallen.org and is distributed under the permissive BSD license.

Title: A posteriori Error Estimation for the Spectral Deferred Correction

Authors: Jehanzeb H. Chaudhry and J.B. Collins
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  The spectral deferred correction method is a variant of the deferred
correction method for solving ordinary differential equations. A benefit of
this method is that is uses low order schemes iteratively to produce a high
order approximation. In this paper we consider adjoint-based a posteriori
analysis to estimate the error in a quantity of interest of the solution. This
error formula is derived by first developing a nodally equivalent finite
element method to the spectral deferred correction method. The error formula is
then split into various terms, each of which characterizes a different
component of the error. These components may be used to determine the optimal
strategy for changing the method parameters to best improve the error.

Authors: Wansheng Wang, Mengli Mao and Zheng Wang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 65M12, 65M15, 65L06, 65J08
\\
  In this paper stability and error estimates for time discretizations of
linear and semilinear parabolic equations by the two-step backward
differentiation formula (BDF2) method with variable step-sizes are derived. An
affirmative answer is provided to the question: whether the upper bound of
step-size ratios for the $l^\infty(0,T;H)$-stability of the BDF2 method for
linear and semilinear parabolic equations is identical with the upper bound for
the zero-stability. The $l^\infty(0,T;V)$-stability of the variable step-size
BDF2 method is also established under more relaxed condition on the ratios of
consecutive step-sizes. Based on these stability results, error estimates in
several different norms are derived. To utilize the BDF method the trapezoidal
method and the backward Euler scheme are employed to compute the starting
value. For the latter choice, order reduction phenomenon of the constant
step-size BDF2 method is observed theoretically and numerically in several
norms. Numerical results also illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for linear and semilinear parabolic equations.

\\
  The aim of this paper is to develop and analyze high-order time stepping
schemes for solving semilinear subdiffusion equations. We apply the $k$-step
BDF convolution quadrature to discretize the time-fractional derivative with
order $\alpha\in (0,1)$, and modify the starting steps in order to achieve
optimal convergence rate. This method has already been well-studied for the
linear fractional evolution equations in Jin, Li and Zhou
\cite{JinLiZhou:correction}, while the numerical analysis for the nonlinear
problem is still missing in the literature. By splitting the nonlinear
potential term into an irregular linear part and a smoother nonlinear part, and
using the generating function technique, we prove that the convergence order of
the corrected BDF$k$ scheme is $O(\tau^{\min(k,1+2\alpha-\epsilon)})$, without
imposing further assumption on the regularity of the solution. Numerical
examples are provided to support our theoretical results.

  We study a simple nonlocal-in-time dynamic system proposed for the effective
modeling of complex diffusive regimes in heterogeneous media. We present its
solutions and their commonly studied statistics such as the mean square
distance. This interesting model employs a nonlocal operator to replace the
conventional first-order time-derivative. It introduces a finite memory effect
of a constant length encoded through a kernel function. The nonlocal-in-time
operator is related to fractional time derivatives that rely on the entire
time-history on one hand, while reduces to, on the other hand, the classical
time derivative if the length of the memory window diminishes. This allows us
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the nonlocal-in-time model in capturing the
crossover widely observed in nature between the initial sub-diffusion and the
long time normal diffusion.

Title: On the Solution of the Nonsymmetric T-Riccati Equation
Authors: Peter Benner and Davide Palitta

\\
  The nonsymmetric T-Riccati equation is a quadratic matrix equation where the
linear part corresponds to the so-called T-Sylvester or T-Lyapunov operator
that has previously been studied in the literature. It has applications in
macroeconomics and policy dynamics. So far, it presents an unexplored problem
in numerical analysis, and both, theoretical results and computational methods,
are lacking in the literature. In this paper we provide some sufficient
conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a nonnegative minimal solution
and its efficient computation is deeply analyzed. Both the small-scale and the
large-scale setting are addressed and Newton-Kleinman-like methods are derived.
The convergence of these procedures to the minimal solution is proved and
several numerical results illustrate the computational efficiency of the
proposed methods.

Title: Lagrangian schemes for Wasserstein gradient flows
Authors: Jose A. Carrillo and Daniel Matthes and Marie-Therese Wolfram
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This paper reviews different numerical methods for specific examples of
Wasserstein gradient flows: we focus on nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations,but
also discuss discretizations of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel model and
of the fourth order thin film equation. The methods under review are of
Lagrangian nature, that is, the numerical approximations trace the
characteristics of the underlying transport equation rather than solving the
evolution equation for the mass density directly. The two main approaches are
based on integrating the equation for the Lagrangian maps on the one hand, and
on solution of coupled ODEs for individual mass particles on the other hand.

  Since integration by parts is an important tool when deriving energy or
entropy estimates for differential equations, one may conjecture that some form
of summation by parts (SBP) property is necessarily involved in provably stable
numerical methods. This article contributes to this topic by proposing a novel
class of $A$ stable SBP time integration methods including the classical
Lobatto IIIA collocation method, not previously formulated as an SBP scheme.
Additionally, a related SBP scheme including the classical Lobatto IIIB
collocation method is developed.

Title: Toeplitz Monte Carlo
Authors: Josef Dick, Takashi Goda, Hiroya Murata
Categories: math.NA cs.NA stat.ME
\\
  Motivated mainly by applications to partial differential equations with
random coefficients, we introduce a new class of Monte Carlo estimators, called
Toeplitz Monte Carlo (TMC) estimator for approximating the integral of a
multivariate function with respect to the direct product of an identical
univariate probability measure. The TMC estimator generates a sequence
$x_1,x_2,\ldots$ of i.i.d. samples for one random variable, and then uses
$(x_{n+s-1},x_{n+s-2}\ldots,x_n)$ with $n=1,2,\ldots$ as quadrature points,
where $s$ denotes the dimension. Although consecutive points have some
dependency, the concatenation of all quadrature nodes is represented by a
Toeplitz matrix, which allows for a fast matrix-vector multiplication. In this
paper we study the variance of the TMC estimator and its dependence on the
dimension $s$. Numerical experiments confirm the considerable efficiency
improvement over the standard Monte Carlo estimator for applications to partial
differential equations with random coefficients, particularly when the
dimension $s$ is large.

Title: Long time error analysis of the fourth-order compact finite difference
  methods for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with weak nonlinearity
Authors: Yue Feng
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 22 pages, 2 figures
\\
  We present the fourth-order compact finite difference (4cFD) discretizations
for the long time dynamics of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE), while
the nonlinearity strength is characterized by $\varepsilon^p$ with a constant
$p \in \mathbb{N}^+$ and a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$.
Based on analytical results of the life-span of the solution, rigorous error
bounds of the 4cFD methods are carried out up to the time at
$O(\varepsilon^{-p})$. We pay particular attention to how error bounds depend
explicitly on the mesh size $h$ and time step $\tau$ as well as the small
parameter $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$, which indicate that, in order to obtain
`correct' numerical solutions up to the time at $O(\varepsilon^{-p})$, the
$\varepsilon$-scalability (or meshing strategy requirement) of the 4cFD methods
should be taken as: $h = O(\varepsilon^{p/4})$ and $\tau =
O(\varepsilon^{p/2})$. It has better spatial resolution capacity than the
classical second order central difference methods. By a rescaling in time, it
is equivalent to an oscillatory NKGE whose solution propagates waves with
wavelength at $O(1)$ in space and $O(\varepsilon^p)$ in time. It is
straightforward to get the error bounds of the oscillatory NKGE in the fixed
time. Finally, numerical results are provided to confirm our theoretical
analysis.

Title: Variational Time Discretizations of Higher Order and Higher Regularity
Authors: Simon Becher, Gunar Matthies
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 28 pages
MSC-class: 65L05, 65L20, 65L60
\\
  We consider a family of variational time discretizations that are
generalizations of discontinuous Galerkin (dG) and continuous Galerkin-Petrov
(cGP) methods. The family is characterized by two parameters. One describes the
polynomial ansatz order while the other one is associated with the global
smoothness that is ensured by higher order collocation conditions at both ends
of the subintervals. The presented methods provide the same stability
properties as dG or cGP. Provided that suitable quadrature rules of Hermite
type for evaluating the integrals in the variational conditions are used, the
variational time discretization methods are connected to special collocation
methods. For this case, we will present error estimates, numerical experiments,
and a computationally cheap postprocessing that allows to increase both the
accuracy and the global smoothness by one order.

Title: Synaptic Metaplasticity in Binarized Neural Networks
Authors: Axel Laborieux, Maxence Ernoult, Tifenn Hirtzlin and Damien Querlioz
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  While deep neural networks have surpassed human performance in multiple
situations, they are prone to catastrophic forgetting: upon training a new
task, they rapidly forget previously learned ones. Neuroscience studies, based
on idealized tasks, suggest that in the brain, synapses overcome this issue by
adjusting their plasticity depending on their past history. However, such
"metaplastic" behaviour has never been leveraged to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in deep neural networks. In this work, we highlight a connection
between metaplasticity models and the training process of binarized neural
networks, a low-precision version of deep neural networks. Building on this
idea, we propose and demonstrate experimentally, in situations of multitask and
stream learning, a training technique that prevents catastrophic forgetting
without needing previously presented data, nor formal boundaries between
datasets. We support our approach with a theoretical analysis on a tractable
task. This work bridges computational neuroscience and deep learning, and
presents significant assets for future embedded and neuromorphic systems.

Title: Shahryar Origami Optimization (SOO): A Novel Approach for Solving
  Large-scale Expensive Optimization Problems Efficiently
Authors: Shahryar Rahnamayan, Seyed Jalaleddin Mousavirad, Azam Asilian Bidgoli
Categories: cs.NE cs.AI
\\
  Many real-world problems are categorized as large-scale problems, and
metaheuristic algorithms as an alternative method to solve large-scale problem;
they need the evaluation of many candidate solutions to tackle them prior to
their convergence, which is not affordable for practical applications since the
most of them are computationally expensive. In other words, these problems are
not only large-scale but also computationally expensive, that makes them very
difficult to solve. There is no efficient surrogate model to support
large-scale expensive global optimization (LSEGO) problems. As a result, the
algorithms should address LSEGO problems using a limited computational budget
to be applicable in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a simple
novel algorithm called Shahryar Origami Optimization (SOO) algorithm to tackle
LSEGO problems with a limited computational budget. Our proposed algorithm
benefits from two leading steps, namely, finding the region of interest and
then shrinkage of the search space by folding it into the half with exponential
speed. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithm is being free of
any control parameters, which makes it far from the intricacies of the tuning
process. The proposed algorithm is compared with cooperative co-evolution with
delta grouping on 20 benchmark functions with dimension 1000. Also, we
conducted some experiments on CEC-2017, D=10, 30, 50, and 100 to investigate
the behavior of SOO algorithm in lower dimensions. The results show that SOO is
beneficial not only in large-scale problems, but also in low-scale optimization
problems.

  Many problems in science and engineering can be formulated as optimization
problems, subject to complex nonlinear constraints. The solutions of highly
nonlinear problems usually require sophisticated optimization algorithms, and
traditional algorithms may struggle to deal with such problems. A current trend
is to use nature-inspired algorithms due to their flexibility and
effectiveness. However, there are some key issues concerning nature-inspired
computation and swarm intelligence. This paper provides an in-depth review of
some recent nature-inspired algorithms with the emphasis on their search
mechanisms and mathematical foundations. Some challenging issues are identified
and five open problems are highlighted, concerning the analysis of algorithmic
convergence and stability, parameter tuning, mathematical framework, role of
benchmarking and scalability. These problems are discussed with the directions
for future research.

Title: Influence of Initialization on the Performance of Metaheuristic

\\
  All metaheuristic optimization algorithms require some initialization, and
the initialization for such optimizers is usually carried out randomly.
However, initialization can have some significant influence on the performance
of such algorithms. This paper presents a systematic comparison of 22 different
initialization methods on the convergence and accuracy of five optimizers:
differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), cuckoo search
(CS), artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). We have
used 19 different test functions with different properties and modalities to
compare the possible effects of initialization, population sizes and the
numbers of iterations. Rigorous statistical ranking tests indicate that 43.37\%
of the functions using the DE algorithm show significant differences for
different initialization methods, while 73.68\% of the functions using both PSO
and CS algorithms are significantly affected by different initialization
methods. The simulations show that DE is less sensitive to initialization,
while both PSO and CS are more sensitive to initialization. In addition, under
the condition of the same maximum number of function evaluations (FEs), the
population size can also have a strong effect. Particle swarm optimization
usually requires a larger population, while the cuckoo search needs only a
small population size. Differential evolution depends more heavily on the
number of iterations, a relatively small population with more iterations can
lead to better results. Furthermore, ABC is more sensitive to initialization,
while such initialization has little effect on GA. Some probability
distributions such as the beta distribution, exponential distribution and
Rayleigh distribution can usually lead to better performance. The implications
of this study and further research topics are also discussed in detail.

Title: Real-World Airline Crew Pairing Optimization: Customized Genetic
  Algorithm versus Column Generation Method
Authors: Divyam Aggarwal, Dhish Kumar Saxena, Thomas Back, Michael Emmerich
Categories: cs.NE math.OC
Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Airline crew cost is the second-largest operating cost component and its
marginal improvement may translate to millions of dollars annually. Further,
it's highly constrained-combinatorial nature brings-in high impact research and
commercial value. The airline crew pairing optimization problem (CPOP) is aimed
at generating a set of crew pairings, covering all flights from its timetable,
with minimum cost, while satisfying multiple legality constraints laid by
federations, etc. Depending upon CPOP's scale, several Genetic Algorithm and
Column Generation based approaches have been proposed in the literature.
However, these approaches have been validated either on small-scale flight
datasets (a handful of pairings) or for smaller airlines (operating-in
low-demand regions) such as Turkish Airlines, etc. Their search-efficiency gets
impaired drastically when scaled to the networks of bigger airlines. The
contributions of this paper relate to the proposition of a customized genetic
algorithm, with improved initialization and genetic operators, developed by
exploiting the domain-knowledge; and its comparison with a column generation
based large-scale optimizer (developed by authors). To demonstrate the utility
of the above-cited contributions, a real-world test-case (839 flights),
provided by GE Aviation, is used which has been extracted from the networks of
larger airlines (operating up to 33000 monthly flights in the US).

Title: An Online Learning Based Path Selection for Multipath Video Telephony
  Service in Overlay
Authors: Songyang Zhang
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Even real time video telephony services have been pervasively applied,
providing satisfactory quality of experience to users is still a challenge task
especially in wireless networks. Multipath transmission is a promising solution
to improve video quality by aggregating bandwidth. In existing multipath
transmission solutions, sender concurrently splits traffic on default routing
paths and has no flexibility to select paths. When default paths fall into
severe congestion and the available bandwidth decreases, sender has to decrease
video quality by reducing resolution or encoding bitrate. Deploying relay
servers in current infrastructure to form overlay network provides path
diversity. An online learning approach based on multi-armed bandits is applied
for path selection to harvest maximum profit. Further, a congestion control
algorithm adapted from BBR is implemented to probe bandwidth and to avoid link
congestion. To maintain throughput stability and fairness, a smaller probe up
gain value is used and the cycle length in bandwidth probe phase is randomized.
To reduce delay, the inflight packets will be reduced to match with the
estimated bandwidth delay product in the probe down phase. Experiments are
conducted to verify the effectiveness the proposed solution to improve
throughput and quality in video communication service.

  We develop an edge-assisted object recognition system with the aim of
studying the system-level trade-offs between end-to-end latency and object
recognition accuracy. We focus on developing techniques that optimize the
transmission delay of the system and demonstrate the effect of image encoding
rate and neural network size on these two performance metrics. We explore
optimal trade-offs between these metrics by measuring the performance of our
real time object recognition application. Our measurements reveal hitherto
unknown parameter effects and sharp trade-offs, hence paving the road for
optimizing this key service. Finally, we formulate two optimization problems
using our measurement-based models and following a Pareto analysis we find that
careful tuning of the system operation yields at least 33% better performance
for real time conditions, over the standard transmission method.

\\
  A large number of emerging IoT applications rely on machine learning routines
for analyzing data. Executing such tasks at the user devices improves response
time and economizes network resources. However, due to power and computing
limitations, the devices often cannot support such resource-intensive routines
and fail to accurately execute the analytics. In this work, we propose to
improve the performance of analytics by leveraging edge infrastructure. We
devise an algorithm that enables the IoT devices to execute their routines
locally; and then outsource them to cloudlet servers, only if they predict they
will gain a significant performance improvement. It uses an approximate dual
subgradient method, making minimal assumptions about the statistical properties
of the system's parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that our proposed
algorithm can intelligently leverage the cloudlet, adapting to the service
requirements.

Title: Error Correction with Systematic RLNC in Multi-Channel THz Communication
  Systems
Authors: Cao Vien Phung, Anna Engelmann and Admela Jukan
Categories: cs.NI cs.DC eess.SP
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures
\\
  The terahertz (THz) frequency band (0.3-10THz) has the advantage of large
available bandwidth and is a candidate to satisfy the ever increasing mobile
traffic in wireless communications. However, the THz channels are often
absorbed by molecules in the atmosphere, which can decrease the signal quality
resulting in high bit error rate of received data. In this paper, we study the
usage of systematic random linear network coding (sRLNC) for error correction
in generic THz systems with with 2N parallel channels, whereby N main
high-bitrate channels are used in parallel with N auxiliary channels with lower
bit rate. The idea behind this approach is to use coded low-bit rate channels
to carry redundant information from high-bit rate channels, and thus compensate
for errors in THz transmission. The analytical results evaluate and compare the
different scenarios of the THz system in term of the amount of coding
redundancy, a code rate, transmission rate of auxiliary channels, the number of
THz channels, the modulation format and transmission distance as required
system configurations for a fault tolerant THz transmission.

\\
  Online social networks (OSNs) are emerging as the most popular mainstream
platform for content cascade diffusion. In order to provide satisfactory
quality of experience (QoE) for users in OSNs, much research dedicates to
proactive content placement by using the propagation pattern, user's personal
profiles and social relationships in open social network scenarios (e.g.,
Twitter and Weibo). In this paper, we take a new direction of popularity-aware
content placement in a closed social network (e.g., WeChat Moment) where user's
privacy is highly enhanced. We propose a novel data-driven holistic deep
learning framework, namely DeepCP, for joint diffusion-aware cascade prediction
and autonomous content placement without utilizing users' personal and social
information. We first devise a time-window LSTM model for content popularity
prediction and cascade geo-distribution estimation. Accordingly, we further
propose a novel autonomous content placement mechanism CP-GAN which adopts the
generative adversarial network (GAN) for agile placement decision making to
reduce the content access latency and enhance users' QoE. We conduct extensive
experiments using cascade diffusion traces in WeChat Moment (WM). Evaluation
results corroborate that the proposed DeepCP framework can predict the content
popularity with a high accuracy, generate efficient placement decision in a
real-time manner, and achieve significant content access latency reduction over
existing schemes.

\\
  IEEE 802.11p is one of the key technologies that enable Dedicated Short-Range
Communications (DSRC) in intelligent transportation system (ITS) for safety on
the road. The main challenge in vehicular communication is the large amount of
data to be processed. As vehicle density and velocity increases, the data to be
transmitted also increases. We proposed a protocol that reduces the number of
messages transmitted at a vehicle according to the level of danger that the
vehicle experiences. The proposed protocol measures inter-vehicle distance, as
the representative of the danger of a vehicle, to determine the priority for
transmission. Our results show that this prioritization of transmissions
directly reduces the number of transmitters at a time, and hence results in
higher performance in terms of key metrics--i.e., PDR, throughput, delay,
probabilities of channel busy and collision.

Title: Engaging Users through Social Media in Public Libraries
Authors: Hongbo Zou, Hsuanwei Michelle Chen and Sharmistha Dey
Categories: cs.OH cs.HC cs.LG cs.SI
Comments: 11 pages
\\
  The participatory library is an emerging concept which refers to the idea
that an integrated library system must allow users to take part in core
functions of the library rather than engaging on the periphery. To embrace the
participatory idea, libraries have employed many technologies, such as social
media to help them build participatory services and engage users. To help
librarians understand the impact of emerging technologies on a participatory
service building, this paper takes social media as an example to explore how to
use different engagement strategies that social media provides to engage more
users. This paper provides three major contributions to the library system. The
libraries can use the resultant engagement strategies to engage its users.
Additionally, the best-fit strategy can be inferred and designed based on the
preferences of users. Lastly, the preferences of users can be understood based
on data analysis of social media. Three such contributions put together to
fully address the proposed research question of how to use different engagement
strategies on social media to build participatory library services and better
engage more users visiting the library?

Title: Towards Green Computing: A Survey of Performance and Energy Efficiency
  of Different Platforms using OpenCL
Authors: Philip Heinisch, Katharina Ostaszewski, Hendrik Ranocha
Categories: cs.PF cs.DC
\\
  When considering different hardware platforms, not just the time-to-solution
can be of importance but also the energy necessary to reach it. This is not
only the case with battery powered and mobile devices but also with
high-performance parallel cluster systems due to financial and practical limits
on power consumption and cooling. Recent developments in hard- and software
have given programmers the ability to run the same code on a range of different
devices giving rise to the concept of heterogeneous computing. Many of these
devices are optimized for certain types of applications. To showcase the
differences and give a basic outlook on the applicability of different

used to compare both time- and energy-to-solution. A large set of devices
ranging from ARM processors to server CPUs and consumer and enterprise level
GPUs has been used with different benchmarking testcases taken from applied
research applications. While the results show the overall advantages of GPUs in
terms of both runtime and energy efficiency compared to CPUs, ARM devices show

also highlights how OpenCL enables the use of the same codebase on many
different systems and hardware platforms without specific code adaptations.

Title: Code Obfuscation for the C/C++ Language
Authors: Dominik Picheta
Categories: cs.PL
Comments: Document also available in https://picheta.me/c_cpp_obfuscator.pdf
\\
  Obfuscation is the action of making something unintelligible. In software
development, this action can be applied to source code or binary applications.
The aim of this dissertation was to implement a tool for the obfuscation of C
and C++ source code. The motivation was to allow proprietary code to be
distributed to third-parties without risking a recreation of the intellectual
property within it. While many obfuscators exist, they seldom focus on software
that is distributed in source code form. This dissertation presents the
challenges and successes that arose during the development of a C and C++
source code obfuscator using the Nim programming language.

Title: Why You Cannot (Yet) Write an "Interval Arithmetic" Library in Common
  Lisp
Authors: Marco Antoniotti
Categories: cs.PL
Comments: 11 pages, paper submitted to the European Lisp Symposium 2020,
  Zurich, CH
ACM-class: D.3.3
\\
  "Interval Arithmetic" (IA) appears to be a useful numerical tool to have at
hand in several applications. Alas, the current IA descriptions and proposed
standards are always formulated in terms of the IEEE-754 standard, and the
status of IEEE-754 compliance of most Common Lisp implementations is not up to
par. A solution would be for Common Lisp implementations to adhere to the
Language Independent Arithmetic} (LIA) IEC standard, which includes IEEE/754.
While the LIA standard provides a set of proposed bindings for Common Lisp, the
format and depth of the specification documents is not readily usable by a
Common Lisp programmer, should an implementation decide to comply with the
provisions. Moreover, much latitude is left to each implementation to provide
the LIA "environmental" setup. It would be most beneficial if more precision
were agreed upon by the Common Lisp community about how to provide LIA
compliance in the implementations. In that case, a new set of documentation or
manuals in the style of the HyperSpec could be provided, for the benefit of the
Common Lisp programmer.

Title: Cross-tier web programming for curated databases: A case study
Authors: Simon Fowler, Simon D. Harding, Joanna Sharman, and James Cheney
Categories: cs.PL cs.DL
Comments: Conference version presented at the International Digital Curation
  Conference (IDCC'20)
\\
  Curated databases have become important sources of information across
scientific disciplines, and due to the manual work of experts, often become
important reference works. Features such as provenance tracking, archiving, and
data citation are widely regarded as important features for curated databases,
but implementing such features is challenging, and small database projects
often lack the resources to do so. A scientific database application is not
just the database itself, but also an ecosystem of web applications to display
the data, and applications supporting data curation. Supporting advanced
curation features requires changing all of these components, and there is
currently no way to provide such capabilities in a reusable way. Cross-tier
programming languages have been proposed to simplify the creation of web
applications, where developers write an application in a single, uniform
language. Consequently, database queries and updates can be written in the same
language as the rest of the program, and at least in principle, it should be
possible to provide curation features reusably via program transformations. As
a first step, it is important to establish that realistic curated databases can
be implemented in a cross-tier programming language. In this paper, we describe
such a case study: reimplementing the web frontend of a real-world scientific
database, the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (GtoPdb), in the Links
programming language. We show how features such as language-integrated query
simplify the development process, and rule out common errors. We show that the
Links implementation performs fewer database queries, while the time needed to
handle the queries is comparable to the Java version. While there is some
overhead to using Links because of its comparative immaturity compared to Java,
the Links version is viable as a proof-of-concept case study.

Title: Modeling the Invariance of Virtual Pointers in LLVM
Authors: Piotr Padlewski, Krzysztof Pszeniczny and Richard Smith
Categories: cs.PL cs.PF
Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures
ACM-class: D.3.4
\\
  Devirtualization is a compiler optimization that replaces indirect (virtual)
function calls with direct calls. It is particularly effective in
object-oriented languages, such as Java or C++, in which virtual methods are
typically abundant.
  We present a novel abstract model to express the lifetimes of C++ dynamic
objects and invariance of virtual table pointers in the LLVM intermediate
representation. The model and the corresponding implementation in Clang and
LLVM enable full devirtualization of virtual calls whenever the dynamic type is
statically known and elimination of redundant virtual table loads in other
cases.
  Due to the complexity of C++, this has not been achieved by any other C++
compiler so far. Although our model was designed for C++, it is also applicable
to other languages that use virtual dispatch. Our benchmarks show an average of
0.8% performance improvement on real-world C++ programs, with more than 30%
speedup in some cases. The implementation is already a part of the upstream
LLVM/Clang and can be enabled with the -fstrict-vtable-pointers flag.

\\
  Aerial vehicles with collision resilience can operate with more confidence in
environments with obstacles that are hard to detect and avoid. This paper
presents the methodology used to design a collision resilient aerial vehicle
with icosahedron tensegrity structure. A simplified stress analysis of the
tensegrity frame under impact forces is performed to guide the selection of its
components. In addition, an autonomous controller is presented to reorient the
vehicle from an arbitrary orientation on the ground to help it take off.
Experiments show that the vehicle can successfully reorient itself after
landing upside-down and can survive collisions with speed up to 6.5m/s.

  Planning in unstructured environments is challenging -- it relies on sensing,
perception, scene reconstruction, and reasoning about various uncertainties. We
propose DeepSemanticHPPC, a novel uncertainty-aware hypothesis-based planner
for unstructured environments. Our algorithmic pipeline consists of: a deep
Bayesian neural network which segments surfaces with uncertainty estimates; a
flexible point cloud scene representation; a next-best-view planner which
minimizes the uncertainty of scene semantics using sparse visual measurements;
and a hypothesis-based path planner that proposes multiple kinematically
feasible paths with evolving safety confidences given next-best-view
measurements. Our pipeline iteratively decreases semantic uncertainty along
planned paths, filtering out unsafe paths with high confidence. We show that
our framework plans safe paths in real-world environments where existing path
planners typically fail.

Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  Robotic automation in surgery requires precise tracking of surgical tools and
mapping of deformable tissue. Previous works on surgical perception frameworks
require significant effort in developing features for surgical tool and tissue
tracking. In this work, we overcome the challenge by exploiting deep learning
methods for surgical perception. We integrated deep neural networks, capable of
efficient feature extraction, into the tissue reconstruction and instrument
pose estimation processes. By leveraging transfer learning, the deep learning
based approach requires minimal training data and reduced feature engineering
efforts to fully perceive a surgical scene. The framework was tested on three
publicly available datasets, which use the da Vinci Surgical System, for
comprehensive analysis. Experimental results show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art tracking performance in a surgical environment by utilizing
deep learning for feature extraction.

Title: Learn and Transfer Knowledge of Preferred Assistance Strategies in
  Semi-autonomous Telemanipulation
Authors: Lingfeng Tao, Michael Bowman, Xu Zhou, Xiaoli Zhang
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.HC
\\
  Increasing the autonomy level of a robot hand to accomplish remote object
manipulation tasks faster and easier is a new and promising topic in
teleoperation. Such semi-autonomous telemanipulation, however, is very
challenging due to the physical discrepancy between the human hand and the
robot hand, along with the fine motion constraints required for the
manipulation task. To overcome these challenges, the robot needs to learn how
to assist the human operator in a preferred/intuitive way, which must provide
effective assistance that the operator needs yet still accommodate human
inputs, so the operator feels in control of the system (i.e., not
counter-intuitive to the operator). Toward this goal, we develop novel
data-driven approaches to stably learn what assistance is preferred from high
data variance caused by the ambiguous nature of human operators. To avoid an
extensive robot-specific training process, methods to transfer this assistance
knowledge between different robot hands are discussed. Experiments were
conducted to telemanipulate a cup for three principal tasks: usage, move, and
handover by remotely controlling a 3-finger gripper and 2-finger gripper.
Results demonstrated that the proposed model effectively learned the knowledge
of preferred assistance, and knowledge transfer between robots allows this
semi-autonomous telemanipulation strategy to be scaled up with less training
efforts.

\\
  Many manipulation tasks, such as placement or within-hand manipulation,
require the object's pose relative to a robot hand. The task is difficult when
the hand significantly occludes the object. It is especially hard for adaptive
hands, for which it is not easy to detect the finger's configuration. In
addition, RGB-only approaches face issues with texture-less objects or when the
hand and the object look similar. This paper presents a depth-based framework,
which aims for robust pose estimation and short response times. The approach
detects the adaptive hand's state via efficient parallel search given the
highest overlap between the hand's model and the point cloud. The hand's point
cloud is pruned and robust global registration is performed to generate object
pose hypotheses, which are clustered. False hypotheses are pruned via physical
reasoning. The remaining poses' quality is evaluated given agreement with
observed data. Extensive evaluation on synthetic and real data demonstrates the
accuracy and computational efficiency of the framework when applied on
challenging, highly-occluded scenarios for different object types. An ablation
study identifies how the framework's components help in performance. This work
also provides a dataset for in-hand 6D object pose estimation. Code and dataset
are available at: https://github.com/wenbowen123/icra20-hand-object-pose

\\
  Planning smooth and energy-efficient motions for wheeled mobile robots is a
central task for applications ranging from autonomous driving to service and
intralogistic robotics. Over the past decades, a wide variety of motion
planners, steer functions and path-improvement techniques have been proposed
for such non-holonomic systems. With the objective of comparing this large
assortment of state-of-the-art motion-planning techniques, we introduce a novel
open-source motion-planning benchmark for wheeled mobile robots, whose
scenarios resemble real-world applications (such as navigating warehouses,
moving in cluttered cities or parking), and propose metrics for planning
efficiency and path quality. Our benchmark is easy to use and extend, and thus
allows practitioners and researchers to evaluate new motion-planning
algorithms, scenarios and metrics easily. We use our benchmark to highlight the
strengths and weaknesses of several common state-of-the-art motion planners and
provide recommendations on when they should be used.

\\
  We describe a fluidic actuator design that replaces the sealed chamber of a
hydraulic cylinder using a soft actuator to provide compliant linear
compression with a large force ($\geq$100 N) at a low operation pressure
($\leq$50 kPa) for a lower-limb wearable. The external shells constrain the
deformation of the soft actuator under fluidic pressurization. This enables us
to use latex party balloons as a quick and cheap alternative for initial design
investigation. We found that the forces exerted by the soft material
deformation are well-captured by the rigid shells, removing the necessity of
explicitly describing the mechanics of the soft material deformation and its
interaction with the rigid structure. One can use the classical Force, Pressure
and Area formula factored with an efficiency parameter to characterize the
actuator performance. Furthermore, we proposed an engineering design of the
hybrid actuator using a customized soft actuator placed inside a single shell
cavity with an open end for the compression force. Our results show that the
proposed design can generate a very high force within a short stroke distance.
At a low input pressure of 50 kPa, the exerted block force is approaching only
about 3\% less than the classical equation predicted. The actuator is fitted to
a new gait augmentation design for correcting knee alignment, which is usually
challenging for actuators made from the purely soft material.

  This chapter is devoted to the study of complexity of complete (or exact)
algorithms for robot motion planning. The term ``complete'' indicates that an
approach is guaranteed to find the correct solution (a motion path or
trajectory in our setting), or to report that none exists otherwise (in case
that for instance, no feasible path exists). Complexity theory is a fundamental
tool in computer science for analyzing the performance of algorithms, in terms
of the amount of resources they require. (While complexity can express
different quantities such as space and communication effort, our focus in this
chapter is on time complexity.) Moreover, complexity theory helps to identify
``hard'' problems which require an excessive amount of computation time to
solve. In the context of motion planning, complexity theory can come in handy
in various ways, some of which are illustrated here.

Title: An Intent-based Task-aware Shared Control Framework for Intuitive Object
  Telemanipulation
Authors: Michael Bowman and Xiaoli Zhang
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Shared control in teleoperation for providing robot assistance to accomplish
object manipulation is a new challenging problem. This has unique challenges,
on top of teleoperation challenges in general, due to difficulties of physical
discrepancy between human hands and robot hands as well as the fine motion
constraints to constitute task success. In this work we are interested in the
scientific underpinnings of robot assistance for telemanipulation by defining
an arbitration strategy for a physically discrepant robot hand structure which
flexibly reproduce actions that accommodate the operator's motion inputs as
well as autonomously regulate the actions to compensate task constraints that
facilitate subsequent manipulation. The overall objective is to present a
control strategy where the focus is on generating poses which are better suited
for human perception of successful teleoperated object manipulation and feeling
of being in control of the robot, rather than developing objective stable grasp
configurations for task success. Identifying the commonalities between human
and robot feature sets enable the accommodation for the arbitration framework
to indicate and appear to intuitively follow the user. Additionally, it is
imperative to understand how users perceive good arbitration in object
telemanipulation. We have also conducted a user study to analyze the effect of
factors including task predictability, perceived following, and user
preference.

Title: Online Dynamic Motion Planning and Control for Wheeled Biped Robots
Authors: Songyan Xin and Sethu Vijayakumar
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheeled robots when driving
on suitably flat surfaces and versatility of legged robots when stepping over
or around obstacles. This paper introduces a planning and control framework to
realise dynamic locomotion for wheeled biped robots. We propose the Cart-Linear
Inverted Pendulum Model (Cart-LIPM) as a template model for the rolling motion
and the under-actuated LIPM for contact changes while walking. The generated
motion is then tracked by an inverse dynamic whole-body controller which
coordinates all joints, including the wheels. The framework has a hierarchical
structure and is implemented in a model predictive control (MPC) fashion. To
validate the proposed approach for hybrid motion generation, two scenarios
involving different types of obstacles are designed in simulation. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time that such online dynamic hybrid
locomotion has been demonstrated on wheeled biped robots.

Title: Online Self-Supervised Learning for Object Picking: Detecting Optimum
  Grasping Position using a Metric Learning Approach
Authors: Kanata Suzuki, Yasuto Yokota, Yuzi Kanazawa, Tomoyoshi Takebayashi
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Self-supervised learning methods are attractive candidates for automatic
object picking. However, the trial samples lack the complete ground truth
because the observable parts of the agent are limited. That is, the information
contained in the trial samples is often insufficient to learn the specific
grasping position of each object. Consequently, the training falls into a local
solution, and the grasp positions learned by the robot are independent of the
state of the object. In this study, the optimal grasping position of an
individual object is determined from the grasping score, defined as the
distance in the feature space obtained using metric learning. The closeness of
the solution to the pre-designed optimal grasping position was evaluated in
trials. The proposed method incorporates two types of feedback control: one
feedback enlarges the grasping score when the grasping position approaches the
optimum; the other reduces the negative feedback of the potential grasping
positions among the grasping candidates. The proposed online self-supervised
learning method employs two deep neural networks. : SSD that detects the
grasping position of an object, and Siamese networks (SNs) that evaluate the
trial sample using the similarity of two input data in the feature space. Our
method embeds the relation of each grasping position as feature vectors by
training the trial samples and a few pre-samples indicating the optimum
grasping position. By incorporating the grasping score based on the feature
space of SNs into the SSD training process, the method preferentially trains
the optimum grasping position. In the experiment, the proposed method achieved
a higher success rate than the baseline method using simple teaching signals.
And the grasping scores in the feature space of the SNs accurately represented
the grasping positions of the objects.

  While robots can learn models to solve many manipulation tasks from raw
visual input, they cannot usually use these models to solve new problems. On
the other hand, symbolic planning methods such as STRIPS have long been able to
solve new problems given only a domain definition and a symbolic goal, but
these approaches often struggle on the real world robotic tasks due to the
challenges of grounding these symbols from sensor data in a
partially-observable world. We propose Deep Planning Domain Learning (DPDL), an
approach that combines the strengths of both methods to learn a hierarchical
model. DPDL learns a high-level model which predicts values for a large set of
logical predicates consisting of the current symbolic world state, and
separately learns a low-level policy which translates symbolic operators into
executable actions on the robot. This allows us to perform complex, multi-step
tasks even when the robot has not been explicitly trained on them. We show our
method on manipulation tasks in a photorealistic kitchen scenario.

  University, USA
\\
  The vision of creating entirely-soft robots capable of performing complex
tasks will be accomplished only when the controllers required for autonomous
operation can be fully implemented on soft components. Despite recent advances
in compliant fluidic circuitry for mechanical signal processing, the
applicability of this technology for soft robot control has been limited by
complicated fabrication and tuning processes, and also the need for external
signals such as clocks and digital references. We propose a method to develop
pneumatic soft robots in which coordinated interactions between multiple
actuators are performed using controllers implemented on components
distributedly embedded in the soft structures of the system. In this approach,
the notions of binary and multi-valued actuator logic states are introduced. In
this way, the physical local dynamical couplings between the analog states of
the actuators, established using soft valves of a new type, can be thought of
as logic-gate-based mappings acting on discretized representations of the
actuator states. Consequently, techniques for digital logic design can be
applied to derive the architectures of the localized mechanical couplings that
intelligently coordinate the oscillation patterns of the actuator responses.
For the purposes of controller tuning, the soft valves are conceived so that
their main physical parameters can be adjusted from the exterior of the robot
through simple geometrical changes of the corresponding structural elements. To
demonstrate the proposed approach, we present the development of a six-state
locomoting soft robot.

  Existing deep learning based visual servoing approaches regress the relative

training data and sometimes fine-tuning for adaptation to a novel scene.
Furthermore, current approaches do not consider underlying geometry of the
scene and rely on direct estimation of camera pose. Thus, inaccuracies in
prediction of the camera pose, especially for distant goals, lead to a
degradation in the servoing performance. In this paper, we propose a two-fold
solution: (i) We consider optical flow as our visual features, which are
predicted using a deep neural network. (ii) These flow features are then
systematically integrated with depth estimates provided by another neural
network using interaction matrix. We further present an extensive benchmark in
a photo-realistic 3D simulation across diverse scenes to study the convergence
and generalisation of visual servoing approaches. We show convergence for over
3m and 40 degrees while maintaining precise positioning of under 2cm and 1
degree on our challenging benchmark where the existing approaches that are
unable to converge for majority of scenarios for over 1.5m and 20 degrees.
Furthermore, we also evaluate our approach for a real scenario on an aerial
robot. Our approach generalizes to novel scenarios producing precise and robust
servoing performance for 6 degrees of freedom positioning tasks with even large
camera transformations without any retraining or fine-tuning.

Title: Deep Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Object Disentangling
Authors: Melvin Laux, Oleg Arenz, Jan Peters, Joni Pajarinen

Comments: 8 pages, submitted to IROS 2020
\\
  Deep learning in combination with improved training techniques and high
computational power has led to recent advances in the field of reinforcement
learning (RL) and to successful robotic RL applications such as in-hand
manipulation. However, most robotic RL relies on a well known initial state
distribution. In real-world tasks, this information is however often not
available. For example, when disentangling waste objects the actual position of
the robot w.r.t.\ the objects may not match the positions the RL policy was
trained for. To solve this problem, we present a novel adversarial
reinforcement learning (ARL) framework. The ARL framework utilizes an
adversary, which is trained to steer the original agent, the protagonist, to
challenging states. We train the protagonist and the adversary jointly to allow
them to adapt to the changing policy of their opponent. We show that our method
can generalize from training to test scenarios by training an end-to-end system
for robot control to solve a challenging object disentangling task. Experiments
with a KUKA LBR+ 7-DOF robot arm show that our approach outperforms the
baseline method in disentangling when starting from different initial states
than provided during training.

Title: Bayesian Particles on Cyclic Graphs
Authors: Ana Pervan and Todd Murphey
Categories: cs.RO eess.SP
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  We consider the problem of designing synthetic cells to achieve a complex
goal (e.g., mimicking the immune system by seeking invaders) in a complex
environment (e.g., the circulatory system), where they might have to change
their control policy, communicate with each other, and deal with stochasticity
including false positives and negatives---all with minimal capabilities and
only a few bits of memory.
  We simulate the immune response using cyclic, maze-like environments and use
targets at unknown locations to represent invading cells. Using only a few bits
of memory, the synthetic cells are programmed to perform a reinforcement
learning-type algorithm with which they update their control policy based on
randomized encounters with other cells. As the synthetic cells work together to
find the target, their interactions as an ensemble function as a physical
implementation of a Bayesian update. That is, the particles act as a particle
filter.
  This result provides formal properties about the behavior of the synthetic
cell ensemble that can be used to ensure robustness and safety. This method of
simplified reinforcement learning is evaluated in simulations, and applied to
an actual model of the human circulatory system.

Title: Task-Motion Planning for Safe and Efficient Urban Driving
Authors: Yan Ding, Xiaohan Zhang, Xingyue Zhan, Shiqi Zhang
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Autonomous vehicles need to plan at the task level to compute a sequence of
symbolic actions, such as merging left and turning right, to fulfill people's
service requests, where efficiency is the main concern. At the same time, the
vehicles must compute continuous trajectories to perform actions at the motion
level, where safety is the most important. Task-motion planning in autonomous
driving faces the problem of maximizing task-level efficiency while ensuring
motion-level safety. To this end, we develop algorithm Task-Motion Planning for
Urban Driving (TMPUD) that, for the first time, enables the task and motion
planners to communicate about the safety level of driving behaviors. TMPUD has
been evaluated using a realistic urban driving simulation platform. Results
suggest that TMPUD performs significantly better than competitive baselines
from the literature in efficiency, while ensuring the safety of driving
behaviors.

Title: A Mathematical Framework for IMU Error Propagation with Applications to
  Preintegration
Authors: Axell Barrau and Silvere Bonnabel
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: To appear in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  (ICRA) 2020
\\
  To fuse information from inertial measurement units (IMU) with other sensors
one needs an accurate model for IMU error propagation in terms of position,
velocity and orientation, a triplet we call extended pose. In this paper we
leverage a nontrivial result, namely log-linearity of inertial navigation
equations based on the recently introduced Lie group $SE_2(3)$, to transpose
the recent methodology of Barfoot and Furgale for associating uncertainty with
poses (position, orientation) of $SE(3)$ when using noisy wheel speeds, to the
case of extended poses (position, velocity, orientation) of $SE_2(3)$ when
using noisy IMUs. Besides, our approach to extended poses combined with
log-linearity property allows revisiting the theory of preintegration on
manifolds and reaching a further theoretic level in this field. We show exact
preintegration formulas that account for rotating Earth, that is, centrifugal
force and Coriolis effect, may be derived as a byproduct.

Title: Geometry-aware Compensation Scheme for Morphing Drones
Authors: Amedeo Fabris, Kevin Kleber, Davide Falanga, Davide Scaramuzza
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)
  2020
\\
  Morphing multirotors, such as the Foldable Drone , can increase the
versatility of drones employing in-flight-adaptive-morphology. To further
increase precision in their tasks, recent works have investigated stable flight
in asymmetric morphologies mainly leveraging the low-level controller. However,
the aerodynamic effects embedded in multirotors are only analyzed in fixed
shape aerial vehicles and are completely ignored in morphing drones. In this
paper, we investigate the effects of the partial overlap between the propellers
and the main body of a morphing quadrotor. We perform experiments to
characterize such effects and design a morphology-aware control scheme to
account for them. To guarantee the right trade-off between efficiency and
compactness of the vehicle, we propose a simple geometry-aware compensation
scheme based on the results of these experiments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by deploying the compensation scheme on the
Foldable Drone, a quadrotor that can fold its arms around the main body. The
same set of experiments are performed and compared against one another by
activating and deactivating the compensation scheme offline or during the
flight. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work counteracting the
aerodynamic effects of a morphing quadrotor during flight and showing the
effects of partial overlap between a propeller and the central body of the
drone.

Title: Probabilistic Egocentric Motion Correction of Lidar Point Cloud and
  Projection to Camera Images for Moving Platforms
Authors: Mao Shan, Julie Stephany Berrio, Stewart Worrall, Eduardo Nebot
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ITSC 2020 for review
ACM-class: I.4.0
\\
  The fusion of sensor data from heterogeneous sensors is crucial for robust
perception in various robotics applications that involve moving platforms, for
instance, autonomous vehicle navigation. In particular, combining camera and
lidar sensors enables the projection of precise range information of the
surrounding environment onto visual images. It also makes it possible to label
each lidar point with visual segmentation/classification results for 3D
mapping, which facilitates a higher level understanding of the scene. The task
is however considered non-trivial due to intrinsic and extrinsic sensor
calibration, and the distortion of lidar points resulting from the ego-motion
of the platform. Despite the existence of many lidar ego-motion correction
methods, the errors in the correction process due to uncertainty in ego-motion
estimation are not possible to remove completely. It is thus essential to
consider the problem a probabilistic process where the ego-motion estimation
uncertainty is modelled and considered consistently. The paper investigates the
probabilistic lidar ego-motion correction and lidar-to-camera projection, where
both the uncertainty in the ego-motion estimation and time jitter in sensory
measurements are incorporated. The proposed approach is validated both in
simulation and using real-world data collected from an electric vehicle
retrofitted with wide-angle cameras and a 16-beam scanning lidar.

Title: Fast Collision Probability Estimation Based on Finite-Dimensional Monte
  Carlo Method
Authors: Zhang Hepeng, Quan Quan
Categories: cs.RO eess.SP
Comments: 26 pages, 8 figures
\\
  The safety concern for unmanned systems, namely the concern for the potential
casualty caused by system abnormalities, has been a bottleneck for their
development, especially in populated areas. Evidently, the collision between
the unmanned system and the obstacles, including both moving and static
objects, accounts for a great proportion of the system abnormalities. The route
planning and corresponding controller are established in order to avoid the
collision, whereas, in the presence of uncertainties, it is possible that the
unmanned system would deviate from the predetermined route and collide with the
obstacles. Therefore, for the safety of unmanned systems, collision probability
estimation and further safety decision are very important. To estimate the
collision probability, the Monte Carlo method could be applied, however, it is
generally rather slow. This paper introduces a fast collision probability
estimation method based on finite-dimensional distribution, whose main idea is
to filter out the sampling points needed and generate the states directly by
samples of finite-dimensional distribution, reducing the estimation time
significantly. Besides, further techniques including the probabilistic
equidistance sampling and dimension reduction, also serve to reduce the
estimation time. The simulation shows that the proposed method reduces over 99%
of the estimation time.

  Planning is an essential topic in the realm of automated driving. Besides
planning algorithms that are widely covered in the literature, planning
requires different software tools for its development, validation, and
execution. This paper presents a survey of such tools including map
representations, communication, traffic rules, open-source planning stacks and
middleware, simulation, and visualization tools as well as benchmarks. We start
by defining the planning task and different supporting tools. Next, we provide
a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art developments and analysis of
relations among them. Finally, we discuss the current gaps and suggest future
research directions.

\\
  In this paper, we present a structured approach of selecting and designing a
set of grippers for an assembly task. Compared to current experience-based
gripper design method, our approach accelerates the design process by
automatically generating a set of initial design options on gripper type and
parameters according to the CAD models of assembly components. We use mesh
segmentation techniques to segment the assembly components and fit the
segmented parts with shape primitives, according to the predefined
correspondence between primitive shape and gripper type, suitable gripper types
and parameters can be selected and extracted from the fitted shape primitives.
Then considering the assembly constraints, applicable gripper types and
parameters can be filtered from the initial options. Among the applicable
gripper configurations, we further minimize the required number of grippers for
performing the assembly task, by exploring the gripper that is able to handle
multiple assembly components during the assembly. Finally, the feasibility of
the designed grippers are experimentally verified by assembling a part of an
industrial product.

Title: Tightly-coupled Fusion of Global Positional Measurements in
  Optimization-based Visual-Inertial Odometry
Authors: Giovanni Cioffi, Davide Scaramuzza
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Motivated by the goal of achieving robust, drift-free pose estimation in
long-term autonomous navigation, in this work we propose a methodology to fuse
global positional information with visual and inertial measurements in a
tightly-coupled nonlinear-optimization-based estimator. Differently from
previous works, which are loosely-coupled, the use of a tightly-coupled
approach allows exploiting the correlations amongst all the measurements. A
sliding window of the most recent system states is estimated by minimizing a
cost function that includes visual re-projection errors, relative inertial
errors, and global positional residuals. We use IMU preintegration to formulate
the inertial residuals and leverage the outcome of such algorithm to
efficiently compute the global position residuals. The experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves accurate and globally consistent
estimates, with negligible increase of the optimization computational cost. Our
method consistently outperforms the loosely-coupled fusion approach. The mean
position error is reduced up to 50% with respect to the loosely-coupled
approach in outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights, where the global
position information is given by noisy GPS measurements. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work where global positional measurements are
tightly fused in an optimization-based visual-inertial odometry algorithm,
leveraging the IMU preintegration method to define the global positional
factors.

Title: Probabilistic Framework for Constrained Manipulations and Task and
  Motion Planning under Uncertainty
Authors: Jung-Su Ha, Danny Driess, Marc Toussaint
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: ICRA 2020
\\
  Logic-Geometric Programming (LGP) is a powerful motion and manipulation
planning framework, which represents hierarchical structure using logic rules
that describe discrete aspects of problems, e.g., touch, grasp, hit, or push,
and solves the resulting smooth trajectory optimization. The expressive power
of logic allows LGP for handling complex, large-scale sequential manipulation
and tool-use planning problems. In this paper, we extend the LGP formulation to
stochastic domains. Based on the control-inference duality, we interpret LGP in
a stochastic domain as fitting a mixture of Gaussians to the posterior path
distribution, where each logic profile defines a single Gaussian path
distribution. The proposed framework enables a robot to prioritize various
interaction modes and to acquire interesting behaviors such as contact
exploitation for uncertainty reduction, eventually providing a composite
control scheme that is reactive to disturbance. The supplementary video can be

Title: SpellBound: Defending Against Package Typosquatting
Authors: Matthew Taylor, Ruturaj K. Vaidya, Drew Davidson, Lorenzo De Carli,
  Vaibhav Rastogi
Categories: cs.SE cs.CR
\\
  Package managers for software repositories based on a single programming
language are very common. Examples include npm (JavaScript), and PyPI (Python).
These tools encourage code reuse, making it trivial for developers to import
external packages. Unfortunately, repositories' size and the ease with which
packages can be published facilitates the practice of typosquatting: the
uploading of a package with name similar to that of a highly popular package,
typically with the aim of capturing some of the popular package's installs.
Typosquatting has serious negative implications, resulting in developers
importing malicious packages, or -- as we show -- code clones which do not
incorporate recent security updates. In order to tackle this problem, we
present SpellBound, a tool for identifying and reporting potentially erroneous
imports to developers. SpellBound implements a novel typosquatting detection
technique, based on an in-depth analysis of npm and PyPI. Our technique
leverages a model of lexical similarity between names, and further incorporates
the notion of package popularity. This approach flags cases where
unknown/scarcely used packages would be installed in place of popular ones with
similar names, before installation occurs. We evaluated SpellBound on both npm
and PyPI, with encouraging results: SpellBound flags typosquatting cases while
generating limited warnings (0.5% of total package installs), and low overhead
(only 2.5% of package install time). Furthermore, SpellBound allowed us to
confirm known cases of typosquatting and discover one high-profile, unknown
case of typosquatting that resulted in a package takedown by the npm security
team.

Title: PUMiner: Mining Security Posts from Developer Question and Answer
  Websites with PU Learning
Authors: Triet H. M. Le, David Hin, Roland Croft, M. Ali Babar
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.IR cs.LG
Comments: Accepted for publication at the 17th Mining Software Repositories
  2020 conference
\\
  Security is an increasing concern in software development. Developer Question
and Answer (Q&A) websites provide a large amount of security discussion.
Existing studies have used human-defined rules to mine security discussions,
but these works still miss many posts, which may lead to an incomplete analysis
of the security practices reported on Q&A websites. Traditional supervised
Machine Learning methods can automate the mining process; however, the required
negative (non-security) class is too expensive to obtain. We propose a novel
learning framework, PUMiner, to automatically mine security posts from Q&A
websites. PUMiner builds a context-aware embedding model to extract features of
the posts, and then develops a two-stage PU model to identify security content
using the labelled Positive and Unlabelled posts. We evaluate PUMiner on more
than 17.2 million posts on Stack Overflow and 52,611 posts on Security
StackExchange. We show that PUMiner is effective with the validation
performance of at least 0.85 across all model configurations. Moreover,
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of PUMiner is 0.906, 0.534 and 0.084
points higher than one-class SVM, positive-similarity filtering, and one-stage
PU models on unseen testing posts, respectively. PUMiner also performs well
with an MCC of 0.745 for scenarios where string matching totally fails. Even
when the ratio of the labelled positive posts to the unlabelled ones is only
1:100, PUMiner still achieves a strong MCC of 0.65, which is 160% better than
fully-supervised learning. Using PUMiner, we provide the largest and up-to-date
security content on Q&A websites for practitioners and researchers.

Title: Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a
  Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation
Authors: Federico Giaimo, Christian Berger

Comments: Paper submitted to the 31st IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium
  (IV2020). 7 pages, 4 figures
\\
  As the automotive industry focuses their efforts more and more towards the
software end of the spectrum, techniques to deliver new software value at a
fast pace are needed. Continuous Experimentation, a practice coming from the
web-based systems world, is one of such techniques. It enables researchers and
developers to use real-world data to verify their hypothesis and steer the
software evolution based on performances and user preferences, reducing the
reliance on simulations and guesswork. Several challenges prevent the verbatim
adoption of this practice on automotive cyber-physical systems, e.g., safety
concerns and computational resources limitations; nonetheless, the automotive
field is starting to take interest in this technique. This work aims at
demonstrating and evaluating a prototypical Continuous Experimentation cycle,
performed on a distributed computational system housed in a commercial truck
tractor that is used in daily operations by a logistic company. The system
comprises computing units and sensors, and is only accessible remotely via a
mobile connection, which is also the only communication channel that can be
used for software deployment and data retrieval. The experimentation process
resulted in the team being able to base software development choices on the
real-world data collected during the experimental procedure. Finally, a set of
previously identified design criteria to enable Continuous Experimentation on
automotive systems was discussed in light of the presented work.

  Context: New software development patterns are emerging aiming at
accelerating the process of delivering value. One is Continuous
Experimentation, which allows to systematically deploy and run instrumented
software variants during development phase in order to collect data from the
field of application. While currently this practice is used on a daily basis on
web-based systems, technical difficulties challenge its adoption in fields
where computational resources are constrained, e.g., cyber-physical systems and
the automotive industry. Objective: To provide an understanding of what is the
state-of-the-art of the Continuous Experimentation practice in the context of
cyber-physical systems, and what is the practitioners' feedback about this
practice. Method: A systematic literature review has been conducted to
investigate the link between the practice and the field of application.
Additionally, an industrial multiple case study is reported. Results: The study
presents the current state-of-the-art regarding Continuous Experimentation in
the field of cyber-physical systems. The current perspective of Continuous
Experimentation in industry is also reported. Conclusions: The field has not
reached maturity yet. More conceptual analyses are found than solution
proposals and the state-of-practice is yet to be achieved. However it is
expected that in time an increasing number of solutions will be proposed and
validated.

Title: Software-testing education: A systematic literature mapping
Authors: Vahid Garousi, Austen Rainer, Per Lauv{\aa}s jr, Andrea Arcuri
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Context: With the rising complexity and scale of software systems, there is
an ever-increasing demand for sophisticated and cost-effective software
testing. To meet such a demand, there is a need for a highly-skilled software
testing work-force (test engineers) in the industry. To address that need, many
university educators worldwide have included software-testing education in
their software engineering (SE) or computer science (CS) programs. Objective:
Our objective in this paper is to summarize the body of experience and
knowledge in the area of software-testing education to benefit the readers
(both educators and researchers) in designing and delivering software testing
courses in university settings, and to also conduct further education research
in this area. Method: To address the above need, we conducted a systematic
literature mapping (SLM) to synthesize what the community of educators have
published on this topic. After compiling a candidate pool of 307 papers, and
applying a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, our final pool included 204
papers published between 1992 and 2019. Results: The topic of software-testing
education is becoming more active, as we can see by the increasing number of
papers. Many pedagogical approaches (how to best teach testing), course-ware,
and specific tools for testing education have been proposed. Many challenges in
testing education and insights on how to overcome those challenges have been
proposed. Conclusion: This paper provides educators and researchers with a
classification of existing studies within software-testing education. We
further synthesize challenges and insights reported when teaching software
testing. The paper also provides a reference ("index") to the vast body of
knowledge and experience on teaching software testing.

\\
  Social networks include millions of users constantly looking for new
relationships for personal or professional purposes. Social network sites
recommend friends based on relationship features and content information. A
significant part of information shared every day is spread in Hashtags. None of
the existing content-based recommender systems uses the semantic of hashtags
while suggesting new friends. Currently, hashtags are considered as strings
without looking at their meanings. Social network sites group together people
sharing exactly the same hashtags and never semantically close ones. We think
that hashtags encapsulate some people interests. In this paper, we propose a
framework showing how a recommender system can benefit from hashtags to enrich
users' profiles. This framework consists of three main components: (1)
constructing user's profile based on shared hashtags, (2) matching method that
computes semantic similarity between profiles, (3) grouping semantically close
users using clustering technics. The proposed framework has been tested on a
Twitter dataset from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection consisting
of 81306 profiles.

  The rapid expansion of social network provides a suitable platform for users
to deliver messages. Through the social network, we can harvest resources and
share messages in a very short time. The developing of social network has
brought us tremendous conveniences. However, nodes that make up the network
have different spreading capability, which are constrained by many factors, and
the topological structure of network is the principal element. In order to
calculate the importance of nodes in network more accurately, this paper
defines the improved H-index centrality (IH) according to the diversity of
neighboring nodes, then uses the cumulative centrality (MC) to take all
neighboring nodes into consideration, and proposes the extended mixing H-index
centrality (EMH). We evaluate the proposed method by
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and monotonicity which are used to
assess accuracy and resolution of the method, respectively. Experimental
results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the existing measures
of identifying nodes in different networks.

  We present an open-source interface for scientists to explore Twitter data
through interactive network visualizations. Combining data collection,
transformation and visualization in one easily accessible framework, the
twitter explorer connects distant and close reading of Twitter data through the
interactive exploration of interaction networks and semantic networks. By
lowering the technological barriers of data-driven research, it aims to attract

Title: Frozen Binomials on the Web: Word Ordering and Language Conventions in
  Online Text
Authors: Katherine Van Koevering, Austin R. Benson, Jon Kleinberg

\\
  There is inherent information captured in the order in which we write words
in a list. The orderings of binomials --- lists of two words separated by `and'
or `or' --- has been studied for more than a century. These binomials are
common across many areas of speech, in both formal and informal text. In the
last century, numerous explanations have been given to describe what order
people use for these binomials, from differences in semantics to differences in
phonology. These rules describe primarily `frozen' binomials that exist in
exactly one ordering and have lacked large-scale trials to determine efficacy.
  Online text provides a unique opportunity to study these lists in the context
of informal text at a very large scale. In this work, we expand the view of
binomials to include a large-scale analysis of both frozen and non-frozen
binomials in a quantitative way. Using this data, we then demonstrate that most
previously proposed rules are ineffective at predicting binomial ordering. By
tracking the order of these binomials across time and communities we are able
to establish additional, unexplored dimensions central to these predictions.
  Expanding beyond the question of individual binomials, we also explore the
global structure of binomials in various communities, establishing a new model
for these lists and analyzing this structure for non-frozen and frozen
binomials. Additionally, novel analysis of trinomials --- lists of length three
--- suggests that none of the binomials analysis applies in these cases.
Finally, we demonstrate how large data sets gleaned from the web can be used in
conjunction with older theories to expand and improve on old questions.

Title: Discovering Strategic Behaviors for Collaborative Content-Production in
  Social Networks

\\
  Some social networks provide explicit mechanisms to allocate social rewards
such as reputation based on user activity, while the mechanism is more opaque
in other networks. Nonetheless, there are always individuals who obtain greater
rewards and reputation than their peers. An intuitive yet important question to
ask is whether these successful users employ strategic behaviors to become
influential. It might appear that the influencers have gamed the system.
However, it remains difficult to conclude the rationality of their actions due
to factors like the combinatorial strategy space, inability to determine
payoffs, and resource limitations faced by individuals. The challenging nature
of this question has drawn attention from both the theory and data mining
communities. Therefore, in this paper, we are motivated to investigate if
resource-limited individuals discover strategic behaviors associated with high
payoffs when producing collaborative or interactive content in social networks.
We propose a novel framework of Dynamic Dual Attention Networks or DDAN which
models content production strategies of users through a generative process,
under the influence of social interactions involved in the process. Extensive
experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our model in modeling user
behavior. We make three strong empirical findings. Different strategies give
rise to different social payoffs, the best performing individuals exhibit
stability in their preference over the discovered strategies, which indicates
the emergence of strategic behavior, and the stability of strategy preference
is correlated with high payoffs.

  Disinformation continues to attract attention due to its increasing threat to
society. Nevertheless, a disinformation-based attack on critical infrastructure
has never been studied to date. Here, we consider traffic networks and focus on
fake information that manipulates drivers' decisions to create congestion. We
study the optimization problem faced by the adversary when choosing which
streets to target to maximize disruption. We prove that finding an optimal
solution is computationally intractable, implying that the adversary has no
choice but to settle for suboptimal heuristics. We analyze one such heuristic,
and compare the cases when targets are spread across the city of Chicago vs.
concentrated in its business district. Surprisingly, the latter results in more
far-reaching disruption, with its impact felt as far as 2 kilometers from the
closest target. Our findings demonstrate that vulnerabilities in critical
infrastructure may arise not only from hardware and software, but also from
behavioral manipulation.

Title: Graph Clustering Via QUBO and Digital Annealing
Authors: Pierre Miasnikof and Seo Hong and Yuri Lawryshyn
Categories: cs.SI cs.DM
Comments: 15 page, 1 figure, 2 subfigures
\\
  This article empirically examines the computational cost of solving a known
hard problem, graph clustering, using novel purpose-built computer hardware. We
express the graph clustering problem as an intra-cluster distance or
dissimilarity minimization problem. We formulate our poblem as a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization problem and employ a novel computer
architecture to obtain a numerical solution. Our starting point is a clustering
formulation from the literature. This formulation is then converted to a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulation. Finally, we use a
novel purpose-built computer architecture to obtain numerical solutions. For
benchmarking purposes, we also compare computational performances to those
obtained using a commercial solver, Gurobi, running on conventional hardware.
Our initial results indicate the purpose-built hardware provides equivalent
solutions to the commercial solver, but in a very small fraction of the time
required.

Title: Local Hypergraph Clustering using Capacity Releasing Diffusion
Authors: Rania Ibrahim and David F. Gleich
Categories: cs.SI
Comments: 18 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Local graph clustering is an important machine learning task that aims to
find a well-connected cluster near a set of seed nodes. Recent results have
revealed that incorporating higher order information significantly enhances the
results of graph clustering techniques. The majority of existing research in
this area focuses on spectral graph theory-based techniques. However, an
alternative perspective on local graph clustering arises from using max-flow
and min-cut on the objectives, which offer distinctly different guarantees. For
instance, a new method called capacity releasing diffusion (CRD) was recently
proposed and shown to preserve local structure around the seeds better than
spectral methods. The method was also the first local clustering technique that
is not subject to the quadratic Cheeger inequality by assuming a good cluster
near the seed nodes. In this paper, we propose a local hypergraph clustering
technique called hypergraph CRD (HG-CRD) by extending the CRD process to
cluster based on higher order patterns, encoded as hyperedges of a hypergraph.
Moreover, we theoretically show that HG-CRD gives results about a quantity
called motif conductance, rather than a biased version used in previous
experiments. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and real world graphs
show that HG-CRD enhances the clustering quality.

\\
  Nowadays, information describing navigation behaviour of internet users are
used in several fields, e-commerce, economy, sociology and data science. Such
information can be extracted from different knowledge bases, including
business-oriented ones. In this paper, we propose a new model for the PageRank,
CheiRank and 2DRank algorithm based on the use of clickstream and pageviews
data in the google matrix construction. We used data from Wikipedia and
analysed links between over 20 million articles from 11 language editions. We
extracted over 1.4 billion source-destination pairs of articles from SQL dumps
and more than 700 million pairs from XML dumps. Additionally, we unified the
pairs based on the analysis of redirect pages and removed all duplicates.
Moreover, we also created a bigger network of Wikipedia articles based on all
considered language versions and obtained multilingual measures. Based on real
data, we discussed the difference between standard PageRank, Cheirank, 2DRank
and measures obtained based on our approach in separate languages and
multilingual network of Wikipedia.

Title: Periodic event-triggered output regulation for linear multi-agent
  systems
Authors: Shiqi Zheng, Peng Shi, Ramesh K. Agarwal, Chee Peng Lim
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This study considers the problem of periodic event-triggered (PET)
cooperative output regulation for a class of linear multi-agent systems. The
advantage of the PET output regulation is that the data transmission and
triggered condition are only needed to be monitored at discrete sampling
instants. It is assumed that only a small number of agents can have access to
the system matrix and states of the leader. Meanwhile, the PET mechanism is
considered not only in the communication between various agents, but also in
the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator transmission channels for
each agent. The above problem set-up will bring some challenges to the
controller design and stability analysis. Based on a novel PET distributed
observer, a PET dynamic output feedback control method is developed for each
follower. Compared with the existing works, our method can naturally exclude
the Zeno behavior, and the inter-event time becomes multiples of the sampling
period. Furthermore, for every follower, the minimum inter-event time can be
determined \textit{a prior}, and computed directly without the knowledge of the
leader information. An example is given to verify and illustrate the
effectiveness of the new design scheme.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Volt-VAR Optimization in Smart
  Distribution Systems
Authors: Ying Zhang, Xinan Wang, Jianhui Wang, Yingchen Zhang
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper develops a model-free volt-VAR optimization (VVO) algorithm via
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) in unbalanced distribution
systems. This method is novel since we cast the VVO problem in unbalanced
distribution networks to an intelligent deep Q-network (DQN) framework, which
avoids solving a specific optimization model directly when facing time-varying
operating conditions of the systems. We consider statuses/ratios of switchable
capacitors, voltage regulators, and smart inverters installed at distributed
generators as the action variables of the DQN agents. A delicately designed
reward function guides these agents to interact with the distribution system,
in the direction of reinforcing voltage regulation and power loss reduction
simultaneously. The forward-backward sweep method for radial three-phase
distribution systems provides accurate power flow results within a few
iterations to the DQN environment. Finally, the proposed multi-objective MADRL
method realizes the dual goals for VVO. We test this algorithm on the
unbalanced IEEE 13-bus and 123-bus systems. Numerical simulations validate the
excellent performance of this method in voltage regulation and power loss
reduction.

Title: Adaptive Testing Scenario Library Generation for Connected and Automated
  Vehicles

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 11 pages, 14 figures
\\
  How to generate testing scenario library for connected and automated vehicles
(CAVs) is a major challenge faced by the industry. In previous studies, to
evaluate maneuver challenge of a scenario, surrogate models (SMs) are often
used without explicit knowledge of the CAV under test. However, performance
dissimilarities between the SM and the CAV under test usually exist, and it can
lead to the generation of suboptimal scenario library. In this paper, an
adaptive testing scenario library generation (ATSLG) method is proposed to
solve this problem. A customized testing scenario library for a specific CAV
model will be generated as the result of the adaptive process. To estimate the
performance dissimilarities and leverage each test of the CAV, Bayesian
optimization techniques are applied with classification-based Gaussian Process
Regression and a new-designed acquisition function. Comparing with a
pre-determined library, a CAV can be tested and evaluated in a more efficient
manner with the customized library. To validate the proposed method, a cut-in
and a highway exit case are studied for safety and functionality evaluation
respectively. For both two cases, the proposed method can further accelerate
the evaluation process by a few orders of magnitudes.

Title: Min-Max Q-Learning for Multi-Player Pursuit-Evasion Games
Authors: Jhanani Selvakumar and Efstathios Bakolas
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  In this paper, we address a pursuit-evasion game involving multiple players
by utilizing tools and techniques from reinforcement learning and matrix game
theory. In particular, we consider the problem of steering an evader to a goal
destination while avoiding capture by multiple pursuers, which is a
high-dimensional and computationally intractable problem in general. In our
proposed approach, we first formulate the multi-agent pursuit-evasion game as a
sequence of discrete matrix games. Next, in order to simplify the solution
process, we transform the high-dimensional state space into a low-dimensional
manifold and the continuous action space into a feature-based space, which is a
discrete abstraction of the original space. Based on these transformed state
and action spaces, we subsequently employ min-max Q-learning, to generate the
entries of the payoff matrix of the game, and subsequently obtain the optimal
action for the evader at each stage. Finally, we present extensive numerical
simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed learning-based evading
strategy in terms of the evader's ability to reach the desired target location
without being captured, as well as computational efficiency.

\\
  This paper presents a novel solution technique for scheduling multi-energy
system (MES) in a commercial urban building to perform price-based demand
response and reduce energy costs. The MES scheduling problem is formulated as a
mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), a non-convex NPhard problem with
uncertainties due to renewable generation and demand. A model predictive
control approach is used to handle the uncertainties and price variations. This
in-turn requires solving a time-coupled multi-time step MINLP during each
time-epoch which is computationally intensive. This investigation proposes an
approach called the Scenario-Based Branch-and-Bound (SB3), a light-weight
solver to reduce the computational complexity. It combines the simplicity of
convex programs with the ability of meta-heuristic techniques to handle complex
nonlinear problems. The performance of the SB3 solver is validated in the
Cleantech building, Singapore and the results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm reduces energy cost by about 17.26% and 22.46% as against solving a
multi-time step heuristic optimization model.

Title: A Modular Small-Signal Analysis Framework for Inverter Penetrated Power
  Grids: Measurement, Assembling, Aggregation, and Stability Assessment
Authors: Lingling Fan and Zhixin Miao
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.DS
\\
  Unprecedented dynamic phenomena may appear in power grids due to higher and
higher penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR), e.g., wind and solar
photovoltaic (PV). A major challenge in dynamic modeling and analysis is that
unlike synchronous generators, whose analytical models are well studied and
known to system planners, inverter models are proprietary information with
black box models provided to utilities. Thus, measurement based
characterization of IBR is a popular approach to find frequency-domain response
of an IBR. The resulting admittances are essentially small-signal
current/voltage relationship in frequency domain. Integrating admittances for
grid dynamic modeling and analysis requires a new framework, namely modular
small-signal analysis framework. In this visionary paper, we examine the
current state-of-the-art of dynamic modeling and analysis of power grids with
IBR, including inverter admittance characterization, the procedure of component
assembling and aggregation, and stability assessment. We push forward a
computing efficient modular modeling and analysis framework via four visions:
(i) efficient and accurate admittance model characterization via model building
and time-domain responses, (ii) accurate assembling of components, (iii)
efficient aggregation, and (iv) stability assessment relying on network
admittance matrices. Challenges of admittance-based modular analysis are
demonstrated using examples and techniques to tackle those challenges are
pointed out in this visionary paper.

Title: Adaptive Extremum Seeking Using Recursive Least Squares
Authors: Nursefa Zengin, Baris Fidan
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 6 pages, 8 figures, will be submitted to L-CSS with CDC Option 2020
\\
  Extremum seeking (ES) optimization approach has been very popular due to its
non-model based analysis and implementation. This approach has been mostly used
with gradient based search algorithms. Since least squares (LS) algorithms are
typically observed to be superior, in terms of convergence speed and robustness
to measurement noises, over gradient algorithms, it is expected that LS based
ES schemes will also provide faster convergence and robustness to sensor
noises. In this paper, with this motivation, a recursive least squares (RLS)
estimation based ES scheme is designed and analysed for application to scalar
parameter and vector parameter static map and dynamic systems. Asymptotic
convergence to the extremum is established for all the cases. Simulation
studies are provided to validate the performance of proposed scheme.

Title: Online inverse reinforcement learning with unknown disturbances

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures
\\
  This paper addresses the problem of online inverse reinforcement learning for
nonlinear systems with modeling uncertainties while in the presence of unknown
disturbances. The developed approach observes state and input trajectories for
an agent and identifies the unknown reward function online. Sub-optimality
introduced in the observed trajectories by the unknown external disturbance is
compensated for using a novel model-based inverse reinforcement learning
approach. The observer estimates the external disturbances and uses the
resulting estimates to learn the dynamic model of the demonstrator. The learned
demonstrator model along with the observed suboptimal trajectories are used to
implement inverse reinforcement learning. Theoretical guarantees are provided
using Lyapunov theory and a simulation example is shown to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Title: Structural Controllability of Undirected Diffusive Networks with
  Vector-Weighted Edges
Authors: Yuan Zhang, Yuanqing Xia, Han Gao, and Guangchen Zhang
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 7 pages,2 figures
\\
  In this paper, controllability of undirected networked systems with
diffusively coupled subsystems is considered, where each subsystem is of
identically fixed general high-order single-input-multi-output dynamics. The
underlying graph of the network topology is vector-weighted. The aim is to find
conditions under which the networked system is structurally controllable, i.e.,
for almost all vector values for interaction links of the network topology, the
corresponding system is controllable. It is proven that, the networked system
is structurally controllable, if and only if each subsystem is controllable and
observable, and the network topology is globally input-reachable. These
conditions are further extended to the cases with multi-input-multi-output
subsystems and matrix-weighted edges, or where both directed and undirected
interaction links exist.

Title: Half-Gain Tuning for Active Disturbance Rejection Control
Authors: Gernot Herbst, Arne-Jens Hempel, Thomas G\"ohrt, Stefan Streif
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  A new tuning rule is introduced for linear active disturbance rejection
control (ADRC), which results in similar closed-loop dynamics as the commonly
employed bandwidth parameterization design, but with lower feedback gains. In
this manner the noise sensitivity of the controller is reduced, paving the way
for using ADRC in more noise-affected applications. It is proved that the
proposed tuning gains, while rooted in the analytical solution of an algebraic
Riccati equation, can always be obtained from a bandwidth parameterization
design by simply halving the gains. This establishes a link between optimal
control and pole placement design.

\\
  Hybrid acoustic-RF systems offer excellent ranging accuracy, yet they
typically come at a power consumption that is too high to meet the energy
constraints of mobile IoT nodes. We combine pulse compression and synchronized
wake-ups to achieve a ranging solution that limits the active time of the nodes
to 1 ms. Hence, an ultra low-power consumption of 9.015 {\mu}W for a single
measurement is achieved. Measurements based on a proof-of-concept hardware
platform show median distance error values below 10 cm. Both simulations and
measurements demonstrate that the accuracy is reduced at low signal-to-noise
ratios and when reflections occur. We introduce three methods that enhance the
distance measurements at a low extra processing power cost. Hence, we validate
in realistic environments that the centimeter accuracy can be obtained within
the energy budget of mobile devices and IoT nodes. The proposed hybrid signal
ranging system can be extended to perform accurate, low-power indoor
positioning.

methods to continuous systems, is a powerful tool for hierarchical control of
complex systems. Finding an approximate simulation relation between the full
"concrete" system and a simplified "abstract" system establishes a bound on the
output error between the two systems, allowing one to design a controller for
the abstract system while formally certifying performance on the concrete
system. However, many real-world control systems are subject to external
disturbances, which are not accounted for in the standard approximate
simulation framework. We present a notion of robust approximate simulation,
which considers external disturbances to the concrete system. We derive output
error bounds for the case of linear systems subject to two types of additive
disturbances: bounded disturbances and a sequence of (unbounded) impulse
disturbances. We demonstrate the need for robust approximate simulation and the
effectiveness of our proposed approach with a simulated robot motion planning
example.

  Sequential Model-based Optimization
Authors: Antonio Candelieri, Bruno Galuzzi, Ilaria Giordani, Francesco Archetti
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  Sequential Model-based Bayesian Optimization has been successful-ly applied
to several application domains, characterized by complex search spaces, such as
Automated Machine Learning and Neural Architecture Search. This paper focuses
on optimal control problems, proposing a Sequential Model-based Bayesian
Optimization framework to learn optimal control strategies. A quite general
formalization of the problem is provided, along with a specific instance
related to optimization of pumping operations in an urban Water Distri-bution
Network. Relevant results on a real-life Water Distribution Network are
reported, comparing different possible choices for the proposed framework.

Title: Staging energy sources to extend flight time of a multirotor UAV
Authors: Karan P. Jain, Jerry Tang, Koushil Sreenath, and Mark W. Mueller

\\
  Energy sources such as batteries do not decrease in mass after consumption,
unlike combustion-based fuels. We present the concept of staging energy
sources, i.e. consuming energy in stages and ejecting used stages, to
progressively reduce the mass of aerial vehicles in-flight which reduces power
consumption, and consequently increases flight time. A flight time vs. energy
storage mass analysis is presented to show the endurance benefit for
multirotors on staging. We consider two specific problems in discrete staging
-- optimal order of staging given a certain number of energy sources, and
optimal partitioning of a given energy storage mass budget into a given number
of stages. We then derive results for two continuously staged cases -- an
internal combustion engine driving propellers, and a rocket engine. A
fundamental flight time limit is seen for the internal combustion engine case,
but not for the rocket engine, suggesting that rocket engines could be a better
choice in certain scenarios. Lastly, we conduct flight experiments on a custom
two-stage battery-powered quadcopter. This quadcopter can eject a battery stage
after consumption in-flight using a custom-designed mechanism, and continue
hovering using the next stage. The experimental flight times are compared with
those predicted from the analysis for our vehicle. The values match well which
validates the presented staging analysis.

Title: Learning Convolutional Sparse Coding on Complex Domain for
  Interferometric Phase Restoration
Authors: Jian Kang, Danfeng Hong, Jialin Liu, Gerald Baier, Naoto Yokoya,

\\
  Interferometric phase restoration has been investigated for decades and most
of the state-of-the-art methods have achieved promising performances for InSAR
phase restoration. These methods generally follow the nonlocal filtering
processing chain aiming at circumventing the staircase effect and preserving
the details of phase variations. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for InSAR phase restoration, i.e. Complex Convolutional Sparse Coding
(ComCSC) and its gradient regularized version. To our best knowledge, this is
the first time that we solve the InSAR phase restoration problem in a
deconvolutional fashion. The proposed methods can not only suppress
interferometric phase noise, but also avoid the staircase effect and preserve
the details. Furthermore, they provide an insight of the elementary phase
components for the interferometric phases. The experimental results on
synthetic and realistic high- and medium-resolution datasets from TerraSAR-X
StripMap and Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath mode, respectively, show
that our method outperforms those previous state-of-the-art methods based on
nonlocal InSAR filters, particularly the state-of-the-art method: InSAR-BM3D.
The source code of this paper will be made publicly available for reproducible
research inside the community.

Title: A Multi-Modal States based Vehicle Descriptor and Dilated Convolutional
  Social Pooling for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction
Authors: Huimin Zhang, Yafei Wang, Junjia Liu, Chengwei Li, Taiyuan Ma,
  Chengliang Yin
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI
\\
  Precise trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is critical for
decision-making of autonomous vehicles and learning-based approaches are well
recognized for the robustness. However, state-of-the-art learning-based methods
ignore 1) the feasibility of the vehicle's multi-modal state information for
prediction and 2) the mutual exclusive relationship between the global traffic
scene receptive fields and the local position resolution when modeling
vehicles' interactions, which may influence prediction accuracy. Therefore, we
propose a vehicle-descriptor based LSTM model with the dilated convolutional
social pooling (VD+DCS-LSTM) to cope with the above issues. First, each
vehicle's multi-modal state information is employed as our model's input and a
new vehicle descriptor encoded by stacked sparse auto-encoders is proposed to
reflect the deep interactive relationships between various states, achieving
the optimal feature extraction and effective use of multi-modal inputs.
Secondly, the LSTM encoder is used to encode the historical sequences composed
of the vehicle descriptor and a novel dilated convolutional social pooling is
proposed to improve modeling vehicles' spatial interactions. Thirdly, the LSTM
decoder is used to predict the probability distribution of future trajectories
based on maneuvers. The validity of the overall model was verified over the
NGSIM US-101 and I-80 datasets and our method outperforms the latest benchmark.

Title: Grid Cells Are Ubiquitous in Neural Networks
Authors: Li Songlin, Deng Yangdong, Wang Zhihua
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.AI
\\
  Grid cells are believed to play an important role in both spatial and
non-spatial cognition tasks. A recent study observed the emergence of grid
cells in an LSTM for path integration. The connection between biological and
artificial neural networks underlying the seemingly similarity, as well as the
application domain of grid cells in deep neural networks (DNNs), expect further
exploration. This work demonstrated that grid cells could be replicated in
either pure vision based or vision guided path integration DNNs for navigation
under a proper setting of training parameters. We also show that grid-like
behaviors arise in feedforward DNNs for non-spatial tasks. Our findings support
that the grid coding is an effective representation for both biological and
artificial networks.

Title: Amortized variance reduction for doubly stochastic objectives
Authors: Ayman Boustati, Sattar Vakili, James Hensman, ST John
Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG stat.ME
\\
  Approximate inference in complex probabilistic models such as deep Gaussian
processes requires the optimisation of doubly stochastic objective functions.
These objectives incorporate randomness both from mini-batch subsampling of the
data and from Monte Carlo estimation of expectations. If the gradient variance
is high, the stochastic optimisation problem becomes difficult with a slow rate
of convergence. Control variates can be used to reduce the variance, but past
approaches do not take into account how mini-batch stochasticity affects
sampling stochasticity, resulting in sub-optimal variance reduction. We propose
a new approach in which we use a recognition network to cheaply approximate the
optimal control variate for each mini-batch, with no additional model gradient
computations. We illustrate the properties of this proposal and test its
performance on logistic regression and deep Gaussian processes.

Title: Beyond Application End-Point Results: Quantifying Statistical Robustness
  of MCMC Accelerators
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Ramin Bashizade, Yicheng Wang, Cheng Lyu, Sayan
  Mukherjee, Alvin R. Lebeck
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI
\\
  Statistical machine learning often uses probabilistic algorithms, such as
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to solve a wide range of problems.
Probabilistic computations, often considered too slow on conventional
processors, can be accelerated with specialized hardware by exploiting
parallelism and optimizing the design using various approximation techniques.
Current methodologies for evaluating correctness of probabilistic accelerators
are often incomplete, mostly focusing only on end-point result quality
("accuracy"). It is important for hardware designers and domain experts to look
beyond end-point "accuracy" and be aware of the hardware optimizations impact
on other statistical properties.
  This work takes a first step towards defining metrics and a methodology for
quantitatively evaluating correctness of probabilistic accelerators beyond
end-point result quality. We propose three pillars of statistical robustness:
1) sampling quality, 2) convergence diagnostic, and 3) goodness of fit. We
apply our framework to a representative MCMC accelerator and surface design
issues that cannot be exposed using only application end-point result quality.
Applying the framework to guide design space exploration shows that statistical
robustness comparable to floating-point software can be achieved by slightly
increasing the bit representation, without floating-point hardware
requirements.

\\
  Despite having the robotic catheter systems which have recently emerged as
safe way of performing cardiovascular interventions, a number of important
challenges are yet to be investigated. One of them is exploration of surgeons'
natural skills during vascular catheterization with robotic systems. In this
study, surgeons' natural hand motions were investigated for identification of
four basic movements used for intravascular catheterization. Controlled
experiment was setup to acquire surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from
six muscles that are innervated when a subject with catheterization skills made
the four movements in open settings. k-means and k-NN models were implemented
over average EMG and root means square features to uniquely identify the
movements. The result shows great potentials of sEMG analysis towards designing
intelligent cyborg control for safe and efficient robotic catheterization.

Title: Complete Hierarchy of Relaxation for Constrained Signomial Positivity
Authors: Allen Houze Wang, Priyank Jaini, Yaoliang Yu, Pascal Poupart
Categories: math.OC cs.CE cs.LG math.AG
\\
  In this article, we prove that the Sums-of-AM/GM Exponential (SAGE)
relaxation generalized to signomial over a constrained set is complete, with a
compactness assumption. The high-level structure of the proof is as follows. We
first apply variable change to convert a set of rational exponents to
polynomial equations. In addition, we make the observation that linear
constraints of the variables may also be converted to polynomial equations
after variable change. Note that any convex set may be expressed as a set of
linear constraints. Further, we use redundant constraints to find reduction to
Positivstellensatz. We rely on Positivstellensatz results from algebraic
geometry to obtain a decomposition of positive polynomials. Lastly, we
explicitly show that the decomposition is of a form certifiable by SAGE.

Categories: physics.comp-ph cs.CE
Comments: 14 pages, 8 figures
\\
  We demonstrate neural-network runtime prediction for complex, many-parameter,
massively parallel, heterogeneous-physics simulations running on cloud-based
MPI clusters. Because individual simulations are so expensive, it is crucial to
train the network on a limited dataset despite the potentially large input
space of the physics at each point in the spatial domain. We achieve this using
a two-part strategy. First, we perform data-driven static load balancing using
regression coefficients extracted from small simulations, which both improves
parallel performance and reduces the dependency of the runtime on the precise
spatial layout of the heterogeneous physics. Second, we divide the execution
time of these load-balanced simulations into computation and communication,
factoring crude asymptotic scalings out of each term, and training neural nets
for the remaining factor coefficients. This strategy is implemented for Meep, a
popular and complex open-source electrodynamics simulation package, and are
validated for heterogeneous simulations drawn from published engineering
models.

Title: Shannon-Limit Approached Information Reconciliation for Quantum Key
  Distribution

Categories: quant-ph cs.CR
Comments: 15 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Npj Quantum Information
\\
  Information reconciliation (IR) corrects the errors in sifted keys and
ensures the correctness of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Polar
codes-based IR schemes can achieve high reconciliation efficiency, however, the
incidental high frame error rate decreases the secure key rate of QKD systems.
In this article, we propose a Shannon-limit approached (SLA) IR scheme, which
mainly contains two phases: the forward reconciliation phase and the
acknowledgment reconciliation phase. In the forward reconciliation phase, the
sifted key is divided into sub-blocks and performed with the improved block
checked successive cancellation list (BC-SCL) decoder of polar codes.
Afterwards, only the failure corrected sub-blocks perform the additional
acknowledgment reconciliation phase, which decreases the frame error rate of
the SLA IR scheme. The experimental results show that the overall failure
probability of SLA IR scheme is decreased to 10-8 and the efficiency is
improved to 1.091 with the IR block length of 128Mb. Furthermore, the
efficiency of the proposed SLA IR scheme is 1.055, approached to Shannon-limit,
when quantum bit error rate is 0.02 and the input scale of 1Gb, which is
hundred times larger than the state-of-art implemented polar codes-based IR
schemes.

\\
  Prediction of survivability in a patient for tumor progression is useful to
estimate the effectiveness of a treatment protocol. In our work, we present a
model to take into account the heterogeneous nature of a tumor to predict
survival. The tumor heterogeneity is measured in terms of its mass by combining
information regarding the radiodensity obtained in images with the gross tumor
volume (GTV). We propose a novel feature called Tumor Mass within a GTV (TMG),
that improves the prediction of survivability, compared to existing models
which use GTV. Weekly variation in TMG of a patient is computed from the image
data and also estimated from a cell survivability model. The parameters
obtained from the cell survivability model are indicatives of changes in TMG
over the treatment period. We use these parameters along with other patient
metadata to perform survival analysis and regression. Cox's Proportional Hazard
survival regression was performed using these data. Significant improvement in
the average concordance index from 0.47 to 0.64 was observed when TMG is used
in the model instead of GTV. The experiments show that there is a difference in
the treatment response in responsive and non-responsive patients and that the
proposed method can be used to predict patient survivability.

\\
  Data-dependent metrics are powerful tools for learning the underlying
structure of high-dimensional data. This article develops and analyzes a
data-dependent metric known as diffusion state distance (DSD), which compares
points using a data-driven diffusion process. Unlike related diffusion methods,
DSDs incorporate information across time scales, which allows for the intrinsic
data structure to be inferred in a parameter-free manner. This article develops
a theory for DSD based on the multitemporal emergence of mesoscopic equilibria
in the underlying diffusion process. New algorithms for denoising and dimension
reduction with DSD are also proposed and analyzed. These approaches are based
on a weighted spectral decomposition of the underlying diffusion process, and
experiments on synthetic datasets and real biological networks illustrate the
efficacy of the proposed algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy.
Throughout, comparisons with related methods are made, in order to illustrate
the distinct advantages of DSD for datasets exhibiting multiscale structure.

  In this paper, we propose a cross-domain networks that can achieve
undersampled MR image reconstruction from raw k-space space. We design a 2D
probability sampling mask layer to simulate real undersampling operation. Then
the 2D Inverse FFT is deployed to reconstruct MR image from frequency domain to
spatial domain. By minimizing the Euclidean loss between ground-truth image and
output, we train the parameters in our probability mask layer. We discover the
probability appears special patterns that is quite different from universal
common sense that mask should be Poisson-like, under certain undersampled
rates. We analyze the probability mask is subjected to Gaussian or Quadratic
distributions, and discuss this pattern will be more accurate and robust than
traditional ones. Extensive experiments proves that the rules we discovered are
adaptive to most cases. This can be a useful guidance to further MR
reconstruction mask designs.

Title: Learned Spectral Computed Tomography
Authors: Dimitris Kamilis, Mario Blatter, Nick Polydorides
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.NE math.OC
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Spectral Photon-Counting Computed Tomography (SPCCT) is a promising
technology that has shown a number of advantages over conventional X-ray
Computed Tomography (CT) in the form of material separation, artefact removal
and enhanced image quality. However, due to the increased complexity and
non-linearity of the SPCCT governing equations, model-based reconstruction
algorithms typically require handcrafted regularisation terms and meticulous
tuning of hyperparameters making them impractical to calibrate in variable
conditions. Additionally, they typically incur high computational costs and in
cases of limited-angle data, their imaging capability deteriorates
significantly. Recently, Deep Learning has proven to provide state-of-the-art
reconstruction performance in medical imaging applications while circumventing
most of these challenges. Inspired by these advances, we propose a Deep
Learning imaging method for SPCCT that exploits the expressive power of Neural
Networks while also incorporating model knowledge. The method takes the form of
a two-step learned primal-dual algorithm that is trained using case-specific
data. The proposed approach is characterised by fast reconstruction capability
and high imaging performance, even in limited-data cases, while avoiding the
hand-tuning that is required by other optimisation approaches. We demonstrate
the performance of the method in terms of reconstructed images and quality
metrics via numerical examples inspired by the application of cardiovascular
imaging.

Title: Hybrid calibration procedure for fringe projection profilometry based on

DOI: 10.1364/AO.383602
\\
  The key to accurate 3D shape measurement in Fringe Projection Profilometry
(FPP) is the proper calibration of the measurement system. Current calibration
techniques rely on phase-coordinate mapping (PCM) or back-projection
stereo-vision (SV) methods. PCM methods are cumbersome to implement as they
require precise positioning of the calibration target relative to the FPP
system but produce highly accurate measurements within the calibration volume.
SV methods generally do not achieve the same accuracy level. However, the
calibration is more flexible in that the calibration target can be arbitrarily
positioned. In this work, we propose a hybrid calibration method that leverages
the SV calibration approach using a PCM method to achieve higher accuracy. The
method has the flexibility of SV methods, is robust to lens distortions, and
has a simple relation between the recovered phase and the metric coordinates.
Experimental results show that the proposed Hybrid method outperforms the SV
method in terms of accuracy and reconstruction time due to its low
computational complexity.

Comments: Presented in Life-Long Learning for Spoken Language Systems Workshop
  - ASRU 2019
\\
  In the area of multi-domain speech recognition, research in the past focused
on hybrid acoustic models to build cross-domain and domain-invariant speech
recognition systems. In this paper, we empirically examine the difference in
behavior between hybrid acoustic models and neural end-to-end systems when
mixing acoustic training data from several domains. For these experiments we
composed a multi-domain dataset from public sources, with the different domains
in the corpus covering a wide variety of topics and acoustic conditions such as
telephone conversations, lectures, read speech and broadcast news. We show that
for the hybrid models, supplying additional training data from other domains
with mismatched acoustic conditions does not increase the performance on
specific domains. However, our end-to-end models optimized with sequence-based
criterion generalize better than the hybrid models on diverse domains. In term
of word-error-rate performance, our experimental acoustic-to-word and
attention-based models trained on multi-domain dataset reach the performance of
domain-specific long short-term memory (LSTM) hybrid models, thus resulting in
multi-domain speech recognition systems that do not suffer in performance over
domain specific ones. Moreover, the use of neural end-to-end models eliminates
the need of domain-adapted language models during recognition, which is a great
advantage when the input domain is unknown.

  The micro-structure of most of the engineering alloys contains some
inclusions and precipitates, which may affect their properties, therefore it is
crucial to characterize them. In this work we focus on the development of a
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence model for Anomaly Detection named
MLography to automatically quantify the degree of anomaly of impurities in
alloys. For this purpose, we introduce several anomaly detection measures:
Spatial, Shape and Area anomaly, that successfully detect the most anomalous
objects based on their objective, given that the impurities were already
labeled. The first two measures quantify the degree of anomaly of each object
by how each object is distant and big compared to its neighborhood, and by the
abnormally of its own shape respectively. The last measure, combines the former
two and highlights the most anomalous regions among all input images, for later
(physical) examination. The performance of the model is presented and analyzed
based on few representative cases. We stress that although the models presented
here were developed for metallography analysis, most of them can be generalized
to a wider set of problems in which anomaly detection of geometrical objects is
desired. All models as well as the data-set that was created for this work, are
publicly available at: https://github.com/matanr/MLography.

Title: Manifold Regularization for Adversarial Robustness
Authors: Charles Jin, Martin Rinard
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE
\\
  Manifold regularization is a technique that penalizes the complexity of
learned functions over the intrinsic geometry of input data. We develop a
connection to learning functions which are "locally stable", and propose new
regularization terms for training deep neural networks that are stable against
a class of local perturbations. These regularizers enable us to train a network
to state-of-the-art robust accuracy of 70% on CIFAR-10 against a PGD adversary
using $\ell_\infty$ perturbations of size $\epsilon = 8/255$. Furthermore, our
techniques do not rely on the construction of any adversarial examples, thus
running orders of magnitude faster than standard algorithms for adversarial
training.

Title: CUBE -- Towards an Optimal Scaling of Cosmological N-body Simulations

\\
  N-body simulations are essential tools in physical cosmology to understand
the large-scale structure (LSS) formation of the Universe. Large-scale
simulations with high resolution are important for exploring the substructure
of universe and for determining fundamental physical parameters like neutrino
mass. However, traditional particle-mesh (PM) based algorithms use considerable
amounts of memory, which limits the scalability of simulations. Therefore, we
designed a two-level PM algorithm CUBE towards optimal performance in memory
consumption reduction. By using the fixed-point compression technique, CUBE
reduces the memory consumption per N-body particle toward 6 bytes, an order of
magnitude lower than the traditional PM-based algorithms. We scaled CUBE to 512
nodes (20,480 cores) on an Intel Cascade Lake based supercomputer with
$\simeq$95\% weak-scaling efficiency. This scaling test was performed in
"Cosmo-$\pi$" -- a cosmological LSS simulation using $\simeq$4.4 trillion
particles, tracing the evolution of the universe over $\simeq$13.7 billion
years. To our best knowledge, Cosmo-$\pi$ is the largest completed cosmological
N-body simulation. We believe CUBE has a huge potential to scale on exascale
supercomputers for larger simulations.

Title: Decentralized SGD with Over-the-Air Computation
Authors: Emre Ozfatura, Stefano Rini, Deniz Gunduz
Categories: eess.SP cs.DC cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML
\\
  We study the performance of decentralized stochastic gradient descent (DSGD)
in a wireless network, where the nodes collaboratively optimize an objective
function using their local datasets. Unlike the conventional setting, where the
nodes communicate over error-free orthogonal communication links, we assume
that transmissions are prone to additive noise and interference.We first
consider a point-to-point (P2P) transmission strategy, termed the OAC-P2P
scheme, in which the node pairs are scheduled in an orthogonal fashion to
minimize interference. Since in the DSGD framework, each node requires a linear
combination of the neighboring models at the consensus step, we then propose
the OAC-MAC scheme, which utilizes the signal superposition property of the
wireless medium to achieve over-the-air computation (OAC). For both schemes, we
cast the scheduling problem as a graph coloring problem. We numerically
evaluate the performance of these two schemes for the MNIST image
classification task under various network conditions. We show that the OAC-MAC
scheme attains better convergence performance with a fewer communication
rounds.

Title: Quasi-random words and limits of word sequences

\\
  Words are sequences of letters over a finite alphabet. We study two
intimately related topics for this object: quasi-randomness and limit theory.
With respect to the first topic we investigate the notion of uniform
distribution of letters over intervals, and in the spirit of the famous
Chung-Graham-Wilson theorem for graphs we provide a list of word properties
which are equivalent to uniformity. In particular, we show that uniformity is
equivalent to counting 3-letter subsequences.
  Inspired by graph limit theory we then investigate limits of convergent word
sequences, those in which all subsequence densities converge. We show that
convergent word sequences have a natural limit, namely Lebesgue measurable
functions of the form $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$. Via this theory we show that every
hereditary word property is testable, address the problem of finite forcibility
for word limits and establish as a byproduct a new model of random word
sequences.
  Along the lines of the proof of the existence of word limits, we can also
establish the existence of limits for higher dimensional structures. In
particular, we obtain an alternative proof of the result by Hoppen, Kohayakawa,
Moreira and Rath (2011) establishing the existence of permutons.

\\
  This paper introduces a new algorithm for the fundamental problem of
generating a random integer from a discrete probability distribution using a
source of independent and unbiased random coin flips. We prove that this
algorithm, which we call the Fast Loaded Dice Roller (FLDR), is highly
efficient in both space and time: (i) the size of the sampler is guaranteed to
be linear in the number of bits needed to encode the input distribution; and
(ii) the expected number of bits of entropy it consumes per sample is at most 6
bits more than the information-theoretically optimal rate. We present fast
implementations of the linear-time preprocessing and near-optimal sampling
algorithms using unsigned integer arithmetic. Empirical evaluations on a broad
set of probability distributions establish that FLDR is 2x-10x faster in both
preprocessing and sampling than multiple baseline algorithms, including the
widely-used alias and interval samplers. It also uses up to 10000x less space
than the information-theoretically optimal sampler, at the expense of less than
1.5x runtime overhead.

Title: Complexity of tree-coloring interval graphs equitably
Authors: Bei Niu, Bi Li, Xin Zhang
Categories: math.CO cs.DM
\\
  An equitable tree-$k$-coloring of a graph is a vertex $k$-coloring such that
each color class induces a forest and the size of any two color classes differ
by at most one. In this work, we show that every interval graph $G$ has an
equitable tree-$k$-coloring for any integer $k\geq
\lceil(\Delta(G)+1)/2\rceil$, solving a conjecture of Wu, Zhang and Li (2013)
for interval graphs, and furthermore, give a linear-time algorithm for
determining whether a proper interval graph admits an equitable
tree-$k$-coloring for a given integer $k$. For disjoint union of split graphs,
or $K_{1,r}$-free interval graphs with $r\geq 4$, we prove that it is
$W[1]$-hard to decide whether there is an equitable tree-$k$-coloring when
parameterized by number of colors, or by treewidth, number of colors and
maximum degree, respectively.

\\
  Quantum computers with tens to hundreds of noisy qubits are being developed
today. To be useful for real-world applications, we believe that these
near-term systems cannot simply be scaled-down non-error-corrected versions of
future fault-tolerant large-scale quantum computers. These near-term systems
require specific architecture and design attributes to realize their full
potential. To efficiently execute an algorithm, the quantum coprocessor must be
designed to scale with respect to qubit number and to maximize useful
computation within the qubits' decoherence bounds. In this work, we employ an
application-system-qubit co-design methodology to architect a near-term quantum
coprocessor. To support algorithms from the real-world application area of
simulating the quantum dynamics of a material system, we design a
(parameterized) arbitrary single-qubit rotation instruction and a two-qubit
entangling controlled-Z instruction. We introduce dynamic gate set and paging
mechanisms to implement the instructions. To evaluate the functionality and
performance of these two instructions, we implement a two-qubit version of an
algorithm to study a disorder-induced metal-insulator transition and run 60
random instances of it, each of which realizes one disorder configuration and
contains 40 two-qubit instructions (or gates) and 104 single-qubit
instructions. We observe the expected quantum dynamics of the time-evolution of
this system.

  The ability to quantify complex relationships within multivariate time series
is a key component of modelling many physical systems, from the climate to
brains and other biophysical phenomena. Unfortunately, even testing the
significance of simple dependence measures, such as Pearson correlation, is
complicated by altered sampling properties when autocorrelation is present in
the individual time series. Moreover, it has been recently established that
commonly used multivariate dependence measures---such as Granger
causality---can produce substantially inaccurate results when applying
classical hypothesis-testing procedures to digitally-filtered time series.
Here, we suggest that the digital filtering-induced bias in Granger causality
is an effect of autocorrelation, and we present a principled statistical
framework for the hypothesis testing of a large family of linear-dependence
measures between multiple autocorrelated time series. Our approach unifies the
theoretical foundations established by Bartlett and others on variance
estimators for autocorrelated signals with the more intricate multivariate
measures of linear dependence. Specifically, we derive the sampling
distributions and subsequent hypothesis tests for any measure that can be
decomposed into terms that involve independent partial correlations, which we
show includes Granger causality and mutual information under a multivariate
linear-Gaussian model. In doing so, we provide the first exact tests for
inferring linear dependence between vector autoregressive processes with
limited data. Using numerical simulations and brain-imaging datasets, we
demonstrate that our newly developed tests maintain the expected false-positive
rate (FPR) with minimally-sufficient samples, while the classical
log-likelihood ratio tests can yield an unbounded FPR depending on the
parameters chosen.

Title: Multi-Time-Scale Convolution for Emotion Recognition from Speech Audio
  Signals
Authors: Eric Guizzo, Tillman Weyde, Jack Barnett Leveson
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML
\\
  Robustness against temporal variations is important for emotion recognition
from speech audio, since emotion is ex-pressed through complex spectral
patterns that can exhibit significant local dilation and compression on the
time axis depending on speaker and context. To address this and potentially
other tasks, we introduce the multi-time-scale (MTS) method to create
flexibility towards temporal variations when analyzing time-frequency
representations of audio data. MTS extends convolutional neural networks with
convolution kernels that are scaled and re-sampled along the time axis, to
increase temporal flexibility without increasing the number of trainable
parameters compared to standard convolutional layers. We evaluate MTS and
standard convolutional layers in different architectures for emotion
recognition from speech audio, using 4 datasets of different sizes. The results
show that the use of MTS layers consistently improves the generalization of
networks of different capacity and depth, compared to standard convolution,
especially on smaller datasets

Comments: 8 pages
\\
  We build a general quantum state tomography framework that makes use of
machine learning techniques to reconstruct quantum states from a given set of
coincidence measurements. For a wide range of pure and mixed input states we
demonstrate via simulations that our method produces functionally equivalent
reconstructed states to that of traditional methods with the added benefit that
expensive computations are front-loaded with our system. Further, by training
our system with measurement results that include simulated noise sources we are
able to demonstrate a significantly enhanced average fidelity when compared to
typical reconstruction methods. These enhancements in average fidelity are also
shown to persist when we consider state reconstruction from partial tomography
data where several measurements are missing. We anticipate that the present
results combining the fields of machine intelligence and quantum state
estimation will greatly improve and speed up tomography-based quantum
experiments.

Title: BasisVAE: Translation-invariant feature-level clustering with
  Variational Autoencoders
Authors: Kaspar M\"artens and Christopher Yau
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG q-bio.GN
Comments: Accepted to AISTATS 2020
\\
  Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a flexible and scalable framework for
non-linear dimensionality reduction. However, in application domains such as
genomics where data sets are typically tabular and high-dimensional, a
black-box approach to dimensionality reduction does not provide sufficient
insights. Common data analysis workflows additionally use clustering techniques
to identify groups of similar features. This usually leads to a two-stage
process, however, it would be desirable to construct a joint modelling
framework for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and clustering of features.
In this paper, we propose to achieve this through the BasisVAE: a combination
of the VAE and a probabilistic clustering prior, which lets us learn a one-hot
basis function representation as part of the decoder network. Furthermore, for
scenarios where not all features are aligned, we develop an extension to handle
translation-invariant basis functions. We show how a collapsed variational
inference scheme leads to scalable and efficient inference for BasisVAE,
demonstrated on various toy examples as well as on single-cell gene expression
data.

Title: Convergence of Q-value in case of Gaussian rewards
Authors: Konatsu Miyamoto, Masaya Suzuki, Yuma Kigami, Kodai Satake
Categories: math.OC cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  In this paper, as a study of reinforcement learning, we converge the Q
function to unbounded rewards such as Gaussian distribution. From the central
limit theorem, in some real-world applications it is natural to assume that
rewards follow a Gaussian distribution , but existing proofs cannot guarantee
convergence of the Q-function. Furthermore, in the distribution-type
reinforcement learning and Bayesian reinforcement learning that have become
popular in recent years, it is better to allow the reward to have a Gaussian
distribution. Therefore, in this paper, we prove the convergence of the
Q-function under the condition of $E[r(s,a)^2]<\infty$, which is much more
relaxed than the existing research. Finally, as a bonus, a proof of the policy
gradient theorem for distributed reinforcement learning is also posted.

  Stochastic version of alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) and
its variants (linearized ADMM, gradient-based ADMM) plays a key role for modern
large scale machine learning problems. One example is the regularized empirical
risk minimization problem. In this work, we put different variants of
stochastic ADMM into a unified form, which includes standard, linearized and
gradient-based ADMM with relaxation, and study their dynamics via a
continuous-time model approach. We adapt the mathematical framework of
stochastic modified equation (SME), and show that the dynamics of stochastic
ADMM is approximated by a class of stochastic differential equations with small
noise parameters in the sense of weak approximation. The continuous-time
analysis would uncover important analytical insights into the behaviors of the
discrete-time algorithm, which are non-trivial to gain otherwise. For example,
we could characterize the fluctuation of the solution paths precisely, and
decide optimal stopping time to minimize the variance of solution paths.

\\
  Multi-omics data, that is, datasets containing different types of
high-dimensional molecular variables (often in addition to classical clinical
variables), are increasingly generated for the investigation of various
diseases. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the usefulness of
multi-omics data for the prediction of disease outcomes such as survival time.
It is also unclear which methods are most appropriate to derive such prediction
models. We aim to give some answers to these questions by means of a
large-scale benchmark study using real data. Different prediction methods from
machine learning and statistics were applied on 18 multi-omics cancer datasets
from the database "The Cancer Genome Atlas", containing from 35 to 1,000
observations and from 60,000 to 100,000 variables. The considered outcome was
the (censored) survival time. Twelve methods based on boosting, penalized
regression and random forest were compared, comprising both methods that do and
that do not take the group structure of the omics variables into account. The
Kaplan-Meier estimate and a Cox model using only clinical variables were used
as reference methods. The methods were compared using several repetitions of
5-fold cross-validation. Uno's C-index and the integrated Brier-score served as
performance metrics. The results show that, although multi-omics data can
improve the prediction performance, this is not generally the case. Only the
method block forest slightly outperformed the Cox model on average over all
datasets. Taking into account the multi-omics structure improves the predictive
performance and protects variables in low-dimensional groups - especially
clinical variables - from not being included in the model. All analyses are
reproducible using freely available R code.

Title: Getting Better from Worse: Augmented Bagging and a Cautionary Tale of
  Variable Importance
Authors: Lucas Mentch and Siyu Zhou
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  As the size, complexity, and availability of data continues to grow,
scientists are increasingly relying upon black-box learning algorithms that can
often provide accurate predictions with minimal a priori model specifications.
Tools like random forest have an established track record of off-the-shelf
success and even offer various strategies for analyzing the underlying
relationships between features and the response. Motivated by recent insights
into random forest behavior, here we introduce the idea of augmented bagging
(AugBagg), a procedure that operates in an identical fashion to the classical
bagging and random forest counterparts but which operates on a larger space
containing additional, randomly generated features. Somewhat surprisingly, we
demonstrate that the simple act of adding additional random features into the
model can have a dramatic beneficial effect on performance, sometimes
outperforming even an optimally tuned traditional random forest. This finding
that the inclusion of an additional set of features generated independently of
the response can considerably improve predictive performance has crucial
implications for the manner in which we consider and measure variable
importance. Numerous demonstrations on both real and synthetic data are
provided.

  We study the spatio-temporal prediction problem, which has attracted
attention of many researchers due to its critical real-life applications. In
particular, we introduce a novel approach to this problem. Our approach is
based on the Hawkes process, which is a non-stationary and self-exciting point
process. We extend the formulations of a standard point process model that can
represent time-series data to represent a spatio-temporal data. We model the
data as nonstationary in time and space. Furthermore, we partition the spatial
region we are working on into subregions via an adaptive decision tree and
model the source statistics in each subregion with individual but mutually
interacting point processes. We also provide a gradient based joint
optimization algorithm for the point process and decision tree parameters.
Thus, we introduce a model that can jointly infer the source statistics and an
adaptive partitioning of the spatial region. Finally, we provide experimental
results on a real-life data, which provides significant improvement due to
space adaptation and joint optimization compared to standard well-known methods
in the literature.

Title: Discovering contemporaneous and lagged causal relations in
  autocorrelated nonlinear time series datasets
Authors: Jakob Runge
Categories: stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures
\\
  We consider causal discovery from time series using conditional independence
(CI) based network learning algorithms such as the PC algorithm. The PC
algorithm is divided into a skeleton phase where adjacencies are determined
based on efficiently selected CI tests and subsequent phases where links are
oriented utilizing the Markov and Faithfulness assumptions. Here we show that
autocorrelation makes the PC algorithm much less reliable with very low
adjacency and orientation detection rates and inflated false positives. We
propose a new algorithm, called PCMCI$^+$ that extends the PCMCI method from
[Runge et al., 2019b] to also include discovery of contemporaneous links. It
separates the skeleton phase for lagged and contemporaneous conditioning sets
and modifies the conditioning sets for the individual CI tests. We show that
this algorithm now benefits from increasing autocorrelation and yields much
more adjacency detection power and especially more orientation recall for
contemporaneous links while controlling false positives and having much shorter
runtimes. Numerical experiments indicate that the algorithm can be of
considerable use in many application scenarios for dozens of variables and
large time delays.

Although binary cost-sensitive classifiers have been well-studied, solving
multicategory classification problems is still challenging. A popular approach
to address this issue is to construct K classification functions for a K-class
problem and remove the redundancy by imposing a sum-to-zero constraint.
However, such method usually results in higher computational complexity and
inefficient algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel angle-based
cost-sensitive classification framework for multicategory classification
without the sum-to-zero constraint. Loss functions that included in the
angle-based cost-sensitive classification framework are further justified to be
Fisher consistent. To show the usefulness of the framework, two cost-sensitive
multicategory boosting algorithms are derived as concrete instances. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that proposed boosting algorithms yield competitive
classification performances against other existing boosting approaches.

Title: Sampling on Graphs: From Theory to Applications
Authors: Yuichi Tanaka, Yonina C. Eldar, Antonio Ortega, and Gene Cheung
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
\\
  The study of sampling signals on graphs, with the goal of building an analog
of sampling for standard signals in the time and spatial domains, has attracted
considerable attention recently. Beyond adding to the growing theory on graph
signal processing (GSP), sampling on graphs has various promising applications.
In this article, we review current progress on sampling over graphs focusing on
theory and potential applications. Most methodologies used in graph signal
sampling are designed to parallel those used in sampling for standard signals,
however, sampling theory for graph signals significantly differs from that for
Shannon--Nyquist and shift invariant signals. This is due in part to the fact
that the definitions of several important properties, such as shift invariance
and bandlimitedness, are different in GSP systems. Throughout, we discuss
similarities and differences between standard and graph sampling and highlight
open problems and challenges.

Title: Tackling real noisy reverberant meetings with all-neural source

\\
  Automatic meeting analysis is an essential fundamental technology required to
let, e.g. smart devices follow and respond to our conversations. To achieve an
optimal automatic meeting analysis, we previously proposed an all-neural
approach that jointly solves source separation, speaker diarization and source
counting problems in an optimal way (in a sense that all the 3 tasks can be
jointly optimized through error back-propagation). It was shown that the method
could well handle simulated clean (noiseless and anechoic) dialog-like data,
and achieved very good performance in comparison with several conventional
methods. However, it was not clear whether such all-neural approach would be
successfully generalized to more complicated real meeting data containing more
spontaneously-speaking speakers, severe noise and reverberation, and how it
performs in comparison with the state-of-the-art systems in such scenarios. In
this paper, we first consider practical issues required for improving the
robustness of the all-neural approach, and then experimentally show that, even
in real meeting scenarios, the all-neural approach can perform effective speech
enhancement, and simultaneously outperform state-of-the-art systems.

Title: Spike-Timing-Dependent Inference of Synaptic Weights
Authors: Nasir Ahmad, Luca Ambrogioni, Marcel A. J. van Gerven
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.LG
Comments: 19 pages, 6 figures
\\
  A potential solution to the weight transport problem, which questions the
biological plausibility of the backpropagation of error algorithm, is proposed.
We derive our method based upon an (approximate) analysis of the dynamics of
leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We thereafter validate our method and show
that the use of spike timing alone out-competes existing biologically plausible
methods for synaptic weight inference in spiking neural network models.
Furthermore, our proposed method is also more flexible, being applicable to any
spiking neuron model, is conservative in how many parameters are required for
implementation and can be deployed in an online-fashion with minimal
computational overhead. These features, together with its biological
plausibility, make it an attractive candidate technique for weight inference at
single synapses.

Title: Improving noise robust automatic speech recognition with single-channel

Authors: Keisuke Kinoshita, Tsubasa Ochiai, Marc Delcroix, Tomohiro Nakatani
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD
Comments: 5 pages, to appear in ICASSP2020
\\
  With the advent of deep learning, research on noise-robust automatic speech
recognition (ASR) has progressed rapidly. However, ASR performance in noisy
conditions of single-channel systems remains unsatisfactory. Indeed, most
single-channel speech enhancement (SE) methods (denoising) have brought only
limited performance gains over state-of-the-art ASR back-end trained on
multi-condition training data. Recently, there has been much research on neural
network-based SE methods working in the time-domain showing levels of
performance never attained before. However, it has not been established whether
the high enhancement performance achieved by such time-domain approaches could
be translated into ASR. In this paper, we show that a single-channel
time-domain denoising approach can significantly improve ASR performance,
providing more than 30 % relative word error reduction over a strong ASR
back-end on the real evaluation data of the single-channel track of the CHiME-4
dataset. These positive results demonstrate that single-channel noise reduction
can still improve ASR performance, which should open the door to more research
in that direction.

\\
  Current data-driven traffic prediction models are usually trained with large
datasets, e.g. several months of speeds and flows. Such models provide very
good fit for ordinary road conditions, but often fail just when they are most
needed: when traffic suffers a sudden and significant disruption, such as a
road incident. In this work, we describe QTIP: a simulation-based framework for
quasi-instantaneous adaptation of prediction models upon traffic disruption. In
a nutshell, QTIP performs real-time simulations of the affected road for
multiple scenarios, analyzes the results, and suggests a change to an ordinary
prediction model accordingly. QTIP constructs the simulated scenarios per
properties of the incident, as conveyed by immediate distress signals from
affected vehicles. Such real-time signals are provided by In-Vehicle Monitor
Systems, which are becoming increasingly prevalent world-wide. We experiment
QTIP in a case study of a Danish motorway, and the results show that QTIP can
improve traffic prediction in the first critical minutes of road incidents.

Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 17 pages, 7 figures
\\
  This paper presents a neural estimator for entropy production, or NEEP, that
estimates entropy production (EP) from trajectories without any prior knowledge
of the system. For steady state, we rigorously prove that the estimator, which
can be built up from different choices of deep neural networks, provides EP by
optimizing the objective function proposed here. We verify the NEEP with
stochastic processes such as those found in the bead-spring system and discrete
flashing ratchet model. We also demonstrate that our method is applicable to
high-dimensional data and non-Markovian systems.

Title: Application of Support Vector Machines for Seismogram Analysis and
  Differentiation
Authors: Rohit Kumar Shrivastava
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
\\
  Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a computational technique which has been
used in various fields of sciences as a classifier with k-class classification
capability, k being 2,3,4, etc. Seismograms of volcanic tremors often contain
noises which can prove harmful for correct interpretation. The PCAB station
(located in the northern region of Panarea island, Italy) has been recording
seismic signals from a pump installed nearby, corrupting the useful signals
from Strombolli volcano. SVM with k=2 classification technique after
optimization through grid search has been instrumental in identification and
classification of the seismic signals coming from pump, reaching a score of
99.7149% of patterns which match the actual membership of class (determined
through cross-validation). The predicted labels of SVM has been used to
estimate the pump's duration of activity leading to the declaration of
corresponding seismograms redundant (not fit for processing and
interpretation). However, when the same trained SVM was used to determine
whether the seismogram used by Pino et al., 2011 recorded at the same PCAB
station on 4th April, 2003 contained pump's signals or not, SVM showed 100%
absence of pump's signals thereby authenticating the research work done in the
latter.

  Networks effectively capture interactions among components of complex
systems, and have thus become a mainstay in many scientific disciplines.
Growing evidence, especially from biology, suggest that networks undergo
changes over time, and in response to external stimuli. In biology and
medicine, these changes have been found to be predictive of complex diseases.
They have also been used to gain insight into mechanisms of disease initiation
and progression. Primarily motivated by biological applications, this article
provides a review of recent statistical machine learning methods for inferring
networks and identifying changes in their structures.

Title: Deep Neural Networks for Automatic Speech Processing: A Survey from
  Large Corpora to Limited Data
Authors: Vincent Roger, J\'er\^ome Farinas and Julien Pinquier
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML
\\
  Most state-of-the-art speech systems are using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
Those systems require a large amount of data to be learned. Hence, learning
state-of-the-art frameworks on under-resourced speech languages/problems is a
difficult task. Problems could be the limited amount of data for impaired
speech. Furthermore, acquiring more data and/or expertise is time-consuming and
expensive. In this paper we position ourselves for the following speech
processing tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition, speaker identification and
emotion recognition. To assess the problem of limited data, we firstly
investigate state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition systems as it
represents the hardest tasks (due to the large variability in each language).
Next, we provide an overview of techniques and tasks requiring fewer data. In
the last section we investigate few-shot techniques as we interpret
under-resourced speech as a few-shot problem. In that sense we propose an
overview of few-shot techniques and perspectives of using such techniques for
the focused speech problems in this survey. It occurs that the reviewed
techniques are not well adapted for large datasets. Nevertheless, some
promising results from the literature encourage the usage of such techniques
for speech processing.

Title: Discovering Symmetry Invariants and Conserved Quantities by Interpreting
  Siamese Neural Networks
Authors: Sebastian J. Wetzel, Roger G. Melko, Joseph Scott, Maysum Panju, Vijay

Categories: physics.comp-ph cond-mat.dis-nn cs.LG
\\
  In this paper, we introduce interpretable Siamese Neural Networks (SNN) for
similarity detectionto the field of theoretical physics. More precisely, we
apply SNNs to events in special relativity, thetransformation of
electromagnetic fields, and the motion of particles in a central potential. In
theseexamples, these SNNs learn to identify datapoints belonging to the same
events, field configurations, or trajectory of motion. It turns out that in the
process of learning which datapoints belong to the same event or field
configuration, these SNNs also learn the relevant symmetry invariants
andconserved quantities. These SNNs are highly interpretable, which enables us
to reveal the symmetry invariants and conserved quantities without prior
knowledge.

Title: Stochastic Recursive Momentum for Policy Gradient Methods
Authors: Huizhuo Yuan, Xiangru Lian, Ji Liu, Yuren Zhou
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named STOchastic Recursive
Momentum for Policy Gradient (STORM-PG), which operates a SARAH-type stochastic
recursive variance-reduced policy gradient in an exponential moving average
fashion. STORM-PG enjoys a provably sharp $O(1/\epsilon^3)$ sample complexity
bound for STORM-PG, matching the best-known convergence rate for policy
gradient algorithm. In the mean time, STORM-PG avoids the alternations between
large batches and small batches which persists in comparable variance-reduced
policy gradient methods, allowing considerably simpler parameter tuning.
Numerical experiments depicts the superiority of our algorithm over comparative
policy gradient algorithms.

\\
  This paper is concerned with the numerical investigation of Quantum
Turbulence (QT) described by the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. Numerical
simulations are performed using a parallel (MPI-OpenMP) code based on a
pseudo-spectral spatial discretization and second order splitting for the time
integration. We start by revisiting (in the framework of
high-performance/high-accuracy computations) well-known GP-QT settings, based
on the analogy with classical vortical flows: Taylor-Green (TG) vortices and
Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flow. Two new settings are suggested to build
the initial condition for the QT simulation. They are based on the direct
manipulation of the wave function by generating a smoothed random phase (SRP)
field, or seeding random vortex rings (RVR) pairs. The new initial conditions
have the advantage to be simpler to implement than the TG and ABC approaches,
while generating statistically equivalent QT fields. Each of these four GP-QT
settings is described in detail by defining corresponding benchmarks that could
be used to validate/calibrate new GP codes. We offer a comprehensive
description of the numerical and physical parameters of each benchmark. We
analyze the results in detail and present values, spectra and structure
functions of main quantities of interest (energy, helicity, etc.) that are
useful to describe the turbulent flow. Some general features of QT are
identified, despite the variety of initial states.

Title: The NuZZ: Numerical ZigZag Sampling for General Models
Authors: Simon Cotter and Thomas House and Filippo Pagani
Categories: stat.ME cs.NA math.NA stat.CO
Comments: 28 pages, 10 figures
\\
  We present the Numerical ZigZag (NuZZ) algorithm, a Piecewise Deterministic
MCMC algorithm that is applicable to general statistical models, without the
need for bounds on the gradient of the log posterior. This allows us to
investigate: (i) how the ZigZag process behaves on some test problems with
common challenging features; (ii) the performance of NuZZ compared to other
numerical approaches to the ZigZag; (iii) the error between the target and
sampled distributions as a function of computational effort for different MCMC
algorithms including the NuZZ. Through a series of test problems we compare the
mixing of the ZigZag process against other common methods. We present numerical
evidence and an analytical argument that the Wasserstein distance between the
target distribution and the invariant distribution of the NuZZ process is
expected to exhibit asymptotically linearly dependence on the tolerances of
both the numerical integration and root finding schemes used. Notably we
present a real-life example which demonstrates that NuZZ can outperform not
only the super-efficient version of the ZigZag process with thinning, but also
well-established methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

Title: Machine learning based non-Newtonian fluid model with molecular fidelity
Authors: Huan Lei, Lei Wu and Weinan E
Categories: physics.comp-ph cs.NA math.NA physics.flu-dyn stat.ML
\\
  We introduce a machine-learning-based framework for constructing continuum
non-Newtonian fluid dynamics model directly from a micro-scale description.
Polymer solution is used as an example to demonstrate the essential ideas. To
faithfully retain molecular fidelity, we establish a micro-macro correspondence
via a set of encoders for the micro-scale polymer configurations and their
macro-scale counterparts, a set of nonlinear conformation tensors. The dynamics
of these conformation tensors can be derived from the micro-scale model and the
relevant terms can be parametrized using machine learning. The final model,
named the deep non-Newtonian model (DeePN$^2$), takes the form of conventional
non-Newtonian fluid dynamics models, with a new form of the objective tensor
derivative. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of DeePN$^2$.

\\
  In this paper, we present a nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm using
B-splines with free knots. Since its performance strongly depends on the
initial estimation of the free parameters (i.e. the knots), we also propose a
fast and efficient knot-prediction algorithm that utilizes numerical properties
of first-order B-splines. Using $\ell_p\;(p=1,2,\infty)$ norm solutions, we
also provide three different strategies for properly selecting the free knots.
Our initial predictions are then iteratively refined by means of a
gradient-based variable projection optimization. Our method is general in
nature and can be used to estimate the optimal number of knots in cases in
which no a-priori information is available. To evaluate the performance of our
method, we approximated a one-dimensional discrete time series and conducted an
extensive comparative study using both synthetic and real-world data. We chose
the problem of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal compression as a real-world case
study. Our experiments on the well-known PhysioNet MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database
show that the proposed method outperforms other knot-prediction techniques in
terms of accuracy while requiring much lower computational complexity.

Title: Divided Differences, Falling Factorials, and Discrete Splines: Another

Comments: 74 pages, 8 figures
\\
  This paper serves as a postscript of sorts to Tibshirani (2014); Wang et al.
(2014), who developed continuous-time formulations and properties of trend
filtering, a discrete-time smoothing tool proposed (independently) by Steidl et
al. (2006); Kim et al. (2009). The central object of study is the falling
factorial basis, as it was called by Tibshirani (2014); Wang et al. (2014). Its
span turns out to be a space of piecewise polynomials that has a classical
place in spline theory, called discrete splines (Mangasarian and Schumaker,
1971, 1973; Schumaker, 2007). At the Tibshirani (2014); Wang et al. (2014), we
were not fully aware of these connections. The current paper attempts to
rectify this by making these connections explicit, reviewing (and making use
of) some of the important existing work on discrete splines, and contributing
several new perspectives and new results on discrete splines along the way.

  In this paper, a block inertial Bregman proximal algorithm, namely
\refBIBPA[], for solving structured nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems
is introduced. More specifically, the objective function is the sum of a block
relatively smooth function (i.e., relatively smooth with respect to each block)
and block separable (nonsmooth) nonconvex functions. It is shown that the
sequence generated by \refBIBPA[] converges subsequentially to critical points,
while it is globally convergent for Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (K{{\L}}) functions.
Furthermore, the rate of convergence of this sequence is studied for the
{\L}ojasiewicz-type K{{\L}} functions.

Title: Mean Field Games of Controls: Finite Difference Approximations
Authors: Y Achdou, Z Kobeissi
Categories: math.AP cs.NA math.NA math.OC
\\
  We consider a class of mean field games in which the agents interact through
both their states and controls, and we focus on situations in which a generic
agent tries to adjust her speed (control) to an average speed (the average is
made in a neighborhood in the state space). In such cases, the monotonicity
assumptions that are frequently made in the theory of mean field games do not
hold, and uniqueness cannot be expected in general. Such model lead to systems
of forward-backward nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations; the latter are
supplemented with various kinds of boundary conditions, in particular
Neumann-like boundary conditions stemming from reflection conditions on the
underlying controled stochastic processes. The present work deals with
numerical approximations of the above mentioned systems. After describing the
finite difference scheme, we propose an iterative method for solving the
systems of nonlinear equations that arise in the discrete setting; it combines
a continuation method, Newton iterations and inner loops of a bigradient like
solver. The numerical method is used for simulating two examples. We also make
experiments on the behaviour of the iterative algorithm when the parameters of
the model vary. The theory of mean field games, (MFGs for short), aims at
studying deterministic or stochastic differential games (Nash equilibria) as
the number of agents tends to infinity. It supposes that the rational agents
are indistinguishable and individually have a negligible influence on the game,
and that each individual strategy is influenced by some averages of quantities
depending on the states (or the controls as in the present work) of the other
agents. MFGs have been introduced in the pioneering works of J-M. Lasry and
P-L. Lions [17, 18, 19]. Independently and at approximately the same time, the
notion of mean field games arose in the engineering literature, see the works
of M.Y. Huang, P.E. Caines and R.Malham{\'e} [14, 15]. The present work deals
with numerical approximations of mean field games in which the agents interact
through both their states and controls; it follows a more theoretical work by
the second author, [16], which is devoted to the mathematical analysis of the
related systems of nonlocal partial differential equations. There is not much
literature on MFGs in which the agents also interact through their controls,
see [13, 12, 8, 10, 7, 16]. To stress the fact that the latter situation is
considered, we will sometimes use the terminology mean field games of control
and the acronym MFGC.

curvature-based, efficient Persistent Homology scheme for networks and
hypernetworks. We also broaden the proposed method to include more general
types of networks, by using Bloch's extension of Banchoff's work. Moreover, we
show the connection between defect and Forman's Ricci curvature that exists in
the combinatorial setting, thus explaining previous empirical results showing
very strong correlation between Persistent Homology results obtained using
Forman's Morse Theory on the one hand, and Forman's Ricci curvature, on the
other.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Active Flow Control in Experiments
Authors: Dixia Fan, Liu Yang, Michael S Triantafyllou, George Em Karniadakis
Categories: physics.flu-dyn cs.RO
Comments: The first two authors contributed equally to this work
\\
  We demonstrate experimentally the feasibility of applying reinforcement
learning (RL) in flow control problems by automatically discovering active
control strategies without any prior knowledge of the flow physics. We consider
the turbulent flow past a circular cylinder with the aim of reducing the
cylinder drag force or maximizing the power gain efficiency by properly
selecting the rotational speed of two small diameter cylinders, parallel to and
located downstream of the larger cylinder. Given properly designed rewards and
noise reduction techniques, after tens of towing experiments, the RL agent
could discover the optimal control strategy, comparable to the optimal static
control. While RL has been found to be effective in recent computer flow
simulation studies, this is the first time that its effectiveness is
demonstrated experimentally, paving the way for exploring new optimal active
flow control strategies in complex fluid mechanics applications.

Title: Discrimination Among Multiple Cutaneous and Proprioceptive Hand Percepts
  Evoked by Nerve Stimulation with Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays in Human
  Amputees
Authors: David M. Page, Suzanne M. Wendelken, Tyler S. Davis, David T. Kluger,

\\
  Objective: This paper aims to demonstrate functional discriminability among
restored hand sensations with different locations, qualities, and intensities
that are evoked by microelectrode stimulation of residual afferent fibers in
human amputees. Methods: We implanted a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (USEA) in
the median and ulnar residual arm nerves of three transradial amputees and
delivered stimulation via different electrodes and at different frequencies to
produce various locations, qualities, and intensities of sensation on the
missing hand. Blind discrimination trials were performed to determine how well
subjects could discriminate among these restored sensations. Results: Subjects
discriminated among restored sensory percepts with varying cutaneous and
proprioceptive locations, qualities, and intensities in blind trials, including
discrimination among up to 10 different location-intensity combinations (15/30
successes, p < 0.0005). Variations in the site of stimulation within the nerve,
via electrode selection, enabled discrimination among up to 5 locations and
qualities (35/35 successes, p < 0.0001). Variations in the stimulation
frequency enabled discrimination among 4 different intensities at the same
location (13/20 successes, p < 0.005). One subject discriminated among
simultaneous, alternating, and isolated stimulation of two different USEA
electrodes, as may be desired during multi-sensor closed-loop prosthesis use
(20/25 successes, p < 0.001). Conclusion: USEA stimulation enables encoding of
a diversity of functionally discriminable sensations with different locations,
qualities, and intensities. Significance: These percepts provide a potentially
rich source of sensory feedback that may enhance performance and embodiment
during multi-sensor, closed-loop prosthesis use.

Title: Algorithm to enumerate superspecial Howe curves of genus $4$
Authors: Momonari Kudo and Shushi Harashita
Categories: math.NT cs.SC math.AG
Comments: 18 pages. Magma codes used to obtain the main results will be appear

\\
  A Howe curve is a curve of genus $4$ obtained as the fiber product over
$\mathbf{P}^1$ of two elliptic curves. Any Howe curve is canonical. This paper
provides an efficient algorithm to find superspecial Howe curves and that to
enumerate their isomorphism classes. We discuss not only an algorithm to test
the superspeciality but also an algorithm to test isomorphisms for Howe curves.
Our algorithms are much more efficient than conventional ones proposed by the
authors so far for general canonical curves. We show the existence of a
superspecial Howe curve in characteristic $7<p\le 331$ and enumerate the
isomorphism classes of superspecial Howe curves in characteristic $p\le 53$, by
executing our algorithms over the computer algebra system Magma.

Title: Lightweight Speaker Verification for Online Identification of New
  Speakers with Short Segments
Authors: Ivette Velez, Caleb Rascon, Gibran Fuentes-Pineda
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: This paper is under review as a Submission for Applied Soft Computing
  Journal
\\
  Verifying if two audio segments belong to the same speaker has been recently
put forward as a flexible way to carry out speaker identification, since it
does not require to be re-trained when new speakers appear on the auditory
scene. However, many of the current techniques employ a considerably high
amount of memory, and require a specific minimum audio segment length to obtain
good performances. This limits the applicability in areas such as service
robots, internet of things and virtual assistants. In this work we propose a
BLSTM-based model that reaches a level of performance comparable to the current
state of the art when using short input audio segments, while requiring a
considerably less amount of memory. Further, as far as we know, a complete
speaker identification system has not been reported using this verification
paradigm. Thus, we present a complete online speaker identifier, based on a
simple voting system that shows that the proposed BLSTM-based model and the
current state of the art are similarly accurate at identifying speakers online.

Title: Enhancing End-to-End Multi-channel Speech Separation via Spatial Feature
  Learning
Authors: Rongzhi Gu, Shi-Xiong Zhang, Lianwu Chen, Yong Xu, Meng Yu, Dan Su,

\\
  Hand-crafted spatial features (e.g., inter-channel phase difference, IPD)
play a fundamental role in recent deep learning based multi-channel speech
separation (MCSS) methods. However, these manually designed spatial features
are hard to incorporate into the end-to-end optimized MCSS framework. In this
work, we propose an integrated architecture for learning spatial features
directly from the multi-channel speech waveforms within an end-to-end speech
separation framework. In this architecture, time-domain filters spanning signal
channels are trained to perform adaptive spatial filtering. These filters are
implemented by a 2d convolution (conv2d) layer and their parameters are
optimized using a speech separation objective function in a purely data-driven
fashion. Furthermore, inspired by the IPD formulation, we design a conv2d
kernel to compute the inter-channel convolution differences (ICDs), which are
expected to provide the spatial cues that help to distinguish the directional
sources. Evaluation results on simulated multi-channel reverberant WSJ0 2-mix
dataset demonstrate that our proposed ICD based MCSS model improves the overall
signal-to-distortion ratio by 10.4\% over the IPD based MCSS model.

Title: Sparse and Cosparse Audio Dequantization Using Convex Optimization
Authors: Pavel Z\'avi\v{s}ka and Pavel Rajmic
Categories: eess.SP cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  The paper shows the potential of sparsity-based methods in restoring
quantized signals. Following up on the study of Brauer et. al. (IEEE ICASSP
2016), we significantly extend the range of the evaluation scenarios: we
introduce the analysis (cosparse) model, we use more effective algorithms, we
experiment with another time-frequency transform. The paper shows that the
analysis-based model performs comparably to the synthesis-model, but the Gabor
transform produces better results than the originally used cosine transform.
Last but not least, we provide codes and data in a reproducible way.

Title: Ranking the spreading influence of nodes in complex networks based on
  mixing degree centrality and local structure
Authors: Pengli Lu and Chen Dong
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.SI
\\
  The safety and robustness of the network have attracted the attention of
people from all walks of life, and the damage of several key nodes will lead to
extremely serious consequences. In this paper, we proposed the clustering
H-index mixing (CHM) centrality based on the H- index of the node itself and
the relative distance of its neighbors. Starting from the node itself and
combining with the topology around the node, the importance of the node and its
spreading capability were determined. In order to evaluate the performance of
the proposed method, we use Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model,
monotonicity and resolution as the evaluation standard of experiment.
Experimental results in artificial networks and real-world networks show that
CHM centrality has excellent performance in identifying node importance and its
spreading capability.

Title: Combining surveys and sensors to explore student behaviour
Authors: Inkeri Kontro, Mathieu G\'enois
Categories: physics.ed-ph cs.SI physics.soc-ph
\\
  Student belongingness is important for successful study paths, and group work
forms an important part of modern university physics education. To study the
group dynamics of introductory physics students at the University of Helsinki,
we collected network data from seven laboratory course sections of
approximately 20 students each for seven consecutive weeks. The data was
collected via the SocioPatterns platform, and supplemented with students' major
subject, year of study and gender. We also collected the Mechanics Baseline
Test to measure physics knowledge and the Colorado Learning Attitudes about
Science Survey to measure attitudes. We developed metrics for studying the
small networks of the laboratory sessions by using connections of the teaching
assistant as a constant. In the network, we found both demographically
homogeneous and heterogeneous groups that are stable. While some students are
consistently loosely connected to their networks, we were not able to identify
risk factors. Based on our results, the physics laboratory course is equally
successful in building strongly connected groups regardless of student
demographics in the sections or the formed small groups. SocioPatterns
supplemented with surveys thus provides an opportunity to look into the
dynamics of students' social networks.

Title: A Discrete-Time, Time-Delayed Lur'e Model with Biased Self-Excited
  Oscillations
Authors: Juan Paredes, Syed Aseem Ul Islam, Omran Kouba and Dennis S. Bernstein

\\
  Self-excited systems arise in many applications, such as biochemical systems,
mechanical systems with fluid-structure interaction, and fuel-driven systems
with combustion dynamics. This paper presents a Lur'e model that exhibits
biased self-excited oscillations under constant inputs. The model involves
asymptotically stable linear dynamics, time delay, a washout filter, and a
saturation nonlinearity. For all sufficiently large scalings of the loop
transfer function, these components cause divergence under small signal levels
and decay under large signal amplitudes, thus producing an oscillatory
response. A bias-generation mechanism is used to specify the mean of the
oscillation. The main contribution of the paper is a detailed analysis of a
discrete-time version of this model.

Title: Differences in Perspective on Inertial Measurement Unit Sensor
  Integration in Myoelectric Control
Authors: Evan Campbell and Angkoon Phinyomark and Erik Scheme
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: Submitted to 2020 MEC (Myoelectric Control) conference
\\
  Recent human computer-interaction (HCI) studies using electromyography (EMG)
and inertial measurement units (IMUs) for upper-limb gesture recognition have
claimed that inertial measurements alone result in higher classification
accuracy than EMG. In biomedical research such as in prosthesis control,
however, EMG remains the gold standard for providing gesture specific
information, exceeding the performance of IMUs alone. This study, therefore,
presents a preliminary investigation of these conflicting claims between these
converging research fields. Previous claims from both fields were verified
within this study using publicly available datasets. The conflicting claims
were found to stem from differences in terminology and experimental design.
Specifically, HCI studies were found to exploit positional variation to
increase separation between similar hand gestures. Conversely, in clinical
applications such as prosthetics, position invariant gestures are
preferred.This work therefore suggests that future studies explicitly outline
experimental approaches to better differentiate between gesture recognition
approaches.

Title: A Comparison of Amputee and Able-Bodied Inter-Subject Variability in
  Myoelectric Control
Authors: Evan Campbell and Jason Chang and Angkoon Phinyomark and Erik Scheme
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: Submitted to MEC 2020 (Myoelectric Control) Conference
\\
  Despite decades of research and development of pattern recognition
approaches, the clinical usability of myoelectriccontrolled prostheses is still
limited. One of the main issues is the high inter-subject variability that
necessitates long and frequent user-specific training. Cross-user models
present an opportunity to improve clinical viability of myoelectric control
systems by leveraging existing data to shorten training. However, due to the
difficulty of obtaining large sets of data from amputee populations, data from
intact-limbed subjects are often supplemented when building cross-user models;
which may not translate well to clinical usability. In this preliminary study,
the differences between intact-limbed and amputee cross-user electromyography
(EMG) patterns were examined. Previously collected EMG data from 20 intact
limbed and 10 amputee subjects for different wrist, finger, and grasping
gestures were analysed. Results using unsupervised clustering showed that
amputees were consistently grouped into a different cluster than intact-limbed
subjects and that additional clustering into more subgroups found larger
differences between amputees than able-bodied subjects. Furthermore, a simple
linear classifier was able to discriminate between able-bodied and amputee
subjects using EMG from multiple gestures with 90% accuracy. These results
suggest that using able-bodied subject data alone may be insufficient to
capture the necessary inter-subject variance when designing cross-user
myoelectric control systems for prosthesis control.

Title: Greedy Finite-Horizon Covariance Steering for Discrete-Time Stochastic
  Nonlinear Systems Based on the Unscented Transform
Authors: Efstathios Bakolas and Alexandros Tsolovikos
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  In this work, we consider the problem of steering the first two moments of
the uncertain state of a discrete time nonlinear stochastic system to
prescribed goal quantities at a given final time. In principle, the latter
problem can be formulated as a density tracking problem, which seeks for a
feedback policy that will keep the probability density function of the state of
the system close, in terms of an appropriate metric, to the goal density. The
solution to the latter infinite-dimensional problem can be, however, a complex
and computationally expensive task. Instead, we propose a more tractable and
intuitive approach which relies on a greedy control policy. The latter control
policy is comprised of the first elements of the control policies that solve a
sequence of corresponding linearized covariance steering problems. Each of
these covariance steering problems relies only on information available about
the state mean and state covariance at the current stage and can be formulated
as a tractable (finite-dimensional) convex program. At each stage, the
information on the state statistics is updated by computing approximations of
the predicted state mean and covariance of the resulting closed-loop nonlinear
system at the next stage by utilizing the (scaled) unscented transform.
Numerical simulations that illustrate the key ideas of our approach are also
presented.
