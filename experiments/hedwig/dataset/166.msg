Title: Mario Level Generation From Mechanics Using Scene Stitching
Authors: Michael Cerny Green, Luvneesh Mugrai, Ahmed Khalifa and Julian
  Togelius
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Foundations of Digital Games
  Conference
\\
  This paper presents a level generation method for Super Mario by stitching
together pre-generated "scenes" that contain specific mechanics, using
mechanic-sequences from agent playthroughs as input specifications. Given a
sequence of mechanics, our system uses an FI-2Pop algorithm and a corpus of
scenes to perform automated level authoring. The system outputs levels that
have a similar mechanical sequence to the target mechanic sequence but with a
different playthrough experience. We compare our system to a greedy method that
selects scenes that maximize the target mechanics. Our system is able to
maximize the number of matched mechanics while reducing emergent mechanics
using the stitching process compared to the greedy approach.

Title: Cognitive Anthropomorphism of AI: How Humans and Computers Classify
  Images
Authors: Shane T. Mueller
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV cs.CY
\\
  Modern AI image classifiers have made impressive advances in recent years,
but their performance often appears strange or violates expectations of users.
This suggests humans engage in cognitive anthropomorphism: expecting AI to have
the same nature as human intelligence. This mismatch presents an obstacle to
appropriate human-AI interaction. To delineate this mismatch, I examine known
properties of human classification, in comparison to image classifier systems.
Based on this examination, I offer three strategies for system design that can
address the mismatch between human and AI classification: explainable AI, novel
methods for training users, and new algorithms that match human cognition.

Title: Diversity and Inclusion Metrics in Subset Selection

Categories: cs.AI
Journal-ref: AIES 2020: Proceedings of the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics,
  and Society
DOI: 10.1145/3375627.3375832
\\
  The ethical concept of fairness has recently been applied in machine learning
(ML) settings to describe a wide range of constraints and objectives. When
considering the relevance of ethical concepts to subset selection problems, the
concepts of diversity and inclusion are additionally applicable in order to
create outputs that account for social power and access differentials. We
introduce metrics based on these concepts, which can be applied together,
separately, and in tandem with additional fairness constraints. Results from
human subject experiments lend support to the proposed criteria. Social choice
methods can additionally be leveraged to aggregate and choose preferable sets,
and we detail how these may be applied.

Title: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Using Dynamic Attention Model
  for Vehicle Routing Problems
Authors: Bo Peng and Jiahai Wang and Zizhen Zhang
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 15 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Recent researches show that machine learning has the potential to learn
better heuristics than the one designed by human for solving combinatorial
optimization problems. The deep neural network is used to characterize the
input instance for constructing a feasible solution incrementally. Recently, an
attention model is proposed to solve routing problems. In this model, the state
of an instance is represented by node features that are fixed over time.
However, the fact is, the state of an instance is changed according to the
decision that the model made at different construction steps, and the node
features should be updated correspondingly. Therefore, this paper presents a
dynamic attention model with dynamic encoder-decoder architecture, which
enables the model to explore node features dynamically and exploit hidden
structure information effectively at different construction steps. This paper
focuses on a challenging NP-hard problem, vehicle routing problem. The
experiments indicate that our model outperforms the previous methods and also
shows a good generalization performance.

Title: Explainable Deep RDFS Reasoner
Authors: Bassem Makni, Ibrahim Abdelaziz, James Hendler
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: StarAI 2020
\\
  Recent research efforts aiming to bridge the Neural-Symbolic gap for RDFS
reasoning proved empirically that deep learning techniques can be used to learn
RDFS inference rules. However, one of their main deficiencies compared to
rule-based reasoners is the lack of derivations for the inferred triples (i.e.
explainability in AI terms). In this paper, we build on these approaches to
provide not only the inferred graph but also explain how these triples were
inferred. In the graph words approach, RDF graphs are represented as a sequence
of graph words where inference can be achieved through neural machine
translation. To achieve explainability in RDFS reasoning, we revisit this
approach and introduce a new neural network model that gets the input graph--as
a sequence of graph words-- as well as the encoding of the inferred triple and
outputs the derivation for the inferred triple. We evaluated our justification
model on two datasets: a synthetic dataset-- LUBM benchmark-- and a real-world
dataset --ScholarlyData about conferences-- where the lowest validation
accuracy approached 96%.

Title: A Novel Kuhnian Ontology for Epistemic Classification of STM Scholarly
  Articles
Authors: Khalid M. Saqr, Abdelrahman Elsharawy
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Thomas Kuhn proposed his paradigmatic view of scientific discovery five
decades ago. The concept of paradigm has not only explained the progress of
science, but has also become the central epistemic concept among STM
scientists. Here, we adopt the principles of Kuhnian philosophy to construct a
novel ontology aims at classifying and evaluating the impact of STM scholarly
articles. First, we explain how the Kuhnian cycle of science describes research
at different epistemic stages. Second, we show how the Kuhnian cycle could be
reconstructed into modular ontologies which classify scholarly articles
according to their contribution to paradigm-centred knowledge. The proposed
ontology and its scenarios are discussed. To the best of the authors knowledge,
this is the first attempt for creating an ontology for describing scholarly
articles based on the Kuhnian paradigmatic view of science.

Title: iDCR: Improved Dempster Combination Rule for Multisensor Fault Diagnosis
Authors: Nimisha Ghosh, Sayantan Saha, Rourab Paul
Categories: cs.AI cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Data gathered from multiple sensors can be effectively fused for accurate
monitoring of many engineering applications. In the last few years, one of the
most sought after applications for multi sensor fusion has been fault
diagnosis. Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence along with Dempsters Combination
Rule is a very popular method for multi sensor fusion which can be successfully
applied to fault diagnosis. But if the information obtained from the different
sensors shows high conflict, the classical Dempsters Combination Rule may
produce counter-intuitive result. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper
proposes an improved combination rule for multi sensor data fusion. Numerical
examples have been put forward to show the effectiveness of the proposed
method. Comparative analysis has also been carried out with existing methods to
show the superiority of the proposed method in multi sensor fault diagnosis.

Title: Testing Unsatisfiability of Constraint Satisfaction Problems via Tensor
  Products
Authors: Daya Gaur and Muhammad Khan
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: ISAIM 2020, International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and
  Mathematics
MSC-class: 68T20
ACM-class: I.2.8
\\
  We study the design of stochastic local search methods to prove
unsatisfiability of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). For a binary CSP,
such methods have been designed using the microstructure of the CSP. Here, we
develop a method to decompose the microstructure into graph tensors. We show
how to use the tensor decomposition to compute a proof of unsatisfiability
efficiently and in parallel. We also offer substantial empirical evidence that
our approach improves the praxis. For instance, one decomposition yields proofs
of unsatisfiability in half the time without sacrificing the quality. Another
decomposition is twenty times faster and effective three-tenths of the times
compared to the prior method. Our method is applicable to arbitrary CSPs using
the well known dual and hidden variable transformations from an arbitrary CSP
to a binary CSP.

  The literature on machine teaching, machine education, and curriculum design
for machines is in its infancy with sparse papers on the topic primarily
focusing on data and model engineering factors to improve machine learning. In
this paper, we first discuss selected attempts to date on machine teaching and
education. We then bring theories and methodologies together from human
education to structure and mathematically define the core problems in lesson
design for machine education and the modelling approaches required to support
the steps for machine education. Last, but not least, we offer an
ontology-based methodology to guide the development of lesson plans to produce
transparent and explainable modular learning machines, including neural
networks.

Title: Overview of chemical ontologies
Authors: Christian Pachl, Nils Frank, Jan Breitbart, Stefan Br\"ase
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 2 Figures
\\
  Ontologies order and interconnect knowledge of a certain field in a formal
and semantic way so that they are machine-parsable. They try to define allwhere
acceptable definition of concepts and objects, classify them, provide
properties as well as interconnect them with relations (e.g. "A is a special
case of B"). More precisely, Tom Gruber defines Ontologies as a "specification
of a conceptualization; [...] a description (like a formal specification of a
program) of the concepts and relationships that can exist for an agent or a
community of agents." [1] An Ontology is made of Individuals which are
organized in Classes. Both can have Attributes and Relations among themselves.
Some complex Ontologies define Restrictions, Rules and Events which change
attributes or relations. To be computer accessible they are written in certain
ontology languages, like the OBO language or the more used Common Algebraic
Specification Language. With the rising of a digitalized, interconnected and
globalized world, where common standards have to be found, ontologies are of
great interest. [2] Yet, the development of chemical ontologies is in the
beginning. Indeed, some interesting basic approaches towards chemical
ontologies can be found, but nevertheless they suffer from two main flaws.
Firstly, we found that they are mostly only fragmentary completed or are still
in an architecture state. Secondly, apparently no chemical ontology is
widespread accepted. Therefore, we herein try to describe the major
ontology-developments in the chemical related fields Ontologies about chemical
analytical methods, Ontologies about name reactions and Ontologies about
scientific units.

Title: A Model of Fast Concept Inference with Object-Factorized Cognitive
  Programs
Authors: Daniel P. Sawyer, Miguel L\'azaro-Gredilla, Dileep George
Categories: cs.AI cs.RO
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables
\\
  The ability of humans to quickly identify general concepts from a handful of
images has proven difficult to emulate with robots. Recently, a computer
architecture was developed that allows robots to mimic some aspects of this
human ability by modeling concepts as cognitive programs using an instruction
set of primitive cognitive functions. This allowed a robot to emulate human
imagination by simulating candidate programs in a world model before
generalizing to the physical world. However, this model used a naive search
algorithm that required 30 minutes to discover a single concept, and became
intractable for programs with more than 20 instructions. To circumvent this
bottleneck, we present an algorithm that emulates the human cognitive
heuristics of object factorization and sub-goaling, allowing human-level
inference speed, improving accuracy, and making the output more explainable.

Title: RVCoreP : An optimized RISC-V soft processor of five-stage pipelining

\\
  RISC-V is a RISC based open and loyalty free instruction set architecture
which has been developed since 2010, and can be used for cost-effective soft
processors on FPGAs. The basic 32-bit integer instruction set in RISC-V is
defined as RV32I, which is sufficient to support the operating system
environment and suits for embedded systems. In this paper, we propose an
optimized RV32I soft processor named RVCoreP adopting five-stage pipelining.
The processor applies three effective optimization methods to improve the
operating frequency. These methods are instruction fetch unit optimization
including pipelined branch prediction mechanism, ALU optimization, and data
alignment and sign-extension optimization for data memory output. We implement
RVCoreP in Verilog HDL and verify the behavior using Verilog simulation and an
actual Xilinx Atrix-7 FPGA board. We evaluate IPC (instructions per cycle),
operating frequency, hardware resource utilization, and processor performance.
>From the evaluation results, we show that RVCoreP achieves 30.0% performance
improvement compared with VexRiscv, which is a high-performance and open source
RV32I processor selected from some related works.

  RISC-V is an open and royalty free instruction set architecture which has
been developed at the University of California, Berkeley. The processors using
RISC-V can be designed and released freely. Because of this, various processor
cores and system on chips (SoCs) have been released so far. However, there are
a few public RISC-V computer systems that are portable and can boot Linux
operating systems. In this paper, we describe a portable and Linux capable
RISC-V computer system targeting FPGAs in Verilog HDL. This system can be
implemented on an FPGA with fewer hardware resources, and can be implemented on
low cost FPGAs or customized by introducing an accelerator. This paper also
describes the knowledge obtained through the development of this RISC-V

Title: Rainbow: A Composable Coherence Protocol for Multi-Chip Servers
Authors: Lucia G. Menezo, Valentin Puente, and Jose A. Gregorio
Categories: cs.AR
\\
  The use of multi-chip modules (MCM) and/or multi-socket boards is the most
suitable approach to increase the computation density of servers while keep
chip yield attained. This paper introduces a new coherence protocol suitable,
in terms of complexity and scalability, for this class of systems. The proposal
uses two complementary ideas: (1) A mechanism that dissociates complexity from
performance by means of colored-token counting, (2) A construct that optimizes
performance and cost by means of two functionally symmetrical modules working
in the last level cache of each chip (D|F-LLC) and each memory controller
(D|F-MEM). Each of these structures is divided into two parts: (2.1) The first
one consists of a small loosely inclusive sparse directory where only the most
actively shared data are tracked in the chip (D-LLC) from each memory
controller (D-MEM) and, (2.2) The second is a d-left Counting Bloom Filter
which stores approximate information about the blocks allocated, either inside
the chip (F-LLC) or in the home memory controller (F-MEM). The coordinated work
of both structures minimizes the coherence-related effects on the average
memory latency perceived by the processor. Our proposal is able to improve on
the performance of a HyperTransport-like coherence protocol by from 25%-to-60%.

Title: On Unbalanced Optimal Transport: An Analysis of Sinkhorn Algorithm
Authors: Khiem Pham and Khang Le and Nhat Ho and Tung Pham and Hung Bui
Categories: cs.CC cs.DS math.OC stat.ML
Comments: The first two authors contributed equally to this work
\\
  We provide a computational complexity analysis for the Sinkhorn algorithm
that solves the entropic regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) problem
between two measures of possibly different masses with at most $n$ components.
We show that the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for finding an
$\varepsilon$-approximate solution to the UOT problem is of order
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2/ \varepsilon)$, which is near-linear time. To the
best of our knowledge, this complexity is better than the complexity of the
Sinkhorn algorithm for solving the Optimal Transport (OT) problem, which is of
order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$. Our proof technique is
based on the geometric convergence of the Sinkhorn updates to the optimal dual
solution of the entropic regularized UOT problem and some properties of the
primal solution. It is also different from the proof for the complexity of the
Sinkhorn algorithm for approximating the OT problem since the UOT solution does
not have to meet the marginal constraints.

Title: Optimal polynomial-time compression for Boolean Max CSP
Authors: Bart M.P. Jansen and Micha{\l} W{\l}odarczyk
Categories: cs.CC cs.DS
\\
  In the Boolean maximum constraint satisfaction problem - Max CSP$(\Gamma)$ -
one is given a collection of weighted applications of constraints from a finite
constraint language $\Gamma$, over a common set of variables, and the goal is
to assign Boolean values to the variables so that the total weight of satisfied
constraints is maximized. There exists an elegant dichotomy theorem providing a
criterion on $\Gamma$ for the problem to be polynomial-time solvable and
stating that otherwise it becomes NP-hard. We study the NP hard cases through
the lens of kernelization and provide a complete characterization of Max
CSP$(\Gamma)$ with respect to the optimal compression size. Namely, we prove
that Max CSP$(\Gamma)$ parameterized by the number of variables $n$ is either
polynomial-time solvable, or there exists an integer $d \ge 2$ depending on
$\Gamma$, such that
  1. An instance of \textsc{Max CSP$(\Gamma)$} can be compressed into an
equivalent instance with $O(n^d\log n)$ bits in polynomial time,
  2. Max CSP$(\Gamma)$ does not admit such a compression to $O(n^{d-\epsilon})$
bits unless $\text{NP} \subseteq \text{co-NP} / \text{poly}$.
  Our reductions are based on interpreting constraints as multilinear
polynomials combined with the framework of constraint implementations. As
another application of our reductions, we reveal tight connections between
optimal running times for solving Max CSP$(\Gamma)$. More precisely, we show
that obtaining a running time of the form $O(2^{(1-\epsilon)n})$ for particular
classes of Max CSPs is as hard as breaching this barrier for Max $d$-SAT for
some $d$.

  We analyze the computational complexity of several new variants of
edge-matching puzzles. First we analyze inequality (instead of equality)
constraints between adjacent tiles, proving the problem NP-complete for strict
inequalities but polynomial for nonstrict inequalities. Second we analyze three
types of triangular edge matching, of which one is polynomial and the other two
are NP-complete; all three are #P-complete. Third we analyze the case where no
target shape is specified, and we merely want to place the (square) tiles so
that edges match (exactly); this problem is NP-complete. Fourth we consider
four 2-player games based on $1 \times n$ edge matching, all four of which are
PSPACE-complete. Most of our NP-hardness reductions are parsimonious, newly
proving #P and ASP-completeness for, e.g., $1 \times n$ edge matching.

\\
  We prove a Pumping Lemma for the noncooperative abstract Tile Assembly Model,
a model central to the theory of algorithmic self-assembly since the beginning
of the field. This theory suggests, and our result proves, that small
differences in the nature of adhesive bindings between abstract square
molecules gives rise to vastly different expressive capabilities.
  In the cooperative abstract Tile Assembly Model, square tiles attach to each
other using multi-sided cooperation of one, two or more sides. This precise
control of tile binding is directly exploited for algorithmic tasks including
growth of specified shapes using very few tile types, as well as simulation of
Turing machines and even self-simulation of self-assembly systems. But are
cooperative bindings required for these computational tasks? The definitionally
simpler noncooperative (or Temperature 1) model has poor control over local
binding events: tiles stick if they bind on at least one side. This has led to
the conjecture that it is impossible for it to exhibit precisely controlled
growth of computationally-defined shapes.
  Here, we prove such an impossibility result. We show that any planar
noncooperative system that attempts to grow large algorithmically-controlled
tile-efficient assemblies must also grow infinite non-algorithmic (pumped)
structures with a simple closed-form description, or else suffer blocking of
intended algorithmic structures. Our result holds for both directed and
nondirected systems, and gives an explicit upper bound of
$(8|T|)^{4|T|+1}(5|\sigma| + 6)$, where $|T|$ is the size of the tileset and
$|\sigma|$ is the size of the seed assembly, beyond which any path of tiles is
pumpable or blockable.

Title: An efficient algorithm for numerical homogenization of fluid filled
  porous solids: part-I
Authors: Saumik Dana and Mary F Wheeler
Categories: cs.CE
\\
  The concept of representative volume element or RVE is invoked to develop an
algorithm for numerical homogenization of fluid filled porous solids. RVE based
methods decouple analysis of a composite material into analyses at the local
and global levels. The local level analysis models the microstructural details
to determine effective properties by applying boundary conditions to the RVE
and solving the resultant boundary value problem. The composite structure is
then replaced by an equivalent homogeneous material having the calculated
effective properties. We combine the features of two techniques: one is the
definition of a displacement field for the fluid phase to allow for a
definition of a continuous displacement field across the microstructure and the
other is the $FE^2$ numerical homogenization that couples the macroscale with
the RVE scale via gauss points.

\\
  Metallic open cell foams have multiple applications in industry, e. g. as
catalyst supports in chemical processes. Their regular or heterogeneous
microscopic structure determines the macroscopic thermodynamic and chemical
properties. We present an object-oriented python library that generates state
space models for simulation and control from the microscopic foam data, which
can be imported from the image processing tool iMorph. The foam topology and
the 3D geometric data are the basis for discrete modeling of the balance laws
using the cell method. While the material structure imposes a primal chain
complex to define discrete thermodynamic driving forces, the internal energy
balance is evaluated on a second chain complex, which is constructed by
topological duality. The heat exchange between the solid and the fluid phase is
described based on the available surface data. We illustrate in detail the
construction of the dual chain complexes, and we show how the structured
discrete model directly maps to the software objects of the python code. As a
test case, we present simulation results for a foam with a Kelvin cell
structure, and compare them to a surrogate finite element model with
homogeneous parameters.

Title: Snippext: Semi-supervised Opinion Mining with Augmented Data

  Online services are interested in solutions to opinion mining, which is the
problem of extracting aspects, opinions, and sentiments from text. One method
to mine opinions is to leverage the recent success of pre-trained language
models which can be fine-tuned to obtain high-quality extractions from reviews.
However, fine-tuning language models still requires a non-trivial amount of
training data. In this paper, we study the problem of how to significantly
reduce the amount of labeled training data required in fine-tuning language
models for opinion mining. We describe Snippext, an opinion mining system
developed over a language model that is fine-tuned through semi-supervised
learning with augmented data. A novelty of Snippext is its clever use of a
two-prong approach to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with little
labeled training data through: (1) data augmentation to automatically generate
more labeled training data from existing ones, and (2) a semi-supervised
learning technique to leverage the massive amount of unlabeled data in addition
to the (limited amount of) labeled data. We show with extensive experiments
that Snippext performs comparably and can even exceed previous SOTA results on
several opinion mining tasks with only half the training data required.
Furthermore, it achieves new SOTA results when all training data are leveraged.
By comparison to a baseline pipeline, we found that Snippext extracts
significantly more fine-grained opinions which enable new opportunities of
downstream applications.

Title: autoNLP: NLP Feature Recommendations for Text Analytics Applications
Authors: Janardan Misra
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  While designing machine learning based text analytics applications, often,
NLP data scientists manually determine which NLP features to use based upon
their knowledge and experience with related problems. This results in increased
efforts during feature engineering process and renders automated reuse of
features across semantically related applications inherently difficult. In this
paper, we argue for standardization in feature specification by outlining
structure of a language for specifying NLP features and present an approach for
their reuse across applications to increase likelihood of identifying optimal
features.

Title: Description Based Text Classification with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Duo Chai, Wei Wu, Qinghong Han, Fei Wu, Jiwei Li
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The task of text classification is usually divided into two stages: {\it text
feature extraction} and {\it classification}. In this standard formalization
categories are merely represented as indexes in the label vocabulary, and the
model lacks for explicit instructions on what to classify. Inspired by the
current trend of formalizing NLP problems as question answering tasks, we
propose a new framework for text classification, in which each category label
is associated with a category description. Descriptions are generated by
hand-crafted templates or using abstractive/extractive models from
reinforcement learning. The concatenation of the description and the text is
fed to the classifier to decide whether or not the current label should be
assigned to the text. The proposed strategy forces the model to attend to the
most salient texts with respect to the label, which can be regarded as a hard
version of attention, leading to better performances. We observe significant
performance boosts over strong baselines on a wide range of text classification
tasks including single-label classification, multi-label classification and
multi-aspect sentiment analysis.

Title: Blank Language Models
Authors: Tianxiao Shen, Victor Quach, Regina Barzilay, Tommi Jaakkola
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  We propose Blank Language Model (BLM), a model that generates sequences by
dynamically creating and filling in blanks. Unlike previous masked language
models or the Insertion Transformer, BLM uses blanks to control which part of
the sequence to expand. This fine-grained control of generation is ideal for a
variety of text editing and rewriting tasks. The model can start from a single
blank or partially completed text with blanks at specified locations. It
iteratively determines which word to place in a blank and whether to insert new
blanks, and stops generating when no blanks are left to fill. BLM can be
efficiently trained using a lower bound of the marginal data likelihood, and
achieves perplexity comparable to traditional left-to-right language models on
the Penn Treebank and WikiText datasets. On the task of filling missing text
snippets, BLM significantly outperforms all other baselines in terms of both
accuracy and fluency. Experiments on style transfer and damaged ancient text
restoration demonstrate the potential of this framework for a wide range of
applications.

Title: LAVA NAT: A Non-Autoregressive Translation Model with Look-Around
  Decoding and Vocabulary Attention
Authors: Xiaoya Li, Yuxian Meng, Arianna Yuan, Fei Wu, Jiwei Li
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models generate multiple tokens in one
forward pass and is highly efficient at inference stage compared with
autoregressive translation (AT) methods. However, NAT models often suffer from
the multimodality problem, i.e., generating duplicated tokens or missing
tokens. In this paper, we propose two novel methods to address this issue, the
Look-Around (LA) strategy and the Vocabulary Attention (VA) mechanism. The
Look-Around strategy predicts the neighbor tokens in order to predict the
current token, and the Vocabulary Attention models long-term token dependencies
inside the decoder by attending the whole vocabulary for each position to
acquire knowledge of which token is about to generate. %We also propose a
dynamic bidirectional decoding approach to accelerate the inference process of
the LAVA model while preserving the high-quality of the generated output. Our
proposed model uses significantly less time during inference compared with
autoregressive models and most other NAT models. Our experiments on four
benchmarks (WMT14 En$\rightarrow$De, WMT14 De$\rightarrow$En, WMT16
Ro$\rightarrow$En and IWSLT14 De$\rightarrow$En) show that the proposed model
achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art
non-autoregressive and autoregressive models while significantly reducing the
time cost in inference phase.

  This paper proposes a chatbot framework that adopts a hybrid model which
consists of a knowledge graph and a text similarity model. Based on this
chatbot framework, we build HHH, an online question-and-answer (QA) Healthcare
Helper system for answering complex medical questions. HHH maintains a
knowledge graph constructed from medical data collected from the Internet. HHH
also implements a novel text representation and similarity deep learning model,
Hierarchical BiLSTM Attention Model (HBAM), to find the most similar question
from a large QA dataset. We compare HBAM with other state-of-the-art language
models such as bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT)
and Manhattan LSTM Model (MaLSTM). We train and test the models with a subset
of the Quora duplicate questions dataset in the medical area. The experimental
results show that our model is able to achieve a superior performance than
these existing methods.

Title: Mining Commonsense Facts from the Physical World
Authors: Yanyan Zou
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Textual descriptions of the physical world implicitly mention commonsense
facts, while the commonsense knowledge bases explicitly represent such facts as
triples. Compared to dramatically increased text data, the coverage of existing
knowledge bases is far away from completion. Most of the prior studies on
populating knowledge bases mainly focus on Freebase. To automatically complete
commonsense knowledge bases to improve their coverage is under-explored. In
this paper, we propose a new task of mining commonsense facts from the raw text
that describes the physical world. We build an effective new model that fuses
information from both sequence text and existing knowledge base resource. Then
we create two large annotated datasets each with approximate 200k instances for
commonsense knowledge base completion. Empirical results demonstrate that our
model significantly outperforms baselines.

Title: Rough Set based Aggregate Rank Measure & its Application to Supervised
  Multi Document Summarization
Authors: Nidhika Yadav, Niladri Chatterjee
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: The paper proposes a novel Rough Set based technique to compute rank
  in a decision system. This is further evaluated on the problem of Supervised
  Text Summarization. The paper contains 9 pages, illustrative examples,
  theoretical properties, and experimental evaluations on standard datasets
\\
  Most problems in Machine Learning cater to classification and the objects of
universe are classified to a relevant class. Ranking of classified objects of
universe per decision class is a challenging problem. We in this paper propose
a novel Rough Set based membership called Rank Measure to solve to this
problem. It shall be utilized for ranking the elements to a particular class.
It differs from Pawlak Rough Set based membership function which gives an
equivalent characterization of the Rough Set based approximations. It becomes
paramount to look beyond the traditional approach of computing memberships
while handling inconsistent, erroneous and missing data that is typically
present in real world problems. This led us to propose the aggregate Rank
Measure. The contribution of the paper is three fold. Firstly, it proposes a
Rough Set based measure to be utilized for numerical characterization of within
class ranking of objects. Secondly, it proposes and establish the properties of
Rank Measure and aggregate Rank Measure based membership. Thirdly, we apply the
concept of membership and aggregate ranking to the problem of supervised Multi
Document Summarization wherein first the important class of sentences are
determined using various supervised learning techniques and are post processed
using the proposed ranking measure. The results proved to have significant
improvement in accuracy.

  Similarity Matrix based CNN

ACM-class: I.7.0
\\
  Short text is becoming more and more popular on the web, such as Chat
Message, SMS and Product Reviews. Accurately classifying short text is an
important and challenging task. A number of studies have difficulties in
addressing this problem because of the word ambiguity and data sparsity. To
address this issue, we propose a knowledge powered attention with similarity
matrix based convolutional neural network (KASM) model, which can compute
comprehensive information by utilizing the knowledge and deep neural network.
We use knowledge graph (KG) to enrich the semantic representation of short
text, specially, the information of parent-entity is introduced in our model.
Meanwhile, we consider the word interaction in the literal-level between short
text and the representation of label, and utilize similarity matrix based
convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract it. For the purpose of measuring
the importance of knowledge, we introduce the attention mechanisms to choose
the important information. Experimental results on five standard datasets show
that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  Forum discussion data differ in both structure and properties from generic
form of textual data such as news. Henceforth, summarization techniques should,
in turn, make use of such differences, and craft models that can benefit from
the structural nature of discussion data. In this work, we propose attending to
the beginning of a document, to improve the performance of extractive
summarization models when applied to forum discussion data. Evaluations
demonstrated that with the help of bidirectional attention mechanism, attending
to the beginning of a document (initial comment/post) in a discussion thread,
can introduce a consistent boost in ROUGE scores, as well as introducing a new
State Of The Art (SOTA) ROUGE scores on the forum discussions dataset.
Additionally, we explored whether this hypothesis is extendable to other
generic forms of textual data. We make use of the tendency of introducing
important information early in the text, by attending to the first few
sentences in generic textual data. Evaluations demonstrated that attending to
introductory sentences using bidirectional attention, improves the performance
of extractive summarization models when even applied to more generic form of
textual data.

  Training abstractive summarization models typically requires large amounts of
data, which can be a limitation for many domains. In this paper we explore
using domain transfer and data synthesis to improve the performance of recent
abstractive summarization methods when applied to small corpora of student
reflections. First, we explored whether tuning state of the art model trained
on newspaper data could boost performance on student reflection data.
Evaluations demonstrated that summaries produced by the tuned model achieved
higher ROUGE scores compared to model trained on just student reflection data
or just newspaper data. The tuned model also achieved higher scores compared to
extractive summarization baselines, and additionally was judged to produce more
coherent and readable summaries in human evaluations. Second, we explored
whether synthesizing summaries of student data could additionally boost
performance. We proposed a template-based model to synthesize new data, which
when incorporated into training further increased ROUGE scores. Finally, we
showed that combining data synthesis with domain transfer achieved higher ROUGE
scores compared to only using one of the two approaches.

  Some consider large-scale language models that can generate long and coherent
pieces of text as dangerous, since they may be used in misinformation
campaigns. Here we formulate large-scale language model output detection as a
hypothesis testing problem to classify text as genuine or generated. We show
that error exponents for particular language models are bounded in terms of
their perplexity, a standard measure of language generation performance. Under
the assumption that human language is stationary and ergodic, the formulation
is extended from considering specific language models to considering maximum
likelihood language models, among the class of k-order Markov approximations;
error probabilities are characterized. Some discussion of incorporating
semantic side information is also given.

\\
  We propose procedures for evaluating and strengthening contextual embedding
alignment and show that they are useful in analyzing and improving multilingual
BERT. In particular, after our proposed alignment procedure, BERT exhibits
significantly improved zero-shot performance on XNLI compared to the base
model, remarkably matching pseudo-fully-supervised translate-train models for
Bulgarian and Greek. Further, to measure the degree of alignment, we introduce
a contextual version of word retrieval and show that it correlates well with
downstream zero-shot transfer. Using this word retrieval task, we also analyze
BERT and find that it exhibits systematic deficiencies, e.g. worse alignment
for open-class parts-of-speech and word pairs written in different scripts,
that are corrected by the alignment procedure. These results support contextual
alignment as a useful concept for understanding large multilingual pre-trained
models.

  In our world with full of uncertainty, debates and argumentation contribute
to the progress of science and society. Despite of the increasing attention to
characterize human arguments, most progress made so far focus on the debate
outcome, largely ignoring the dynamic patterns in argumentation processes. This
paper presents a study that automatically analyzes the key factors in argument
persuasiveness, beyond simply predicting who will persuade whom. Specifically,
we propose a novel neural model that is able to dynamically track the changes
of latent topics and discourse in argumentative conversations, allowing the
investigation of their roles in influencing the outcomes of persuasion.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on argumentative conversations on
both social media and supreme court. The results show that our model
outperforms state-of-the-art models in identifying persuasive arguments via
explicitly exploring dynamic factors of topic and discourse. We further analyze
the effects of topics and discourse on persuasiveness, and find that they are
both useful - topics provide concrete evidence while superior discourse styles
may bias participants, especially in social media arguments. In addition, we
draw some findings from our empirical results, which will help people better
engage in future persuasive conversations.

Comments: ICLR 2020 conference paper (spotlight). The first two authors
  contributed equally
\\
  We present a deep generative model for unsupervised text style transfer that
unifies previously proposed non-generative techniques. Our probabilistic
approach models non-parallel data from two domains as a partially observed
parallel corpus. By hypothesizing a parallel latent sequence that generates
each observed sequence, our model learns to transform sequences from one domain
to another in a completely unsupervised fashion. In contrast with traditional
generative sequence models (e.g. the HMM), our model makes few assumptions
about the data it generates: it uses a recurrent language model as a prior and
an encoder-decoder as a transduction distribution. While computation of
marginal data likelihood is intractable in this model class, we show that
amortized variational inference admits a practical surrogate. Further, by
drawing connections between our variational objective and other recent
unsupervised style transfer and machine translation techniques, we show how our
probabilistic view can unify some known non-generative objectives such as
backtranslation and adversarial loss. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method on a wide range of unsupervised style transfer tasks, including
sentiment transfer, formality transfer, word decipherment, author imitation,
and related language translation. Across all style transfer tasks, our approach
yields substantial gains over state-of-the-art non-generative baselines,
including the state-of-the-art unsupervised machine translation techniques that
our approach generalizes. Further, we conduct experiments on a standard
unsupervised machine translation task and find that our unified approach
matches the current state-of-the-art.

Categories: cs.CL cs.SD
Comments: To appear in ICASSP 2020
\\
  Recently, fully recurrent neural network (RNN) based end-to-end models have
been proven to be effective for multi-speaker speech recognition in both the
single-channel and multi-channel scenarios. In this work, we explore the use of
Transformer models for these tasks by focusing on two aspects. First, we
replace the RNN-based encoder-decoder in the speech recognition model with a
Transformer architecture. Second, in order to use the Transformer in the
masking network of the neural beamformer in the multi-channel case, we modify
the self-attention component to be restricted to a segment rather than the
whole sequence in order to reduce computation. Besides the model architecture
improvements, we also incorporate an external dereverberation preprocessing,
the weighted prediction error (WPE), enabling our model to handle reverberated
signals. Experiments on the spatialized wsj1-2mix corpus show that the
Transformer-based models achieve 40.9% and 25.6% relative WER reduction, down
to 12.1% and 6.4% WER, under the anechoic condition in single-channel and
multi-channel tasks, respectively, while in the reverberant case, our methods
achieve 41.5% and 13.8% relative WER reduction, down to 16.5% and 15.2% WER.

on Google Play and Apple App Store in 2018. Wi-Fi Direct, also known as Wi-Fi
P2P, is commonly used for peer-to-peer, high-speed file transfer between mobile
devices, as well as a close proximity connection mode for wireless cameras,
network printers, TVs and other IoT and mobile devices. For its end users, such
type of direct file transfer does not result in cellular data charges and
allows to keep their primary Wi-Fi interface up concurrently with a dedicated
Wi-Fi P2P interface, which is commonly provided by the default wireless module
of the mobile phone. However, despite the popularity of these solutions
demonstrated by Google Play download statistics, we observe that the software
vendors tend to prioritize the ease of user flow over the security of the
implementation, introducing serious security flaws. We perform a comprehensive
security analysis in the context of security and usability behind the
identified flaws and report our findings in the form of 16 Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), disclosed to the corresponding vendors. To
address the similar flaws at the early stage of the application design, we
propose a joint consideration of Security and Usability for such applications
and their protocols that can be visualized in form of a User Journey Map (UJM).

Title: Invariant Hopping Attacks on Block Ciphers
Authors: Nicolas T. Courtois
Categories: cs.CR math.AC
Comments: 27 pages, 8 figures, extended version with new more complex examples
  of attacks
MSC-class: 13A50, 68P25 (Primary) 94A60, 14G50 (Secondary)
ACM-class: E.3; G.2.3
\\
  Block ciphers are in widespread use since the 1970s. Their iterated structure
is prone to numerous round invariant attacks for example in Linear
Cryptanalysis (LC). The next step is to look at non-linear polynomial
invariants cf. Eurocrypt'95. Until recently, researchers have found extremely
few such attacks, with some impossibility results. Eventually recent papers
show how to construct polynomial invariant attacks for block ciphers, however
many such results were of degree 2. In this paper we propose a new incremental
methodology for constructing high degree polynomial invariant attacks on block
ciphers. A trivial attack on one cipher setup will be transposed to show the
existence of a more advanced attack on a stronger cipher in several steps. The
key tool is the manipulation of the roots of the so called Fundamental
Equation. Examples are constructed with an old historical block cipher T-310.

Title: Target Privacy Preserving for Social Networks

Categories: cs.CR cs.SI
\\
  In this paper, we incorporate the realistic scenario of key protection into
link privacy preserving and propose the target-link privacy preserving (TPP)
model: target links referred to as targets are the most important and sensitive
objectives that would be intentionally attacked by adversaries, in order that
need privacy protections, while other links of less privacy concerns are
properly released to maintain the graph utility. The goal of TPP is to limit
the target disclosure by deleting a budget limited set of alternative
non-target links referred to as protectors to defend the adversarial link
predictions for all targets. Traditional link privacy preserving treated all
links as targets and concentrated on structural level protections in which
serious link disclosure and high graph utility loss is still the bottleneck of
graph releasing today, while TPP focuses on the target level protections in
which key protection is implemented on a tiny fraction of critical targets to
achieve better privacy protection and lower graph utility loss. Currently there
is a lack of clear TPP problem definition, provable optimal or near optimal
protector selection algorithms and scalable implementations on large-scale
social graphs. Firstly, we introduce the TPP model and propose a dissimilarity
function used for measuring the defense ability against privacy analyzing for
the targets. We consider two different problems by budget assignment settings:
1) we protect all targets and to optimize the dissimilarity of all targets with
a single budget; 2) besides the protections of all targets, we also care about
the protection of each target by assigning a local budget to every target,
considering two local protector selections. We also implement scalable
implementations and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of the proposed algorithms.

Title: MDEA: Malware Detection with Evolutionary Adversarial Learning
Authors: Xiruo Wang and Risto Miikkulainen
Categories: cs.CR cs.NE
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Malware detection have used machine learning to detect malware in programs.
These applications take in raw or processed binary data to neural network
models to classify as benign or malicious files. Even though this approach has
proven effective against dynamic changes, such as encrypting, obfuscating and
packing techniques, it is vulnerable to specific evasion attacks where that
small changes in the input data cause misclassification at test time. This
paper proposes a new approach: MDEA, an Adversarial Malware Detection model
uses evolutionary optimization to create attack samples to make the network
robust against evasion attacks. By retraining the model with the evolved
malware samples, its performance improves a significant margin.

Title: Towards Learning Representations of Binary Executable Files for Security
  Tasks
Authors: Shushan Arakelyan, Christophe Hauser, Erik Kline and Aram Galstyan
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Tackling binary analysis problems has traditionally implied manually defining
rules and heuristics. As an alternative, we are suggesting using machine
learning models for learning distributed representations of binaries that can
be applicable for a number of downstream tasks. We construct a computational
graph from the binary executable and use it with a graph convolutional neural
network to learn a high dimensional representation of the program. We show the
versatility of this approach by using our representations to solve two
semantically different binary analysis tasks -- algorithm classification and
vulnerability discovery. We compare the proposed approach to our own strong
baseline as well as published results and demonstrate improvement on the state
of the art methods for both tasks.

Title: HotFuzz: Discovering Algorithmic Denial-of-Service Vulnerabilities
  Through Guided Micro-Fuzzing
Authors: William Blair, Andrea Mambretti, Sajjad Arshad, Michael Weissbacher,
  William Robertson, Engin Kirda, Manuel Egele
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS) Symposium, 2020
DOI: 10.14722/ndss.2020.24415
\\
  Contemporary fuzz testing techniques focus on identifying memory corruption
vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to achieve either remote code execution
or information disclosure. Meanwhile, Algorithmic Complexity
(AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service
attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a
framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries.
HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java
objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test.
We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed
inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing,
HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java
programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities
outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high
CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We
evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular
Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time
Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by
comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of
AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs. In
this evaluation, we verified known AC vulnerabilities, discovered previously
unknown AC vulnerabilities that we responsibly reported to vendors, and
received confirmation from both IBM and Oracle. Our results demonstrate that
micro-fuzzing finds AC vulnerabilities in real-world software, and that
micro-fuzzing with SRI-derived seed inputs outperforms using empty values.

Title: Certified Robustness of Community Detection against Adversarial
  Structural Perturbation via Randomized Smoothing
Authors: Jinyuan Jia, Binghui Wang, Xiaoyu Cao, Neil Zhenqiang Gong
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG cs.SI
Comments: Accepted by WWW'20; This is technical report version
\\
  Community detection plays a key role in understanding graph structure.
However, several recent studies showed that community detection is vulnerable
to adversarial structural perturbation. In particular, via adding or removing a
small number of carefully selected edges in a graph, an attacker can manipulate
the detected communities. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no
studies on certifying robustness of community detection against such
adversarial structural perturbation. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap.
Specifically, we develop the first certified robustness guarantee of community
detection against adversarial structural perturbation. Given an arbitrary
community detection method, we build a new smoothed community detection method
via randomly perturbing the graph structure. We theoretically show that the
smoothed community detection method provably groups a given arbitrary set of
nodes into the same community (or different communities) when the number of
edges added/removed by an attacker is bounded. Moreover, we show that our
certified robustness is tight. We also empirically evaluate our method on
multiple real-world graphs with ground truth communities.

Title: Network-Agnostic State Machine Replication
Authors: Erica Blum, Jonathan Katz, Julian Loss
Categories: cs.CR cs.DC
Comments: 21 pages
\\
  We study the problem of $\textit{state machine replication}$ (SMR) -- the
underlying problem addressed by blockchain protocols -- in the presence of a
malicious adversary who can corrupt some fraction of the parties running the
protocol. Existing protocols for this task assume either a
$\textit{synchronous}$ network (where all messages are delivered within some
known time $\Delta$) or an $\textit{asynchronous}$ network (where messages can
be delayed arbitrarily). Although protocols for the latter case give seemingly
stronger guarantees, in fact they are incomparable since they (inherently)
tolerate a lower fraction of corrupted parties.
  We design an SMR protocol that is $\textit{network-agnostic}$ in the
following sense: if it is run in a synchronous network, it tolerates $t_s$
corrupted parties; if the network happens to be asynchronous it is resilient to
$t_a \leq t_s$ faults. Our protocol achieves optimal tradeoffs between $t_s$
and $t_a$.

Title: Meet Malexa, Alexa's Malicious Twin: Malware-Induced Misperception
  Through Intelligent Voice Assistants
Authors: Filipo Sharevski, Paige Treebridge, Peter Jachim, Audrey Li, Adam
  Babin, Jessica Westbrook
Categories: cs.CR cs.CY cs.HC
\\
  This paper reports the findings of a study where users (N=220) interacted
with Malexa, Alexa's malicious twin. Malexa is an intelligent voice assistant
with a simple and seemingly harmless third-party skill that delivers news
briefings to users. The twist, however, is that Malexa covertly rewords these
briefings to intentionally introduce misperception about the reported events.
This covert rewording is referred to as a Malware-Induced Misperception (MIM)
attack. It differs from squatting or invocation hijacking attacks in that it is
focused on manipulating the "content" delivered through a third-party skill
instead of the skill's "invocation logic." Malexa, in the study, reworded
regulatory briefings to make a government response sound more accidental or
lenient than the original news delivered by Alexa. The results show that users
who interacted with Malexa perceived that the government was less friendly to
working people and more in favor of big businesses. The results also show that
Malexa is capable of inducing misperceptions regardless of the user's gender,
political ideology or frequency of interaction with intelligent voice
assistants. We discuss the implications in the context of using Malexa as a
covert "influencer" in people's living or working environments.

Title: Security & Privacy in IoT Using Machine Learning & Blockchain: Threats &
  Countermeasures
Authors: Nazar Waheed, Xiangjian He, Muhammad Usman, Muhammad Usman
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
Comments: 35 pages, ACM CSUR Journal
\\
  Security and privacy have become significant concerns due to the involvement
of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in different applications. Cyber
threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and
privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for
hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce
accurate outputs from large complex databases. The generated outputs can be
used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore,
Blockchain (BC) technique is becoming popular in modern IoT applications to
deal with security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on
either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either
security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a
need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both
security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this
paper, we have provided a summary of research efforts made in the past few
years addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC
techniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security
and privacy threats in the IoT domain that were reported in the past few years.
Secondly, we classify the literature on security and privacy efforts based on
ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. In the end, various
challenges and future research directions using ML algorithms and BC techniques
to address security and privacy issues in the IoT domain are identified and
discussed.

an ideal utility for data storage that is applicable in many real world
industrial scenarios. One important scenario is web log, which is treated as
sources of technical significance and commercial revenues in major internet
companies. In this paper, we illustrate our design of a web log storage system
based on HyperLedger. HyperLedger yields higher throughput and lower latency
compared with other blockchain systems. Alongside its efficiency advantages,
HyperLeger is a permissioned blockchain, which is an ideal fit for enterprise

Title: Droidetec: Android Malware Detection and Malicious Code Localization
  through Deep Learning
Authors: Zhuo Ma, Haoran Ge, Zhuzhu Wang, Yang Liu, Ximeng Liu
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Android malware detection is a critical step towards building a security
credible system. Especially, manual search for the potential malicious code has
plagued program analysts for a long time. In this paper, we propose Droidetec,
a deep learning based method for android malware detection and malicious code
localization, to model an application program as a natural language sequence.
Droidetec adopts a novel feature extraction method to derive behavior sequences
from Android applications. Based on that, the bi-directional Long Short Term
Memory network is utilized for malware detection. Each unit in the extracted
behavior sequence is inventively represented as a vector, which allows
Droidetec to automatically analyze the semantics of sequence segments and
eventually find out the malicious code. Experiments with 9616 malicious and
11982 benign programs show that Droidetec reaches an accuracy of 97.22% and an
F1-score of 98.21%. In all, Droidetec has a hit rate of 91% to properly find
out malicious code segments.

  We present a cryptographic primitive called WibsonTree designed to preserve
users' privacy by allowing them to demonstrate predicates on their personal
attributes, without revealing the values of those attributes. We suppose that
there are three types of agents --buyers, sellers and notaries-- who interact
in a decentralized privacy-preserving data marketplace (dPDM) such as the
Wibson marketplace. We introduce the WibsonTree protocol as an efficient
cryptographic primitive that enables the exchange of private information while
preserving the seller's privacy. Using our primitive, a data seller can
efficiently prove that he/she belongs to the target audience of a buyer's data
request, without revealing any additional information.

Title: Smartphone Impostor Detection with Built-in Sensors and Deep Learning
Authors: Guangyuan Hu, Zecheng He, Ruby Lee
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  In this paper, we show that sensor-based impostor detection with deep
learning can achieve excellent impostor detection accuracy at lower hardware
cost compared to past work on sensor-based user authentication (the inverse
problem) which used more conventional machine learning algorithms. While these
methods use other smartphone users' sensor data to build the (user, non-user)
classification models, we go further to show that using only the legitimate
user's sensor data can still achieve very good accuracy while preserving the
privacy of the user's sensor data (behavioral biometrics). For this use case, a
key contribution is showing that the detection accuracy of a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) deep learning model can be significantly improved by comparing
prediction error distributions. This requires generating and comparing
empirical probability distributions, which we show in an efficient hardware
design. Another novel contribution is in the design of SID (Smartphone impostor
Detection), a minimalist hardware accelerator that can be integrated into
future smartphones for efficient impostor detection for different scenarios.
Our SID module can implement many common Machine Learning and Deep Learning
algorithms. SID is also scalable in parallelism and performance and easy to
program. We show an FPGA prototype of SID, which can provide more than enough
performance for real-time impostor detection, with very low hardware complexity
and power consumption (one to two orders of magnitude less than related
performance-oriented FPGA accelerators). We also show that the FPGA
implementation of SID consumes 64.41X less energy than an implementation using
the CPU with a GPU.

Title: Local Facial Attribute Transfer through Inpainting
Authors: Ricard Durall, Franz-Josef Pfreundt, Janis Keuper
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  The term attribute transfer refers to the tasks of altering images in such a
way, that the semantic interpretation of a given input image is shifted towards
an intended direction, which is quantified by semantic attributes. Prominent
example applications are photo realistic changes of facial features and
expressions, like changing the hair color, adding a smile, enlarging the nose
or altering the entire context of a scene, like transforming a summer landscape
into a winter panorama. Recent advances in attribute transfer are mostly based
on generative deep neural networks, using various techniques to manipulate
images in the latent space of the generator. In this paper, we present a novel
method for the common sub-task of local attribute transfers, where only parts
of a face have to be altered in order to achieve semantic changes (e.g.
removing a mustache). In contrast to previous methods, where such local changes
have been implemented by generating new (global) images, we propose to
formulate local attribute transfers as an inpainting problem. Removing and
regenerating only parts of images, our Attribute Transfer Inpainting Generative
Adversarial Network (ATI-GAN) is able to utilize local context information,
resulting in visually sound results.

Title: Bone Suppression on Chest Radiographs With Adversarial Learning
Authors: Jia Liang, Yuxing Tang, Youbao Tang, Jing Xiao, Ronald M. Summers
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI eess.IV
Comments: Accepted by SPIE Medical Imaging 2020
\\
  Dual-energy (DE) chest radiography provides the capability of selectively
imaging two clinically relevant materials, namely soft tissues, and osseous
structures, to better characterize a wide variety of thoracic pathology and
potentially improve diagnosis in posteroanterior (PA) chest radiographs.
However, DE imaging requires specialized hardware and a higher radiation dose
than conventional radiography, and motion artifacts sometimes happen due to
involuntary patient motion. In this work, we learn the mapping between
conventional radiographs and bone suppressed radiographs. Specifically, we
propose to utilize two variations of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for
image-to-image translation between conventional and bone suppressed radiographs
obtained by DE imaging technique. We compare the effectiveness of training with
patient-wisely paired and unpaired radiographs. Experiments show both training
strategies yield "radio-realistic'' radiographs with suppressed bony structures
and few motion artifacts on a hold-out test set. While training with paired
images yields slightly better performance than that of unpaired images when
measuring with two objective image quality metrics, namely Structural
Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), training with
unpaired images demonstrates better generalization ability on unseen
anteroposterior (AP) radiographs than paired training.

Title: Attacking Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Systems with Adversarial

\\
  Optical character recognition (OCR) is widely applied in real applications
serving as a key preprocessing tool. The adoption of deep neural network (DNN)
in OCR results in the vulnerability against adversarial examples which are
crafted to mislead the output of the threat model. Different from vanilla
colorful images, images of printed text have clear backgrounds usually.
However, adversarial examples generated by most of the existing adversarial
attacks are unnatural and pollute the background severely. To address this
issue, we propose a watermark attack method to produce natural distortion that
is in the disguise of watermarks and evade human eyes' detection. Experimental
results show that watermark attacks can yield a set of natural adversarial
examples attached with watermarks and attain similar attack performance to the
state-of-the-art methods in different attack scenarios.

  Wang, Maithilee Kunda
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures
\\
  For the problem of 3D object recognition, researchers using deep learning
methods have developed several very different input representations, including
"multi-view" snapshots taken from discrete viewpoints around an object, as well
as "spherical" representations consisting of a dense map of essentially
ray-traced samples of the object from all directions. These representations
offer trade-offs in terms of what object information is captured and to what
degree of detail it is captured, but it is not clear how to measure these
information trade-offs since the two types of representations are so different.
We demonstrate that both types of representations in fact exist at two extremes
of a common representational continuum, essentially choosing to prioritize
either the number of views of an object or the pixels (i.e., field of view)
allotted per view. We identify interesting intermediate representations that
lie at points in between these two extremes, and we show, through systematic
empirical experiments, how accuracy varies along this continuum as a function
of input information as well as the particular deep learning architecture that
is used.

Title: Symbiotic Attention with Privileged Information for Egocentric Action
  Recognition
Authors: Xiaohan Wang, Yu Wu, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: AAAI-2020(Oral)
\\
  Egocentric video recognition is a natural testbed for diverse interaction
reasoning. Due to the large action vocabulary in egocentric video datasets,
recent studies usually utilize a two-branch structure for action recognition,
ie, one branch for verb classification and the other branch for noun
classification. However, correlation studies between the verb and the noun
branches have been largely ignored. Besides, the two branches fail to exploit
local features due to the absence of a position-aware attention mechanism. In
this paper, we propose a novel Symbiotic Attention framework leveraging
Privileged information (SAP) for egocentric video recognition. Finer
position-aware object detection features can facilitate the understanding of
actor's interaction with the object. We introduce these features in action
recognition and regard them as privileged information. Our framework enables
mutual communication among the verb branch, the noun branch, and the privileged
information. This communication process not only injects local details into
global features but also exploits implicit guidance about the spatio-temporal
position of an on-going action. We introduce novel symbiotic attention (SA) to
enable effective communication. It first normalizes the detection guided
features on one branch to underline the action-relevant information from the
other branch. SA adaptively enhances the interactions among the three sources.
To further catalyze this communication, spatial relations are uncovered for the
selection of most action-relevant information. It identifies the most valuable
and discriminative feature for classification. We validate the effectiveness of
our SAP quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, it achieves the
state-of-the-art on two large-scale egocentric video datasets.

Title: Multi-Modality Cascaded Fusion Technology for Autonomous Driving
Authors: Hongwu Kuang, Xiaodong Liu, Jingwei Zhang, Zicheng Fang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Multi-modality fusion is the guarantee of the stability of autonomous driving
systems. In this paper, we propose a general multi-modality cascaded fusion
framework, exploiting the advantages of decision-level and feature-level
fusion, utilizing target position, size, velocity, appearance and confidence to
achieve accurate fusion results. In the fusion process, dynamic coordinate
alignment(DCA) is conducted to reduce the error between sensors from different
modalities. In addition, the calculation of affinity matrix is the core module
of sensor fusion, we propose an affinity loss that improves the performance of
deep affinity network(DAN). Last, the proposed step-by-step cascaded fusion
framework is more interpretable and flexible compared to the end-toend fusion
methods. Extensive experiments on Nuscenes [2] dataset show that our approach
achieves the state-of-theart performance.dataset show that our approach
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Title: CTM: Collaborative Temporal Modeling for Action Recognition
Authors: Qian Liu, Tao Wang, Jie Liu, Yang Guan, Qi Bu, Longfei Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  With the rapid development of digital multimedia, video understanding has
become an important field. For action recognition, temporal dimension plays an
important role, and this is quite different from image recognition. In order to
learn powerful feature of videos, we propose a Collaborative Temporal Modeling
(CTM) block (Figure 1) to learn temporal information for action recognition.
Besides a parameter-free identity shortcut, as a separate temporal modeling
block, CTM includes two collaborative paths: a spatial-aware temporal modeling
path, which we propose the Temporal-Channel Convolution Module (TCCM) with
unshared parameters for each spatial position (H*W) to build, and a
spatial-unaware temporal modeling path. CTM blocks can seamlessly be inserted
into many popular networks to generate CTM Networks and bring the capability of
learning temporal information to 2D CNN backbone networks, which only capture
spatial information. Experiments on several popular action recognition datasets
demonstrate that CTM blocks bring the performance improvements on 2D CNN
baselines, and our method achieves the competitive results against the
state-of-the-art methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Title: Sparsity-Aware Deep Learning for Automatic 4D Facial Expression
  Recognition
Authors: Muzammil Behzad, Nhat Vo, Xiaobai Li, Guoying Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Submitted to IEEE ICIP 2020
\\
  In this paper, we present a sparsity-aware deep network for automatic 4D
facial expression recognition (FER). Given 4D data, we first propose a novel
augmentation method to combat the data limitation problem for deep learning.
This is achieved by projecting the input data into RGB and depth map images and
then iteratively performing channel concatenation. Encoded in the given 3D
landmarks, we also introduce TOP-landmarks over multi-views, an effective way
to capture the facial muscle movements from three orthogonal planes.
Importantly, we then present a sparsity-aware network to compute the sparse
representations of convolutional features over multi-views for a significant
and computationally convenient deep learning. For training, the TOP-landmarks
and sparse representations are used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM)
network. The refined predictions are achieved when the learned features
collaborate over multi-views. Extensive experimental results achieved on the
BU-4DFE dataset show the significance of our method over the state-of-the-art
methods by reaching a promising accuracy of 99.69% for 4D FER.

Title: Spatial-Temporal Multi-Cue Network for Continuous Sign Language
  Recognition
Authors: Hao Zhou, Wengang Zhou, Yun Zhou, Houqiang Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted as an oral presentation paper at AAAI 2020. (To appear in
  Proceedings of the Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence)
\\
  Despite the recent success of deep learning in continuous sign language
recognition (CSLR), deep models typically focus on the most discriminative
features, ignoring other potentially non-trivial and informative contents. Such
characteristic heavily constrains their capability to learn implicit visual
grammars behind the collaboration of different visual cues (i,e., hand shape,
facial expression and body posture). By injecting multi-cue learning into
neural network design, we propose a spatial-temporal multi-cue (STMC) network
to solve the vision-based sequence learning problem. Our STMC network consists
of a spatial multi-cue (SMC) module and a temporal multi-cue (TMC) module. The
SMC module is dedicated to spatial representation and explicitly decomposes
visual features of different cues with the aid of a self-contained pose
estimation branch. The TMC module models temporal correlations along two
parallel paths, i.e., intra-cue and inter-cue, which aims to preserve the
uniqueness and explore the collaboration of multiple cues. Finally, we design a
joint optimization strategy to achieve the end-to-end sequence learning of the
STMC network. To validate the effectiveness, we perform experiments on three
large-scale CSLR benchmarks: PHOENIX-2014, CSL and PHOENIX-2014-T. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on all three benchmarks.

Title: Exocentric to Egocentric Image Generation via Parallel Generative
  Adversarial Network
Authors: Gaowen Liu, Hao Tang, Hugo Latapie, Yan Yan
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: It has been accepted by ICASSP 2020
\\
  Cross-view image generation has been recently proposed to generate images of
one view from another dramatically different view. In this paper, we
investigate exocentric (third-person) view to egocentric (first-person) view
image generation. This is a challenging task since egocentric view sometimes is
remarkably different from exocentric view. Thus, transforming the appearances
across the two views is a non-trivial task. To this end, we propose a novel
Parallel Generative Adversarial Network (P-GAN) with a novel cross-cycle loss
to learn the shared information for generating egocentric images from
exocentric view. We also incorporate a novel contextual feature loss in the
learning procedure to capture the contextual information in images. Extensive
experiments on the Exo-Ego datasets show that our model outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: Intrinsic Dimension Estimation via Nearest Constrained Subspace
  Classifier
Authors: Liang Liao and Stephen John Maybank
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 19 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables
\\
  We consider the problems of classification and intrinsic dimension estimation
on image data. A new subspace based classifier is proposed for supervised
classification or intrinsic dimension estimation. The distribution of the data
in each class is modeled by a union of of a finite number ofaffine subspaces of
the feature space. The affine subspaces have a common dimension, which is
assumed to be much less than the dimension of the feature space. The subspaces
are found using regression based on the L0-norm. The proposed method is a
generalisation of classical NN (Nearest Neighbor), NFL (Nearest Feature Line)
classifiers and has a close relationship to NS (Nearest Subspace) classifier.
The proposed classifier with an accurately estimated dimension parameter
generally outperforms its competitors in terms of classification accuracy. We
also propose a fast version of the classifier using a neighborhood
representation to reduce its computational complexity. Experiments on publicly
available datasets corroborate these claims.

Title: Ensemble of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Pavement
  Crack Detection and Measurement
Authors: Zhun Fan, Chong Li, Ying Chen, Paola Di Mascio, Xiaopeng Chen, Guijie

\\
  Automated pavement crack detection and measurement are important road issues.
Agencies have to guarantee the improvement of road safety. Conventional crack
detection and measurement algorithms can be extremely time-consuming and low
efficiency. Therefore, recently, innovative algorithms have received increased
attention from researchers. In this paper, we propose an ensemble of
convolutional neural networks (without a pooling layer) based on probability
fusion for automated pavement crack detection and measurement. Specifically, an
ensemble of convolutional neural networks was employed to identify the
structure of small cracks with raw images. Secondly, outputs of the individual
convolutional neural network model for the ensemble were averaged to produce
the final crack probability value of each pixel, which can obtain a predicted
probability map. Finally, the predicted morphological features of the cracks
were measured by using the skeleton extraction algorithm. To validate the
proposed method, some experiments were performed on two public crack databases
(CFD and AigleRN) and the results of the different state-of-the-art methods
were compared. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms the other methods. For crack measurement, the crack length and
width can be measure based on different crack types (complex, common, thin, and
intersecting cracks.). The results show that the proposed algorithm can be
effectively applied for crack measurement.

Title: GradMix: Multi-source Transfer across Domains and Tasks
Authors: Junnan Li, Ziwei Xu, Yongkang Wong, Qi Zhao, Mohan Kankanhalli
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The computer vision community is witnessing an unprecedented rate of new
tasks being proposed and addressed, thanks to the deep convolutional networks'
capability to find complex mappings from X to Y. The advent of each task often
accompanies the release of a large-scale annotated dataset, for supervised
training of deep network. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to
manually label sufficient amount of training data. Therefore, it is important
to develop algorithms that can leverage off-the-shelf labeled dataset to learn
useful knowledge for the target task. While previous works mostly focus on
transfer learning from a single source, we study multi-source transfer across
domains and tasks (MS-DTT), in a semi-supervised setting. We propose GradMix, a
model-agnostic method applicable to any model trained with gradient-based
learning rule, to transfer knowledge via gradient descent by weighting and
mixing the gradients from all sources during training. GradMix follows a
meta-learning objective, which assigns layer-wise weights to the source
gradients, such that the combined gradient follows the direction that minimize
the loss for a small set of samples from the target dataset. In addition, we
propose to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each mini-batch based on its
importance to the target task, and a pseudo-labeling method to leverage the
unlabeled samples in the target domain. We conduct MS-DTT experiments on two
tasks: digit recognition and action recognition, and demonstrate the
advantageous performance of the proposed method against multiple baselines.

Title: Weakly-Supervised Multi-Person Action Recognition in 360$^{\circ}$
  Videos
Authors: Junnan Li, Jianquan Liu, Yongkang Wong, Shoji Nishimura, Mohan
  Kankanhalli
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The recent development of commodity 360$^{\circ}$ cameras have enabled a
single video to capture an entire scene, which endows promising potentials in
surveillance scenarios. However, research in omnidirectional video analysis has
lagged behind the hardware advances. In this work, we address the important
problem of action recognition in top-view 360$^{\circ}$ videos. Due to the wide
filed-of-view, 360$^{\circ}$ videos usually capture multiple people performing
actions at the same time. Furthermore, the appearance of people are deformed.
The proposed framework first transforms omnidirectional videos into panoramic
videos, then it extracts spatial-temporal features using region-based 3D CNNs
for action recognition. We propose a weakly-supervised method based on
multi-instance multi-label learning, which trains the model to recognize and
localize multiple actions in a video using only video-level action labels as
supervision. We perform experiments to quantitatively validate the efficacy of
the proposed method and qualitatively demonstrate action localization results.
To enable research in this direction, we introduce 360Action, the first
omnidirectional video dataset for multi-person action recognition.

Title: Learning efficient structured dictionary for image classification
Authors: Zi-Qi Li, Jun Sun, Xiao-Jun Wu and He-Feng Yin
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: Submitted to Journal of Electronic Imaging
\\
  Recent years have witnessed the success of dictionary learning (DL) based
approaches in the domain of pattern classification. In this paper, we present
an efficient structured dictionary learning (ESDL) method which takes both the
diversity and label information of training samples into account. Specifically,
ESDL introduces alternative training samples into the process of dictionary
learning. To increase the discriminative capability of representation
coefficients for classification, an ideal regularization term is incorporated
into the objective function of ESDL. Moreover, in contrast with conventional DL
approaches which impose computationally expensive L1-norm constraint on the
coefficient matrix, ESDL employs L2-norm regularization term. Experimental
results on benchmark databases (including four face databases and one scene
dataset) demonstrate that ESDL outperforms previous DL approaches. More
importantly, ESDL can be applied in a wide range of pattern classification
tasks. The demo code of our proposed ESDL will be available at
https://github.com/li-zi-qi/ESDL.

Title: Asymmetric Rejection Loss for Fairer Face Recognition
Authors: Haoyu Qin
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Face recognition performance has seen a tremendous gain in recent years,
mostly due to the availability of large-scale face images dataset that can be
exploited by deep neural networks to learn powerful face representations.
However, recent research has shown differences in face recognition performance
across different ethnic groups mostly due to the racial imbalance in the
training datasets where Caucasian identities largely dominate other
ethnicities. This is actually symptomatic of the under-representation of
non-Caucasian ethnic groups in the celebdom from which face datasets are
usually gathered, rendering the acquisition of labeled data of the
under-represented groups challenging. In this paper, we propose an Asymmetric
Rejection Loss, which aims at making full use of unlabeled images of those
under-represented groups, to reduce the racial bias of face recognition models.
We view each unlabeled image as a unique class, however as we cannot guarantee
that two unlabeled samples are from a distinct class we exploit both labeled
and unlabeled data in an asymmetric manner in our loss formalism. Extensive
experiments show our method's strength in mitigating racial bias, outperforming
state-of-the-art semi-supervision methods. Performance on the under-represented
ethnicity groups increases while that on the well-represented group is nearly
unchanged.

  Classification
Authors: Min Zhang, Yifan Wang, Pranav Kadam, Shan Liu and C.-C. Jay Kuo

Comments: 4pages, 4 figures
\\
  The PointHop method was recently proposed by Zhang et al. for 3D point cloud
classification with unsupervised feature extraction. It has an extremely low
training complexity while achieving state-of-the-art classification
performance. In this work, we improve the PointHop method furthermore in two
aspects: 1) reducing its model complexity in terms of the model parameter
number and 2) ordering discriminant features automatically based on the
cross-entropy criterion. The resulting method is called PointHop++. The first
improvement is essential for wearable and mobile computing while the second
improvement bridges statistics-based and optimization-based machine learning
methodologies. With experiments conducted on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset,
we show that the PointHop++ method performs on par with deep neural network
(DNN) solutions and surpasses other unsupervised feature extraction methods.

\\
  Filters are the essential elements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Filters are corresponded to the feature maps and form the main part of the
computational and memory requirement for the CNN processing. In filter pruning
methods, a filter with all of its components, including channels and
connections, are removed. The removal of a filter can cause a drastic change in
the network's performance. Also, the removed filters cannot come back to the
network structure. We want to address these problems in this paper. We propose
a CNN pruning method based on filter attenuation in which weak filters are not
directly removed. Instead, weak filters are attenuated and gradually removed.
In the proposed attenuation approach, weak filters are not abruptly removed,
and there is a chance for these filters to return to the network. The filter
attenuation method is assessed using the VGG model for the Cifar10 image
classification task. Simulation results show that the filter attenuation works
with different pruning criteria, and better results are obtained in comparison
with the conventional pruning methods.

  For convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that have a large volume of input
data, memory management becomes a major concern. Memory cost reduction can be
an effective way to deal with these problems that can be realized through
different techniques such as feature map pruning, input data splitting, etc.
Among various methods existing in this area of research, splitting the network
structure is an interesting research field, and there are a few works done in
this area. In this study, the problem of reducing memory utilization using
network structure splitting is addressed. A new technique is proposed to split
the network structure into small parts that consume lower memory than the
original network. The split parts can be processed almost separately, which
provides an essential role for better memory management. The split approach has
been tested on two well-known network structures of VGG16 and ResNet18 for the
classification of CIFAR10 images. Simulation results show that the splitting
method reduces both the number of computational operations as well as the
amount of memory consumption.

Title: Face Hallucination with Finishing Touches
Authors: Yang Zhang, Ivor W.Tsang, Jun Li, Ping Liu, Xiaobo Lu, and Xin Yu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 15 figures
\\
  Obtaining a high-quality frontal face image from a low-resolution (LR)
non-frontal face image is primarily important for many facial analysis
applications. However, mainstreams either focus on super-resolving near-frontal
LR faces or frontalizing non-frontal high-resolution (HR) faces. It is
desirable to perform both tasks seamlessly for daily-life unconstrained face
images. In this paper, we present a novel Vivid Face Hallucination Generative
Adversarial Network (VividGAN) devised for simultaneously super-resolving and
frontalizing tiny non-frontal face images. VividGAN consists of a Vivid Face
Hallucination Network (Vivid-FHnet) and two discriminators, i.e., Coarse-D and
Fine-D. The Vivid-FHnet first generates a coarse frontal HR face and then makes
use of the structure prior, i.e., fine-grained facial components, to achieve a
fine frontal HR face image. Specifically, we propose a facial component-aware
module, which adopts the facial geometry guidance as clues to accurately align
and merge the coarse frontal HR face and prior information. Meanwhile, the
two-level discriminators are designed to capture both the global outline of the
face as well as detailed facial characteristics. The Coarse-D enforces the
coarse hallucinated faces to be upright and complete; while the Fine-D focuses
on the fine hallucinated ones for sharper details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VividGAN achieves photo-realistic frontal HR faces,
reaching superior performance in downstream tasks, i.e., face recognition and
expression classification, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Action recognition is an important and challenging problem in video analysis.
Although the past decade has witnessed progress in action recognition with the
development of deep learning, such process has been slow in competitive sports
content analysis. To promote the research on action recognition from
competitive sports video clips, we introduce a Figure Skating Dataset (FSD-10)
for finegrained sports content analysis. To this end, we collect 1484 clips
from the worldwide figure skating championships in 2017-2018, which consist of
10 different actions in men/ladies programs. Each clip is at a rate of 30
frames per second with resolution 1080 $\times$ 720. These clips are then
annotated by experts in type, grade of execution, skater info, .etc. To build a
baseline for action recognition in figure skating, we evaluate state-of-the-art
action recognition methods on FSD-10. Motivated by the idea that domain
knowledge is of great concern in sports field, we propose a keyframe based
temporal segment network (KTSN) for classification and achieve remarkable
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that FSD-10 is an ideal dataset
for benchmarking action recognition algorithms, as it requires to accurately
extract action motions rather than action poses. We hope FSD-10, which is
designed to have a large collection of finegrained actions, can serve as a new
challenge to develop more robust and advanced action recognition models.

\\
  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extensively beneficial for medical
image processing. Medical images are plentiful, but there is a lack of
annotated data. Transfer learning is used to solve the problem of lack of
labeled data and grants CNNs better training capability. Transfer learning can
be used in many different medical applications; however, the model under
transfer should have the same size as the original network. Knowledge
distillation is recently proposed to transfer the knowledge of a model to
another one and can be useful to cover the shortcomings of transfer learning.
But some parts of the knowledge may not be distilled by knowledge distillation.
In this paper, a novel knowledge distillation using transfer learning is
proposed to transfer the whole knowledge of a model to another one. The
proposed method can be beneficial and practical for medical image analysis in
which a small number of labeled data are available. The proposed process is
tested for diabetic retinopathy classification. Simulation results demonstrate
that using the proposed method, knowledge of an extensive network can be
transferred to a smaller model.

Authors: Wenhao Wu, Dongliang He, Xiao Tan, Shifeng Chen, Yi Yang, Shilei Wen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Though action recognition in videos has achieved great success recently, it
remains a challenging task due to the massive computational cost. Designing
lightweight networks is a possible solution, but it may degrade the recognition
performance. In this paper, we innovatively propose a general dynamic inference
idea to improve inference efficiency by leveraging the variation in the
distinguishability of different videos. The dynamic inference approach can be
achieved from aspects of the network depth and the number of input video
frames, or even in a joint input-wise and network depth-wise manner. In a
nutshell, we treat input frames and network depth of the computational graph as
a 2-dimensional grid, and several checkpoints are placed on this grid in
advance with a prediction module. The inference is carried out progressively on
the grid by following some predefined route, whenever the inference process
comes across a checkpoint, an early prediction can be made depending on whether
the early stop criteria meets. For the proof-of-concept purpose, we instantiate
three dynamic inference frameworks using two well-known backbone CNNs. In these
instances, we overcome the drawback of limited temporal coverage resulted from
an early prediction by a novel frame permutation scheme, and alleviate the
conflict between progressive computation and video temporal relation modeling
by introducing an online temporal shift module. Extensive experiments are
conducted to thoroughly analyze the effectiveness of our ideas and to inspire
future research efforts. Results on various datasets also evident the
superiority of our approach.

Title: Weakly Supervised Attention Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network for
  Fine-Grained Visual Classification
Authors: Yifeng Ding, Shaoguo Wen, Jiyang Xie, Dongliang Chang, Zhanyu Ma,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Classifying the sub-categories of an object from the same super-category
(e.g. bird species, car and aircraft models) in fine-grained visual
classification (FGVC) highly relies on discriminative feature representation
and accurate region localization. Existing approaches mainly focus on
distilling information from high-level features. In this paper, however, we
show that by integrating low-level information (e.g. color, edge junctions,
texture patterns), performance can be improved with enhanced feature
representation and accurately located discriminative regions. Our solution,
named Attention Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (AP-CNN), consists of a) a
pyramidal hierarchy structure with a top-down feature pathway and a bottom-up
attention pathway, and hence learns both high-level semantic and low-level
detailed feature representation, and b) an ROI guided refinement strategy with
ROI guided dropblock and ROI guided zoom-in, which refines features with
discriminative local regions enhanced and background noises eliminated. The
proposed AP-CNN can be trained end-to-end, without the need of additional
bounding box/part annotations. Extensive experiments on three commonly used
FGVC datasets (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, and FGVC-Aircraft) demonstrate that
our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Code available at

Title: MS-Net: Multi-Site Network for Improving Prostate Segmentation with
  Heterogeneous MRI Data
Authors: Quande Liu, Qi Dou, Lequan Yu, Pheng Ann Heng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
\\
  Automated prostate segmentation in MRI is highly demanded for
computer-assisted diagnosis. Recently, a variety of deep learning methods have
achieved remarkable progress in this task, usually relying on large amounts of
training data. Due to the nature of scarcity for medical images, it is
important to effectively aggregate data from multiple sites for robust model
training, to alleviate the insufficiency of single-site samples. However, the
prostate MRIs from different sites present heterogeneity due to the differences
in scanners and imaging protocols, raising challenges for effective ways of
aggregating multi-site data for network training. In this paper, we propose a
novel multi-site network (MS-Net) for improving prostate segmentation by
learning robust representations, leveraging multiple sources of data. To
compensate for the inter-site heterogeneity of different MRI datasets, we
develop Domain-Specific Batch Normalization layers in the network backbone,
enabling the network to estimate statistics and perform feature normalization
for each site separately. Considering the difficulty of capturing the shared
knowledge from multiple datasets, a novel learning paradigm, i.e.,
Multi-site-guided Knowledge Transfer, is proposed to enhance the kernels to
extract more generic representations from multi-site data. Extensive
experiments on three heterogeneous prostate MRI datasets demonstrate that our
MS-Net improves the performance across all datasets consistently, and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multi-site learning.

  Image-guided interventions are saving the lives of a large number of patients
where the image registration problem should indeed be considered as the most
complex and complicated issue to be tackled. On the other hand, the recently
huge progress in the field of machine learning made by the possibility of
implementing deep neural networks on the contemporary many-core GPUs opened up
a promising window to challenge with many medical applications, where the
registration is not an exception. In this paper, a comprehensive review on the
state-of-the-art literature known as medical image registration using deep
neural networks is presented. The review is systematic and encompasses all the
related works previously published in the field. Key concepts, statistical
analysis from different points of view, confiding challenges, novelties and
main contributions, key-enabling techniques, future directions and prospective
trends all are discussed and surveyed in details in this comprehensive review.
This review allows a deep understanding and insight for the readers active in
the field who are investigating the state-of-the-art and seeking to contribute
the future literature.

Title: ABBA: Saliency-Regularized Motion-Based Adversarial Blur Attack
Authors: Qing Guo and Felix Juefei-Xu and Xiaofei Xie and Lei Ma and Jian Wang
  and Wei Feng and Yang Liu
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG

\\
  Deep neural networks are vulnerable to noise-based adversarial examples,
which can mislead the networks by adding random-like noise. However, such
examples are hardly found in the real world and easily perceived when thumping
noises are used to keep their high transferability across different models. In
this paper, we identify a new attacking method termed motion-based adversarial
blur attack (ABBA) that can generate visually natural motion-blurred
adversarial examples even with relatively high perturbation, allowing much
better transferability than noise-based methods. To this end, we first
formulate the kernel-prediction-based attack where an input image is convolved
with kernels in a pixel-wise way, and the misclassification capability is
achieved by tuning the kernel weights. To generate visually more natural and
plausible examples, we further propose the saliency-regularized adversarial
kernel prediction where the salient region serves as a moving object, and the
predicted kernel is regularized to achieve naturally visual effects. Besides,
the attack can be further enhanced by adaptively tuning the translations of
object and background. Extensive experimental results on the NeurIPS'17
adversarial competition dataset validate the effectiveness of ABBA by
considering various kernel sizes, translations, and regions. Furthermore, we
study the effects of state-of-the-art GAN-based deblurring mechanisms to our
methods.

Title: Segmenting unseen industrial components in a heavy clutter using rgb-d
  fusion and synthetic data
Authors: Seunghyeok Back, Jongwon Kim, Raeyong Kang, Seungjun Choi, Kyoobin Lee
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: 5 pages
\\
  Segmentation of unseen industrial parts is essential for autonomous
industrial systems. However, industrial components are texture-less,
reflective, and often found in cluttered and unstructured environments with
heavy occlusion, which makes it more challenging to deal with unseen objects.
To tackle this problem, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that
randomizes textures via domain randomization to focus on the shape information.
In addition, we propose an RGB-D Fusion Mask R-CNN with a confidence map
estimator, which exploits reliable depth information in multiple feature
levels. We transferred the trained model to real-world scenarios and evaluated
its performance by making comparisons with baselines and ablation studies. We
demonstrate that our methods, which use only synthetic data, could be effective
solutions for unseen industrial components segmentation.

Title: A New Perspective for Flexible Feature Gathering in Scene Text
  Recognition Via Character Anchor Pooling
Authors: Shangbang Long, Yushuo Guan, Kaigui Bian, Cong Yao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To appear at ICASSP 2020
\\
  Irregular scene text recognition has attracted much attention from the
research community, mainly due to the complexity of shapes of text in natural
scene.
  However, recent methods either rely on shape-sensitive modules such as
bounding box regression, or discard sequence learning.
  To tackle these issues, we propose a pair of coupling modules, termed as
Character Anchoring Module (CAM) and Anchor Pooling Module (APM), to extract
high-level semantics from two-dimensional space to form feature sequences.
  The proposed CAM localizes the text in a shape-insensitive way by design by
anchoring characters individually.
  APM then interpolates and gathers features flexibly along the character
anchors which enables sequence learning.
  The complementary modules realize a harmonic unification of spatial
information and sequence learning.
  With the proposed modules, our recognition system surpasses previous
state-of-the-art scores on irregular and perspective text datasets, including,
ICDAR 2015, CUTE, and Total-Text, while paralleling state-of-the-art
performance on regular text datasets.

Title: UGRWO-Sampling: A modified random walk under-sampling approach based on
  graphs to imbalanced data classification
Authors: Saeideh Roshanfekr, Shahriar Esmaeili, Hassan Ataeian, Neda Maleki
  Khas and Ali Amiri

\\
  In this paper, we propose a new RWO-Sampling (Random Walk Over-Sampling)
based on graphs for imbalanced datasets. In this method, two figures based on
under-sampling and over-sampling methods are introduced to keep the proximity
information, which is robust to noises and outliers. After the construction of
the first graph on minority class, RWO-Sampling will be implemented on selected
samples, and the rest of them will remain unchanged. The second graph is
constructed for the majority class, and the samples in a low-density area
(outliers) are removed. In the proposed method, examples of the majority class
in a high-density area are selected, and the rest of them are eliminated.
Furthermore, utilizing RWO-sampling, the boundary of minority class is
increased though, the outliers are not raised. This method is tested, and the
number of evaluation measures is compared to previous methods on nine
continuous attribute datasets with different over-sampling rates. The
experimental results were an indicator of the high efficiency and flexibility
of the proposed method for the classification of imbalanced data.

Title: From Anchor Generation to Distribution Alignment: Learning a
  Discriminative Embedding Space for Zero-Shot Recognition
Authors: Fuzhen Li, Zhenfeng Zhu, Xingxing Zhang, Jian Cheng, Yao Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures
\\
  In zero-shot learning (ZSL), the samples to be classified are usually
projected into side information templates such as attributes. However, the
irregular distribution of templates makes classification results confused. To
alleviate this issue, we propose a novel framework called Discriminative Anchor
Generation and Distribution Alignment Model (DAGDA). Firstly, in order to
rectify the distribution of original templates, a diffusion based graph
convolutional network, which can explicitly model the interaction between class
and side information, is proposed to produce discriminative anchors. Secondly,
to further align the samples with the corresponding anchors in anchor space,
which aims to refine the distribution in a fine-grained manner, we introduce a
semantic relation regularization in anchor space. Following the way of
inductive learning, our approach outperforms some existing state-of-the-art
methods, on several benchmark datasets, for both conventional as well as
generalized ZSL setting. Meanwhile, the ablation experiments strongly
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component.

\\
  Autonomous vehicles has been a common term in our day to day life with car
manufacturers like Tesla shipping cars that are SAE Level 3. While these
vehicles include a slew of features such as parking assistance and cruise
control,they have mostly been tailored to foreign roads. Potholes, and the
abundance of them, is something that is unique to our Indian roads. We believe
that successful detection of potholes from visual images can be applied in a
variety of scenarios. Moreover, the sheer variety in the color, shape and size
of potholes makes this problem an apt candidate to be solved using modern
machine learning and image processing techniques.

Title: FAU, Facial Expressions, Valence and Arousal: A Multi-task Solution
Authors: Didan Deng, Zhaokang Chen, Bertram E. Shi
Categories: cs.CV cs.MM
Comments: A technical report to the FG-2020 ABAW Competition
\\
  In the paper, we aim to train a unified model that performs three tasks:
Facial Action Units (FAU) prediction, seven basic facial expressions
prediction, as well as valence and arousal prediction. The main challenge of
this task is the lack of fully-annotated dataset. Most of existing datasets
only contain one or two types of labels. To tackle this challenge, we propose
an algorithm for the multitask model to learn from partial labels. The
algorithm has two steps: first, we train a teacher model to perform all three
tasks, where each instance is trained by the ground truth label of its
corresponding task. Second, we refer to the outputs of the teacher model as the
soft labels. We use the soft labels and the ground truths to train the student
model. We find that the student model outperforms the teacher model on all the
tasks, possibly due to the exposure to the full set of labels. Finally, we use
ensemble modeling to boost the performance further on the three tasks.

\\
  The ability to automatically detect, classify, calculate the size, number,
and grade of retinal cells and other biological objects is critically important
in eye disease like age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In this paper, we
developed an automated tool based on deep learning technique and Mask R-CNN
model to analyze large datasets of transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images and quantify retinal cells with high speed and precision. We considered
three categories for outer nuclear layer (ONL) cells: live, intermediate, and
pyknotic. We trained the model using a dataset of 24 samples. We then optimized
the hyper-parameters using another set of 6 samples. The results of this
research, after applying to the test datasets, demonstrated that our method is
highly accurate for automatically detecting, categorizing, and counting cell
nuclei in the ONL of the retina. Performance of our model was tested using
general metrics: general mean average precision (mAP) for detection; and
precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for categorizing and counting.

Title: Prototype Refinement Network for Few-Shot Segmentation
Authors: Jinlu Liu and Yongqiang Qin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Few-shot segmentation targets to segment new classes with few annotated
images provided. It is more challenging than traditional semantic segmentation
tasks that segment pre-defined classes with abundant annotated data. In this
paper, we propose Prototype Refinement Network (PRNet) to attack the challenge
of few-shot segmentation. PRNet learns to bidirectionally extract prototypes
from both support and query images, which is different from existing methods.
To extract representative prototypes of the new classes, we use adaptation and
fusion for prototype refinement. The adaptation of PRNet is implemented by
fine-tuning on the support set. Furthermore, prototype fusion is adopted to
fuse support prototypes with query prototypes, incorporating the knowledge from
both sides. Refined in this way, the prototypes become more discriminative in
low-data regimes. Experiments on PASAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ demonstrate the
superiority of our method. Especially on COCO-$20^i$, PRNet significantly
outperforms previous methods by a large margin of 13.1% in 1-shot setting and
17.4% in 5-shot setting respectively.

Title: Post-Comparison Mitigation of Demographic Bias in Face Recognition Using
  Fair Score Normalization
Authors: Philipp Terh\"orst, Jan Niklas Kolf, Naser Damer, Florian
  Kirchbuchner, Arjan Kuijper
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Under review in Pattern Recognition Letters since July 12, 2019
\\
  Current face recognition systems achieved high progress on several benchmark
tests. Despite this progress, recent works showed that these systems are
strongly biased against demographic sub-groups. Consequently, an easily
integrable solution is needed to reduce the discriminatory effect of these
biased systems. Previous work introduced fairness-enhancing solutions that
strongly degrades the overall system performance. In this work, we propose a
novel fair score normalization approach that is specifically designed to reduce
the effect of bias in face recognition and subsequently lead to a significant
overall performance boost. Our hypothesis is built on the notation of
individual fairness by designing a normalization approach that leads to
treating "similar" individuals "similarly". Experiments were conducted on two
publicly available datasets captured under controlled and in-the-wild
circumstances. The results show that our fair normalization approach enhances
the overall performance by up to 14.8% under intermediate false match rate
settings and up to 30.7% under high security settings. Our proposed approach
significantly reduces the errors of all demographic groups, and thus reduce
bias. Especially under in-the-wild conditions, we demonstrated that our fair
normalization method improves the recognition performance of the effected
population sub-groups by 31.6%. Unlike previous work, our proposed
fairness-enhancing solution does not require demographic information about the
individuals, leads to an overall performance boost, and can be easily
integrated in existing biometric systems.

Title: End-to-End Facial Deep Learning Feature Compression with Teacher-Student
  Enhancement
Authors: Shurun Wang, Wenhan Yang, Shiqi Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end feature compression scheme by
leveraging the representation and learning capability of deep neural networks,
towards intelligent front-end equipped analysis with promising accuracy and
efficiency. In particular, the extracted features are compactly coded in an
end-to-end manner by optimizing the rate-distortion cost to achieve
feature-in-feature representation. In order to further improve the compression
performance, we present a latent code level teacher-student enhancement model,
which could efficiently transfer the low bit-rate representation into a high
bit rate one. Such a strategy further allows us to adaptively shift the
representation cost to decoding computations, leading to more flexible feature
compression with enhanced decoding capability. We verify the effectiveness of
the proposed model with the facial feature, and experimental results reveal
better compression performance in terms of rate-accuracy compared with existing
models.

Title: Collaborative Training of Balanced Random Forests for Open Set Domain
  Adaptation
Authors: Jongbin Ryu, Jiun Bae, Jongwoo Lim
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we introduce a collaborative training algorithm of balanced
random forests with convolutional neural networks for domain adaptation tasks.
In real scenarios, most domain adaptation algorithms face the challenges from
noisy, insufficient training data and open set categorization. In such cases,
conventional methods suffer from overfitting and fail to successfully transfer
the knowledge of the source to the target domain. To address these issues, the
following two techniques are proposed. First, we introduce the optimized
decision tree construction method with convolutional neural networks, in which
the data at each node are split into equal sizes while maximizing the
information gain. It generates balanced decision trees on deep features because
of the even-split constraint, which contributes to enhanced discrimination
power and reduced overfitting problem. Second, to tackle the domain
misalignment problem, we propose the domain alignment loss which penalizes
uneven splits of the source and target domain data. By collaboratively
optimizing the information gain of the labeled source data as well as the
entropy of unlabeled target data distributions, the proposed CoBRF algorithm
achieves significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

Title: CRVOS: Clue Refining Network for Video Object Segmentation

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The encoder-decoder based methods for semi-supervised video object
segmentation (Semi-VOS) have received extensive attentions due to their
superior performances. However, most of them have complex intermediate networks
which generate strong specifiers, to be robust against challenging scenarios,
and this is quite inefficient when dealing with relatively simple scenarios. To
solve this problem, we propose a real-time Clue Refining Network for Video
Object Segmentation (CRVOS) which does not have complex intermediate network.
In this work, we propose a simple specifier, referred to as the Clue, which
consists of the previous frame's coarse mask and coordinates information. We
also propose a novel refine module which shows higher performance than general
ones by using deconvolution layer instead of bilinear upsampling. Our proposed
network, CRVOS, is the fastest method with the competitive performance. On
DAVIS16 validation set, CRVOS achieves 61 FPS and J&F score of 81.6%.

  Recognition from Hard Samples
Authors: Yuge Huang, Pengcheng Shen, Ying Tai, Shaoxin Li, Xiaoming Liu, Jilin
  Li, Feiyue Huang, Rongrong Ji
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Large facial variations are the main challenge in face recognition. To this
end, previous variation-specific methods make full use of task-related prior to
design special network losses, which are typically not general among different
tasks and scenarios. In contrast, the existing generic methods focus on
improving the feature discriminability to minimize the intra-class distance
while maximizing the interclass distance, which perform well on easy samples
but fail on hard samples. To improve the performance on those hard samples for
general tasks, we propose a novel Distribution Distillation Loss to narrow the
performance gap between easy and hard samples, which is a simple, effective and
generic for various types of facial variations. Specifically, we first adopt
state-of-the-art classifiers such as ArcFace to construct two similarity
distributions: teacher distribution from easy samples and student distribution
from hard samples. Then, we propose a novel distribution-driven loss to
constrain the student distribution to approximate the teacher distribution,
which thus leads to smaller overlap between the positive and negative pairs in
the student distribution. We have conducted extensive experiments on both
generic large-scale face benchmarks and benchmarks with diverse variations on
race, resolution and pose. The quantitative results demonstrate the superiority
of our method over strong baselines, e.g., Arcface and Cosface.

Title: Uncertainty Estimation for End-To-End Learned Dense Stereo Matching via
  Probabilistic Deep Learning
Authors: Max Mehltretter

\\
  Motivated by the need to identify erroneous disparity assignments, various
approaches for uncertainty and confidence estimation of dense stereo matching
have been presented in recent years. As in many other fields, especially deep
learning based methods have shown convincing results. However, most of these
methods only model the uncertainty contained in the data, while ignoring the
uncertainty of the employed dense stereo matching procedure. Additionally
modelling the latter, however, is particularly beneficial if the domain of the
training data varies from that of the data to be processed. For this purpose,
in the present work the idea of probabilistic deep learning is applied to the
task of dense stereo matching for the first time. Based on the well-known and
commonly employed GC-Net architecture, a novel probabilistic neural network is
presented, for the task of joint depth and uncertainty estimation from epipolar
rectified stereo image pairs. Instead of learning the network parameters
directly, the proposed probabilistic neural network learns a probability
distribution from which parameters are sampled for every prediction. The
variations between multiple such predictions on the same image pair allow to
approximate the model uncertainty. The quality of the estimated depth and
uncertainty information is assessed in an extensive evaluation on three
different datasets.

Title: Deep Multi-task Multi-label CNN for Effective Facial Attribute
  Classification
Authors: Longbiao Mao, Yan Yan, Jing-Hao Xue, and Hanzi Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Facial Attribute Classification (FAC) has attracted increasing attention in
computer vision and pattern recognition. However, state-of-the-art FAC methods
perform face detection/alignment and FAC independently. The inherent
dependencies between these tasks are not fully exploited. In addition, most
methods predict all facial attributes using the same CNN network architecture,
which ignores the different learning complexities of facial attributes. To
address the above problems, we propose a novel deep multi-task multi-label CNN,
termed DMM-CNN, for effective FAC. Specifically, DMM-CNN jointly optimizes two
closely-related tasks (i.e., facial landmark detection and FAC) to improve the
performance of FAC by taking advantage of multi-task learning. To deal with the
diverse learning complexities of facial attributes, we divide the attributes
into two groups: objective attributes and subjective attributes. Two different
network architectures are respectively designed to extract features for two
groups of attributes, and a novel dynamic weighting scheme is proposed to
automatically assign the loss weight to each facial attribute during training.
Furthermore, an adaptive thresholding strategy is developed to effectively
alleviate the problem of class imbalance for multi-label learning. Experimental
results on the challenging CelebA and LFWA datasets show the superiority of the
proposed DMM-CNN method compared with several state-of-the-art FAC methods.

Title: Knowledge Distillation for Brain Tumor Segmentation
Authors: Dmitrii Lachinov, Elena Shipunova and Vadim Turlapov
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  The segmentation of brain tumors in multimodal MRIs is one of the most
challenging tasks in medical image analysis. The recent state of the art
algorithms solving this task is based on machine learning approaches and deep
learning in particular. The amount of data used for training such models and
its variability is a keystone for building an algorithm with high
representation power. In this paper, we study the relationship between the
performance of the model and the amount of data employed during the training
process. On the example of brain tumor segmentation challenge, we compare the
model trained with labeled data provided by challenge organizers, and the same
model trained in omni-supervised manner using additional unlabeled data
annotated with the ensemble of heterogeneous models. As a result, a single
model trained with additional data achieves performance close to the ensemble
of multiple models and outperforms individual methods.

Title: Fabricated Pictures Detection with Graph Matching
Authors: Binrui Shen, Qiang Niu and Shengxin Zhu
Categories: cs.CV cs.CR
\\
  Fabricating experimental pictures in research work is a serious academic
misconduct, which should better be detected in the reviewing process. However,
due to large number of submissions, the detection whether a picture is
fabricated or reused is laborious for reviewers, and sometimes is indistinct
with human eyes. A tool for detecting similarity between images may help to
alleviate this problem. Some methods based on local feature points matching
work for most of the time, while these methods may result in mess of matchings
due to ignorance of global relationship between features. We present a
framework to detect similar, or perhaps fabricated, pictures with the graph
matching techniques. A new iterative method is proposed, and experiments show
that such a graph matching technique is better than the methods based only on
local features for some cases.

Comments: Medical Imaging meets NeurIPS 2019
\\
  Predictive marker patterns in imaging data are a means to quantify disease
and progression, but their identification is challenging, if the underlying
biology is poorly understood. Here, we present a method to identify predictive
texture patterns in medical images in an unsupervised way. Based on deep
clustering networks, we simultaneously encode and cluster medical image patches
in a low-dimensional latent space. The resulting clusters serve as features for
disease staging, linking them to the underlying disease. We evaluate the method
on 70 T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of patients with different stages
of liver steatosis. The deep clustering approach is able to find predictive
clusters with a stable ranking, differentiating between low and high steatosis
with an F1-Score of 0.78.

Title: Deep Frequent Spatial Temporal Learning for Face Anti-Spoofing
Authors: Ying Huang, Wenwei Zhang, and Jinzhuo Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Face anti-spoofing is crucial for the security of face recognition system, by
avoiding invaded with presentation attack. Previous works have shown the
effectiveness of using depth and temporal supervision for this task. However,
depth supervision is often considered only in a single frame, and temporal
supervision is explored by utilizing certain signals which is not robust to the
change of scenes. In this work, motivated by two stream ConvNets, we propose a
novel two stream FreqSaptialTemporalNet for face anti-spoofing which
simultaneously takes advantage of frequent, spatial and temporal information.
Compared with existing methods which mine spoofing cues in multi-frame RGB
image, we make multi-frame spectrum image as one input stream for the
discriminative deep neural network, encouraging the primary difference between
live and fake video to be automatically unearthed. Extensive experiments show
promising improvement results using the proposed architecture. Meanwhile, we
proposed a concise method to obtain a large amount of spoofing training data by
utilizing a frequent augmentation pipeline, which contributes detail
visualization between live and fake images as well as data insufficiency issue
when training large networks.

  A sleepy driver is arguably much more dangerous on the road than the one who
is speeding as he is a victim of microsleeps. Automotive researchers and
manufacturers are trying to curb this problem with several technological
solutions that will avert such a crisis. This article focuses on the detection
of such micro sleep and drowsiness using neural network based methodologies.
Our previous work in this field involved using machine learning with
multi-layer perceptron to detect the same. In this paper, accuracy was
increased by utilizing facial landmarks which are detected by the camera and
that is passed to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify drowsiness.
The achievement with this work is the capability to provide a lightweight
alternative to heavier classification models with more than 88% for the
category without glasses, more than 85% for the category night without glasses.
On average, more than 83% of accuracy was achieved in all categories. Moreover,
as for model size, complexity and storage, there is a marked reduction in the
new proposed model in comparison to the benchmark model where the maximum size
is 75 KB. The proposed CNN based model can be used to build a real-time driver
drowsiness detection system for embedded systems and Android devices with high
accuracy and ease of use.

\\
  The crucial components of a conventional image registration method are the
choice of the right feature representations and similarity measures. These two
components, although elaborately designed, are somewhat handcrafted using human
knowledge. To this end, these two components are tackled in an end-to-end
manner via reinforcement learning in this work. Specifically, an artificial
agent, which is composed of a combined policy and value network, is trained to
adjust the moving image toward the right direction. We train this network using
an asynchronous reinforcement learning algorithm, where a customized reward
function is also leveraged to encourage robust image registration. This trained
network is further incorporated with a lookahead inference to improve the
registration capability. The advantage of this algorithm is fully demonstrated
by our superior performance on clinical MR and CT image pairs to other
state-of-the-art medical image registration methods.

Title: Iterative energy-based projection on a normal data manifold for anomaly
  localization
Authors: David Dehaene, Oriel Frigo, S\'ebastien Combrexelle, Pierre Eline
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  Autoencoder reconstructions are widely used for the task of unsupervised
anomaly localization. Indeed, an autoencoder trained on normal data is expected
to only be able to reconstruct normal features of the data, allowing the
segmentation of anomalous pixels in an image via a simple comparison between
the image and its autoencoder reconstruction. In practice however, local
defects added to a normal image can deteriorate the whole reconstruction,
making this segmentation challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose in this
paper a new approach for projecting anomalous data on a autoencoder-learned
normal data manifold, by using gradient descent on an energy derived from the
autoencoder's loss function. This energy can be augmented with regularization
terms that model priors on what constitutes the user-defined optimal
projection. By iteratively updating the input of the autoencoder, we bypass the
loss of high-frequency information caused by the autoencoder bottleneck. This
allows to produce images of higher quality than classic reconstructions. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on various anomaly localization
datasets. It also shows promising results at an inpainting task on the CelebA
dataset.

\\
  We envision that in the near future, humanoid robots would share home space
and assist us in our daily and routine activities through object manipulations.
One of the fundamental technologies that need to be developed for robots is to
enable them to detect objects and recognize them for effective manipulations
and take real-time decisions involving those objects. In this paper, we
describe a novel architecture that enables multiple low-compute NAO robots to
perform real-time detection, recognition and localization of objects in its
camera view and take programmable actions based on the detected objects. The
proposed algorithm for object detection and localization is an empirical
modification of YOLOv3, based on indoor experiments in multiple scenarios, with
a smaller weight size and lesser computational requirements. Quantization of
the weights and re-adjusting filter sizes and layer arrangements for
convolutions improved the inference time for low-resolution images from the
robot s camera feed. YOLOv3 was chosen after a comparative study of bounding
box algorithms was performed with an objective to choose one that strikes the
perfect balance among information retention, low inference time and high
accuracy for real-time object detection and localization. The architecture also
comprises of an effective end-to-end pipeline to feed the real-time frames from
the camera feed to the neural net and use its results for guiding the robot
with customizable actions corresponding to the detected class labels.

Title: Universal Semantic Segmentation for Fisheye Urban Driving Images
Authors: Yaozu Ye, Kailun Yang, Kaite Xiang, Juan Wang and Kaiwei Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Submitted to IV2020
\\
  Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous
driving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view
(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,
making automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by
fisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye data sets are not available, and
the fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with
large distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be
directly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation
method is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more
comprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed
into fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by
cameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result
shows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can evidently improve the
model's accuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This
seven-DoF augmentation provides an universal semantic segmentation solution for
fisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide
specific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At
last, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye
images and obtained satisfactory results. The code and configurations are
released at \url{https://github.com/Yaozhuwa/FisheyeSeg}.

Title: Localizing Multi-scale Semantic Patches for Image Classification
Authors: Chuanguang Yang, Xiaolong Hu, Zhulin An, Hui Zhu, Yongjun Xu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) always non-linearly aggregate the
information from the whole input image, which results in the difficult to
interpret how relevant regions contribute the final prediction. In this paper,
we construct a light-weight AnchorNet combined with our proposed algorithms to
localize multi-scale semantic patches, where the contribution of each patch can
be determined due to the linearly spatial aggregation before the softmax layer.
Visual explanation shows that localized patches can indeed retain the semantics
of the original images, while helping us to further analyze the feature
extraction of localization branches with various receptive fields. For more
practical, we use localized patches for downstream classification tasks across
widely applied networks. Experimental results demonstrate that replacing the
original images can get a clear inference acceleration with only tiny
performance degradation.

  Previous approaches for video summarization mainly concentrate on finding the
most diverse and representative visual contents as video summary without

query-focused video summarization, which takes user's query and a long video as
inputs and aims to generate a query-focused video summary. In this paper, we
consider the task as a problem of computing similarity between video shots and
query. To this end, we propose a method, named Convolutional Hierarchical
Attention Network (CHAN), which consists of two parts: feature encoding network
and query-relevance computing module. In the encoding network, we employ a
convolutional network with local self-attention mechanism and query-aware
global attention mechanism to learns visual information of each shot. The
encoded features will be sent to query-relevance computing module to generate
queryfocused video summary. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset

Title: Dynamic Error-bounded Lossy Compression (EBLC) to Reduce the Bandwidth
  Requirement for Real-time Vision-based Pedestrian Safety Applications
Authors: Mizanur Rahman, Mhafuzul Islam, Jon C. Calhoun and Mashrur Chowdhury
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables
\\
  As camera quality improves and their deployment moves to areas with limited
bandwidth, communication bottlenecks can impair real-time constraints of an ITS
application, such as video-based real-time pedestrian detection. Video
compression reduces the bandwidth requirement to transmit the video but
degrades the video quality. As the quality level of the video decreases, it
results in the corresponding decreases in the accuracy of the vision-based
pedestrian detection model. Furthermore, environmental conditions (e.g., rain
and darkness) alter the compression ratio and can make maintaining a high
pedestrian detection accuracy more difficult. The objective of this study is to
develop a real-time error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) strategy to
dynamically change the video compression level depending on different
environmental conditions in order to maintain a high pedestrian detection
accuracy. We conduct a case study to show the efficacy of our dynamic EBLC
strategy for real-time vision-based pedestrian detection under adverse
environmental conditions. Our strategy selects the error tolerances dynamically
for lossy compression that can maintain a high detection accuracy across a
representative set of environmental conditions. Analyses reveal that our
strategy increases pedestrian detection accuracy up to 14% and reduces the
communication bandwidth up to 14x for adverse environmental conditions compared
to the same conditions but without our dynamic EBLC strategy. Our dynamic EBLC
strategy is independent of detection models and environmental conditions
allowing other detection models and environmental conditions to be easily
incorporated in our strategy.

Title: Black Box Explanation by Learning Image Exemplars in the Latent Feature
  Space
Authors: Riccardo Guidotti, Anna Monreale, Stan Matwin, Dino Pedreschi
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We present an approach to explain the decisions of black box models for image
classification. While using the black box to label images, our explanation
method exploits the latent feature space learned through an adversarial
autoencoder. The proposed method first generates exemplar images in the latent
feature space and learns a decision tree classifier. Then, it selects and
decodes exemplars respecting local decision rules. Finally, it visualizes them
in a manner that shows to the user how the exemplars can be modified to either
stay within their class, or to become counter-factuals by "morphing" into
another class. Since we focus on black box decision systems for image
classification, the explanation obtained from the exemplars also provides a
saliency map highlighting the areas of the image that contribute to its
classification, and areas of the image that push it into another class. We
present the results of an experimental evaluation on three datasets and two
black box models. Besides providing the most useful and interpretable
explanations, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing explainers
in terms of fidelity, relevance, coherence, and stability.

  Age estimation is a technique for predicting human ages from digital facial
images, which analyzes a person's face image and estimates his/her age based on
the year measure. Nowadays, intelligent age estimation and age synthesis have
become particularly prevalent research topics in computer vision and face
verification systems. Age synthesis is defined to render a facial image
aesthetically with rejuvenating and natural aging effects on the person's face.
Age estimation is defined to label a facial image automatically with the age
group (year range) or the exact age (year) of the person's face. In this case

Title: Weighted Average Precision: Adversarial Example Detection in the Visual
  Perception of Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Yilan Li, Senem Velipasalar
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Recent works have shown that neural networks are vulnerable to carefully
crafted adversarial examples (AE). By adding small perturbations to input
images, AEs are able to make the victim model predicts incorrect outputs.
Several research work in adversarial machine learning started to focus on the
detection of AEs in autonomous driving. However, the existing studies either
use preliminary assumption on outputs of detections or ignore the tracking
system in the perception pipeline. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel
distance metric for practical autonomous driving object detection outputs.
Then, we bridge the gap between the current AE detection research and the
real-world autonomous systems by providing a temporal detection algorithm,
which takes the impact of tracking system into consideration. We perform
evaluation on Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) and CityScapes datasets to show how our
approach outperforms existing single-frame-mAP based AE detections by
increasing 17.76% accuracy of performance.

Title: An Empirical Study of Person Re-Identification with Attributes
Authors: Vikram Shree, Wei-Lun Chao and Mark Campbell
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: Accepted by RO-MAN 2019, 28th IEEE International Conference on Robot

\\
  Person re-identification aims to identify a person from an image collection,
given one image of that person as the query. There is, however, a plethora of
real-life scenarios where we may not have a priori library of query images and
therefore must rely on information from other modalities. In this paper, an
attribute-based approach is proposed where the person of interest (POI) is
described by a set of visual attributes, which are used to perform the search.
We compare multiple algorithms and analyze how the quality of attributes
impacts the performance. While prior work mostly relies on high precision
attributes annotated by experts, we conduct a human-subject study and reveal
that certain visual attributes could not be consistently described by human
observers, making them less reliable in real applications. A key conclusion is
that the performance achieved by non-expert attributes, instead of
expert-annotated ones, is a more faithful indicator of the status quo of
attribute-based approaches for person re-identification.

Title: Music2Dance: Music-driven Dance Generation using WaveNet
Authors: Wenlin Zhuang, Congyi Wang, Siyu Xia, Jinxiang Chai, Yangang Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel system, named as Music2Dance, for
addressing the problem of fully automatic music and choreography. Our key idea
is to shift the WaveNet, which is originally designed for speech generation, to
the human motion synthesis. To balance the big differences between these two
tasks, we propose a novel network structure. Typically, being regarded as the
local condition for our network, the music features are first extracted by
considering the characteristics of rhythms and melody. In addition, the types
of dance are then designed as the global condition for the network. Both of the
two conditions are utilized to stabilize the network training. Beyond the
network architecture, another main challenge is the lack of data. In order to
further tackle the obstacle, we have captured the synchronized music-dance
pairs by professional dancers, and thus build a high-quality music-dance pair
dataset. Experiments have demonstrated the performance of the proposed system
and the proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art results.

Title: Learning Numerical Observers using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Authors: Shenghua He and Weimin Zhou and Hua Li and Mark A. Anastasio
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: SPIE Medical Imaging 2020 (Oral)
\\
  Medical imaging systems are commonly assessed by use of objective image
quality measures. Supervised deep learning methods have been investigated to
implement numerical observers for task-based image quality assessment. However,
labeling large amounts of experimental data to train deep neural networks is
tedious, expensive, and prone to subjective errors. Computer-simulated image
data can potentially be employed to circumvent these issues; however, it is
often difficult to computationally model complicated anatomical structures,
noise sources, and the response of real world imaging systems. Hence, simulated
image data will generally possess physical and statistical differences from the
experimental image data they seek to emulate. Within the context of machine
learning, these differences between the sets of two images is referred to as
domain shift. In this study, we propose and investigate the use of an
adversarial domain adaptation method to mitigate the deleterious effects of
domain shift between simulated and experimental image data for deep
learning-based numerical observers (DL-NOs) that are trained on simulated
images but applied to experimental ones. In the proposed method, a DL-NO will
initially be trained on computer-simulated image data and subsequently adapted
for use with experimental image data, without the need for any labeled
experimental images. As a proof of concept, a binary signal detection task is
considered. The success of this strategy as a function of the degree of domain
shift present between the simulated and experimental image data is
investigated.

Title: Deriving Emotions and Sentiments from Visual Content: A Disaster
  Analysis Use Case
Authors: Kashif Ahmad, Syed Zohaib, Nicola Conci and Ala Al-Fuqaha
Categories: cs.CV cs.IR cs.LG cs.MM
\\
  Sentiment analysis aims to extract and express a person's perception,
opinions and emotions towards an entity, object, product and a service,
enabling businesses to obtain feedback from the consumers. The increasing
popularity of the social networks and users' tendency towards sharing their
feelings, expressions and opinions in text, visual and audio content has opened
new opportunities and challenges in sentiment analysis. While sentiment
analysis of text streams has been widely explored in the literature, sentiment
analysis of images and videos is relatively new. This article introduces visual
sentiment analysis and contrasts it with textual sentiment analysis with
emphasis on the opportunities and challenges in this nascent research area. We
also propose a deep visual sentiment analyzer for disaster-related images as a
use-case, covering different aspects of visual sentiment analysis starting from
data collection, annotation, model selection, implementation and evaluations.
We believe such rigorous analysis will provide a baseline for future research
in the domain.

Title: Towards Deep Machine Reasoning: a Prototype-based Deep Neural Network
  with Decision Tree Inference
Authors: Plamen Angelov, Eduardo Soares
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to the IEEE Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN -
  2020)
\\
  In this paper we introduce the DMR -- a prototype-based method and network
architecture for deep learning which is using a decision tree (DT)-based
inference and synthetic data to balance the classes. It builds upon the
recently introduced xDNN method addressing more complex multi-class problems,
specifically when classes are highly imbalanced. DMR moves away from a direct
decision based on all classes towards a layered DT of pair-wise class
comparisons. In addition, it forces the prototypes to be balanced between
classes regardless of possible class imbalances of the training data. It has
two novel mechanisms, namely i) using a DT to determine the winning class
label, and ii) balancing the classes by synthesizing data around the prototypes
determined from the available training data. As a result, we improved
significantly the performance of the resulting fully explainable DNN as
evidenced by the best reported result on the well know benchmark problem
Caltech-101 surpassing our own recently published "world record". Furthermore,
we also achieved another "world record" for another very hard benchmark
problem, namely Caltech-256 as well as surpassed the results of other
approaches on Faces-1999 problem. In summary, we propose a new approach
specifically advantageous for imbalanced multi-class problems that achieved two
world records on well known hard benchmark problems and the best result on
another problem in terms of accuracy. Moreover, DMR offers full explainability,
does not require GPUs and can continue to learn from new data by adding new
prototypes preserving the previous ones but not requiring full retraining.

Title: Multi-stream Faster RCNN for Mitosis Counting in Breast Cancer Images
Authors: Robin Elizabeth Yancey
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Mitotic count is a commonly used method to assess the level of progression of
breast cancer, which is now the fourth most prevalent cancer. Unfortunately,
counting mitosis is a tedious and subjective task with poor reproducibility,
especially for non-experts. Luckily, since the machine can read and compare
more data with greater efficiency this could be the next modern technique to
count mitosis. Furthermore, technological advancements in medicine have led to
the increase in image data available for use in training. In this work, we
propose a network constructed using a similar approach to one that has been
used for image fraud detection with the segmented image map as the second
stream input to Faster RCNN. This region-based detection model combines a fully
convolutional Region Proposal Network to generate proposals and a
classification network to classify each of these proposals as containing
mitosis or not. Features from both streams are fused in the bilinear pooling
layer to maintain the spatial concurrence of each. After training this model on
the ICPR 2014 MITOSIS contest dataset, we received an F-measure score of 0.507,
higher than both the winners score and scores from recent tests on the same
data. Our method is clinically applicable, taking only around five min per ten
full High Power Field slides when tested on a Quadro P6000 cloud GPU.

  One third of food produced in the world for human consumption --
approximately 1.3 billion tons -- is lost or wasted every year. By classifying
food waste of individual consumers and raising awareness of the measures,
avoidable food waste can be significantly reduced. In this research, we use
deep learning to classify food waste in half a million images captured by
cameras installed on top of food waste bins. We specifically designed a deep
neural network that classifies food waste for every time food waste is thrown
in the waste bins. Our method presents how deep learning networks can be
tailored to best learn from available training data.

\\
  Today, video cameras are deployed in dense for monitoring physical places
e.g., city, industrial, or agricultural sites. In the current systems, each
camera node sends its feed to a cloud server individually. However, this
approach suffers from several hurdles including higher computation cost, large
bandwidth requirement for analyzing the enormous data, and privacy concerns. In
dense deployment, video nodes typically demonstrate a significant
spatio-temporal correlation. To overcome these obstacles in current approaches,
this paper introduces CONVINCE, a new approach to look at the network cameras
as a collective entity that enables collaborative video analytics pipeline
among cameras. CONVINCE aims at 1) reducing the computation cost and bandwidth
requirements by leveraging spatio-temporal correlations among cameras in
eliminating redundant frames intelligently, and ii) improving vision
algorithms' accuracy by enabling collaborative knowledge sharing among relevant
cameras. Our results demonstrate that CONVINCE achieves an object
identification accuracy of $\sim$91\%, by transmitting only about $\sim$25\% of
all the recorded frames.

  Understanding how biological communities respond to environmental changes is
a key challenge in ecology and ecosystem management. The apparent decline of
insect populations necessitates more biomonitoring but the time-consuming
sorting and identification of taxa pose strong limitations on how many insect
samples can be processed. In turn, this affects the scale of efforts to map
invertebrate diversity altogether. Given recent advances in computer vision, we
propose to replace the standard manual approach of human expert-based sorting
and identification with an automatic image-based technology. We describe a
robot-enabled image-based identification machine, which can automate the
process of invertebrate identification, biomass estimation and sample sorting.
We use the imaging device to generate a comprehensive image database of
terrestrial arthropod species. We use this database to test the classification
accuracy i.e. how well the species identity of a specimen can be predicted from
images taken by the machine. We also test sensitivity of the classification
accuracy to the camera settings (aperture and exposure time) in order to move
forward with the best possible image quality. We use state-of-the-art Resnet-50
and InceptionV3 CNNs for the classification task. The results for the initial
dataset are very promising ($\overline{ACC}=0.980$). The system is general and
can easily be used for other groups of invertebrates as well. As such, our
results pave the way for generating more data on spatial and temporal variation
in invertebrate abundance, diversity and biomass.

databases of high-resolution fingerprints ceased to be publicly available. To
address this problem, we present an approach to creating high-resolution
synthetic fingerprints. We modified a state-of-the-art fingerprint generator to
create ridge maps with sweat pores and trained a CycleGAN to transform these
maps into realistic prints. We also create a synthetic database of
high-resolution fingerprints using the proposed approach to propel further
studies in this field without raising any legal issues. We test this database
with two existing fingerprint matchers without adjustments to confirm the
realism of the generated images. Besides, we provide a visual analysis that
highlights the quality of our results compared to the state-of-the-art.

  Although group convolutional networks are able to learn powerful
representations based on symmetry patterns, they lack explicit means to learn
meaningful relationships among them (e.g., relative positions and poses). In
this paper, we present attentive group equivariant convolutions, a
generalization of the group convolution, in which attention is applied during
the course of convolution to accentuate meaningful symmetry combinations and
suppress non-plausible, misleading ones. We indicate that prior work on visual
attention can be described as special cases of our proposed framework and show
empirically that our attentive group equivariant convolutional networks
consistently outperform conventional group convolutional networks on benchmark
image datasets. Simultaneously, we provide interpretability to the learned
concepts through the visualization of equivariant attention maps.

Title: CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using Feature Ensembles
Authors: Felipe O. Giuste and Juan C. Vizcarra
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Image classification requires the generation of features capable of detecting
image patterns informative of group identity. The objective of this study was
to classify images from the public CIFAR-10 image dataset by leveraging
combinations of disparate image feature sources from both manual and deep
learning approaches. Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and pixel
intensities successfully inform classification (53% and 59% classification
accuracy, respectively), yet there is much room for improvement. VGG16 with
ImageNet trained weights and a CIFAR-10 optimized model (CIFAR-VGG) further
improve upon image classification (60% and 93.43% accuracy, respectively). We
further improved classification by utilizing transfer learning to re-establish
optimal network weights for VGG16 (TL-VGG) and Inception ResNet v2
(TL-Inception) resulting in significant performance increases (85% and 90.74%,
respectively), yet fail to surpass CIFAR-VGG. We hypothesized that if each
generated feature set obtained some unique insight into the classification
problem, then combining these features would result in greater classification
accuracy, surpassing that of CIFAR-VGG. Upon selection of the top 1000
principal components from TL-VGG, TL-Inception, HOG, pixel intensities, and
CIFAR-VGG, we achieved testing accuracy of 94.6%, lending support to our
hypothesis.

Title: Hierarchical Multi-Process Fusion for Visual Place Recognition
Authors: Stephen Hausler and Michael Milford
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: Pre-print version of article which will be presented at ICRA 2020
\\
  Combining multiple complementary techniques together has long been regarded
as a way to improve performance. In visual localization, multi-sensor fusion,
multi-process fusion of a single sensing modality, and even combinations of
different localization techniques have been shown to result in improved
performance. However, merely fusing together different localization techniques
does not account for the varying performance characteristics of different
localization techniques. In this paper we present a novel, hierarchical
localization system that explicitly benefits from three varying characteristics
of localization techniques: the distribution of their localization hypotheses,
their appearance- and viewpoint-invariant properties, and the resulting
differences in where in an environment each system works well and fails. We
show how two techniques deployed hierarchically work better than in parallel
fusion, how combining two different techniques works better than two levels of
a single technique, even when the single technique has superior individual
performance, and develop two and three-tier hierarchical structures that
progressively improve localization performance. Finally, we develop a stacked
hierarchical framework where localization hypotheses from techniques with
complementary characteristics are concatenated at each layer, significantly
improving retention of the correct hypothesis through to the final localization
stage. Using two challenging datasets, we show the proposed system
outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: 6DoF Object Pose Estimation via Differentiable Proxy Voting Loss
Authors: Xin Yu and Zheyu Zhuang and Piotr Koniusz and Hongdong Li
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Estimating a 6DOF object pose from a single image is very challenging due to
occlusions or textureless appearances. Vector-field based keypoint voting has
demonstrated its effectiveness and superiority on tackling those issues.
However, direct regression of vector-fields neglects that the distances between
pixels and keypoints also affect the deviations of hypotheses dramatically. In
other words, small errors in direction vectors may generate severely deviated
hypotheses when pixels are far away from a keypoint. In this paper, we aim to
reduce such errors by incorporating the distances between pixels and keypoints
into our objective. To this end, we develop a simple yet effective
differentiable proxy voting loss (DPVL) which mimics the hypothesis selection
in the voting procedure. By exploiting our voting loss, we are able to train
our network in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on widely used datasets, i.e.
LINEMOD and Occlusion LINEMOD, manifest that our DPVL improves pose estimation
performance significantly and speeds up the training convergence.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose a novel efficient and lightweight model for human pose estimation
from a single image. Our model is designed to achieve competitive results at a
fraction of the number of parameters and computational cost of various
state-of-the-art methods. To this end, we explicitly incorporate part-based
structural and geometric priors in a hierarchical prediction framework. At the
coarsest resolution, and in a manner similar to classical part-based
approaches, we leverage the kinematic structure of the human body to propagate
convolutional feature updates between the keypoints or body parts. Unlike
classical approaches, we adopt end-to-end training to learn this geometric
prior through feature updates from data. We then propagate the feature
representation at the coarsest resolution up the hierarchy to refine the
predicted pose in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The final network effectively
models the geometric prior and intuition within a lightweight deep neural
network, yielding state-of-the-art results for a model of this size on two
standard datasets, Leeds Sports Pose and MPII Human Pose.

Title: Joint Encoding of Appearance and Motion Features with Self-supervision
  for First Person Action Recognition
Authors: Mirco Planamente, Andrea Bottino, Barbara Caputo
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Wearable cameras are becoming more and more popular in several applications,
increasing the interest of the research community in developing approaches for
recognizing actions from a first-person point of view. An open challenge is how
to cope with the limited amount of motion information available about the
action itself, as opposed to the more investigated third-person action
recognition scenario. When focusing on manipulation tasks, videos tend to
record only parts of the movement, making crucial the understanding of the
objects being manipulated and of their context. Previous works addressed this
issue with two-stream architectures, one dedicated to modeling the appearance
of objects involved in the action, another dedicated to extracting motion
features from optical flow. In this paper, we argue that features from these
two information channels should be learned jointly to capture the
spatio-temporal correlations between the two in a better way. To this end, we
propose a single stream architecture able to do so, thanks to the addition of a
self-supervised block that uses a pretext motion segmentation task to
intertwine motion and appearance knowledge. Experiments on several publicly
available databases show the power of our approach.

  StickyPillars introduces a sparse feature matching method on point clouds. It
is the first approach applying Graph Neural Networks on point clouds to stick
points of interest. The feature estimation and assignment relies on the optimal
transport problem, where the cost is based on the neural network itself. We
utilize a Graph Neural Network for context aggregation with the aid of
multihead self and cross attention. In contrast to image based feature matching
methods, the architecture learns feature extraction in an end-to-end manner.
Hence, the approach does not rely on handcrafted features. Our method
outperforms state-of-the art matching algorithms, while providing real-time
capability.

Title: Unconstrained Periocular Recognition: Using Generative Deep Learning
  Frameworks for Attribute Normalization
Authors: Luiz A. Zanlorensi, Hugo Proen\c{c}a, David Menotti
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Ocular biometric systems working in unconstrained environments usually face
the problem of small within-class compactness caused by the multiple factors
that jointly degrade the quality of the obtained data. In this work, we propose
an attribute normalization strategy based on deep learning generative
frameworks, that reduces the variability of the samples used in pairwise
comparisons, without reducing their discriminability. The proposed method can
be seen as a preprocessing step that contributes for data regularization and
improves the recognition accuracy, being fully agnostic to the recognition
strategy used. As proof of concept, we consider the "eyeglasses" and "gaze"
factors, comparing the levels of performance of five different recognition
methods with/without using the proposed normalization strategy. Also, we
introduce a new dataset for unconstrained periocular recognition, composed of
images acquired by mobile devices, particularly suited to perceive the impact
of "wearing eyeglasses" in recognition effectiveness. Our experiments were
performed in two different datasets, and support the usefulness of our
attribute normalization scheme to improve the recognition performance.

Title: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Spatial Regularization, Volume
  and Star-shape Priori for Image Segmentation
Authors: Jun Liu, Xiangyue Wang, Xue-cheng Tai
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for image segmentation
problems. DCNNs can well extract the features from natural images. However, the
classification functions in the existing network architecture of CNNs are
simple and lack capabilities to handle important spatial information in a way
that have been done for many well-known traditional variational models. Prior
such as spatial regularity, volume prior and object shapes cannot be well
handled by existing DCNNs. We propose a novel Soft Threshold Dynamics (STD)
framework which can easily integrate many spatial priors of the classical
variational models into the DCNNs for image segmentation. The novelty of our
method is to interpret the softmax activation function as a dual variable in a
variational problem, and thus many spatial priors can be imposed in the dual
space. From this viewpoint, we can build a STD based framework which can enable
the outputs of DCNNs to have many special priors such as spatial regularity,
volume constraints and star-shape priori. The proposed method is a general
mathematical framework and it can be applied to any semantic segmentation
DCNNs. To show the efficiency and accuracy of our method, we applied it to the
popular DeepLabV3+ image segmentation network, and the experiments results show
that our method can work efficiently on data-driven image segmentation DCNNs.

Title: Upper, Middle and Lower Region Learning for Facial Action Unit Detection
Authors: Yao Xia
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Facial action units (AUs) detection is fundamental to facial expression
analysis. As AU occur only in a small area of face, region based learning has
been widely recognized useful for AU detection. Most region based studies focus
on a small region where the AU occurs. Focusing on a specific region is helpful
in eliminating the influence of identity, but to be risk for losing
information. It is difficult to find balance. In this study, I propose a simple
strategy. I divide the face into three large regions, upper, middle and lower
region, and group AUs based on where it occurs. I propose a new end-to-end deep
learning framework named three regions based attention network (TRA-Net). After
extracting the global feature, TRA-Net uses a hard attention module to extract
three feature maps, each of which contains only a specific region. Each
region-specific feature map is fed to an independent branch. For each branch,
three continuous soft attention modules are used to extract higher-level
features for final AU detection. In the DISFA dataset, this model achieves the
highest F1 scores for the detection of AU1, AU2 and AU4, and produces the
highest accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

\\
  The trustworthiness of data science systems in applied and real-world
settings emerges from the resolution of specific tensions through situated,
pragmatic, and ongoing forms of work. Drawing on research in CSCW, critical
data studies, and history and sociology of science, and six months of immersive
ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team, we describe four
common tensions in applied data science work: (un)equivocal numbers,
(counter)intuitive knowledge, (in)credible data, and (in)scrutable models. We
show how organizational actors establish and re-negotiate trust under messy and
uncertain analytic conditions through practices of skepticism, assessment, and
credibility. Highlighting the collaborative and heterogeneous nature of
real-world data science, we show how the management of trust in applied
corporate data science settings depends not only on pre-processing and
quantification, but also on negotiation and translation. We conclude by
discussing the implications of our findings for data science research and
practice, both within and beyond CSCW.

Title: Storyboard: Optimizing Precomputed Summaries for Aggregation
Authors: Edward Gan, Peter Bailis, Moses Charikar
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  An emerging class of data systems partition their data and precompute
approximate summaries (i.e., sketches and samples) for each segment to reduce
query costs. They can then aggregate and combine the segment summaries to
estimate results without scanning the raw data. However, given limited storage
space each summary introduces approximation errors that affect query accuracy.
For instance, systems that use existing mergeable summaries cannot reduce query
error below the error of an individual precomputed summary. We introduce
Storyboard, a query system that optimizes item frequency and quantile summaries
for accuracy when aggregating over multiple segments. Compared to conventional
mergeable summaries, Storyboard leverages additional memory available for
summary construction and aggregation to derive a more precise combined result.
This reduces error by up to 25x over interval aggregations and 4.4x over data
cube aggregations on industrial datasets compared to standard summarization
methods, with provable worst-case error guarantees.

Title: Index-based Solutions for Efficient Density Peaks Clustering
Authors: Zafaryab Rasool, Rui Zhou, Lu Chen, Chengfei Liu, Jiajie Xu
Categories: cs.DB cs.IR
Comments: 13 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Density Peaks Clustering (DPC), a novel density-based clustering approach,
has received considerable attention of the research community primarily due to
its simplicity and less parameter requirement. However, the resultant clusters
obtained using DPC are influenced by its sensitive parameter dc which depends
upon data distribution and requirements of different users. Besides, the
original DPC algorithm requires visiting a large number of objects making it
slow.
  To this end, this paper investigates index-based solutions for DPC.
Specifically, we propose two list-based index methods viz. (i) a simple List
Index and (ii) an advanced Cumulative Histogram Index. Efficient query
algorithms are proposed for these indices which significantly avoids irrelevant
comparisons at the cost of space. To remedy this for memory-constrained
systems, we further introduce an approximate solution to the above indices
which allows substantial reduction in the space cost provided slight
inaccuracies are admissible. Furthermore, owing to considerably lower memory
requirements of existing tree-based index structures, we also present effective
pruning techniques and efficient query algorithms to support DPC using the
popular Quadtree Index and R-tree Index. Finally, we practically evaluate all
the above indices and present the findings and results, obtained from a set of
extensive experiments on six synthetic and real datasets. The experimental
insights obtained help to guide in selecting the befitting index.

Title: RDFFrames: Knowledge Graph Access for Machine Learning Tools
Authors: Aisha Mohamed, Ghadeer Abuoda, Abdurrahman Ghanem, Zoi Kaoudi, Ashraf
  Aboulnaga
Categories: cs.DB cs.LG
\\
  Knowledge graphs represented as RDF datasets are becoming increasingly
popular, and they are an integral part of many machine learning applications. A
rich ecosystem of data management systems and tools that support RDF has
evolved over the years to facilitate high performance storage and retrieval of
RDF data, most notably RDF database management systems that support the SPARQL
query language. Surprisingly, machine learning tools for knowledge graphs
typically do not use SPARQL, despite the obvious advantages of using a database
system. This is due to the mismatch between SPARQL and machine learning tools
in terms of the expected data model and the programming style. Machine learning
tools work on data in tabular format and process it using an imperative
programming style, while SPARQL is declarative and has as the basic query
operation matching graph patterns to RDF triples. We posit that a good
interface to knowledge graphs from a machine learning software stack should use
an imperative, navigational programming paradigm based on graph traversal
rather than the SPARQL query paradigm based on graph patterns. In this paper,
we introduce RDFFrames, a framework that provides such an interface. RDFFrames
enables the user to make a sequence of calls in a programming language such as
Python to define the data to be extracted from a knowledge graph stored in an
RDF database system. It then translates these calls into compact SPQARL
queries, executes these queries on the database system, and returns the results
in a standard tabular format. Thus, RDFframes combines the usability of a
machine learning software stack with the performance of an RDF database system.

Title: Optimization of Retrieval Algorithms on Large Scale Knowledge Graphs
Authors: Jens D\"orpinghaus, Andreas Stefan
Categories: cs.DB cs.AI
\\
  Knowledge graphs have been shown to play an important role in recent
knowledge mining and discovery, for example in the field of life sciences or
bioinformatics. Although a lot of research has been done on the field of query
optimization, query transformation and of course in storing and retrieving
large scale knowledge graphs the field of algorithmic optimization is still a
major challenge and a vital factor in using graph databases. Few researchers
have addressed the problem of optimizing algorithms on large scale labeled
property graphs. Here, we present two optimization approaches and compare them
with a naive approach of directly querying the graph database. The aim of our
work is to determine limiting factors of graph databases like Neo4j and we
describe a novel solution to tackle these challenges. For this, we suggest a
classification schema to differ between the complexity of a problem on a graph
database. We evaluate our optimization approaches on a test system containing a
knowledge graph derived biomedical publication data enriched with text mining
data. This dense graph has more than 71M nodes and 850M relationships. The
results are very encouraging and - depending on the problem - we were able to
show a speedup of a factor between 44 and 3839.

Title: Desynchronization and Wave Pattern Formation in MPI-Parallel and Hybrid
  Memory-Bound Programs
Authors: Ayesha Afzal and Georg Hager and Gerhard Wellein
Categories: cs.DC cs.PF
Comments: 18 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Analytic, first-principles performance modeling of distributed-memory
parallel codes is notoriously imprecise. Even for applications with extremely
regular and homogeneous compute-communicate phases, simply adding communication
time to computation time does often not yield a satisfactory prediction of
parallel runtime due to deviations from the expected simple lockstep pattern
caused by system noise, variations in communication time, and inherent load
imbalance. In this paper, we highlight the specific cases of provoked and
spontaneous desynchronization of memory-bound, bulk-synchronous pure MPI and
hybrid MPI+OpenMP programs. Using simple microbenchmarks we observe that
although desynchronization can introduce increased waiting time per process, it
does not necessarily cause lower resource utilization but can lead to an
increase in available bandwidth per core. In case of significant communication
overhead, even natural noise can shove the system into a state of automatic
overlap of communication and computation, improving the overall time to
solution. The saturation point, i.e., the number of processes per memory domain
required to achieve full memory bandwidth, is pivotal in the dynamics of this
process and the emerging stable wave pattern. We also demonstrate how hybrid
MPI-OpenMP programming can prevent desirable desynchronization by eliminating
the bandwidth bottleneck among processes. A Chebyshev filter diagonalization
application is used to demonstrate some of the observed effects in a realistic
setting.

Title: Paving the way for Distributed Non-Blocking Algorithms and Data
  Structures in the Partitioned Global Address Space
Authors: Garvit Dewan, Louis Jenkins
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  The partitioned global address space has bridged the gap between shared and
distributed memory, and with this bridge comes the ability to adapt shared
memory concepts, such as non-blocking programming, to distributed systems such
as supercomputers. To enable non-blocking algorithms, we present ways to
perform scalable atomic operations on objects in remote memory via remote
direct memory address and pointer compression. As a solution to the problem of
concurrent-safe reclamation of memory in a distributed system, we adapt
Epoch-Based Memory Reclamation to distributed memory and implement it in such a
way to support global-view programming. This construct is designed and
implemented for the Chapel programming language, but can be adapted and
generalized to work on other languages and libraries.

Title: On Probabilistic Byzantine Fault Tolerance
Authors: Quan Nguyen, Andre Cronje
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) has been extensively studied in distributed
trustless systems to guarantee system's functioning when up to 1/3 Byzantine
processes exist. Despite a plethora of previous work in BFT systems, they are
mainly concerned about common knowledge deducible from the states of all
participant processes. In BFT systems, it is crucial to know about which
knowledge a process knows about the states of other processes and the global
state of the system. However, there is a lack of studies about common knowledge
of Byzantine faults, such as, whether existence of a Byzantine node is known by
all honest nodes. In a dynamic setting, processes may fail or get compromised
unexpectedly and unpredictably. It is critical to reason about which processes
know about the faulty processes of the network.
  In this paper, we are interested in studying BFT systems in which Byzantine
processes may misbehave randomly, possibly at some random periods of time. The
problem of \emph{probabilistic Byzantine} (PB) processes studied in this paper
is more general than the problems previously studied in existing work. We
propose an approach that allows us to formulate and reason about the concurrent
knowledge of the PB processes by all processes. We present our study of the
proposed approach in both synchronous and asynchronous systems.

Title: A General Coreset-Based Approach to Diversity Maximization under Matroid
  Constraints
Authors: Matteo Ceccarello, Andrea Pietracaprina, Geppino Pucci
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Diversity maximization is a fundamental problem in web search and data
mining. For a given dataset $S$ of $n$ elements, the problem requires to
determine a subset of $S$ containing $k\ll n$ "representatives" which minimize
some diversity function expressed in terms of pairwise distances, where
distance models dissimilarity. An important variant of the problem prescribes
that the solution satisfy an additional orthogonal requirement, which can be
specified as a matroid constraint (i.e., a feasible solution must be an
independent set of size $k$ of a given matroid). While unconstrained diversity
maximization admits efficient coreset-based strategies for several diversity
functions, known approaches dealing with the additional matroid constraint
apply only to one diversity function (sum of distances), and are based on an
expensive, inherently sequential, local search over the entire input dataset.
We devise the first coreset-based algorithms for diversity maximization under
matroid constraints for various diversity functions, together with efficient
sequential, MapReduce and Streaming implementations. Technically, our
algorithms rely on the construction of a small coreset, that is, a subset of
$S$ containing a feasible solution which is no more than a factor $1-\epsilon$
away from the optimal solution for $S$. While our algorithms are fully general,
for the partition and transversal matroids, if $\epsilon$ is a constant in
$(0,1)$ and $S$ has bounded doubling dimension, the coreset size is independent
of $n$ and it is small enough to afford the execution of a slow sequential
algorithm to extract a final, accurate, solution in reasonable time. Extensive
experiments show that our algorithms are accurate, fast and scalable, and
therefore they are capable of dealing with the large input instances typical of
the big data scenario.

Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 14 pages, 14 figures. The paper is going to be submitted to IEEE TPDS
\\
  Linear algebra operations have been widely used in big data analytics and
scientific computations. Many works have been done on optimizing linear algebra
operations on GPUs with regular-shaped input. However, few works are focusing
on fully utilizing GPU resources when the input is not regular-shaped. Current
optimizations lack of considering fully utilizing the memory bandwidth and
computing power, therefore they could only achieve sub-optimal performance. In
this paper, we propose two efficient irregular-shaped matrix-matrix
multiplication (GEMM) algorithms on GPUs, called TSM2 and ISM2. Both of them
focus on optimizing GEMMs with various input sizes where at least one of the
matrices is tall-and-skinny. We implement our proposed algorithms and test on
several modern Nvidia GPU micro-architectures. Experiments show that compared
to state of the art, our TSM2 speeds up the computation by 1.1x~3x and improves
the memory bandwidth utilization and computing power utilization by 8%~47.6%
and 7%~37.3%, respectively, when the size of regular matrix is relatively large
or medium. Moreover, our ISM2 speeds up the GEMM by 1.1x~3.5x and improve the
memory bandwidth utilization by up to 55% when the size of regular matrix is
relatively small.

Title: A Distributed Path Query Engine for Temporal Property Graphs

Comments: To appear in the Proceedings of the 20th IEEE/ACM International
  Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid), Melbourne,
  Australia, May, 2020
\\
  Property graphs are a common form of linked data, with path queries used to
traverse and explore them for enterprise transactions and mining. Temporal
property graphs are a recent variant where time is a first-class entity to be
queried over, and properties and structure varying over time. These are seen in
social, telecom and transit networks. However, current graph databases and
query engines have limited support for temporal relations among graph entities,
no support for time-varying entities and/or do not scale on distributed
resources. We address this gap by extending a linear path query model over
property graphs to include intuitive temporal predicates that operate over
temporal graphs. We design a distributed execution model for these temporal
path queries using the interval-centric computing model, and develop a novel
cost model to select an efficient execution plan from several. We perform
detailed experiments of our Granite distributed query engine using temporal
property graphs as large as 52M vertices, 218M edges, and 118M properties, and
a 800-query workload, derived from the LDBC benchmark. We offer sub-second
query latencies in most cases, which is 154x-1786x faster compared to
industry-leading Neo4J shared-memory graph database and the JanusGraph/Spark
distributed graph query engine. Further, our cost model selects a query plan
that is within 10% of the optimal execution time in 90% of the cases. We also
scale well, and complete 100% of the query workload for all graphs, as opposed
to only 32-90% completion by the baseline systems.

Categories: cs.DC
\\
  We investigate computational issues in the distributed model Amoebots of
programmable matter. In this model, the computational entities, called
particles, are anonymous finite-state machines that operate and move on an
hexagonal tasselation of the plane. In this paper we show how a constant number
of such weak particles can simulate a powerful Turing-complete entity that is
able to move on the plane while computing. We then show an application of our
tool to the classical Shape-Formation problem, providing a new and much more
general distributed solution protocol. Indeed, the existing algorithms would
allow to form only shapes made of arrangements of segments and triangles. Our
algorithm allows the particles to form more abstract and general connected
shapes, including circles and spirals, as well as fractal objects of
non-integer dimension, such as the Sierpinski triangle or the Koch snowflake.
In lieu of the existing limitation on the formability of a shape depending on
the symmetry of the initial configuration of the particles, our result provides
a complete characterization of the connected shapes that can be formed by an
initially simply connected set of particles. Furthermore, in the case of
non-connected shapes, we give almost-matching necessary and sufficient
conditions for their formability.

  This paper presents Istanbul BFT (IBFT), a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT)
consensus algorithm that is used for implementing state-machine replication in
the Quorum blockchain, n open source permissioned blockchain platform. IBFT
belongs to a class of BFT algorithms that assume a partially synchronous
communication model. The IBFT algorithm is deterministic, leader-based, and
optimally resilient - tolerating $f$ faulty processes out of $n$, where $n \geq
3f+1$. During periods of good communication, IBFT achieves termination in three
message delays. The communication complexity is $O(n^2)$ for normal operation
and $O(n)$ for round (or view) changes. We also introduce a variant of IBFT,
which achieves $O(n)$ communication complexity during both normal operation and
view changes at a small latency penalty compared to IBFT - from 3 to 5 message
delays.

\\
  The difficulty of deploying various deep learning (DL) models on diverse DL
hardwares has boosted the research and development of DL compilers in the
community. Several DL compilers have been proposed from both industry and
academia such as Tensorflow XLA and TVM. Similarly, the DL compilers take the
DL models described in different DL frameworks as input, and then generate
optimized codes for diverse DL hardwares as output. However, none of the
existing survey has analyzed the unique design of the DL compilers
comprehensively. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive survey of existing
DL compilers by dissecting the commonly adopted design in details, with
emphasis on the DL oriented multi-level IRs, and frontend/backend
optimizations. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive comparison among
existing DL compilers from various aspects. In addition, we present detailed
analysis of the multi-level IR design and compiler optimization techniques.
Finally, several insights are highlighted as the potential research directions
of DL compiler. This is the first survey paper focusing on the unique design of
DL compiler, which we hope can pave the road for future research towards the DL
compiler.

Title: Parallel Performance-Energy Predictive Modeling of Browsers: Case Study

  Mozilla Research is developing Servo, a parallel web browser engine, to
exploit the benefits of parallelism and concurrency in the web rendering
pipeline. Parallelization results in improved performance for pinterest.com but
not for google.com. This is because the workload of a browser is dependent on
the web page it is rendering. In many cases, the overhead of creating,
deleting, and coordinating parallel work outweighs any of its benefits. In this
paper, we model the relationship between web page primitives and a web
browser's parallel performance using supervised learning. We discover a feature
space that is representative of the parallelism available in a web page and
characterize it using seven key features. Additionally, we consider energy
usage trade-offs for different levels of performance improvements using
automated labeling algorithms. Such a model allows us to predict the degree of
parallelism available in a web page and decide whether or not to render a web
page in parallel. This modeling is critical for improving the browser's
performance and minimizing its energy usage. We evaluate our model by using
Servo's layout stage as a case study. Experiments on a quad-core Intel Ivy
Bridge (i7-3615QM) laptop show that we can improve performance and energy usage
by up to 94.52% and 46.32% respectively on the 535 web pages considered in this
study. Looking forward, we identify opportunities to apply this model to other
stages of a browser's architecture as well as other performance- and
energy-critical devices.

Title: Learning@home: Crowdsourced Training of Large Neural Networks using
  Decentralized Mixture-of-Experts

\\
  Many recent breakthroughs in deep learning were achieved by training
increasingly larger models on massive datasets. However, training such models
can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, Megatron Language Model with 8.3B
parameters was trained on a GPU cluster worth \$25 million. As a result, most
researchers cannot afford to train state of the art models and contribute to
their development. Hypothetically, a researcher could crowdsource the training
of large neural networks with thousands of regular PCs provided by volunteers.
The raw computing power of ten thousand \$2500 desktops dwarfs that of a \$25M
server pod, but one cannot utilize that power efficiently with conventional
distributed training methods. In this work, we propose Learning@home: a neural
network training paradigm designed to handle millions of poorly connected
participants. We analyze the performance, reliability, and architectural
constraints of this paradigm and compare it against existing distributed
training techniques.

Title: Multilevel Acyclic Hypergraph Partitioning
Authors: Merten Popp, Sebastian Schlag, Christian Schulz, Daniel Seemaier
Categories: cs.DS cs.DC cs.NE
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1710.01968
\\
  A directed acyclic hypergraph is a generalized concept of a directed acyclic
graph, where each hyperedge can contain an arbitrary number of tails and heads.
Directed hypergraphs can be used to model data flow and execution dependencies
in streaming applications. Thus, hypergraph partitioning algorithms can be used
to obtain efficient parallelizations for multiprocessor architectures. However,
an acyclicity constraint on the partition is necessary when mapping streaming
applications to embedded multiprocessors due to resource restrictions on this
type of hardware. The acyclic hypergraph partitioning problem is to partition
the hypernodes of a directed acyclic hypergraph into a given number of blocks
of roughly equal size such that the corresponding quotient graph is acyclic
while minimizing an objective function on the partition.
  Here, we contribute the first n-level algorithm for the acyclic hypergraph
partitioning problem. Our focus is on acyclic hypergraphs where hyperedges can
have one head and arbitrary many tails. Based on this, we engineer a memetic
algorithm to further reduce communication cost, as well as to improve
scheduling makespan on embedded multiprocessor architectures. Experiments
indicate that our algorithm outperforms previous algorithms that focus on the
directed acyclic graph case which have previously been employed in the
application domain. Moreover, our experiments indicate that using the directed
hypergraph model for this type of application yields a significantly smaller
makespan.

Title: List Decodable Subspace Recovery
Authors: Prasad Raghavendra, Morris Yau
Categories: cs.DS math.ST stat.TH
\\
  Learning from data in the presence of outliers is a fundamental problem in
statistics. In this work, we study robust statistics in the presence of
overwhelming outliers for the fundamental problem of subspace recovery. Given a
dataset where an $\alpha$ fraction (less than half) of the data is distributed
uniformly in an unknown $k$ dimensional subspace in $d$ dimensions, and with no
additional assumptions on the remaining data, the goal is to recover a succinct
list of $O(\frac{1}{\alpha})$ subspaces one of which is nontrivially correlated
with the planted subspace. We provide the first polynomial time algorithm for
the 'list decodable subspace recovery' problem, and subsume it under a more
general framework of list decoding over distributions that are "certifiably
resilient" capturing state of the art results for list decodable mean
estimation and regression.

Title: The Bloom Tree

Categories: cs.DS
\\
  The Bloom tree is a probabilistic data structure that combines the idea of
Bloom filters with that of Merkle trees. Bloom filters are used to verify the
presence, or absence of elements in a set. In the case of the Bloom tree, we
are interested to verify and transmit the presence, or absence of an element in
a secure and bandwidth efficient way to another party. Instead of sending the
whole Bloom filter to check for the presence, or absence of an element, the
Bloom tree achieves efficient verification by using a compact Merkle
multiproof.

Title: Curvature of Feasible Sets in Offline and Online Optimization
Authors: Marco Molinaro
Categories: cs.DS math.OC
\\
  It is known that the curvature of the feasible set in convex optimization
allows for algorithms with better convergence rates, and there has been renewed
interest in this topic both for offline as well as online problems.
  In this paper, leveraging results on geometry and convex analysis, we further
our understanding of the role of curvature in optimization:
  - We first show the equivalence of two notions of curvature, namely strong
convexity and gauge bodies, proving a conjecture of Abernethy et al. As a
consequence, this show that the Frank-Wolfe-type method of Wang and Abernethy
has accelerated convergence rate $O(\frac{1}{t^2})$ over strongly convex
feasible sets without additional assumptions on the (convex) objective
function.
  - In Online Linear Optimization, we show that the logarithmic regret
guarantee of the algorithm Follow the Leader (FTL) over strongly convex sets
recently proved by Huang et al. follows directly from a partial lipschitzness
of the support function of such sets. We believe that this provides a simpler
explanation for the good performance of FTL in this context.
  - We provide an efficient procedure for approximating convex bodies by curved
ones, smoothly trading off approximation error and curvature, allowing one to
extend the applicability of algorithms for curved set to non-curved ones.

  In this paper, we propose a novel framework that converts streaming
algorithms for monotone submodular maximization into streaming algorithms for
non-monotone submodular maximization. This reduction readily leads to the
currently tightest deterministic approximation ratio for submodular
maximization subject to a $k$-matchoid constraint. Moreover, we propose the
first streaming algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to
$k$-extendible and $k$-set system constraints. Together with our proposed
reduction, we obtain $O(k\log k)$ and $O(k^2\log k)$ approximation ratio for
submodular maximization subject to the above constraints, respectively. We
extensively evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm against the
existing work in a series of experiments including finding the maximum
independent set in randomly generated graphs, maximizing linear functions over
social networks, movie recommendation, Yelp location summarization, and Twitter
data summarization.

Title: Monotone probability distributions over the Boolean cube can be learned
  with sublinear samples
Authors: Ronitt Rubinfeld, Arsen Vasilyan
Categories: cs.DS
DOI: 10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2020.28
\\
  A probability distribution over the Boolean cube is monotone if flipping the
value of a coordinate from zero to one can only increase the probability of an
element. Given samples of an unknown monotone distribution over the Boolean
cube, we give (to our knowledge) the first algorithm that learns an
approximation of the distribution in statistical distance using a number of
samples that is sublinear in the domain.
  To do this, we develop a structural lemma describing monotone probability
distributions. The structural lemma has further implications to the sample
complexity of basic testing tasks for analyzing monotone probability
distributions over the Boolean cube: We use it to give nontrivial upper bounds
on the tasks of estimating the distance of a monotone distribution to uniform
and of estimating the support size of a monotone distribution. In the setting
of monotone probability distributions over the Boolean cube, our algorithms are
the first to have sample complexity lower than known lower bounds for the same
testing tasks on arbitrary (not necessarily monotone) probability
distributions.
  One further consequence of our learning algorithm is an improved sample
complexity for the task of testing whether a distribution on the Boolean cube
is monotone.

Title: Approximating Text-to-Pattern Distance via Dimensionality Reduction
Authors: Przemys{\l}aw Uzna\'nski
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Text-to-pattern distance is a fundamental problem in string matching, where
given a pattern of length $m$ and a text of length $n$, over integer alphabet,
we are asked to compute the distance between pattern and text at every
location. The distance function can be e.g. Hamming distance or $\ell_p$
distance for some parameter $p > 0$. Almost all state-of-the-art exact and
approximate algorithms developed in the past $\sim 40$ years were using FFT as
a black-box. In this work we present $\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ time
algorithms for $(1\pm\varepsilon)$-approximation of $\ell_2$ distances, and
$\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^3)$ algorithm for approximation of Hamming and
$\ell_1$ distances, all without use of FFT. This is independent to the very
recent development by Chan et al. [STOC 2020], where $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$
algorithm for Hamming distances not using FFT was presented -- although their
algorithm is much more "combinatorial", our techniques apply to other norms
than Hamming.

Title: Fair Correlation Clustering
Authors: Saba Ahmadi, Sainyam Galhotra, Barna Saha, Roy Schwartz
Categories: cs.DS cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper we study the problem of correlation clustering under fairness
constraints. In the classic correlation clustering problem, we are given a
complete graph where each edge is labeled positive or negative. The goal is to
obtain a clustering of the vertices that minimizes disagreements -- the number
of negative edges trapped inside a cluster plus positive edges between
different clusters.
  We consider two variations of fairness constraint for the problem of
correlation clustering where each node has a color, and the goal is to form
clusters that do not over-represent vertices of any color.
  The first variant aims to generate clusters with minimum disagreements, where
the distribution of a feature (e.g. gender) in each cluster is same as the
global distribution. For the case of two colors when the desired ratio of the
number of colors in each cluster is $1:p$, we get
$\mathcal{O}(p^2)$-approximation algorithm. Our algorithm could be extended to
the case of multiple colors. We prove this problem is NP-hard.
  The second variant considers relative upper and lower bounds on the number of
nodes of any color in a cluster. The goal is to avoid violating upper and lower
bounds corresponding to each color in each cluster while minimizing the total
number of disagreements. Along with our theoretical results, we show the
effectiveness of our algorithm to generate fair clusters by empirical
evaluation on real world data sets.

Title: Approximation Algorithms for Steiner Tree Based on Star Contractions: A
  Unified View
Authors: Radek Hu\v{s}ek, Du\v{s}an Knop, Tom\'a\v{s} Masa\v{r}\'ik
Categories: cs.DS

ACM-class: F.2.0
\\
  In the Steiner Tree problem we are given an edge weighted undirected graph $G
= (V,E)$ and a set of terminals $R \subseteq V$. The task is to find a
connected subgraph of $G$ containing $R$ and minimizing the sum of weights of
its edges. We observe that many approximation algorithms for Steiner Tree
follow a similar scheme (meta-algorithm) and perform (exhaustively) a similar
routine which we call star contraction. Here, by a star contraction, we mean
finding a star-like subgraph in the input graph minimizing the ratio of its
weight to the number of contained terminals minus one. It is not hard to see
that the well-known MST-approximation seeks the best star to contract among
those containing two terminals only. We perform an empirical study of star
contractions with the relaxed condition on the number of terminals in each star
contraction. Our experiments suggest the following: -- if the algorithm
performs star contractions exhaustively, the quality of the solution is usually
slightly better than Zelikovsky's 11/6-approximation algorithm, -- on average
the quality of the solution returned by the MST-approximation algorithm
improves with every star contraction, -- the same holds for iterated MST
(MST+), which outperforms MST in every measurement while keeping very fast
running time (on average $\sim 3\times$ slower than MST), -- on average the
quality of the solution obtained by exhaustively performing star contraction is
about 16\% better than the initial MST-approximation, and -- we propose a more
precise way to find the so-called improved stars which yield a slightly better
solution within a comparable running time (on average $\sim 3\times$ slower).
Furthermore, we propose two improvements of Zelikovsky's 11/6-approximation
algorithm and we empirically confirm that the quality of the solution returned
by any of these is better than the one returned by the former algorithm.

Title: Edge colouring Game on Trees with maximum degree $\Delta=4$
Authors: Akshay Singh and Sanjeev Saxena
Categories: cs.DS cs.GT
\\
  Consider the following game. We are given a tree $T$ and two players (say)
Alice and Bob who alternately colour an edge of a tree (using one of $k$
colours). If all edges of the tree get coloured, then Alice wins else Bob wins.
Game chromatic index of trees of is the smallest index $k$ for which there is a
winning strategy for Alice. If the maximum degree of a node in tree is
$\Delta$, Erdos et.al.[6], show that the game chromatic index is at least
$\Delta+1$. The bound is known to be tight for all values of $\Delta\neq 4$.
  In this paper we show that for $\Delta=4$, even if Bob is allowed to skip a
move, Alice can always choose an edge to colour and win the game for
$k=\Delta+1$. Thus the game chromatic index of trees of maximum degree $4$ is
also $5$. Hence, game chromatic index of trees of maximum degree $\Delta$ is
$\Delta+1$ for all $\Delta\geq 2$.
  Moreover,the tree can be preprocessed to allow Alice to pick the next edge to
colour in $O(1)$ time.
  A result of independent interest is a linear time algorithm for on-line
edge-deletion problem on trees.

  Given a string $s$ of length $n$ over a general alphabet and an integer $k$,
the problem is to decide whether $s$ is a concatenation of $k$ nonempty

$O(kn)$ and $O(n\log n)$ respectively. Here we settle the complexity of this

algorithm. The algorithm simultaneously finds the minimum odd number of factors
and the minimum even number of factors in a factorization of a string into
nonempty palindromes. We also demonstrate how to get an explicit factorization
of $s$ into $k$ palindromes with an $O(n)$-time offline postprocessing.

Title: The Investigation of Negative Capacitance Vertical Nanowire FETs Based

Categories: cs.ET
\\
  In this study, a SPICE model for negative capacitance vertical nanowire
field-effect-transistor (NC VNW-FET) based on BSIM-CMG model and
Landau-Khalatnikov (LK) equation was presented. Suffering from the limitation
of short gate length there is lack of controllable and integrative structures
for high performance NC VNW-FETs. A new kind of structure was proposed for NC
VNW-FETs at sub-3nm node. Moreover, in order to understand and improve NC
VNW-FETs, the S-shaped polarization-voltage curve (S-curve) was divided into
four regions and some new design rules were proposed. By using the SPICE model,
device-circuit co-optimization was implemented. The co-design of gate work
function (WF) and NC was investigated. A ring oscillator was simulated to
analyze the circuit energy-delay, and it shown that significant energy
reduction, up to 88%, at iso-delay for NC VNW-FETs at low supply voltage can be
achieved. This study gives a credible method to analysis the performance of NC
based devices and circuits and reveals the potential of NC VNW-FETs in
low-power applications.

\\
  We study alternating automata with qualitative semantics over infinite binary
trees: alternation means that two opposing players construct a decoration of
the input tree called a run, and the qualitative semantics says that a run of
the automaton is accepting if almost all branches of the run are accepting. In
this paper we prove a positive and a negative result for the emptiness problem
of alternating automata with qualitative semantics.
  The positive result is the decidability of the emptiness problem for the case
of B\"uchi acceptance condition. An interesting aspect of our approach is that
we do not extend the classical solution for solving the emptiness problem of
alternating automata, which first constructs an equivalent non-deterministic
automaton. Instead, we directly construct an emptiness game making use of
imperfect information.
  The negative result is the undecidability of the emptiness problem for the
case of co-B\"uchi acceptance condition. This result has two direct
consequences: the undecidability of monadic second-order logic extended with
the qualitative path-measure quantifier, and the undecidability of the
emptiness problem for alternating tree automata with non-zero semantics, a
recently introduced probabilistic model of alternating tree automata.

  The process of rendering high dynamic range (HDR) images to be viewed on
conventional displays is called tone mapping. However, tone mapping introduces
distortions in the final image which may lead to visual displeasure. To
quantify these distortions, we introduce a novel no-reference quality
assessment technique for these tone mapped images. This technique is composed
of two stages. In the first stage, we employ a convolutional neural network
(CNN) to generate quality aware maps (also known as distortion maps) from tone
mapped images by training it with the ground truth distortion maps. In the
second stage, we model the normalized image and distortion maps using an
Asymmetric Generalized Gaussian Distribution (AGGD). The parameters of the AGGD
model are then used to estimate the quality score using support vector
regression (SVR). We show that the proposed technique delivers competitive
performance relative to the state-of-the-art techniques. The novelty of this
work is its ability to visualize various distortions as quality maps
(distortion maps), especially in the no-reference setting, and to use these
maps as features to estimate the quality score of tone mapped images.

Title: Correction of Chromatic Aberration from a Single Image Using Keypoints

\\
  In this paper, we propose a method to correct for chromatic aberration in a
single photograph. Our method replicates what a user would do in a photo
editing program to account for this defect. We find matching keypoints in each
colour channel then align them as a user would.

Title: SplitStreams: A Visual Metaphor for Evolving Hierarchies
Authors: Fabian Bolte, Mahsan Nourani, Eric D. Ragan and Stefan Bruckner
Categories: cs.GR
Comments: Will be published at IEEE Transactions on Visualization & Computer
  Graphics 2020
\\
  The visualization of hierarchically structured data over time is an ongoing
challenge and several approaches exist trying to solve it. Techniques such as
animated or juxtaposed tree visualizations are not capable of providing a good
overview of the time series and lack expressiveness in conveying changes over
time. Nested streamgraphs provide a better understanding of the data evolution,
but lack the clear outline of hierarchical structures at a given timestep.
Furthermore, these approaches are often limited to static hierarchies or
exclude complex hierarchical changes in the data, limiting their use cases. We
propose a novel visual metaphor capable of providing a static overview of all
hierarchical changes over time, as well as clearly outlining the hierarchical
structure at each individual time step. Our method allows for smooth
transitions between tree maps and nested streamgraphs, enabling the exploration
of the trade-off between dynamic behavior and hierarchical structure. As our
technique handles topological changes of all types, it is suitable for a wide
range of applications. We demonstrate the utility of our method on several use
cases, evaluate it with a user study, and provide its full source code.

Title: A polynomial algorithm for maxmin and minmax envy-free rent division on
  a soft budget
Authors: Rodrigo A. Velez
Categories: cs.GT econ.TH
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1902.02935
\\
  The current practice of envy-free rent division, lead by the fair allocation
website Spliddit, is based on quasi-linear preferences. These preferences rule
out agents' well documented financial constraints. To resolve this issue we
consider piece-wise linear budget constrained preferences. These preferences
admit differences in agents' marginal disutility of paying rent below and above
a given reference, i.e., a soft budget. We construct a polynomial algorithm to
calculate a maxmin utility envy-free allocation, and other related solutions,
in this domain.

Title: Shipper Cooperation in Stochastic Drone Delivery: A Dynamic Bayesian

\\
  With the recent technological innovation, unmanned aerial vehicles, known as
drones, have found numerous applications including package and parcel delivery
for shippers. Drone delivery offers benefits over conventional ground-based
vehicle delivery in terms of faster speed, lower cost, more
environment-friendly, and less manpower needed. However, most of existing
studies on drone delivery planning and scheduling focus on a single shipper and
ignore uncertainty factors. As such, in this paper, we consider a scenario that
multiple shippers can cooperate to minimize their drone delivery cost. We
propose the Bayesian Shipper Cooperation in Stochastic Drone Delivery (BCoSDD)
framework. The framework is composed of three functions, i.e., package
assignment, shipper cooperation formation and cost management. The
uncertainties of drone breakdown and misbehavior of cooperative shippers are
taken into account by using multistage stochastic programming optimization and
dynamic Bayesian coalition formation game. We conduct extensive performance
evaluation of the BCoSDD framework by using customer locations from Solomon
benchmark suite and a real Singapore logistics industry. As a result, the
framework can help the shippers plan and schedule their drone delivery
effectively.

Title: Distance-based Equilibria in Normal-Form Games
Authors: Erman Acar and Reshef Meir
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: Author's preprint
\\
  We propose a simple uncertainty modification for the agent model in
normal-form games; at any given strategy profile, the agent can access only a
set of "possible profiles" that are within a certain distance from the actual
action profile. We investigate the various instantiations in which the agent
chooses her strategy using well-known rationales e.g., considering the worst
case, or trying to minimize the regret, to cope with such uncertainty. Any such
modification in the behavioral model naturally induces a corresponding notion
of equilibrium; a distance-based equilibrium. We characterize the relationships
between the various equilibria, and also their connections to well-known
existing solution concepts such as Trembling-hand perfection. Furthermore, we
deliver existence results, and show that for some class of games, such solution
concepts can actually lead to better outcomes.

Title: Fairness and Efficiency in Cake-Cutting with Single-Peaked Preferences
Authors: Bhavook Bhardwaj, Rajnish Kumar, Josue Ortega
Categories: cs.GT econ.TH
\\
  We study the cake-cutting problem when agents have single-peaked preferences
over the cake. We show that a recently proposed mechanism by Wang-Wu (2019) to
obtain envy-free allocations can yield large welfare losses. Using a
simplifying assumption, we characterize all Pareto optimal allocations, which
have a simple structure: are peak-preserving and non-wasteful. Finally, we
provide simple alternative mechanisms that Pareto dominate that of Wang-Wu, and
which achieve envy-freeness or Pareto optimality.

\\
  We investigate the complexity of {\sc{Constructive Control by Adding/Deleting
Votes}} (CCAV/CCDV) for $r$-approval, Condorcet, Maximin and
Copeland$^{\alpha}$ in $k$-axes and $k$-candidates partition single-peaked
elections. In general, we prove that CCAV and CCDV for most of the voting
correspondences mentioned above are NP-hard even when~$k$ is a very small
constant. Exceptions are CCAV and CCDV for Condorcet and CCAV for $r$-approval
in $k$-axes single-peaked elections, which we show to be fixed-parameter
tractable with respect to~$k$. In addition, we give a polynomial-time algorithm
for recognizing $2$-axes elections, resolving an open problem. Our work leads
to a number of dichotomy results. To establish an NP-hardness result, we also
study a property of $3$-regular bipartite graphs which may be of independent
interest. In particular, we prove that for every $3$-regular bipartite graph,
there are two linear orders of its vertices such that the two endpoints of
every edge are consecutive in at least one of the two orders.

Title: On the effect of symmetry requirement for rendezvous on the complete
  graph
Authors: Marthe Bonamy and Micha{\l} Pilipczuk and Jean-S\'ebastien Sereni
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: 13 pages
MSC-class: 90B40 (Primary) 91A12 (Secondary)
\\
  We consider a classic rendezvous game where two players try to meet each
other on a set of $n$ locations. In each round, every player visits one of the
locations and the game finishes when the players meet at the same location. The
goal is to devise strategies for both players that minimize the expected
waiting time till the rendezvous.
  In the asymmetric case, when the strategies of the players may differ, it is
known that the optimum expected waiting time of $\frac{n+1}{2}$ is achieved by
the wait-for-mommy pair of strategies, where one of the players stays at one
location for $n$ rounds, while the other player searches through all the $n$
locations in a random order. However, if we insist that the players are
symmetric --- they are expected to follow the same strategy --- then the best
known strategy, proposed by Anderson and Weber, achieves an asymptotic expected
waiting time of $0.829 n$.
  We show that the symmetry requirement indeed implies that the expected
waiting time needs to be asymptotically larger than in the asymmetric case.
Precisely, we prove that for every $n\geqslant 2$, if the players need to
employ the same strategy, then the expected waiting time is at least
$\frac{n+1}{2}+\varepsilon n$, where $\varepsilon=2^{-36}$.

Title: Above Surface Interaction for Multiscale Navigation in Mobile Virtual
  Reality
Authors: Tim Mezner and Travis Gesslein and Alexander Otte and Jens Grubert
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: Accepted for IEEE VR 2020
\\
  Virtual Reality enables the exploration of large information spaces. In
physically constrained spaces such as airplanes or buses, controller-based or
mid-air interaction in mobile Virtual Reality can be challenging. Instead, the
input space on and above touch-screen enabled devices such as smartphones or
tablets could be employed for Virtual Reality interaction in those spaces.
  In this context, we compared an above surface interaction technique with
traditional 2D on-surface input for navigating large planar information spaces
such as maps in a controlled user study (n = 20). We find that our proposed
above surface interaction technique results in significantly better performance
and user preference compared to pinch-to-zoom and drag-to-pan when navigating
planar information spaces.

Title: Lessons Learned Developing and Extending a Visual Analytics Solution for
  Investigative Analysis of Scamming Activities
Authors: Ronak Tanna, Shivam Dhar, Ashwin Sudhir, Shreyash Devan, Shubham Verma
Categories: cs.HC cs.CR
\\
  Cybersecurity analysts work on large communication data sets to perform
investigative analysis by painstakingly going over thousands of email
conversations to find potential scamming activities and the network of cyber
scammers. Traditionally,experts used email clients, database systems and text
editors to perform this investigation. With the advent of technology,elaborate
tools that summarize data more efficiently by using cutting edge data
visualization techniques have come out. Beagle[1] is one such tool which
visualizes the large communication data using different panels such that the
inspector has better chances of finding the scam network. This paper is a
report on our work to implement and improve the work done by Jay Koven et al.
[1]. We have proposed and demonstrated via implementation, a few more
visualizations that we feel would help in grouping and analyzing the e-mail
data more efficiently. Lastly, we have also presented a case study that shows
the potential use of our tool in a real-world scenario.

Title: Assistive robots for the social management of health: a framework for
  robot design and human-robot interaction research
Authors: Meia Chita-Tegmark and Matthias Scheutz
Categories: cs.HC cs.CY cs.RO
Comments: 21 pages, 2 figs
\\
  There is a close connection between health and the quality of one's social
life. Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often
health conditions can detrimentally affect a person's ability to interact with
others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health.
For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of
healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people
with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in
social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below.
We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform,
motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have.
In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform:
a) changing how the person is perceived, b) enhancing the social behavior of
the person, c) modifying the social behavior of others, d) providing structure
for interactions, and e) changing how the person feels. We thematically
organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human
interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the
findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions
identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in
designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities
for future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.

Categories: cs.HC cs.LG
Comments: 14 pages, 13 figures
\\
  One major cause of performance degradation in predictive models is that the
test samples are not well covered by the training data. Such not
well-represented samples are called OoD samples. In this paper, we propose
OoDAnalyzer, a visual analysis approach for interactively identifying OoD
samples and explaining them in context. Our approach integrates an ensemble OoD
detection method and a grid-based visualization. The detection method is
improved from deep ensembles by combining more features with algorithms in the
same family. To better analyze and understand the OoD samples in context, we
have developed a novel kNN-based grid layout algorithm motivated by Hall's
theorem. The algorithm approximates the optimal layout and has $O(kN^2)$ time
complexity, faster than the grid layout algorithm with overall best performance
but $O(N^3)$ time complexity. Quantitative evaluation and case studies were
performed on several datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness
of OoDAnalyzer.

  Cooperative Work and Social Computing. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 2436-2447
DOI: 10.1145/2998181.2998331
\\
  Learning to see through data is central to contemporary forms of algorithmic
knowledge production. While often represented as a mechanical application of
rules, making algorithms work with data requires a great deal of situated work.
This paper examines how the often-divergent demands of mechanization and
discretion manifest in data analytic learning environments. Drawing on research
in CSCW and the social sciences, and ethnographic fieldwork in two data
learning environments, we show how an algorithm's application is seen sometimes
as a mechanical sequence of rules and at other times as an array of situated
decisions. Casting data analytics as a rule-based (rather than rule-bound)
practice, we show that effective data vision requires would-be analysts to
straddle the competing demands of formal abstraction and empirical contingency.
We conclude by discussing how the notion of data vision can help better
leverage the role of human work in data analytic learning, research, and
practice.

Title: Different Types of Voice User Interface Failures May Cause Different
  Degrees of Frustration
Authors: Shiyoh Goetsu and Tetsuya Sakai
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 5 pages;1 figure
\\
  We report on an investigation into how different types of failures in a voice
user interface (VUI) affects user frustration. To this end, we conducted a
pilot user study ($n=10$) and a main user study ($n=30$), both with a simple
voice-operated calendar application that we built using the Alexa Skills Kit.
In our pilot study, we identified three major failure types as perceived by the
users, namely, Reason Unknown, Speech Misrecognition, and Utterance Pattern
Match Failure, along with more fine-grained failure types from the developer's
viewpoint such as Intent Pattern Match Failure and Intent Misclassification.
Then, in our main study, we set up three user tasks that were designed to each
induce a specific failure type, and collected user frustration ratings for each
task. Our main findings are:
  (a)Users may be relatively tolerant to user-perceived Speech Misrecognition,
and not so to user-perceived Reason Unknown and Utterance Mattern Match
Failures;
  (b)Regarding the relationship between developer-perceived and user-perceived
failure types, 68.8\% of developer-perceived Intent Misclassification instances
caused user-perceived Reason Unkown failures.
  From (a) and (b), a practical design implication would be to try to prevent
Intent Misclassification from happening by carefully crafting the utterance
patterns for each intent.

\\
  Most scientists are aware that, in addition to the traditional and
subscription-based publication model, there is also the possibility of
publishing their research in open access. Various surveys show that scientists
are in favour of this new model. Nevertheless, the transition to open access
has been very slow so far. In order to accelerate this process, we are looking
for new opportunities to create incentives for researchers to deal with the
topic of open access. In a field study with 28 participants the effects of the
game design elements badge and progress bar on the motivation when working on
an online quiz on the topic of open access are examined. In our study both game
design elements provide a statistically significant increase in the number of
questions answered compared to a control group. This suggests that gamification

Title: Beyond Trolling: Malware-Induced Misperception Attacks on Polarized
  Facebook Discourse
Authors: Filipo Sharevski, Paige Treebridge, Peter Jachim, Audrey Li, Adam
  Babin, Jessica Westbrook
Categories: cs.HC cs.CR cs.CY
\\
  Social media trolling is a powerful tactic to manipulate public opinion on
issues with a high moral component. Troll farms, as evidenced in the past,
created fabricated content to provoke or silence people to share their opinion
on social media during the US presidential election in 2016. In this paper, we
introduce an alternate way of provoking or silencing social media discourse by
manipulating how users perceive authentic content. This manipulation is
performed by man-in-the-middle malware that covertly rearranges the linguistic
content of an authentic social media post and comments. We call this attack
Malware-Induced Misperception (MIM) because the goal is to socially engineer
spiral-of-silence conditions on social media by inducing perception. We
conducted experimental tests in controlled settings (N = 311) where a malware
covertly altered selected words in a Facebook post about the freedom of
political expression on college campuses. The empirical results (1) confirm the
previous findings about the presence of the spiral-of-silence effect on social
media; and (2) demonstrate that inducing misperception is an effective tactic
to silence or provoke targeted users on Facebook to express their opinion on a
polarizing political issue.

Title: Massive Unsourced Random Access Based on Uncoupled Compressive Sensing:
  Another Blessing of Massive MIMO
Authors: Volodymyr Shyianov, Faouzi Bellili, Amine Mezghani, Ekram Hossain
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  We put forward a new algorithmic solution to the massive unsourced random
access (URA) problem, by leveraging the rich spatial dimensionality offered by
large-scale antenna arrays. This paper makes an observation that spatial
signature is key to URA in massive connectivity setups. The proposed scheme
relies on a slotted transmission framework but eliminates completely the need
for concatenated coding that was introduced in the context of the coupled
compressive sensing (CCS) paradigm. Indeed, all existing works on CCS-based URA
rely on an inner/outer tree-based encoder/decoder to stitch the slot-wise
recovered sequences. This paper takes a different path by harnessing the
nature-provided correlations between the slot-wise reconstructed channels of
each user in order to put together its decoded sequences. The required
slot-wise channel estimates and decoded sequences are first obtained through
the powerful hybrid generalized approximate message passing (HyGAMP) algorithm
which systematically accommodates the multiantenna-induced group sparsity.
Then, a channel correlation-aware clustering framework based on the
expectation-maximization (EM) concept is used together with the Hungarian
algorithm to find the slot-wise optimal assignment matrices by enforcing two
clustering constraints that are very specific to the problem at hand. Stitching
is then readily accomplished by associating the decoded sequences to their
respective users according to the ensuing assignment matrices. Exhaustive
computer simulations reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms by far the
only known work from the open literature. More precisely, it will be seen that
our scheme can accommodate a very large number of active users with much higher
total spectral efficiency while using a remarkably smaller number of receive
antennas and achieving a low decoding error probability.

Comments: 15 pages in double columns, 8 figures, accepted for publication on
  IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications
\\
  This paper studies physical-layer secure transmissions from a transmitter to
a legitimate receiver against an eavesdropper over slow fading channels, taking
into account the impact of finite blocklength secrecy coding. A comprehensive
analysis and optimization framework is established to investigate secrecy
throughput for both single- and multi-antenna transmitter scenarios. Both
adaptive and non-adaptive design schemes are devised, in which the secrecy
throughput is maximized by exploiting the instantaneous and statistical channel
state information of the legitimate receiver, respectively. Specifically,
optimal transmission policy, blocklength, and code rates are jointly designed
to maximize the secrecy throughput. Additionally, null-space artificial noise
is employed to improve the secrecy throughput for the multi-antenna setup with
the optimal power allocation derived.Various important insights are developed.
In particular, 1) increasing blocklength benefits both reliability and secrecy
under the proposed transmission policy; 2) secrecy throughput monotonically
increases with blocklength; 3) secrecy throughput initially increases but then
decreases as secrecy rate increases, and the optimal secrecy rate maximizing
the secrecy throughput should be carefully chosen in order to strike a good
balance between rate and decoding correctness. Numerical results are eventually
presented to verify theoretical findings.

Title: Achievable Rate of Multi-Antenna WSRNs with EH Constraint in the
  presence of a Jammer
Authors: Minhan Tian, Guiguo Feng, Wangmei Guo, Jingliang Gao, Yongkang Li
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, the rate-energy region is studied for the wireless sensor
relay network (WSRN) with energy harvesting in the presence of a jammer. In the
model, a source communicates to a destination equipped with a single antenna
with energy harvesting constraint through a multi-antenna cooperative relay
under beamforming. Meanwhile, there is a jammer intended to disturb the
communication. The relay works in half-duplex mode and knows all the channel
state information (CSI). When beamforming is employed at the relay, the network
can be modeled as an equivalent Gaussian arbitrarily varying channel (GAVC). We
characterize the achievable rate-energy region. Since the problem is

Title: Robust URLLC Packet Scheduling of OFDM Systems
Authors: Jing Cheng, Chao Shen, Shuqiang Xia
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we consider the power minimization problem of joint physical
resource block (PRB) assignment and transmit power allocation under specified
delay and reliability requirements for ultra-reliable and low-latency
communication (URLLC) in downlink cellular orthogonal frequency-division
multiple-access (OFDMA) system. To be more practical, only the imperfect
channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be available at the base station
(BS). The formulated problem is a combinatorial and mixed-integer nonconvex
problem and is difficult to tackle. Through techniques of slack variables
introduction, the first-order Taylor approximation and reweighted
$\ell_1$-norm, we approximate it by a convex problem and the successive convex
approximation (SCA) based iterative algorithm is proposed to yield sub-optimal
solutions. Numerical results provide some insights into the impact of channel
estimation error, user number, the allowable maximum delay and packet error
probability on the required system sum power.

Title: Holographic Image Sensing

Categories: cs.IT cs.CV eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Holographic representations of data enable distributed storage with
progressive refinement when the stored packets of data are made available in
any arbitrary order. In this paper, we propose and test patch-based transform
coding holographic sensing of image data. Our proposal is optimized for
progressive recovery under random order of retrieval of the stored data. The
coding of the image patches relies on the design of distributed projections
ensuring best image recovery, in terms of the $\ell_2$ norm, at each retrieval
stage. The performance depends only on the number of data packets that has been
retrieved thus far.
  Several possible options to enhance the quality of the recovery while
changing the size and number of data packets are discussed and tested. This
leads us to examine several interesting bit-allocation and rate-distortion
trade offs, highlighted for a set of natural images with ensemble estimated
statistical properties.

Title: Reed-Muller Codes: Theory and Algorithms
Authors: Emmanuel Abbe and Amir Shpilka and Min Ye
Categories: cs.IT cs.DM math.IT
\\
  Reed-Muller (RM) codes are among the oldest, simplest and perhaps most
ubiquitous family of codes. They are used in many areas of coding theory in
both electrical engineering and computer science. Yet, many of their important
properties are still under investigation. This paper covers some of the recent
developments regarding the weight enumerator and the capacity-achieving
properties of RM codes, as well as some of the algorithmic developments. In
particular, the paper discusses the recent connections established between RM
codes, thresholds of Boolean functions, polarization theory,
hypercontractivity, and the techniques of approximating low weight codewords
using lower degree polynomials. It then overviews some of the algorithms with
performance guarantees, as well as some of the algorithms with state-of-the-art
performances in practical regimes. Finally, the paper concludes with a few open
problems.

Title: Performance Analysis of SWIPT Relaying Systems in the Presence of
  Impulsive Noise
Authors: Lina Mohjazi, Sami Muhaidat, Mehrdad Dianati, Mahmoud Al-Qutayri and
  Naofal Al-Dhahir
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  We develop an analytical framework to characterize the effect of impulsive
noise on the performance of relay-assisted simultaneous wireless information
and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. We derive novel closed-form expressions for
the pairwise error probability (PEP) considering two variants based on the
availability of channel state information (CSI), namely, blind relaying and
CSI-assisted relaying. We further consider two energy harvesting (EH)
techniques, i.e., instantaneous EH (IEH) and average EH (AEH). Capitalizing on
the derived analytical results, we present a detailed numerical investigation
of the diversity order for the underlying scenarios under the impulsive noise
assumption. For the case when two relays and the availability of a direct link,
it is demonstrated that the considered SWIPT system with blind AEH-relaying is
able to achieve an asymptotic diversity order of less than 3, which is equal to
the diversity order achieved by CSI-assisted IEH-relaying. This result suggests
that, by employing the blind AEH relaying, the power consumption of the network
can be reduced, due to eliminating the need of CSI estimation. This can be
achieved without any performance loss. Our results further show that placing
the relays close to the source can significantly mitigate the detrimental
effects of impulsive noise. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation results are
presented to validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical framework.

Title: A differentiable measure of pointwise shared information
Authors: Abdullah Makkeh, Aaron J. Gutknecht, Michael Wibral
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 27 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Partial information decomposition (PID) of the multivariate mutual
information describes the distinct ways in which a set of source variables
contains information about a target variable. The groundbreaking work of
Williams and Beer has shown that this decomposition can not be determined from
classic information theory without making additional assumptions, and several
candidate measures have been proposed, often drawing on principles from related
fields such as decision theory. None of these measures is differentiable with
respect to the underlying probability mass function. We here present a novel
measure that draws only on principles linking the local mutual information to
exclusion of probability mass. This principle is foundational to the original
definition of the mutual information by Fano. We reuse this principle to define
measure of shared information that is differentiable and is well-defined for
individual realizations of the random variables. We show that the measure can
be interpreted as a local mutual information with the help of an auxiliary
variable. We also show that it has a meaningful Moebius inversion on a
redundancy lattice and obeys a target chain rule. We give an operational
interpretation of the measure based on the decisions an agent should take if
given only the shared information.

Title: Communication Efficient Secret Sharing in the Presence of Malicious
  Adversary
Authors: Rawad Bitar and Sidharth Jaggi
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Extended version of a paper submitted to ISIT 2020
\\
  Consider the communication efficient secret sharing problem. A dealer wants
to share a secret with $n$ parties such that any $k\leq n$ parties can
reconstruct the secret and any $z<k$ parties eavesdropping on their shares
obtain no information about the secret. In addition, a legitimate user
contacting any $d$, $k\leq d \leq n$, parties to decode the secret can do so by
reading and downloading the minimum amount of information needed. We are
interested in communication efficient secret sharing schemes that tolerate the
presence of malicious parties actively corrupting their shares and the data
delivered to the users. The knowledge of the malicious parties about the secret
is restricted to the shares they obtain. We characterize the capacity, i.e.
maximum size of the secret that can be shared. We derive the minimum amount of
information needed to to be read and communicated to a legitimate user to
decode the secret from $d$ parties, $k\leq d \leq n$. Error-correcting codes do
not achieve capacity in this setting. We construct codes that achieve capacity
and achieve minimum read and communication costs for all possible values of
$d$. Our codes are based on Staircase codes, previously introduced for
communication efficient secret sharing, and on the use of a pairwise hashing
scheme used in distributed data storage and network coding settings to detect
errors inserted by a limited knowledge adversary.

\\
  Massive access, also known as massive connectivity or massive machine-type
communication (mMTC), is one of the main use cases of the fifth-generation (5G)
and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks. A typical application of massive access
is the cellular Internet of Things (IoT). Different from conventional
human-type communication, massive access aims at realizing efficient and
reliable communications for a massive number of IoT devices. Hence, the main
characteristics of massive access include low power, massive connectivity, and
broad coverage, which require new concepts, theories, and paradigms for the
design of next-generation cellular networks. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of aspects of massive access design for B5G wireless
networks. Specifically, we provide a detailed review of massive access from the
perspectives of theory, protocols, techniques, coverage, energy, and security.
Furthermore, several future research directions and challenges are identified.

Title: Straggler-resistant distributed matrix computation via coding theory
Authors: Aditya Ramamoorthy, Anindya Bijoy Das and Li Tang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: To appear in the Special Issue on Distributed, Streaming Machine
  Learning in the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 2020
\\
  The current BigData era routinely requires the processing of large scale data
on massive distributed computing clusters. Such large scale clusters often
suffer from the problem of "stragglers", which are defined as slow or failed
nodes. The overall speed of a computational job on these clusters is typically
dominated by stragglers in the absence of a sophisticated assignment of tasks
to the worker nodes. In recent years, approaches based on coding theory
(referred to as "coded computation") have been effectively used for straggler
mitigation. Coded computation offers significant benefits for specific classes
of problems such as distributed matrix computations (which play a crucial role
in several parts of the machine learning pipeline). The essential idea is to
create redundant tasks so that the desired result can be recovered as long as a
certain number of worker nodes complete their tasks. In this survey article, we
overview recent developments in the field of coding for straggler-resilient
distributed matrix computations.

Comments: To be submitted to the IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop

\\
  We present an algorithm to reduce the computational effort for the
multiplication of a given matrix with an unknown column vector. The algorithm
decomposes the given matrix into a product of matrices whose entries are either
zero or integer powers of two utilizing the principles of sparse recovery.
While classical low resolution quantization achieves an accuracy of 6 dB per
bit, our method can achieve many times more than that for large matrices.
Numerical evidence suggests that the improvement actually grows unboundedly
with matrix size. Due to sparsity, the algorithm even allows for quantization
levels below 1 bit per matrix entry while achieving highly accurate
approximations for large matrices. Applications include, but are not limited
to, neural networks, as well as fully digital beam-forming for massive MIMO and
millimeter wave applications.

Title: DropCluster: A structured dropout for convolutional networks
Authors: Liyan Chen, Philip Gautier, Sergul Aydore
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages, 10 figures, under review
\\
  Dropout as a regularizer in deep neural networks has been less effective in
convolutional layers than in fully connected layers. This is due to the fact
that dropout drops features randomly. When features are spatially correlated as
in the case of convolutional layers, information about the dropped pixels can
still propagate to the next layers via neighboring pixels. In order to address
this problem, more structured forms of dropout have been proposed. A drawback
of these methods is that they do not adapt to the data. In this work, we
introduce a novel structured regularization for convolutional layers, which we
call DropCluster. Our regularizer relies on data-driven structure. It finds
clusters of correlated features in convolutional layer outputs and drops the
clusters randomly at each iteration. The clusters are learned and updated
during model training so that they adapt both to the data and to the model
weights. Our experiments on the ResNet-50 architecture demonstrate that our
approach achieves better performance than DropBlock or other existing
structured dropout variants. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach
when the size of training data is limited and when there is corruption in the
data at test time.

Title: Improving the Adversarial Robustness of Transfer Learning via Noisy
  Feature Distillation
Authors: Ting-Wu Chin, Cha Zhang, Diana Marculescu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Fine-tuning through knowledge transfer from a pre-trained model on a
large-scale dataset is a widely spread approach to effectively build models on
small-scale datasets. However, recent literature has shown that such a
fine-tuning approach is vulnerable to adversarial examples based on the
pre-trained model, which raises security concerns for many industrial
applications. In contrast, models trained with random initialization are much
more robust to such attacks, although these models often exhibit much lower
accuracy. In this work, we propose noisy feature distillation, a new transfer
learning method that trains a network from random initialization while
achieving clean-data performance competitive with fine-tuning. In addition, the
method is shown empirically to significantly improve the robustness compared to
fine-tuning with 15x reduction in attack success rate for ResNet-50, from 66%
to 4.4% averaged across Stanford 120 Dogs, Caltech-UCSD 200 Birds, Stanford 40
Actions, MIT 67 Indoor Scenes, and Oxford 102 Flowers datasets. Code is

Comments: 8 pages, 12 figures. Under review for ICML 2020
\\
  In this work, we present a machine learning approach for reducing the error
when numerically solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDE).
We use a fully convolutional LSTM network to exploit the spatiotemporal
dynamics of PDEs. The neural network serves to enhance finite-difference and
finite-volume methods (FDM/FVM) that are commonly used to solve PDEs, allowing
us to maintain guarantees on the order of convergence of our method. We train
the network on simulation data, and show that our network can reduce error by a
factor of 2 to 3 compared to the baseline algorithms. We demonstrate our method
on three PDEs that each feature qualitatively different dynamics. We look at
the linear advection equation, which propagates its initial conditions at a
constant speed, the inviscid Burgers' equation, which develops shockwaves, and
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, which is chaotic.

Title: Safe Wasserstein Constrained Deep Q-Learning
Authors: Aaron Kandel, Scott J. Moura
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures
\\
  This paper presents a distributionally robust Q-Learning algorithm (DrQ)
which leverages Wasserstein ambiguity sets to provide probabilistic
out-of-sample safety guarantees during online learning. First, we follow past
work by separating the constraint functions from the principal objective to
create a hierarchy of machines within the constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP). DrQ works within this framework by augmenting constraint costs with
tightening offset variables obtained through Wasserstein distributionally
robust optimization (DRO). These offset variables correspond to worst-case
distributions of modeling error characterized by the TD-errors of the
constraint Q-functions. This overall procedure allows us to safely approach the
nominal constraint boundaries with strong probabilistic out-of-sample safety
guarantees. Using a case study of safe lithium-ion battery fast charging, we
demonstrate dramatic improvements in safety and performance relative to a
conventional DQN.

Title: Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing
Authors: Elan Rosenfeld, Ezra Winston, Pradeep Ravikumar, J. Zico Kolter
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Machine learning algorithms are known to be susceptible to data poisoning
attacks, where an adversary manipulates the training data to degrade
performance of the resulting classifier. While many heuristic defenses have
been proposed, few defenses exist which are certified against worst-case
corruption of the training data. In this work, we propose a strategy to build
linear classifiers that are certifiably robust against a strong variant of
label-flipping, where each test example is targeted independently. In other
words, for each test point, our classifier makes a prediction and includes a
certification that its prediction would be the same had some number of training
labels been changed adversarially. Our approach leverages randomized smoothing,
a technique that has previously been used to guarantee---with high
probability---test-time robustness to adversarial manipulation of the input to
a classifier. We derive a variant which provides a deterministic, analytical
bound, sidestepping the probabilistic certificates that traditionally result
from the sampling subprocedure. Further, we obtain these certified bounds with
no additional runtime cost over standard classification. We generalize our
results to the multi-class case, providing what we believe to be the first
multi-class classification algorithm that is certifiably robust to
label-flipping attacks.

Comments: 19 pages
\\
  Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples - small input
perturbations that result in incorrect predictions. We study this problem in
the context of models of source code, where we want the network to be robust to
source-code modifications that preserve code functionality. We define a natural
notion of robustness, $k$-transformation robustness, in which an adversary
performs up to $k$ semantics-preserving transformations to an input program. We
show how to train robust models using an adversarial training objective
inspired by that of Madry et al. (2018) for continuous domains.
  We implement an extensible framework for adversarial training over source
code, and conduct a thorough evaluation on a number of datasets and two
different architectures. Our results show (1) the increase in robustness
following adversarial training, (2) the ability of training on weak adversaries
to provide robustness to attacks by stronger adversaries, and (3) the shift in
attribution focus of adversarially trained models towards semantic vs.
syntactic features.

Title: Incorporating Symmetry into Deep Dynamics Models for Improved
  Generalization
Authors: Rui Wang, Robin Walters, Rose Yu
Categories: cs.LG math.RT stat.ML
\\
  Training machine learning models that can learn complex spatiotemporal
dynamics and generalize under distributional shift is a fundamental challenge.
The symmetries in a physical system play a unique role in characterizing
unchanged features under transformation. We propose a systematic approach to
improve generalization in spatiotemporal models by incorporating symmetries
into deep neural networks. Our general framework to design equivariant
convolutional models employs (1) convolution with equivariant kernels, (2)
conjugation by averaging operators in order to force equivariance, (3) and a
naturally equivariant generalization of convolution called group correlation.
Our framework is both theoretically and experimentally robust to distributional
shift by a symmetry group and enjoys favorable sample complexity. We
demonstrate the advantage of our approach on a variety of physical dynamics
including turbulence and diffusion systems. This is the first time that
equivariant CNNs have been used to forecast physical dynamics.

\\
  Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms combined with value function
approximation have recently achieved impressive performance in a variety of
application domains, including games and robotics. However, the theoretical
understanding of such algorithms is limited, and existing results are largely
focused on episodic or discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this
work, we present adaptive approximate policy iteration (AAPI), a learning
scheme which enjoys a O(T^{2/3}) regret bound for undiscounted, continuing
learning in uniformly ergodic MDPs. This is an improvementover the best
existing bound of O(T^{3/4}) for the average-reward case with function
approximation. Our algorithm and analysis rely on adversarialonline learning
techniques, where value functionsare treated as losses. The main technical
novelty is the use of a data-dependent adaptive learning rate coupled with a
so-called optimistic prediction of upcoming losses. In addition to
theoreticalguarantees, we demonstrate the advantages of ourapproach empirically
on several environments.

Title: Generalized Hidden Parameter MDPs Transferable Model-based RL in a
  Handful of Trials
Authors: Christian F. Perez, Felipe Petroski Such, Theofanis Karaletsos
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: paper presented at AAAI 2020 as oral presentation, 9 pages
\\
  There is broad interest in creating RL agents that can solve many (related)
tasks and adapt to new tasks and environments after initial training.
Model-based RL leverages learned surrogate models that describe dynamics and
rewards of individual tasks, such that planning in a good surrogate can lead to
good control of the true system. Rather than solving each task individually
from scratch, hierarchical models can exploit the fact that tasks are often
related by (unobserved) causal factors of variation in order to achieve
efficient generalization, as in learning how the mass of an item affects the
force required to lift it can generalize to previously unobserved masses. We
propose Generalized Hidden Parameter MDPs (GHP-MDPs) that describe a family of
MDPs where both dynamics and reward can change as a function of hidden
parameters that vary across tasks. The GHP-MDP augments model-based RL with
latent variables that capture these hidden parameters, facilitating transfer
across tasks. We also explore a variant of the model that incorporates explicit
latent structure mirroring the causal factors of variation across tasks (for
instance: agent properties, environmental factors, and goals). We
experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and sample-efficiency
on a new challenging MuJoCo task using reward and dynamics latent spaces, while
beating a previous state-of-the-art baseline with $>10\times$ less data. Using
test-time inference of the latent variables, our approach generalizes in a
single episode to novel combinations of dynamics and reward, and to novel
rewards.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Recent work has extensively shown that randomized perturbations of a neural
network can improve its robustness to adversarial attacks. The literature is,
however, lacking a detailed compare-and-contrast of the latest proposals to
understand what classes of perturbations work, when they work, and why they
work. We contribute a detailed experimental evaluation that elucidates these
questions and benchmarks perturbation defenses in a consistent way. In
particular, we show five main results: (1) all input perturbation defenses,
whether random or deterministic, are essentially equivalent in their efficacy,
(2) such defenses offer almost no robustness to adaptive attacks unless these
perturbations are observed during training, (3) a tuned sequence of noise
layers across a network provides the best empirical robustness, (4) attacks
transfer between perturbation defenses so the attackers need not know the
specific type of defense only that it involves perturbations, and (5)
adversarial examples very close to original images show an elevated sensitivity
to perturbation in a first-order analysis. Based on these insights, we
demonstrate a new robust model built on noise injection and adversarial
training that achieves state-of-the-art robustness.

Title: RL-Duet: Online Music Accompaniment Generation Using Deep Reinforcement
  Learning
Authors: Nan Jiang, Sheng Jin, Zhiyao Duan, Changshui Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.HC eess.AS
\\
  This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for online
accompaniment generation, with potential for real-time interactive
human-machine duet improvisation. Different from offline music generation and
harmonization, online music accompaniment requires the algorithm to respond to
human input and generate the machine counterpart in a sequential order. We cast
this as a reinforcement learning problem, where the generation agent learns a
policy to generate a musical note (action) based on previously generated
context (state). The key of this algorithm is the well-functioning reward
model. Instead of defining it using music composition rules, we learn this
model from monophonic and polyphonic training data. This model considers the
compatibility of the machine-generated note with both the machine-generated
context and the human-generated context. Experiments show that this algorithm
is able to respond to the human part and generate a melodic, harmonic and
diverse machine part. Subjective evaluations on preferences show that the
proposed algorithm generates music pieces of higher quality than the baseline
method.

  Neural networks have demonstrably achieved state-of-the art accuracy using
low-bitlength integer quantization, yielding both execution time and energy
benefits on existing hardware designs that support short bitlengths. However,
the question of finding the minimum bitlength for a desired accuracy remains
open. We introduce a training method for minimizing inference bitlength at any
granularity while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a regularizer
that penalizes large bitlength representations throughout the architecture and
show how it can be modified to minimize other quantifiable criteria, such as
number of operations or memory footprint. We demonstrate that our method learns
thrifty representations while maintaining accuracy. With ImageNet, the method
produces an average per layer bitlength of 4.13 and 3.76 bits on AlexNet and
ResNet18 respectively, remaining within 2.0% and 0.5% of the baseline TOP-1
accuracy.

  Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) offers a decision-theoretic solution to
the problem of reinforcement learning. However, typical model-based BRL
algorithms have focused either on ma intaining a posterior distribution on
models or value functions and combining this with approx imate dynamic
programming or tree search. This paper describes a novel backwards induction
pri nciple for performing joint Bayesian estimation of models and value
functions, from which many new BRL algorithms can be obtained. We demonstrate
this idea with algorithms and experiments in discrete state spaces.

Title: Towards a combinatorial characterization of bounded memory learning
Authors: Alon Gonen and Shachar Lovett and Michal Moshkovitz
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Combinatorial dimensions play an important role in the theory of machine
learning. For example, VC dimension characterizes PAC learning, SQ dimension
characterizes weak learning with statistical queries, and Littlestone dimension
characterizes online learning.
  In this paper we aim to develop combinatorial dimensions that characterize
bounded memory learning. We propose a candidate solution for the case of
realizable strong learning under a known distribution, based on the SQ
dimension of neighboring distributions. We prove both upper and lower bounds
for our candidate solution, that match in some regime of parameters. In this
parameter regime there is an equivalence between bounded memory and SQ
learning. We conjecture that our characterization holds in a much wider regime
of parameters.

Title: Fast Detection of Maximum Common Subgraph via Deep Q-Learning
Authors: Yunsheng Bai, Derek Xu, Alex Wang, Ken Gu, Xueqing Wu, Agustin

Categories: cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML
\\
  Detecting the Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) between two input graphs is
fundamental for applications in biomedical analysis, malware detection, cloud
computing, etc. This is especially important in the task of drug design, where
the successful extraction of common substructures in compounds can reduce the
number of experiments needed to be conducted by humans. However, MCS
computation is NP-hard, and state-of-the-art exact MCS solvers do not have
worst-case time complexity guarantee and cannot handle large graphs in
practice. Designing learning based models to find the MCS between two graphs in
an approximate yet accurate way while utilizing as few labeled MCS instances as
possible remains to be a challenging task. Here we propose RLMCS, a Graph
Neural Network based model for MCS detection through reinforcement learning.
Our model uses an exploration tree to extract subgraphs in two graphs one node
pair at a time, and is trained to optimize subgraph extraction rewards via Deep
Q-Networks. A novel graph embedding method is proposed to generate state
representations for nodes and extracted subgraphs jointly at each step.
Experiments on real graph datasets demonstrate that our model performs
favorably to exact MCS solvers and supervised neural graph matching network
models in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Title: Manifold for Machine Learning Assurance
Authors: Taejoon Byun, Sanjai Rayadurgam
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
DOI: 10.1145/3377816.3381734
\\
  The increasing use of machine-learning (ML) enabled systems in critical tasks
fuels the quest for novel verification and validation techniques yet grounded
in accepted system assurance principles. In traditional system development,
model-based techniques have been widely adopted, where the central premise is
that abstract models of the required system provide a sound basis for judging
its implementation. We posit an analogous approach for ML systems using an ML
technique that extracts from the high-dimensional training data implicitly
describing the required system, a low-dimensional underlying structure--a
manifold. It is then harnessed for a range of quality assurance tasks such as
test adequacy measurement, test input generation, and runtime monitoring of the
target ML system. The approach is built on variational autoencoder, an
unsupervised method for learning a pair of mutually near-inverse functions
between a given high-dimensional dataset and a low-dimensional representation.
Preliminary experiments establish that the proposed manifold-based approach,
for test adequacy drives diversity in test data, for test generation yields
fault-revealing yet realistic test cases, and for runtime monitoring provides
an independent means to assess trustability of the target system's output.

  There is a striking relationship between a three hundred years old Political
Science theorem named "Condorcet's jury theorem" (1785), which states that
majorities are more likely to choose correctly when individual votes are often
correct and independent, and a modern Machine Learning concept called "Strength
of Weak Learnability" (1990), which describes a method for converting a weak
learning algorithm into one that achieves arbitrarily high accuracy and stands
in the basis of Ensemble Learning. Albeit the intuitive statement of
Condorcet's theorem, we could not find a compact and simple rigorous
mathematical proof of the theorem neither in classical handbooks of Machine
Learning nor in published papers. By all means we do not claim to discover or
reinvent a theory nor a result. We humbly want to offer a more publicly
available simple derivation of the theorem. We will find joy in seeing more
teachers of introduction-to-machine-learning courses use the proof we provide
here as an exercise to explain the motivation of ensemble learning.

Title: Random Features Strengthen Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Ryoma Sato, Makoto Yamada, Hisashi Kashima
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning models for various
graph learning tasks. Recently, the limitations of the expressive power of
various GNN models have been revealed. For example, GNNs cannot distinguish
some non-isomorphic graphs and they cannot learn efficient graph algorithms,
and several GNN models have been proposed to overcome these limitations. In
this paper, we demonstrate that GNNs become powerful just by adding a random
feature to each node. We prove that the random features enable GNNs to learn
almost optimal polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the minimum
dominating set problem and maximum matching problem in terms of the
approximation ratio. The main advantage of our method is that it can be
combined with off-the-shelf GNN models with slight modifications. Through
experiments, we show that the addition of random features enables GNNs to solve
various problems that normal GNNs, including GCNs and GINs, cannot solve.

Title: On a scalable entropic breaching of the overfitting barrier in machine
  learning
Authors: Illia Horenko
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Overfitting and treatment of "small data" are among the most challenging
problems in the machine learning (ML), when a relatively small data statistics
size $T$ is not enough to provide a robust ML fit for a relatively large data
feature dimension $D$. Deploying a massively-parallel ML analysis of generic
classification problems for different $D$ and $T$, existence of
statistically-significant linear overfitting barriers for common ML methods is
demonstrated. For example, these results reveal that for a robust
classification of bioinformatics-motivated generic problems with the Long
Short-Term Memory deep learning classifier (LSTM) one needs in a best case a
statistics $T$ that is at least 13.8 times larger then the feature dimension
$D$. It is shown that this overfitting barrier can be breached at a $10^{-12}$
fraction of the computational cost by means of the entropy-optimal Scalable
Probabilistic Approximations algorithm (eSPA), performing a joint solution of
the entropy-optimal Bayesian network inference and feature space segmentation
problems. Application of eSPA to experimental single cell RNA sequencing data
exhibits a 30-fold classification performance boost when compared to standard
bioinformatics tools - and a 7-fold boost when compared to the deep learning
LSTM classifier.

Title: Statistical Optimal Transport posed as Learning Kernel Embedding
Authors: J. Saketha Nath and Pratik Jawanpuria
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This work takes the novel approach of posing the statistical Optimal
Transport (OT) problem as that of learning the transport plan's kernel mean
embedding. The key advantage is that the estimates for the embeddings of the
marginals can now be employed directly, leading to a dimension-free sample
complexity for the proposed transport plan and transport map estimators. Also,
because of the implicit smoothing in the kernel embeddings, the proposed
estimators can perform out-of-sample estimation. Interestingly, the proposed
formulation employs an MMD based regularization to avoid overfitting, which is
complementary to existing $\phi$-divergence (entropy) based regularization
techniques. An appropriate representer theorem is presented that leads to a
fully kernelized formulation and hence the same formulation can be used to
perform continuous/semi-discrete/discrete OT in any non-standard domain (as
long as universal kernels in those domains are known). Finally, an ADMM based
algorithm is presented for solving the kernelized formulation efficiently.
Empirical results show that the proposed estimator outperforms discrete OT
based estimator in terms of transport map accuracy.

  Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have been proposed as an alternative to
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper showcases how CapsNets are
more capable than CNNs for autonomous agent exploration of realistic scenarios.
In real world navigation, rewards external to agents may be rare. In turn,
reinforcement learning algorithms can struggle to form meaningful policy
functions. This paper's approach Capsules Exploration Module (Caps-EM) pairs a
CapsNets architecture with an Advantage Actor Critic algorithm. Other
approaches for navigating sparse environments require intrinsic reward
generators, such as the Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) and Augmented
Curiosity Modules (ACM). Caps-EM uses a more compact architecture without need
for intrinsic rewards. Tested using ViZDoom, the Caps-EM uses 44% and 83% fewer
trainable network parameters than the ICM and Depth-Augmented Curiosity Module
(D-ACM), respectively, for 1141% and 437% average time improvement over the ICM
and D-ACM, respectively, for converging to a policy function across "My Way
Home" scenarios.

Title: Time-aware Large Kernel Convolutions
Authors: Vasileios Lioutas, Yuhong Guo
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages, 1 figure
\\
  To date, most state-of-the-art sequence modelling architectures use attention
to build generative models for language based tasks. Some of these models use
all the available sequence tokens to generate an attention distribution which
results in time complexity of $O(n^2)$. Alternatively, they utilize depthwise
convolutions with softmax normalized kernels of size $k$ acting as a
limited-window self-attention, resulting in time complexity of $O(k{\cdot}n)$.
In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Large Kernel (TaLK) Convolutions, a
novel adaptive convolution operation that learns to predict the size of a
summation kernel instead of using the fixed-sized kernel matrix. This method
yields a time complexity of $O(n)$, effectively making the sequence encoding
process linear to the number of tokens. We evaluate the proposed method on
large-scale standard machine translation and language modelling datasets and
show that TaLK Convolutions constitute an efficient improvement over other
attention/convolution based approaches.

Journal-ref: 2020 IEEE 14th International Conference on Semantic Computing
  (ICSC)
\\
  Click-through data has proven to be a valuable resource for improving
search-ranking quality. Search engines can easily collect click data, but
biases introduced in the data can make it difficult to use the data
effectively. In order to measure the effects of biases, many click models have
been proposed in the literature. However, none of the models can explain the
observation that users with different search intent (e.g., informational,
navigational, etc.) have different click behaviors. In this paper, we study how
differences in user search intent can influence click activities and determined
that there exists a bias between user search intent and the relevance of the
document relevance. Based on this observation, we propose a search intent bias
hypothesis that can be applied to most existing click models to improve their
ability to learn unbiased relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that
after adopting the search intent hypothesis, click models can better interpret
user clicks and substantially improve retrieval performance.

Title: Exploring the Memorization-Generalization Continuum in Deep Learning
Authors: Ziheng Jiang, Chiyuan Zhang, Kunal Talwar, Michael C. Mozer
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Human learners appreciate that some facts demand memorization whereas other
facts support generalization. For example, English verbs have irregular cases
that must be memorized (e.g., go->went) and regular cases that generalize well
(e.g., kiss->kissed, miss->missed). Likewise, deep neural networks have the
capacity to memorize rare or irregular forms but nonetheless generalize across
instances that share common patterns or structures. We analyze how individual
instances are treated by a model on the memorization-generalization continuum
via a consistency score. The score is the expected accuracy of a particular
architecture for a held-out instance on a training set of a fixed size sampled
from the data distribution. We obtain empirical estimates of this score for
individual instances in multiple datasets, and we show that the score
identifies out-of-distribution and mislabeled examples at one end of the
continuum and regular examples at the other end. We explore three proxies to
the consistency score: kernel density estimation on input and hidden
representations; and the time course of training, i.e., learning speed. In
addition to helping to understand the memorization versus generalization
dynamics during training, the C-score proxies have potential application for
out-of-distribution detection, curriculum learning, and active data collection.

Title: Inference for Batched Bandits
Authors: Kelly W. Zhang, Lucas Janson, Susan A. Murphy
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  As bandit algorithms are increasingly utilized in scientific studies, there
is an associated increasing need for reliable inference methods based on the
resulting adaptively-collected data. In this work, we develop methods for
inference regarding the treatment effect on data collected in batches using a
bandit algorithm. We focus on the setting in which the total number of batches
is fixed and develop approximate inference methods based on the asymptotic
distribution as the size of the batches goes to infinity. We first prove that
the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS), which is asymptotically normal on
independently sampled data, is not asymptotically normal on data collected
using standard bandit algorithms when the treatment effect is zero. This
asymptotic non-normality result implies that the naive assumption that the OLS
estimator is approximately normal can lead to Type-1 error inflation and
confidence intervals with below-nominal coverage probabilities. Second, we
introduce the Batched OLS estimator (BOLS) that we prove is asymptotically
normal---even in the zero treatment effect case---on data collected from both
multi-arm and contextual bandits. Moreover, BOLS is robust to changes in the
baseline reward and can be used for obtaining simultaneous confidence intervals
for the treatment effect from all batches in non-stationary bandits. We
demonstrate in simulations that BOLS can be used reliably for hypothesis
testing and obtaining a confidence interval for the treatment effect, even in
small sample settings.

Title: Conservative Exploration in Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Evrard Garcelon, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Alessandro Lazaric, Matteo
  Pirotta
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  While learning in an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP), an agent should
trade off exploration to discover new information about the MDP, and
exploitation of the current knowledge to maximize the reward. Although the
agent will eventually learn a good or optimal policy, there is no guarantee on
the quality of the intermediate policies. This lack of control is undesired in
real-world applications where a minimum requirement is that the executed
policies are guaranteed to perform at least as well as an existing baseline. In
this paper, we introduce the notion of conservative exploration for average
reward and finite horizon problems. We present two optimistic algorithms that
guarantee (w.h.p.) that the conservative constraint is never violated during
learning. We derive regret bounds showing that being conservative does not
hinder the learning ability of these algorithms.

\\
  In many fields such as digital marketing, healthcare, finance, and robotics,
it is common to have a well-tested and reliable baseline policy running in
production (e.g., a recommender system). Nonetheless, the baseline policy is
often suboptimal. In this case, it is desirable to deploy online learning
algorithms (e.g., a multi-armed bandit algorithm) that interact with the system
to learn a better/optimal policy under the constraint that during the learning
process the performance is almost never worse than the performance of the
baseline itself. In this paper, we study the conservative learning problem in
the contextual linear bandit setting and introduce a novel algorithm, the
Conservative Constrained LinUCB (CLUCB2). We derive regret bounds for CLUCB2
that match existing results and empirically show that it outperforms
state-of-the-art conservative bandit algorithms in a number of synthetic and
real-world problems. Finally, we consider a more realistic constraint where the
performance is verified only at predefined checkpoints (instead of at every
step) and show how this relaxed constraint favorably impacts the regret and
empirical performance of CLUCB2.

Title: SUOD: Toward Scalable Unsupervised Outlier Detection

  (AICS)
\\
  Outlier detection is a key field of machine learning for identifying abnormal
data objects. Due to the high expense of acquiring ground truth, unsupervised
models are often chosen in practice. To compensate for the unstable nature of
unsupervised algorithms, practitioners from high-stakes fields like finance,
health, and security, prefer to build a large number of models for further
combination and analysis. However, this poses scalability challenges in
high-dimensional large datasets. In this study, we propose a three-module
acceleration framework called SUOD to expedite the training and prediction with
a large number of unsupervised detection models. SUOD's Random Projection
module can generate lower subspaces for high-dimensional datasets while
reserving their distance relationship. Balanced Parallel Scheduling module can
forecast the training and prediction cost of models with high confidence---so
the task scheduler could assign nearly equal amount of taskload among workers
for efficient parallelization. SUOD also comes with a Pseudo-supervised
Approximation module, which can approximate fitted unsupervised models by lower
time complexity supervised regressors for fast prediction on unseen data. It
may be considered as an unsupervised model knowledge distillation process.
Notably, all three modules are independent with great flexibility to "mix and
match"; a combination of modules can be chosen based on use cases. Extensive
experiments on more than 30 benchmark datasets have shown the efficacy of SUOD,
and a comprehensive future development plan is also presented.

Title: Supervised Quantile Normalization for Low-rank Matrix Approximation
Authors: Marco Cuturi, Olivier Teboul, Jonathan Niles-Weed, Jean-Philippe Vert
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Low rank matrix factorization is a fundamental building block in machine
learning, used for instance to summarize gene expression profile data or
word-document counts. To be robust to outliers and differences in scale across
features, a matrix factorization step is usually preceded by ad-hoc feature
normalization steps, such as \texttt{tf-idf} scaling or data whitening. We
propose in this work to learn these normalization operators jointly with the
factorization itself. More precisely, given a $d\times n$ matrix $X$ of $d$
features measured on $n$ individuals, we propose to learn the parameters of
quantile normalization operators that can operate row-wise on the values of $X$
and/or of its factorization $UV$ to improve the quality of the low-rank
representation of $X$ itself. This optimization is facilitated by the
introduction of a differentiable quantile normalization operator built using
optimal transport, providing new results on top of existing work by Cuturi et
al. (2019). We demonstrate the applicability of these techniques on synthetic
and genomics datasets.

Title: Hierarchical Generation of Molecular Graphs using Structural Motifs
Authors: Wengong Jin, Regina Barzilay, Tommi Jaakkola
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Graph generation techniques are increasingly being adopted for drug
discovery. Previous graph generation approaches have utilized relatively small
molecular building blocks such as atoms or simple cycles, limiting their
effectiveness to smaller molecules. Indeed, as we demonstrate, their
performance degrades significantly for larger molecules. In this paper, we
propose a new hierarchical graph encoder-decoder that employs significantly
larger and more flexible graph motifs as basic building blocks. Our encoder
produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a
fine-to-coarse fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates
the encoding of constituents below with the graph at that level. Our
autoregressive coarse-to-fine decoder adds one motif at a time, interleaving
the decision of selecting a new motif with the process of resolving its
attachments to the emerging molecule. We evaluate our model on multiple
molecule generation tasks, including polymers, and show that our model
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: Soft Threshold Weight Reparameterization for Learnable Sparsity

\\
  Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is studied extensively with the focus
of maximizing prediction accuracy given an overall budget. Existing methods
rely on uniform or heuristic non-uniform sparsity budgets which have
sub-optimal layer-wise parameter allocation resulting in a) lower prediction
accuracy or b) higher inference cost (FLOPs). This work proposes Soft Threshold
Reparameterization (STR), a novel use of the soft-threshold operator on DNN
weights. STR smoothly induces sparsity while learning pruning thresholds
thereby obtaining a non-uniform sparsity budget. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy for unstructured sparsity in CNNs (ResNet50 and
MobileNetV1 on ImageNet-1K), and, additionally, learns non-uniform budgets that
empirically reduce the FLOPs by up to 50%. Notably, STR boosts the accuracy
over existing results by up to 10% in the ultra sparse (99%) regime and can
also be used to induce low-rank (structured sparsity) in RNNs. In short, STR is
a simple mechanism which learns effective sparsity budgets that contrast with
popular heuristics.

Title: Curse of Dimensionality on Randomized Smoothing for Certifiable
  Robustness
Authors: Aounon Kumar, Alexander Levine, Tom Goldstein, Soheil Feizi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Randomized smoothing, using just a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution,
has been shown to produce good robustness guarantees against $\ell_2$-norm
bounded adversaries. In this work, we show that extending the smoothing
technique to defend against other attack models can be challenging, especially
in the high-dimensional regime. In particular, for a vast class of i.i.d.
smoothing distributions, we prove that the largest $\ell_p$-radius that can be
certified decreases as $O(1/d^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{p}})$ with dimension $d$
for $p > 2$. Notably, for $p \geq 2$, this dependence on $d$ is no better than
that of the $\ell_p$-radius that can be certified using isotropic Gaussian
smoothing, essentially putting a matching lower bound on the robustness radius.
When restricted to generalized Gaussian smoothing, these two bounds can be
shown to be within a constant factor of each other in an asymptotic sense,
establishing that Gaussian smoothing provides the best possible results, up to
a constant factor, when $p \geq 2$. We present experimental results on CIFAR to
validate our theory. For other smoothing distributions, such as, a uniform
distribution within an $\ell_1$ or an $\ell_\infty$-norm ball, we show upper
bounds of the form $O(1 / d)$ and $O(1 / d^{1 - \frac{1}{p}})$ respectively,
which have an even worse dependence on $d$.

Title: Multi-task Reinforcement Learning with a Planning Quasi-Metric
Authors: Vincent Micheli, Karthigan Sinnathamby, Fran\c{c}ois Fleuret
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We introduce a new reinforcement learning approach combining a planning
quasi-metric (PQM) that estimates the number of actions required to go from a
state to another, with task-specific planners that compute a target state to
reach a given goal. The main advantage of this decomposition is to allow the
sharing across tasks of a task-agnostic model of the quasi-metric that captures
the environment's dynamics and can be learned in a dense and unsupervised
manner. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach on the standard bit-flip
problem and in the MuJoCo robotic arm simulator.

Title: Composing Molecules with Multiple Property Constraints
Authors: Wengong Jin, Regina Barzilay, Tommi Jaakkola
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Drug discovery aims to find novel compounds with specified chemical property
profiles. In terms of generative modeling, the goal is to learn to sample
molecules in the intersection of multiple property constraints. This task
becomes increasingly challenging when there are many property constraints. We
propose to offset this complexity by composing molecules from a vocabulary of
substructures that we call molecular rationales. These rationales are
identified from molecules as substructures that are likely responsible for each
property of interest. We then learn to expand rationales into a full molecule
using graph generative models. Our final generative model composes molecules as
mixtures of multiple rationale completions, and this mixture is fine-tuned to
preserve the properties of interest. We evaluate our model on various drug
design tasks and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines in terms of accuracy, diversity, and novelty of generated compounds.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Image Classification in the Local Setting
Authors: Sen Wang, J.Morris Chang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures, conference
\\
  Image data has been greatly produced by individuals and commercial vendors in
the daily life, and it has been used across various domains, like advertising,
medical and traffic analysis. Recently, image data also appears to be greatly
important in social utility, like emergency response. However, the privacy
concern becomes the biggest obstacle that prevents further exploration of image
data, due to that the image could reveal sensitive information, like the
personal identity and locations. The recent developed Local Differential
Privacy (LDP) brings us a promising solution, which allows the data owners to
randomly perturb their input to provide the plausible deniability of the data
before releasing. In this paper, we consider a two-party image classification
problem, in which data owners hold the image and the untrustworthy data user
would like to fit a machine learning model with these images as input. To
protect the image privacy, we propose to locally perturb the image
representation before revealing to the data user. Subsequently, we analyze how
the perturbation satisfies {\epsilon}-LDP and affect the data utility regarding
count-based and distance-based machine learning algorithm, and propose a
supervised image feature extractor, DCAConv, which produces an image
representation with scalable domain size. Our experiments show that DCAConv
could maintain a high data utility while preserving the privacy regarding
multiple image benchmark datasets.

Title: Local Nonparametric Meta-Learning
Authors: Wonjoon Goo, Scott Niekum
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A central goal of meta-learning is to find a learning rule that enables fast
adaptation across a set of tasks, by learning the appropriate inductive bias
for that set. Most meta-learning algorithms try to find a \textit{global}
learning rule that encodes this inductive bias. However, a global learning rule
represented by a fixed-size representation is prone to meta-underfitting or
-overfitting since the right representational power for a task set is difficult
to choose a priori. Even when chosen correctly, we show that global, fixed-size
representations often fail when confronted with certain types of
out-of-distribution tasks, even when the same inductive bias is appropriate. To
address these problems, we propose a novel nonparametric meta-learning
algorithm that utilizes a meta-trained local learning rule, building on recent
ideas in attention-based and functional gradient-based meta-learning. In
several meta-regression problems, we show improved meta-generalization results
using our local, nonparametric approach and achieve state-of-the-art results in
the robotics benchmark, Omnipush.

Title: On the Complexity of Minimizing Convex Finite Sums Without Using the
  Indices of the Individual Functions
Authors: Yossi Arjevani, Amit Daniely, Stefanie Jegelka, Hongzhou Lin
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Recent advances in randomized incremental methods for minimizing $L$-smooth
$\mu$-strongly convex finite sums have culminated in tight complexity of
$\tilde{O}((n+\sqrt{n L/\mu})\log(1/\epsilon))$ and $O(n+\sqrt{nL/\epsilon})$,
where $\mu>0$ and $\mu=0$, respectively, and $n$ denotes the number of
individual functions. Unlike incremental methods, stochastic methods for finite
sums do not rely on an explicit knowledge of which individual function is being
addressed at each iteration, and as such, must perform at least $\Omega(n^2)$
iterations to obtain $O(1/n^2)$-optimal solutions. In this work, we exploit the
finite noise structure of finite sums to derive a matching $O(n^2)$-upper bound
under the global oracle model, showing that this lower bound is indeed tight.
Following a similar approach, we propose a novel adaptation of SVRG which is
both \emph{compatible with stochastic oracles}, and achieves complexity bounds
of $\tilde{O}((n^2+n\sqrt{L/\mu})\log(1/\epsilon))$ and
$O(n\sqrt{L/\epsilon})$, for $\mu>0$ and $\mu=0$, respectively. Our bounds hold
w.h.p. and match in part existing lower bounds of
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^2+\sqrt{nL/\mu}\log(1/\epsilon))$ and
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^2+\sqrt{nL/\epsilon})$, for $\mu>0$ and $\mu=0$,
respectively.

Title: Domain Adaptation As a Problem of Inference on Graphical Models
Authors: Kun Zhang, Mingming Gong, Petar Stojanov, Biwei Huang, Clark Glymour
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 17 pages; 6 figures
\\
  This paper is concerned with data-driven unsupervised domain adaptation,
where it is unknown in advance how the joint distribution changes across
domains, i.e., what factors or modules of the data distribution remain
invariant or change across domains. To develop an automated way of domain
adaptation with multiple source domains, we propose to use a graphical model as
a compact way to encode the change property of the joint distribution, which
can be learned from data, and then view domain adaptation as a problem of
Bayesian inference on the graphical models. Such a graphical model
distinguishes between constant and varied modules of the distribution and
specifies the properties of the changes across domains, which serves as prior
knowledge of the changing modules for the purpose of deriving the posterior of
the target variable $Y$ in the target domain. This provides an end-to-end
framework of domain adaptation, in which additional knowledge about how the
joint distribution changes, if available, can be directly incorporated to
improve the graphical representation. We discuss how causality-based domain
adaptation can be put under this umbrella. Experimental results on both
synthetic and real data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework for
domain adaptation.

Title: Segmented Graph-Bert for Graph Instance Modeling
Authors: Jiawei Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  In graph instance representation learning, both the diverse graph instance
sizes and the graph node orderless property have been the major obstacles that
render existing representation learning models fail to work. In this paper, we
will examine the effectiveness of GRAPH-BERT on graph instance representation
learning, which was designed for node representation learning tasks originally.
To adapt GRAPH-BERT to the new problem settings, we re-design it with a
segmented architecture instead, which is also named as SEG-BERT (Segmented
GRAPH-BERT) for reference simplicity in this paper. SEG-BERT involves no
node-order-variant inputs or functional components anymore, and it can handle
the graph node orderless property naturally. What's more, SEG-BERT has a
segmented architecture and introduces three different strategies to unify the
graph instance sizes, i.e., full-input, padding/pruning and segment shifting,
respectively. SEG-BERT is pre-trainable in an unsupervised manner, which can be
further transferred to new tasks directly or with necessary fine-tuning. We
have tested the effectiveness of SEG-BERT with experiments on seven graph
instance benchmark datasets, and SEG-BERT can out-perform the comparison
methods on six out of them with significant performance advantages.

Title: Learning High Order Feature Interactions with Fine Control Kernels
Authors: Hristo Paskov, Alex Paskov, Robert West
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We provide a methodology for learning sparse statistical models that use as
features all possible multiplicative interactions among an underlying atomic
set of features. While the resulting optimization problems are exponentially
sized, our methodology leads to algorithms that can often solve these problems
exactly or provide approximate solutions based on combining highly correlated
features. We also introduce an algorithmic paradigm, the Fine Control Kernel
framework, so named because it is based on Fenchel Duality and is reminiscent
of kernel methods. Its theory is tailored to large sparse learning problems,
and it leads to efficient feature screening rules for interactions. These rules
are inspired by the Apriori algorithm for market basket analysis -- which also
falls under the purview of Fine Control Kernels, and can be applied to a
plurality of learning problems including the Lasso and sparse matrix
estimation. Experiments on biomedical datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our
methodology in deriving algorithms that efficiently produce interactions models
which achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and are interpretable.

Title: Momentum Improves Normalized SGD
Authors: Ashok Cutkosky and Harsh Mehta
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  We provide an improved analysis of normalized SGD showing that adding
momentum provably removes the need for large batch sizes on non-convex
objectives. Then, we consider the case of objectives with bounded second
derivative and show that in this case a small tweak to the momentum formula
allows normalized SGD with momentum to find an $\epsilon$-critical point in
$O(1/\epsilon^{3.5})$ iterations, matching the best-known rates without
accruing any logarithmic factors or dependence on dimension. We also provide an
adaptive method that automatically improves convergence rates when the variance
in the gradients is small. Finally, we show that our method is effective when
employed on popular large scale tasks such as ResNet-50 and BERT pretraining,
matching the performance of the disparate methods used to get state-of-the-art
results on both tasks.

\\
  Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest (CA) face a high risk of
neurological disability and death, however pragmatic methods are lacking for
accurate and reliable prognostication. The aim of this study was to build
computational models to predict post-CA outcome by leveraging high-dimensional
patient data available early after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).
We hypothesized that model performance could be enhanced by integrating
physiological time series (PTS) data and by training machine learning (ML)
classifiers. We compared three models integrating features extracted from the
electronic health records (EHR) alone, features derived from PTS collected in
the first 24hrs after ICU admission (PTS24), and models integrating PTS24 and
EHR. Outcomes of interest were survival and neurological outcome at ICU
discharge. Combined EHR-PTS24 models had higher discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) than models which used either
EHR or PTS24 alone, for the prediction of survival (AUC 0.85, 0.80 and 0.68
respectively) and neurological outcome (0.87, 0.83 and 0.78). The best ML
classifier achieved higher discrimination than the reference logistic
regression model (APACHE III) for survival (AUC 0.85 vs 0.70) and neurological
outcome prediction (AUC 0.87 vs 0.75). Feature analysis revealed previously
unknown factors to be associated with post-CA recovery. Results attest to the
effectiveness of ML models for post-CA predictive modeling and suggest that PTS
recorded in very early phase after resuscitation encode short-term outcome
probabilities.

Title: Maximizing the Total Reward via Reward Tweaking
Authors: Chen Tessler and Shie Mannor
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In reinforcement learning, the discount factor $\gamma$ controls the agent's
effective planning horizon. Traditionally, this parameter was considered part
of the MDP; however, as deep reinforcement learning algorithms tend to become
unstable when the effective planning horizon is long, recent works refer to
$\gamma$ as a hyper-parameter. In this work, we focus on the finite-horizon
setting and introduce \emph{reward tweaking}. Reward tweaking learns a
surrogate reward function $\tilde r$ for the discounted setting, which induces
an optimal (undiscounted) return in the original finite-horizon task.
Theoretically, we show that there exists a surrogate reward which leads to
optimality in the original task and discuss the robustness of our approach.
Additionally, we perform experiments in a high-dimensional continuous control
task and show that reward tweaking guides the agent towards better long-horizon
returns when it plans for short horizons using the tweaked reward.

  Models
Authors: Yufeng Zhang, Wanwei Liu, Zhenbang Chen, Ji Wang, Zhiming Liu, Kenli

Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Recent research has shown that it is challenging to detect
out-of-distribution (OOD) data in deep generative models including flow-based
models and variational autoencoders (VAEs). In this paper, we prove a theorem
that, for a well-trained flow-based model, the distance between the
distribution of representations of an OOD dataset and prior can be large
enough, as long as the distance between the distributions of the training
dataset and the OOD dataset is large enough. Furthermore, our observation shows
that, for flow-based model and VAE with factorized prior, the representations
of OOD datasets are more correlated than that of the training dataset. Based on
our theorem and observation, we propose detecting OOD data according to the
total correlation of representations in flow-based model and VAE. Experimental
results show that our method can achieve nearly 100\% AUROC for all the widely
used benchmarks and has robustness against data manipulation. While the
state-of-the-art method performs not better than random guessing for
challenging problems and can be fooled by data manipulation in almost all
cases.

Title: Multi-Task Learning by a Top-Down Control Network

  A general problem that received considerable recent attention is how to
perform multiple tasks in the same network, maximizing both prediction accuracy
and efficiency of training. Recent approaches address this problem by branching
networks, or by a channel-wise modulation of the feature-maps with task
specific vectors. We propose a novel architecture that uses a top-down network
to modify the main network according to the task in a channel-wise, as well as
spatial-wise, image-dependent computation scheme. We show the effectiveness of
our scheme by achieving better results than alternative state-of-the-art
approaches to multi-task learning. We also demonstrate our advantages in terms
of task selectivity, scaling the number of tasks, learning from fewer examples
and interpretability.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Local robustness verification can verify that a neural network is robust wrt.
any perturbation to a specific input within a certain distance. We call this
distance Robustness Radius. We observe that the robustness radii of correctly
classified inputs are much larger than that of misclassified inputs which
include adversarial examples, especially those from strong adversarial attacks.
Another observation is that the robustness radii of correctly classified inputs
often follow a normal distribution. Based on these two observations, we propose
to validate inputs for neural networks via runtime local robustness
verification. Experiments show that our approach can protect neural networks
from adversarial examples and improve their accuracies.

Title: Graph Neural Distance Metric Learning with Graph-Bert

Comments: 11 pages
\\
  Graph distance metric learning serves as the foundation for many graph
learning problems, e.g., graph clustering, graph classification and graph
matching. Existing research works on graph distance metric (or graph kernels)
learning fail to maintain the basic properties of such metrics, e.g.,
non-negative, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and triangle inequality,
respectively. In this paper, we will introduce a new graph neural network based
distance metric learning approaches, namely GB-DISTANCE (GRAPH-BERT based
Neural Distance). Solely based on the attention mechanism, GB-DISTANCE can
learn graph instance representations effectively based on a pre-trained
GRAPH-BERT model. Different from the existing supervised/unsupervised metrics,
GB-DISTANCE can be learned effectively in a semi-supervised manner. In
addition, GB-DISTANCE can also maintain the distance metric basic properties
mentioned above. Extensive experiments have been done on several benchmark
graph datasets, and the results demonstrate that GB-DISTANCE can out-perform
the existing baseline methods, especially the recent graph neural network model
based graph metrics, with a significant gap in computing the graph distance.

Title: Improving Neural Network Learning Through Dual Variable Learning Rates

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This paper introduces and evaluates a novel training method for neural
networks: Dual Variable Learning Rates (DVLR). Building on techniques and
insights from behavioral psychology, the dual learning rates are used to
emphasize correct and incorrect responses differently, thereby making the
feedback to the network more specific. Further, the learning rates are varied
as a function of the network's performance, thereby making it more efficient.
DVLR was implemented on both a simple feedforward neural network and a
convolutional neural network. Both networks are trained faster and achieve an
increased accuracy on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 domains demonstrating that DVLR is
a promising, psychologically motivated technique for training neural network
models.

  How far apart are two neural networks? This is a foundational question in

function space to distance in parameter space for a broad class of nonlinear
compositional functions. The bound distills a clear dependence on depth of the
composition. The theory is of practical relevance since it establishes a trust
region for first-order optimisation. In turn, this suggests an optimiser that
we call Frobenius matched gradient descent---or Fromage. Fromage involves a
principled form of gradient rescaling and enjoys guarantees on stability of
both the spectra and Frobenius norms of the weights. We find that the new
algorithm increases the depth at which a multilayer perceptron may be trained
as compared to Adam and SGD and is competitive with Adam for training
generative adversarial networks. We further verify that Fromage scales up to a
language transformer with over $10^8$ parameters. Please find code &

Title: Robust binary classification with the 01 loss
Authors: Yunzhe Xue, Meiyan Xie, Usman Roshan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  The 01 loss is robust to outliers and tolerant to noisy data compared to
convex loss functions. We conjecture that the 01 loss may also be more robust
to adversarial attacks. To study this empirically we have developed a
stochastic coordinate descent algorithm for a linear 01 loss classifier and a
single hidden layer 01 loss neural network. Due to the absence of the gradient
we iteratively update coordinates on random subsets of the data for fixed
epochs. We show our algorithms to be fast and comparable in accuracy to the
linear support vector machine and logistic loss single hidden layer network for
binary classification on several image benchmarks, thus establishing that our
method is on-par in test accuracy with convex losses. We then subject them to
accurately trained substitute model black box attacks on the same image
benchmarks and find them to be more robust than convex counterparts. On CIFAR10
binary classification task between classes 0 and 1 with adversarial
perturbation of 0.0625 we see that the MLP01 network loses 27\% in accuracy
whereas the MLP-logistic counterpart loses 83\%. Similarly on STL10 and
ImageNet binary classification between classes 0 and 1 the MLP01 network loses
21\% and 20\% while MLP-logistic loses 67\% and 45\% respectively. On MNIST
that is a well-separable dataset we find MLP01 comparable to MLP-logistic and
show under simulation how and why our 01 loss solver is less robust there. We
then propose adversarial training for our linear 01 loss solver that
significantly improves its robustness on MNIST and all other datasets and
retains clean test accuracy. Finally we show practical applications of our
method to deter traffic sign and facial recognition adversarial attacks. We
discuss attacks with 01 loss, substitute model accuracy, and several future
avenues like multiclass, 01 loss convolutions, and further adversarial
training.

Title: Relation Embedding for Personalised POI Recommendation

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.DB cs.IR stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures, Accepted in the 24th Pacific-Asia Conference on
  Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2020)
\\
  Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of the most important
location-based services to help people discover interesting venues or services.
However, the extreme user-POI matrix sparsity and the varying spatial-temporal
context create challenges for POI recommendation, which affects the performance
of POI recommendation quality. To this end, we propose a translation-based
relation embedding for POI recommendation. Our approach encodes the temporal
and geographic information, as well as semantic content information effectively
in a low-dimension relation space by using knowledge graph embedding
techniques. To further alleviate the issue of user-POI matrix sparsity, a fused
matrix factorization framework is built on a user-POI graph to enhance the
inference of dynamic personal interests by exploiting the side-information.
Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed model.

Title: Projected Stein Variational Gradient Descent
Authors: Peng Chen, Omar Ghattas
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The curse of dimensionality is a critical challenge in Bayesian inference for
high dimensional parameters. In this work, we address this challenge by
developing a projected Stein variational gradient descent (pSVGD) method, which
projects the parameters into a subspace that is adaptively constructed using
the gradient of the log-likelihood, and applies SVGD for the much
lower-dimensional coefficients of the projection. We provide an upper bound for
the projection error with respect to the posterior and demonstrate the accuracy
(compared to SVGD) and scalability of pSVGD with respect to the number of
parameters, samples, data points, and processor cores.

Title: Interpretable Off-Policy Evaluation in Reinforcement Learning by
  Highlighting Influential Transitions
Authors: Omer Gottesman, Joseph Futoma, Yao Liu, Soanli Parbhoo, leo Anthony

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning offers the chance of using
observational data to improve future outcomes in domains such as healthcare and
education, but safe deployment in high stakes settings requires ways of
assessing its validity. Traditional measures such as confidence intervals may
be insufficient due to noise, limited data and confounding. In this paper we
develop a method that could serve as a hybrid human-AI system, to enable human
experts to analyze the validity of policy evaluation estimates. This is
accomplished by highlighting observations in the data whose removal will have a
large effect on the OPE estimate, and formulating a set of rules for choosing
which ones to present to domain experts for validation. We develop methods to
compute exactly the influence functions for fitted Q-evaluation with two
different function classes: kernel-based and linear least squares. Experiments
on medical simulations and real-world intensive care unit data demonstrate that
our method can be used to identify limitations in the evaluation process and
make evaluation more robust.

Title: Semi-Supervised Class Discovery
Authors: Jeremy Nixon, Jeremiah Liu, David Berthelot
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  One promising approach to dealing with datapoints that are outside of the
initial training distribution (OOD) is to create new classes that capture
similarities in the datapoints previously rejected as uncategorizable. Systems
that generate labels can be deployed against an arbitrary amount of data,
discovering classification schemes that through training create a higher
quality representation of data. We introduce the Dataset Reconstruction
Accuracy, a new and important measure of the effectiveness of a model's ability
to create labels. We introduce benchmarks against this Dataset Reconstruction
metric. We apply a new heuristic, class learnability, for deciding whether a
class is worthy of addition to the training dataset. We show that our method
applies to language through the CLINC Out-of-scope dataset. And we present a
class discovery system that given only half of the classes at train time
achieves 91\% reconstruction accuracy on MNIST, 73\% reconstruction accuracy on
CIFAR-10 and 87\% reconstruction accuracy on Fashion-MNIST, demonstrating the
value of semi-supervised learning to automatically discovering classes.

\\
  Implementing enterprise process automation often requires significant
technical expertise and engineering effort. It would be beneficial for
non-technical users to be able to describe a business process in natural
language and have an intelligent system generate the workflow that can be
automatically executed. A building block of process automations are If-Then
programs. In the consumer space, sites like IFTTT and Zapier allow users to
create automations by defining If-Then programs using a graphical interface. We
explore the efficacy of modeling If-Then programs as a sequence learning task.
We find Seq2Seq approaches have high potential (performing strongly on the
Zapier recipes) and can serve as a promising approach to more complex program
synthesis challenges.

Title: A Diffusion Theory for Deep Learning Dynamics: Stochastic Gradient
  Descent Escapes From Sharp Minima Exponentially Fast
Authors: Zeke Xie, Issei Sato, and Masashi Sugiyama
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Stochastic optimization algorithms, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
and its variants, are mainstream methods for training deep networks in
practice. However, the theoretical mechanism behind gradient noise still
remains to be further investigated. Deep learning is known to find flat minima
with a large neighboring region in parameter space from which each weight
vector has similar small error. In this paper, we focus on a fundamental
problem in deep learning, "How can deep learning usually find flat minima among
so many minima?" To answer the question, we develop a density diffusion theory
(DDT) for revealing the fundamental dynamical mechanism of SGD and deep
learning. More specifically, we study how escape time from loss valleys to the
outside of valleys depends on minima sharpness, gradient noise and
hyperparameters. One of the most interesting findings is that stochastic
gradient noise from SGD can help escape from sharp minima exponentially faster
than flat minima, while white noise can only help escape from sharp minima
polynomially faster than flat minima. We also find large-batch training
requires exponentially many iterations to pass through sharp minima and find
flat minima. We present direct empirical evidence supporting the proposed
theoretical results.

Title: Few-shot Domain Adaptation by Causal Mechanism Transfer
Authors: Takeshi Teshima, Issei Sato, Masashi Sugiyama
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 31 pages, 3 figures
\\
  We study few-shot supervised domain adaptation (DA) for regression problems,
where only a few labeled target domain data and many labeled source domain data
are available. Many of the current DA methods base their transfer assumptions
on either parametrized distribution shift or apparent distribution
similarities, e.g., identical conditionals or small distributional
discrepancies. However, these assumptions may preclude the possibility of
adaptation from intricately shifted and apparently very different
distributions. To overcome this problem, we propose mechanism transfer, a
meta-distributional scenario in which a data generating mechanism is invariant
among domains. This transfer assumption can accommodate nonparametric shifts
resulting in apparently different distributions while providing a solid
statistical basis for DA. We take the structural equations in causal modeling
as an example and propose a novel DA method, which is shown to be useful both
theoretically and experimentally. Our method can be seen as the first attempt
to fully leverage the structural causal models for DA.

Title: Regularized Submodular Maximization at Scale
Authors: Ehsan Kazemi and Shervin Minaee and Moran Feldman and Amin Karbasi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we propose scalable methods for maximizing a regularized
submodular function $f = g - \ell$ expressed as the difference between a
monotone submodular function $g$ and a modular function $\ell$. Indeed,
submodularity is inherently related to the notions of diversity, coverage, and
representativeness. In particular, finding the mode of many popular
probabilistic models of diversity, such as determinantal point processes,
submodular probabilistic models, and strongly log-concave distributions,
involves maximization of (regularized) submodular functions. Since a
regularized function $f$ can potentially take on negative values, the classic
theory of submodular maximization, which heavily relies on the non-negativity
assumption of submodular functions, may not be applicable. To circumvent this
challenge, we develop the first one-pass streaming algorithm for maximizing a
regularized submodular function subject to a $k$-cardinality constraint. It
returns a solution $S$ with the guarantee that $f(S)\geq(\phi^{-2}-\epsilon)
\cdot g(OPT)-\ell (OPT)$, where $\phi$ is the golden ratio. Furthermore, we
develop the first distributed algorithm that returns a solution $S$ with the
guarantee that $\mathbb{E}[f(S)] \geq (1-\epsilon) [(1-e^{-1}) \cdot
g(OPT)-\ell(OPT)]$ in $O(1/ \epsilon)$ rounds of MapReduce computation, without
keeping multiple copies of the entire dataset in each round (as it is usually
done). We should highlight that our result, even for the unregularized case
where the modular term $\ell$ is zero, improves the memory and communication
complexity of the existing work by a factor of $O(1/ \epsilon)$ while arguably
provides a simpler distributed algorithm and a unifying analysis. We also
empirically study the performance of our scalable methods on a set of real-life
applications, including finding the mode of distributions, data summarization,
and product recommendation.

Title: Learning Stochastic Behaviour of Aggregate Data
Authors: Shaojun Ma, Shu Liu, Hongyuan Zha, Haomin Zhou
Categories: cs.LG math.AP stat.ML
\\
  Learning nonlinear dynamics of aggregate data is a challenging problem since
the full trajectory of each individual is not observable, namely, the
individual observed at one time point may not be observed at next time point.
One class of existing work investigate such dynamics by requiring complete
longitudinal individual-level trajectories. However, in most of the practical
applications, the requirement is unrealistic due to technical limitations,
experimental costs and/or privacy issues. The other one class of methods learn
the dynamics by regarding aggregate behaviour as a stochastic process
with/without hidden variable. The performances of such methods may be
restricted due to complex dynamics, high dimensions and computation costs. In
this paper, we propose a new weak form based framework to study the hidden
dynamics of aggregate data via Wasserstein generative adversarial network(WGAN)
and Fokker Planck Equation(FPE). Our model fall into the second class of
methods with simple structure and computation. We demonstrate our approach in
the context of a series of synthetic and real-world datasets.

Title: Random Smoothing Might be Unable to Certify $\ell_\infty$ Robustness for
  High-Dimensional Images
Authors: Avrim Blum, Travis Dick, Naren Manoj, Hongyang Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  We show a hardness result for random smoothing to achieve certified
adversarial robustness against attacks in the $\ell_p$ ball of radius
$\epsilon$ when $p>2$. Although random smoothing has been well understood for
the $\ell_2$ case using the Gaussian distribution, much remains unknown
concerning the existence of a noise distribution that works for the case of
$p>2$. This has been posed as an open problem by Cohen et al. (2019) and
includes many significant paradigms such as the $\ell_\infty$ threat model. In
this work, we show that under certain regularity conditions, any noise
distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ that provides $\ell_p$
robustness with $p>2$ must satisfy
$\mathbb{E}\eta_i^2=\Omega(d^{1-2/p}\epsilon^2/\delta^2)$ for 99% of the
features (pixels) of vector $\eta$ drawn from $\mathcal{D}$, where $\epsilon$
is the robust radius and $\delta$ measures the score gap between the highest
score and the runner-up. Therefore, for high-dimensional images with pixel
values bounded in $[0,255]$, the required noise will eventually dominate the
useful information in the images, leading to trivial smoothed classifiers.

Title: Self-Assttentive Associative Memory
Authors: Hung Le, Truyen Tran and Svetha Venkatesh
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages
\\
  Heretofore, neural networks with external memory are restricted to single
memory with lossy representations of memory interactions. A rich representation
of relationships between memory pieces urges a high-order and segregated
relational memory. In this paper, we propose to separate the storage of
individual experiences (item memory) and their occurring relationships
(relational memory). The idea is implemented through a novel Self-attentive
Associative Memory (SAM) operator. Found upon outer product, SAM forms a set of
associative memories that represent the hypothetical high-order relationships
between arbitrary pairs of memory elements, through which a relational memory
is constructed from an item memory. The two memories are wired into a single
sequential model capable of both memorization and relational reasoning. We
achieve competitive results with our proposed two-memory model in a diversity
of machine learning tasks, from challenging synthetic problems to practical
testbeds such as geometry, graph, reinforcement learning, and question
answering.

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for constrained submodular
maximization, inspired by barrier functions in continuous optimization. This
connection not only improves the running time for constrained submodular
maximization but also provides the state of the art guarantee. More precisely,
for maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to the combination of a
$k$-matchoid and $\ell$-knapsack constraint (for $\ell\leq k$), we propose a
potential function that can be approximately minimized. Once we minimize the
potential function up to an $\epsilon$ error it is guaranteed that we have
found a feasible set with a $2(k+1+\epsilon)$-approximation factor which can
indeed be further improved to $(k+1+\epsilon)$ by an enumeration technique. We
extensively evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm over several
real-world applications, including a movie recommendation system, summarization
tasks for YouTube videos, Twitter feeds and Yelp business locations, and a set
cover problem.

Title: Understanding and Improving Knowledge Distillation

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Knowledge distillation is a model-agnostic technique to improve model quality
while having a fixed capacity budget. It is a commonly used technique for model
compression, where a higher capacity teacher model with better quality is used
to train a more compact student model with better inference efficiency. Through
distillation, one hopes to benefit from student's compactness, without
sacrificing too much on model quality. Despite the large success of knowledge
distillation, better understanding of how it benefits student model's training
dynamics remains under-explored. In this paper, we dissect the effects of
knowledge distillation into three main factors: (1) benefits inherited from
label smoothing, (2) example re-weighting based on teacher's confidence on
ground-truth, and (3) prior knowledge of optimal output (logit) layer geometry.
Using extensive systematic analyses and empirical studies on synthetic and
real-world datasets, we confirm that the aforementioned three factors play a
major role in knowledge distillation. Furthermore, based on our findings, we
propose a simple, yet effective technique to improve knowledge distillation
empirically.

Title: Adversarial TCAV -- Robust and Effective Interpretation of Intermediate
  Layers in Neural Networks
Authors: Rahul Soni, Naresh Shah, Chua Tat Seng, Jimmy D. Moore
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Interpreting neural network decisions and the information learned in
intermediate layers is still a challenge due to the opaque internal state and
shared non-linear interactions. Although \cite{kim2017interpretability}
proposed to interpret intermediate layers by quantifying its ability to
distinguish a user-defined concept (from random examples), the questions of
robustness (variation against the choice of random examples) and effectiveness
(retrieval rate of concept images) remain. We investigate these two properties
and propose improvements to make concept activations reliable for practical
use.
  Effectiveness: If the intermediate layer has effectively learned a
user-defined concept, it should be able to recall --- at the testing step ---
most of the images containing the proposed concept. For instance, we observed
that the recall rate of Tiger shark and Great white shark from the ImageNet
dataset with "Fins" as a user-defined concept was only 18.35% for VGG16. To
increase the effectiveness of concept learning, we propose A-CAV --- the
Adversarial Concept Activation Vector --- this results in larger margins
between user concepts and (negative) random examples. This approach improves
the aforesaid recall to 76.83% for VGG16.
  For robustness, we define it as the ability of an intermediate layer to be
consistent in its recall rate (the effectiveness) for different random seeds.
We observed that \cite{kim2017interpretable} has a large variance in recalling
a concept across different random seeds. For example, the recall of cat images
(from a layer learning the concept of \texttt{tail}) varies from 18% to 86%
with 20.85% standard deviation on VGG16. We propose a simple and scalable
modification that employs a Gram-Schmidt process to sample random noise from
concepts and learn an average "concept classifier". This approach improves the
aforesaid standard deviation from 20.85% to 6.4%.

Title: A Spike in Performance: Training Hybrid-Spiking Neural Networks with
  Quantized Activation Functions
Authors: Aaron R. Voelker and Daniel Rasmussen and Chris Eliasmith
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI q-bio.NC stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages. Submission under review
\\
  The machine learning community has become increasingly interested in the
energy efficiency of neural networks. The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a
promising approach to energy-efficient computing, since its activation levels
are quantized into temporally sparse, one-bit values (i.e., "spike" events),
which additionally converts the sum over weight-activity products into a simple
addition of weights (one weight for each spike). However, the goal of
maintaining state-of-the-art (SotA) accuracy when converting a non-spiking
network into an SNN has remained an elusive challenge, primarily due to spikes
having only a single bit of precision. Adopting tools from signal processing,
we cast neural activation functions as quantizers with temporally-diffused
error, and then train networks while smoothly interpolating between the
non-spiking and spiking regimes. We apply this technique to the Legendre Memory
Unit (LMU) to obtain the first known example of a hybrid SNN outperforming SotA
recurrent architectures---including the LSTM, GRU, and NRU---in accuracy, while
reducing activities to at most 3.74 bits on average with 1.26 significant bits
multiplying each weight. We discuss how these methods can significantly improve
the energy efficiency of neural networks.

Title: Supervised Learning: No Loss No Cry
Authors: Richard Nock and Aditya Krishna Menon
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
ACM-class: I.2.6
\\
  Supervised learning requires the specification of a loss function to
minimise. While the theory of admissible losses from both a computational and
statistical perspective is well-developed, these offer a panoply of different
choices. In practice, this choice is typically made in an \emph{ad hoc} manner.
In hopes of making this procedure more principled, the problem of
\emph{learning the loss function} for a downstream task (e.g., classification)
has garnered recent interest. However, works in this area have been generally
empirical in nature.
  In this paper, we revisit the {\sc SLIsotron} algorithm of Kakade et al.
(2011) through a novel lens, derive a generalisation based on Bregman
divergences, and show how it provides a principled procedure for learning the
loss. In detail, we cast {\sc SLIsotron} as learning a loss from a family of
composite square losses. By interpreting this through the lens of \emph{proper
losses}, we derive a generalisation of {\sc SLIsotron} based on Bregman
divergences. The resulting {\sc BregmanTron} algorithm jointly learns the loss
along with the classifier. It comes equipped with a simple guarantee of
convergence for the loss it learns, and its set of possible outputs comes with
a guarantee of agnostic approximability of Bayes rule. Experiments indicate
that the {\sc BregmanTron} substantially outperforms the {\sc SLIsotron}, and
that the loss it learns can be minimized by other algorithms for different
tasks, thereby opening the interesting problem of \textit{loss transfer}
between domains.

Title: Bilinear Graph Neural Network with Node Interactions

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.GR
\\
  Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a powerful model to learn representations and
make predictions on graph data. Existing efforts on GNN have largely defined
the graph convolution as a weighted sum of the features of the connected nodes
to form the representation of the target node. Nevertheless, the operation of
weighted sum assumes the neighbor nodes are independent of each other, and
ignores the possible interactions between them. When such interactions exist,
such as the co-occurrence of two neighbor nodes is a strong signal of the
target node's characteristics, existing GNN models may fail to capture the
signal. In this work, we argue the importance of modeling the interactions
between neighbor nodes in GNN. We propose a new graph convolution operator,
which augments the weighted sum with pairwise interactions of the
representations of neighbor nodes. We term this framework as Bilinear Graph
Neural Network (BGNN), which improves GNN representation ability with bilinear
interactions between neighbor nodes. In particular, we specify two BGNN models

Title: Accelerating RNN Transducer Inference via One-Step Constrained Beam
  Search
Authors: Juntae Kim and Yoonhan Lee
Categories: cs.LG eess.AS eess.SP
Comments: 4 pages
\\
  We propose a one-step constrained (OSC) beam search to accelerate recurrent
neural network (RNN) transducer (RNN-T) inference. The original RNN-T beam
search has a while-loop leading to speed down of the decoding process. The OSC
beam search eliminates this while-loop by vectorizing multiple hypotheses. This
vectorization is nontrivial as the expansion of the hypotheses within the
original RNN-T beam search can be different from each other. However, we found
that the hypotheses expanded only once at each decoding step in most cases;
thus, we constrained the maximum expansion number to one, thereby allowing
vectorization of the hypotheses. For further acceleration, we assign
constraints to the prefixes of the hypotheses to prune the redundant search
space. In addition, OSC beam search has duplication check among hypotheses
during the decoding process as duplication can undesirably shrink the search
space. We achieved significant speedup compared with other RNN-T beam search
methods with lower phoneme and word error rate.

Title: Combinatorial Semi-Bandit in the Non-Stationary Environment
Authors: Wei Chen, Liwei Wang, Haoyu Zhao, Kai Zheng
Categories: cs.LG cs.DS cs.GT stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the non-stationary combinatorial semi-bandit
problem, both in the switching case and in the dynamic case. In the general
case where (a) the reward function is non-linear, (b) arms may be
probabilistically triggered, and (c) only approximate offline oracle exists
\cite{wang2017improving}, our algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\mathcal{S} T})$ distribution-dependent regret in
the switching case, and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathcal{V}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ in the
dynamic case, where $\mathcal S$ is the number of switchings and $\mathcal V$
is the sum of the total ``distribution changes''. The regret bounds in both
scenarios are nearly optimal, but our algorithm needs to know the parameter
$\mathcal S$ or $\mathcal V$ in advance.
  We further show that by employing another technique, our algorithm no longer
needs to know the parameters $\mathcal S$ or $\mathcal V$ but the regret bounds
could become suboptimal.
  In a special case where the reward function is linear and we have an exact
oracle, we design a parameter-free algorithm that achieves nearly optimal
regret both in the switching case and in the dynamic case without knowing the
parameters in advance.

Title: On the Convergence of the Monte Carlo Exploring Starts Algorithm for
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Che Wang, Keith Ross
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Preprint, under review
\\
  A simple and natural algorithm for reinforcement learning is Monte Carlo
Exploring States (MCES), where the Q-function is estimated by averaging the
Monte Carlo returns, and the policy is improved by choosing actions that
maximize the current estimate of the Q-function. Exploration is performed by
"exploring starts", that is, each episode begins with a randomly chosen state
and action and then follows the current policy. Establishing convergence for
this algorithm has been an open problem for more than 20 years. We make headway
with this problem by proving convergence for Optimal Policy Feed-Forward MDPs,
which are MDPs whose states are not revisited within any episode for an optimal
policy. Such MDPs include all deterministic environments (including Cliff
Walking and other gridworld examples) and a large class of stochastic
environments (including Blackjack). The convergence results presented here make
progress for this long-standing open problem in reinforcement learning.

Title: Nonlinear Equation Solving: A Faster Alternative to Feedforward
  Computation
Authors: Yang Song, Chenlin Meng, Renjie Liao, Stefano Ermon
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Feedforward computations, such as evaluating a neural network or sampling
from an autoregressive model, are ubiquitous in machine learning. The
sequential nature of feedforward computation, however, requires a strict order
of execution and cannot be easily accelerated with parallel computing. To
enable parrallelization, we frame the task of feedforward computation as
solving a system of nonlinear equations. We then propose to find the solution
using a Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel fixed-point iteration method, as well as hybrid
methods of both. Crucially, Jacobi updates operate independently on each
equation and can be executed in parallel. Our method is guaranteed to give
exactly the same values as the original feedforward computation with a reduced
(or equal) number of parallel iterations. Experimentally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in accelerating 1) the evaluation of DenseNets on
ImageNet and 2) autoregressive sampling of MADE and PixelCNN. We are able to
achieve between 1.2 and 33 speedup factors under various conditions and
computation models.

Title: Stochastic Online Optimization using Kalman Recursion
Authors: Joseph de Vilmarest (LPSM), Olivier Wintenberger (LPSM)
Categories: cs.LG math.OC math.ST stat.TH
\\
  We study the Extended Kalman Filter in constant dynamics, offering a bayesian
perspective of stochastic optimization. We obtain high probability bounds on
the cumulative excess risk in an unconstrained setting. The unconstrained
challenge is tackled through a two-phase analysis. First, for linear and
logistic regressions, we prove that the algorithm enters a local phase where
the estimate stays in a small region around the optimum. We provide explicit
bounds with high probability on this convergence time. Second, for generalized
linear regressions, we provide a martingale analysis of the excess risk in the
local phase, improving existing ones in bounded stochastic optimization. The
EKF appears as a parameter-free O(d^2) online algorithm that optimally solves
some unconstrained optimization problems.

\\
  Acquiring abilities in the absence of a task-oriented reward function is at
the frontier of reinforcement learning research. This problem has been studied
through the lens of empowerment, which draws a connection between option
discovery and information theory. Information-theoretic skill discovery methods
have garnered much interest from the community, but little research has been
conducted in understanding their limitations. Through theoretical analysis and
empirical evidence, we show that existing algorithms suffer from a common
limitation -- they discover options that provide a poor coverage of the state
space. In light of this, we propose 'Explore, Discover and Learn' (EDL), an
alternative approach to information-theoretic skill discovery. Crucially, EDL
optimizes the same information-theoretic objective derived from the empowerment
literature, but addresses the optimization problem using different machinery.
We perform an extensive evaluation of skill discovery methods on controlled
environments and show that EDL offers significant advantages, such as
overcoming the coverage problem, reducing the dependence of learned skills on
the initial state, and allowing the user to define a prior over which behaviors
should be learned.

\\
  Anomaly detection on attributed networks aims at finding nodes whose patterns
deviate significantly from the majority of reference nodes, which is pervasive
in many applications such as network intrusion detection and social spammer
detection. However, most existing methods neglect the complex cross-modality
interactions between network structure and node attribute. In this paper, we
propose a deep joint representation learning framework for anomaly detection
through a dual autoencoder (AnomalyDAE), which captures the complex
interactions between network structure and node attribute for high-quality
embeddings. Specifically, AnomalyDAE consists of a structure autoencoder and an
attribute autoencoder to learn both node embedding and attribute embedding
jointly in latent space. Moreover, attention mechanism is employed in structure
encoder to learn the importance between a node and its neighbors for an
effective capturing of structure pattern, which is important to anomaly
detection. Besides, by taking both the node embedding and attribute embedding
as inputs of attribute decoder, the cross-modality interactions between network
structure and node attribute are learned during the reconstruction of node
attribute. Finally, anomalies can be detected by measuring the reconstruction
errors of nodes from both the structure and attribute perspectives. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Title: Learning Interpretable Models in the Property Specification Language
Authors: Rajarshi Roy, Dana Fisman and Daniel Neider
Categories: cs.LG cs.LO stat.ML
\\
  We address the problem of learning human-interpretable descriptions of a
complex system from a finite set of positive and negative examples of its
behavior. In contrast to most of the recent work in this area, which focuses on
descriptions expressed in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), we develop a learning
algorithm for formulas in the IEEE standard temporal logic PSL (Property
Specification Language). Our work is motivated by the fact that many natural
properties, such as an event happening at every n-th point in time, cannot be
expressed in LTL, whereas it is easy to express such properties in PSL.
Moreover, formulas in PSL can be more succinct and easier to interpret (due to
the use of regular expressions in PSL formulas) than formulas in LTL.
  Our learning algorithm builds on top of an existing algorithm for learning
LTL formulas. Roughly speaking, our algorithm reduces the learning task to a
constraint satisfaction problem in propositional logic and then uses a SAT
solver to search for a solution in an incremental fashion. We have implemented
our algorithm and performed a comparative study between the proposed method and
the existing LTL learning algorithm. Our results illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach to provide succinct human-interpretable descriptions
from examples.

Title: Towards Mixture Proportion Estimation without Irreducibility
Authors: Yu Yao and Tongliang Liu and Bo Han and Mingming Gong and Gang Niu and
  Masashi Sugiyama and Dacheng Tao
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  \textit{Mixture proportion estimation} (MPE) is a fundamental problem of
practical significance, where we are given data from only a \textit{mixture}
and one of its two \textit{components} to identify the proportion of each
component. All existing MPE methods that are distribution-independent
explicitly or implicitly rely on the \textit{irreducible} assumption---the
unobserved component is not a mixture containing the observable component. If
this is not satisfied, those methods will lead to a critical estimation bias.
In this paper, we propose \textit{Regrouping-MPE} that works without
irreducible assumption: it builds a new irreducible MPE problem and solves the
new problem. It is worthwhile to change the problem: we prove that if the
assumption holds, our method will not affect anything; if the assumption does
not hold, the bias from problem changing is less than the bias from violation
of the irreducible assumption in the original problem. Experiments show that
our method outperforms all state-of-the-art MPE methods on various real-world
datasets.

Title: A Measure-Theoretic Approach to Kernel Conditional Mean Embeddings
Authors: Junhyung Park, Krikamol Muandet
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We present a new operator-free, measure-theoretic definition of the
conditional mean embedding as a random variable taking values in a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space. While the kernel mean embedding of marginal distributions
has been defined rigorously, the existing operator-based approach of the
conditional version lacks a rigorous definition, and depends on strong
assumptions that hinder its analysis. Our definition does not impose any of the
assumptions that the operator-based counterpart requires. We derive a natural
regression interpretation to obtain empirical estimates, and provide a thorough
analysis of its properties, including universal consistency. As natural
by-products, we obtain the conditional analogues of the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion, and demonstrate their
behaviour via simulations.

Title: Distributed Bayesian Matrix Decomposition for Big Data Mining and

\\
  Matrix decomposition is one of the fundamental tools to discover knowledge
from big data generated by modern applications. However, it is still
inefficient or infeasible to process very big data using such a method in a
single machine. Moreover, big data are often distributedly collected and stored
on different machines. Thus, such data generally bear strong heterogeneous
noise. It is essential and useful to develop distributed matrix decomposition
for big data analytics. Such a method should scale up well, model the
heterogeneous noise, and address the communication issue in a distributed
system. To this end, we propose a distributed Bayesian matrix decomposition
model (DBMD) for big data mining and clustering. Specifically, we adopt three
strategies to implement the distributed computing including 1) the accelerated
gradient descent, 2) the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
and 3) the statistical inference. We investigate the theoretical convergence
behaviors of these algorithms. To address the heterogeneity of the noise, we
propose an optimal plug-in weighted average that reduces the variance of the
estimation. Synthetic experiments validate our theoretical results, and
real-world experiments show that our algorithms scale up well to big data and
achieves superior or competing performance compared to other distributed
methods.

Title: Try Depth Instead of Weight Correlations: Mean-field is a Less

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We challenge the longstanding assumption that the mean-field approximation
for variational inference in Bayesian neural networks is severely restrictive.
We argue mathematically that full-covariance approximations only improve the
ELBO if they improve the expected log-likelihood. We further show that deeper
mean-field networks are able to express predictive distributions approximately
equivalent to shallower full-covariance networks. We validate these
observations empirically, demonstrating that deeper models decrease the
divergence between diagonal- and full-covariance Gaussian fits to the true
posterior.

Title: Classification Algorithm of Speech Data of Parkinsons Disease Based on
  Convolution Sparse Kernel Transfer Learning with Optimal Kernel and Parallel
  Sample Feature Selection
Authors: Xiaoheng Zhang, Yongming Li, Pin Wang, Xiaoheng Tan, and Yuchuan Liu
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP
Comments: 12 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Labeled speech data from patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) are scarce,
and the statistical distributions of training and test data differ
significantly in the existing datasets. To solve these problems, dimensional
reduction and sample augmentation must be considered. In this paper, a novel PD
classification algorithm based on sparse kernel transfer learning combined with
a parallel optimization of samples and features is proposed. Sparse transfer
learning is used to extract effective structural information of PD speech
features from public datasets as source domain data, and the fast ADDM
iteration is improved to enhance the information extraction performance. To
implement the parallel optimization, the potential relationships between
samples and features are considered to obtain high-quality combined features.
First, features are extracted from a specific public speech dataset to
construct a feature dataset as the source domain. Then, the PD target domain,
including the training and test datasets, is encoded by convolution sparse
coding, which can extract more in-depth information. Next, parallel
optimization is implemented. To further improve the classification performance,
a convolution kernel optimization mechanism is designed. Using two
representative public datasets and one self-constructed dataset, the
experiments compare over thirty relevant algorithms. The results show that when
taking the Sakar dataset, MaxLittle dataset and DNSH dataset as target domains,
the proposed algorithm achieves obvious improvements in classification
accuracy. The study also found large improvements in the algorithms in this
paper compared with nontransfer learning approaches, demonstrating that
transfer learning is both more effective and has a more acceptable time cost.

Title: Unsupervised Discovery of Interpretable Directions in the GAN Latent
  Space
Authors: Andrey Voynov, Artem Babenko
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  The latent spaces of typical GAN models often have semantically meaningful
directions. Moving in these directions corresponds to human-interpretable image
transformations, such as zooming or recoloring, enabling a more controllable
generation process. However, the discovery of such directions is currently
performed in a supervised manner, requiring human labels, pretrained models, or
some form of self-supervision. These requirements can severely limit a range of
directions existing approaches can discover. In this paper, we introduce an
unsupervised method to identify interpretable directions in the latent space of
a pretrained GAN model. By a simple model-agnostic procedure, we find
directions corresponding to sensible semantic manipulations without any form of
(self-)supervision. Furthermore, we reveal several non-trivial findings, which
would be difficult to obtain by existing methods, e.g., a direction
corresponding to background removal. As an immediate practical benefit of our
work, we show how to exploit this finding to achieve a new state-of-the-art for
the problem of saliency detection.

Regular data sharing is often necessary for human-centered discussion and

sharing may also lead to data leakage. Inspired by adversarial attack, we
propose a method for data encryption, so that for human beings the encrypted
data look identical to the original version, but for machine learning methods
they are misleading. To show the effectiveness of our method, we collaborate
with the Beijing Tiantan Hospital, which has a world leading neurological

\\
  This chapter studies emerging cyber-attacks on reinforcement learning (RL)
and introduces a quantitative approach to analyze the vulnerabilities of RL.
Focusing on adversarial manipulation on the cost signals, we analyze the
performance degradation of TD($\lambda$) and $Q$-learning algorithms under the
manipulation. For TD($\lambda$), the approximation learned from the manipulated
costs has an approximation error bound proportional to the magnitude of the
attack. The effect of the adversarial attacks on the bound does not depend on
the choice of $\lambda$. In $Q$-learning, we show that $Q$-learning algorithms
converge under stealthy attacks and bounded falsifications on cost signals. We
characterize the relation between the falsified cost and the $Q$-factors as
well as the policy learned by the learning agent which provides fundamental
limits for feasible offensive and defensive moves. We propose a robust region
in terms of the cost within which the adversary can never achieve the targeted
policy. We provide conditions on the falsified cost which can mislead the agent
to learn an adversary's favored policy. A case study of TD($\lambda$) learning
is provided to corroborate the results.

Title: Adversarial Attacks on Linear Contextual Bandits
Authors: Evrard Garcelon, Baptiste Roziere, Laurent Meunier, Olivier Teytaud,

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Contextual bandit algorithms are applied in a wide range of domains, from
advertising to recommender systems, from clinical trials to education. In many
of these domains, malicious agents may have incentives to attack the bandit
algorithm to induce it to perform a desired behavior. For instance, an
unscrupulous ad publisher may try to increase their own revenue at the expense
of the advertisers; a seller may want to increase the exposure of their
products, or thwart a competitor's advertising campaign. In this paper, we
study several attack scenarios and show that a malicious agent can force a
linear contextual bandit algorithm to pull any desired arm $T - o(T)$ times
over a horizon of $T$ steps, while applying adversarial modifications to either
rewards or contexts that only grow logarithmically as $O(\log T)$. We also
investigate the case when a malicious agent is interested in affecting the
behavior of the bandit algorithm in a single context (e.g., a specific user).
We first provide sufficient conditions for the feasibility of the attack and we
then propose an efficient algorithm to perform the attack. We validate our
theoretical results on experiments performed on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

  While neural networks are good at learning unspecified functions from
training samples, they cannot be directly implemented in hardware and are often
not interpretable or formally verifiable. On the other hand, logic circuits are
implementable, verifiable, and interpretable but are not able to learn from
training data in a generalizable way. We propose a novel logic learning
pipeline that combines the advantages of neural networks and logic circuits.
Our pipeline first trains a neural network on a classification task, and then
translates this, first to random forests or look-up tables, and then to
AND-Inverter logic. We show that our pipeline maintains greater accuracy than
naive translations to logic, and minimizes the logic such that it is more
interpretable and has decreased hardware cost. We show the utility of our
pipeline on a network that is trained on biomedical data from patients
presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding with the prediction task of
determining if patients need immediate hospital-based intervention. This

Title: Deep Graph Mapper: Seeing Graphs through the Neural Lens
Authors: Cristian Bodnar, C\u{a}t\u{a}lina Cangea, Pietro Li\`o
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.SI stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Recent advancements in graph representation learning have led to the
emergence of condensed encodings that capture the main properties of a graph.
However, even though these abstract representations are powerful for downstream
tasks, they are not equally suitable for visualisation purposes. In this work,
we merge Mapper, an algorithm from the field of Topological Data Analysis
(TDA), with the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to produce
hierarchical, topologically-grounded visualisations of graphs. These
visualisations do not only help discern the structure of complex graphs but
also provide a means of understanding the models applied to them for solving
various tasks. We further demonstrate the suitability of Mapper as a
topological framework for graph pooling by mathematically proving an
equivalence with Min-Cut and Diff Pool. Building upon this framework, we
introduce a novel pooling algorithm based on PageRank, which obtains
competitive results with state of the art methods on graph classification
benchmarks.

Title: Machine learning approaches for identifying prey handling activity in
  otariid pinnipeds
Authors: Rita Pucci and Alessio Micheli and Stefano Chessa and Jane Hunter
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Systems developed in wearable devices with sensors onboard are widely used to
collect data of humans and animals activities with the perspective of an
on-board automatic classification of data. An interesting application of these
systems is to support animals' behaviour monitoring gathered by sensors' data
analysis. This is a challenging area and in particular with fixed memories
capabilities because the devices should be able to operate autonomously for
long periods before being retrieved by human operators, and being able to
classify activities onboard can significantly improve their autonomy. In this
paper, we focus on the identification of prey handling activity in seals (when
the animal start attaching and biting the prey), which is one of the main
movement that identifies a successful foraging activity. Data taken into
consideration are streams of 3D accelerometers and depth sensors values
collected by devices attached directly on seals. To analyse these data, we
propose an automatic model based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. In
particular, we compare the performance (in terms of accuracy and F1score) of
three ML algorithms: Input Delay Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and
Echo State Networks. We attend to the final aim of developing an automatic
classifier on-board. For this purpose, in this paper, the comparison is
performed concerning the performance obtained by each ML approach developed and
its memory footprint. In the end, we highlight the advantage of using an ML
algorithm, in terms of feasibility in wild animals' monitoring.

Title: A Framework for Semi-Automatic Precision and Accuracy Analysis for Fast
  and Rigorous Deep Learning
Authors: Christoph Lauter and Anastasia Volkova
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.MS cs.PL
\\
  Deep Neural Networks (DNN) represent a performance-hungry application.
Floating-Point (FP) and custom floating-point-like arithmetic satisfies this
hunger. While there is need for speed, inference in DNNs does not seem to have
any need for precision. Many papers experimentally observe that DNNs can
successfully run at almost ridiculously low precision.
  The aim of this paper is two-fold: first, to shed some theoretical light upon
why a DNN's FP accuracy stays high for low FP precision. We observe that the
loss of relative accuracy in the convolutional steps is recovered by the
activation layers, which are extremely well-conditioned. We give an
interpretation for the link between precision and accuracy in DNNs.
  Second, the paper presents a software framework for semi-automatic FP error
analysis for the inference phase of deep-learning. Compatible with common
Tensorflow/Keras models, it leverages the frugally-deep Python/C++ library to
transform a neural network into C++ code in order to analyze the network's need
for precision. This rigorous analysis is based on Interval and Affine
arithmetics to compute absolute and relative error bounds for a DNN. We
demonstrate our tool with several examples.

Title: SparseIDS: Learning Packet Sampling with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Maximilian Bachl, Fares Meghdouri, Joachim Fabini, Tanja Zseby
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.NI stat.ML
\\
  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been shown to be valuable for
constructing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for network data. They allow
determining if a flow is malicious or not already before it is over, making it
possible to take action immediately. However, considering the large number of
packets that have to be inspected, the question of computational efficiency
arises. We show that by using a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based
approach called SparseIDS, we can reduce the number of consumed packets by more
than three fourths while keeping classification accuracy high. Comparing to
various other sampling techniques, SparseIDS consistently achieves higher
classification accuracy by learning to sample only relevant packets. A major
novelty of our RL-based approach is that it can not only skip up to a
predefined maximum number of samples like other approaches proposed in the
domain of Natural Language Processing but can even skip arbitrarily many
packets in one step. This enables saving even more computational resources for
long sequences. Inspecting SparseIDS's behavior of choosing packets shows that
it adopts different sampling strategies for different attack types and network
flows. Finally we build an automatic steering mechanism that can guide
SparseIDS in deployment to achieve a desired level of sparsity.

\\
  The goal of this research project is to analyze the dynamics of social
networks using machine learning techniques to locate maximal cliques and to
find clusters for the purpose of identifying a target demographic. Unsupervised
machine learning techniques are designed and implemented in this project to
analyze a dataset from YouTube to discover communities in the social network
and find central nodes. Different clustering algorithms are implemented and
applied to the YouTube dataset. The well-known Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is used
effectively in this research to find maximal cliques. The results obtained from
this research could be used for advertising purposes and for building smart
recommendation systems. All algorithms were implemented using Python
programming language. The experimental results show that we were able to
successfully find central nodes through clique-centrality and degree
centrality. By utilizing clique detection algorithms, the research shown how
machine learning algorithms can detect close knit groups within a larger

Title: Using Fractal Neural Networks to Play SimCity 1 and Conway's Game of
  Life at Variable Scales
Authors: Sam Earle
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures, presented at EXAG, an AIIDE workshop
\\
  We introduce gym-city, a Reinforcement Learning environment that uses SimCity
1's game engine to simulate an urban environment, wherein agents might seek to
optimize one or a combination of any number of city-wide metrics, on gameboards
of various sizes. We focus on population, and analyze our agents' ability to
generalize to larger map-sizes than those seen during training. The environment
is interactive, allowing a human player to build alongside agents during
training and inference, potentially influencing the course of their learning,
or manually probing and evaluating their performance. To test our agents'
ability to capture distance-agnostic relationships between elements of the
gameboard, we design a minigame within the environment which is, by design,
unsolvable at large enough scales given strictly local strategies. Given the
game engine's extensive use of Cellular Automata, we also train our agents to
"play" Conway's Game of Life -- again optimizing for population -- and examine
their behaviour at multiple scales. To make our models compatible with
variable-scale gameplay, we use Neural Networks with recursive weights and
structure -- fractals to be truncated at different depths, dependent upon the
size of the gameboard.

  We discuss the problem of performing similarity search over function spaces.
To perform search over such spaces in a reasonable amount of time, we use {\it

functions on $\mathbb{R}^N$ to be extended to $L^p$ spaces: one using function
approximation in an orthonormal basis, and another using (quasi-)Monte
Carlo-style techniques. We use the presented hashing schemes to construct an
LSH family for Wasserstein distance over one-dimensional, continuous
probability distributions.

Title: Reducing the Computational Burden of Deep Learning with Recursive Local
  Representation Alignment
Authors: Alexander Ororbia, Ankur Mali, Daniel Kifer, C. Lee Giles
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE
Comments: Initial submission (under review)
\\
  Training deep neural networks on large-scale datasets requires significant
hardware resources whose costs (even on cloud platforms) put them out of reach
of smaller organizations, groups, and individuals. Backpropagation (backprop),
the workhorse for training these networks, is an inherently sequential process
that is difficult to parallelize. Furthermore, it requires researchers to
continually develop various tricks, such as specialized weight initializations
and activation functions, in order to ensure a stable parameter optimization.
Our goal is to seek an effective, parallelizable alternative to backprop that
can be used to train deep networks. In this paper, we propose a gradient-free
learning procedure, recursive local representation alignment, for training
large-scale neural architectures. Experiments with deep residual networks on
CIFAR-10 and the massive-scale benchmark, ImageNet, show that our algorithm
generalizes as well as backprop while converging sooner due to weight updates
that are parallelizable and computationally less demanding. This is empirical
evidence that a backprop-free algorithm can scale up to larger datasets.
Another contribution is that we also significantly reduce total parameter count
of our networks by utilizing fast, fixed noise maps in place of convolutional
operations without compromising generalization.

\\
  We consider the problem of prediction by a machine learning algorithm, called
learner, within an adversarial learning setting. The learner's task is to
correctly predict the class of data passed to it as a query. However, along
with queries containing clean data, the learner could also receive malicious or
adversarial queries from an adversary. The objective of the adversary is to
evade the learner's prediction mechanism by sending adversarial queries that
result in erroneous class prediction by the learner, while the learner's
objective is to reduce the incorrect prediction of these adversarial queries
without degrading the prediction quality of clean queries. We propose a game
theory-based technique called a Repeated Bayesian Sequential Game where the
learner interacts repeatedly with a model of the adversary using self play to
determine the distribution of adversarial versus clean queries. It then
strategically selects a classifier from a set of pre-trained classifiers that
balances the likelihood of correct prediction for the query along with reducing
the costs to use the classifier. We have evaluated our proposed technique using
clean and adversarial text data with deep neural network-based classifiers and
shown that the learner can select an appropriate classifier that is
commensurate with the query type (clean or adversarial) while remaining aware
of the cost to use the classifier.

Title: Pre-training Tasks for Embedding-based Large-scale Retrieval
Authors: Wei-Cheng Chang, Felix X. Yu, Yin-Wen Chang, Yiming Yang, Sanjiv Kumar
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL cs.IR stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by ICLR 2020
\\
  We consider the large-scale query-document retrieval problem: given a query
(e.g., a question), return the set of relevant documents (e.g., paragraphs
containing the answer) from a large document corpus. This problem is often
solved in two steps. The retrieval phase first reduces the solution space,
returning a subset of candidate documents. The scoring phase then re-ranks the
documents. Critically, the retrieval algorithm not only desires high recall but
also requires to be highly efficient, returning candidates in time sublinear to
the number of documents. Unlike the scoring phase witnessing significant
advances recently due to the BERT-style pre-training tasks on cross-attention
models, the retrieval phase remains less well studied. Most previous works rely
on classic Information Retrieval (IR) methods such as BM-25 (token matching +
TF-IDF weights). These models only accept sparse handcrafted features and can
not be optimized for different downstream tasks of interest. In this paper, we
conduct a comprehensive study on the embedding-based retrieval models. We show
that the key ingredient of learning a strong embedding-based Transformer model
is the set of pre-training tasks. With adequately designed paragraph-level
pre-training tasks, the Transformer models can remarkably improve over the
widely-used BM-25 as well as embedding models without Transformers. The
paragraph-level pre-training tasks we studied are Inverse Cloze Task (ICT),
Body First Selection (BFS), Wiki Link Prediction (WLP), and the combination of
all three.

Title: Subclass Distillation
Authors: Rafael M\"uller, Simon Kornblith, Geoffrey Hinton
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Under review
\\
  After a large "teacher" neural network has been trained on labeled data, the
probabilities that the teacher assigns to incorrect classes reveal a lot of
information about the way in which the teacher generalizes. By training a small
"student" model to match these probabilities, it is possible to transfer most
of the generalization ability of the teacher to the student, often producing a
much better small model than directly training the student on the training
data. The transfer works best when there are many possible classes because more
is then revealed about the function learned by the teacher, but in cases where
there are only a few possible classes we show that we can improve the transfer
by forcing the teacher to divide each class into many subclasses that it
invents during the supervised training. The student is then trained to match
the subclass probabilities. For datasets where there are known, natural
subclasses we demonstrate that the teacher learns similar subclasses and these
improve distillation. For clickthrough datasets where the subclasses are
unknown we demonstrate that subclass distillation allows the student to learn
faster and better.

Title: Statistical Guarantees of Generative Adversarial Networks for
  Distribution Estimation
Authors: Minshuo Chen, Wenjing Liao, Hongyuan Zha, Tuo Zhao
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved great success in
unsupervised learning. Despite the remarkable empirical performance, there are
limited theoretical understandings on the statistical properties of GANs. This
paper provides statistical guarantees of GANs for the estimation of data
distributions which have densities in a H\"{o}lder space. Our main result shows
that, if the generator and discriminator network architectures are properly
chosen (universally for all distributions with H\"{o}lder densities), GANs are
consistent estimators of the data distributions under strong discrepancy
metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance. To our best knowledge, this is the
first statistical theory of GANs for H\"{o}lder densities. In comparison with
existing works, our theory requires minimum assumptions on data distributions.
Our generator and discriminator networks utilize general weight matrices and
the non-invertible ReLU activation function, while many existing works only
apply to invertible weight matrices and invertible activation functions. In our
analysis, we decompose the error into a statistical error and an approximation
error by a new oracle inequality, which may be of independent interest.

Title: Adaptive Online Learning with Varying Norms
Authors: Ashok Cutkosky
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Given any increasing sequence of norms $\|\cdot\|_0,\dots,\|\cdot\|_{T-1}$,
we provide an online convex optimization algorithm that outputs points $w_t$ in
some domain $W$ in response to convex losses $\ell_t:W\to \mathbb{R}$ that
guarantees regret $R_T(u)=\sum_{t=1}^T \ell_t(w_t)-\ell_t(u)\le \tilde
O\left(\|u\|_{T-1}\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T \|g_t\|_{t-1,\star}^2}\right)$ where $g_t$
is a subgradient of $\ell_t$ at $w_t$. Our method does not require tuning to
the value of $u$ and allows for arbitrary convex $W$. We apply this result to
obtain new "full-matrix"-style regret bounds. Along the way, we provide a new
examination of the full-matrix AdaGrad algorithm, suggesting a better learning
rate value that improves significantly upon prior analysis. We use our new
techniques to tune AdaGrad on-the-fly, realizing our improved bound in a
concrete algorithm.

Title: Deep Gated Networks: A framework to understand training and
  generalisation in deep learning
Authors: Chandrashekar Lakshminarayanan and Amit Vikram Singh
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 18 Pages
\\
  Understanding the role of (stochastic) gradient descent in training and
generalisation of deep neural networks with ReLU activation has been the object
study in the recent past. In this paper, we make use of deep gated networks
(DGNs) as a framework to obtain insights about DNNs with ReLU activation. In
DGNs, a single neuronal unit has two components namely the pre-activation input
(equal to the inner product the weights of the layer and previous layer
outputs), and a gating value which belongs to $[0,1]$ and the output of the
neuronal unit is equal to the multiplication of pre-activation input and the
gating value. The standard DNN with ReLU gate, is a special case of the DGNs,
wherein the gating value is $1/0$ based on whether or not the pre-activation
input is positive or negative. We theoretically analyse and experiment with
several variants of DGNs, each variant suited to understand a particular aspect
of either training/generalisation in DNNs with ReLU activations. Our theory
throws light on two questions namely i) why increasing depth till a point helps
in training and ii) why increasing depth beyond a point hurts training? We also
present experimental evidence to show that gate adaptation is key for
generalisation.

Title: Taylorized Training: Towards Better Approximation of Neural Network
  Training at Finite Width
Authors: Yu Bai, Ben Krause, Huan Wang, Caiming Xiong, Richard Socher
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose \emph{Taylorized training} as an initiative towards better
understanding neural network training at finite width. Taylorized training
involves training the $k$-th order Taylor expansion of the neural network at
initialization, and is a principled extension of linearized training---a
recently proposed theory for understanding the success of deep learning.
  We experiment with Taylorized training on modern neural network
architectures, and show that Taylorized training (1) agrees with full neural
network training increasingly better as we increase $k$, and (2) can
significantly close the performance gap between linearized and full training.
Compared with linearized training, higher-order training works in more
realistic settings such as standard parameterization and large (initial)
learning rate. We complement our experiments with theoretical results showing
that the approximation error of $k$-th order Taylorized models decay
exponentially over $k$ in wide neural networks.

Title: Provable Self-Play Algorithms for Competitive Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yu Bai, Chi Jin
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Self-play, where the algorithm learns by playing against itself without
requiring any direct supervision, has become the new weapon in modern
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for achieving superhuman performance in practice.
However, the majority of exisiting theory in reinforcement learning only
applies to the setting where the agent plays against a fixed environment. It
remains largely open whether self-play algorithms can be provably effective,
especially when it is necessary to manage the exploration/exploitation
tradeoff.
  We study self-play in competitive reinforcement learning under the setting of
Markov games, a generalization of Markov decision processes to the two-player
case. We introduce a self-play algorithm---Value Iteration with Upper/Lower
Confidence Bound (VI-ULCB), and show that it achieves regret
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ after playing $T$ steps of the game. The regret
is measured by the agent's performance against a \emph{fully adversarial}
opponent who can exploit the agent's strategy at \emph{any} step. We also
introduce an explore-then-exploit style algorithm, which achieves a slightly
worse regret of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(T^{2/3})$, but is guaranteed to run in
polynomial time even in the worst case. To the best of our knowledge, our work
presents the first line of provably sample-efficient self-play algorithms for
competitive reinforcement learning.

  Normalization

  Fernandez-Granda
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Extraneous variables are variables that are irrelevant for a certain task,
but heavily affect the distribution of the available data. In this work, we
show that the presence of such variables can degrade the performance of
deep-learning models. We study three datasets where there is a strong influence
of known extraneous variables: classification of upper-body movements in stroke
patients, annotation of surgical activities, and recognition of corrupted
images. Models trained with batch normalization learn features that are highly
dependent on the extraneous variables. In batch normalization, the statistics
used to normalize the features are learned from the training set and fixed at
test time, which produces a mismatch in the presence of varying extraneous
variables. We demonstrate that estimating the feature statistics adaptively
during inference, as in instance normalization, addresses this issue, producing
normalized features that are more robust to changes in the extraneous
variables. This results in a significant gain in performance for different
network architectures and choices of feature statistics.

Title: Can graph neural networks count substructures?
Authors: Zhengdao Chen, Lei Chen, Soledad Villar, Joan Bruna
Categories: cs.LG cs.DM stat.ML
\\
  The ability to detect and count certain substructures in graphs is important
for solving many tasks on graph-structured data, especially in the contexts of
computational chemistry and biology as well as social network analysis.
Inspired by this, we propose to study the expressive power of graph neural
networks (GNNs) via their ability to count attributed graph substructures,
extending recent works that examine their power in graph isomorphism testing.
We distinguish between two types of substructure counting: matching-count and
containment-count, and establish mostly negative answers for a wide class of
GNN architectures. Specifically, we prove that Message Passing Neural Networks
(MPNNs), Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) and 2-Invariant Graph Networks (2-IGNs) cannot
perform matching-count of substructures consisting of 3 or more nodes, while
they can perform containment-count of star-shaped substructures. We also
provide partial results for k-WL and k-IGNs. We then conduct experiments that
support several of the theoretical results, and demonstrate that local
relational pooling strategies inspired by Murphy et al. (2019) are more
effective for substructure counting. In addition, we prove that WL and 2-IGNs
are equivalent in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs, partly answering an
open problem raised in Maron et al. (2019).

Title: Mean-Field Analysis of Two-Layer Neural Networks: Non-Asymptotic Rates
  and Generalization Bounds
Authors: Zixiang Chen and Yuan Cao and Quanquan Gu and Tong Zhang
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
Comments: 50 pages, 1 table
\\
  A recent line of work in deep learning theory has utilized the mean-field
analysis to demonstrate the global convergence of noisy (stochastic) gradient
descent for training over-parameterized two-layer neural networks. However,
existing results in the mean-field setting do not provide the convergence rate
of neural network training, and the generalization error bound is largely
missing. In this paper, we provide a mean-field analysis in a generalized
neural tangent kernel regime, and show that noisy gradient descent with weight
decay can still exhibit a "kernel-like" behavior. This implies that the
training loss converges linearly up to a certain accuracy in such regime. We

Title: SAT-Based ATL Satisfiability Checking
Authors: Magdalena Kacprzak, Artur Niewiadomski, Wojciech Penczek
Categories: cs.LO cs.MA
\\
  Synthesis of models and strategies is a very important problem in software
engineering. The main element here is checking the satisfiability of formulae
expressing the specification of a system to be implemented. This paper puts
forward a novel method for deciding the satisfiability of formulae of
Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL). The method presented expands on one for
CTL exploit ing SAT Modulo Monotonic Theories solvers. Similarly to the CTL
case, our approach appears to be very efficient. The experimental results show
that we can quickly test the satisfiability of large ATL formulae that have
been out of reach of the existing approaches.

Title: Means-fit effectivity
Authors: Yuri Gurevich
Categories: cs.LO math.LO
\\
  Historically, the notion of effective algorithm is closely related to the
Church-Turing thesis. But effectivity imposes no restriction on computation
time or any other resource; in that sense, it is incompatible with engineering
or physics. We propose a natural generalization of it, means-fitting
effectivity, which is effectivity relative to the (physical or abstract)
underlying machinery of the algorithm. This machinery varies from one class of
algorithms to another. Think for example of ruler-and-compass algorithms,
arithmetical algorithms, and Blum-Shub-Smale algorithms. We believe that
means-fitting effectivity is meaningful and useful independently of the
Church-Turing thesis. Means-fitting effectivity is definable, at least in the
theory of abstract state machines (ASMs). The definition elucidates original
effectivity as well. Familiarity with the ASM theory is not assumed. We tried
to make the paper self-contained.

  Gurevich (1988) conjectured that there is no logic for $\textsf{P}$ or for
$\textsf{NP}\cap \textsf{coNP}$. For the latter complexity class, he also
showed that the existence of a logic would imply that $\textsf{NP} \cap
\textsf{coNP}$ has a complete problem under polynomial time reductions. We show
that there is an oracle with respect to which $\textsf P$ does have a logic and
$\textsf P \ne\textsf{NP}$. We also show that a logic for $\textsf{NP} \cap
\textsf{coNP}$ follows from the existence of a complete problem and a further
assumption about canonical labelling. For intersection classes $\Sigma^p_n \cap
\Pi^p_n$ higher in the polynomial hierarchy, the existence of a logic is
equivalent to the existence of complete problems.

Title: Extensional proofs in a propositional logic modulo isomorphisms
Authors: Alejandro D\'iaz-Caro and Gilles Dowek
Categories: cs.LO
Comments: 14 pages plus a 5-pages appendix
\\
  System I is a proof language for a fragment of propositional logic where
isomorphic propositions, such as $A\wedge B$ and $B\wedge A$, or
$A\Rightarrow(B\wedge C)$ and $(A\Rightarrow B)\wedge(A\Rightarrow C)$ are made
equal. System I enjoys the strong normalization property. This is sufficient to
prove the existence of empty types, but not to prove the introduction property
(every normal closed term is an introduction). Moreover, a severe restriction
had to be made on the types of the variables in order to obtain the existence
of empty types. We show here that adding $\eta$-expansion rules to System I
permit to drop this restriction and to retrieve full introduction property.

Title: The Bang Calculus Revisited
Authors: Antonio Bucciarelli, Delia Kesner, Alejandro R\'ios, Andr\'es Viso
Categories: cs.LO cs.PL
\\
  Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV) is a programming paradigm subsuming both
Call-by-Name (CBN) and Call-by-Value (CBV) semantics. The paradigm was recently
modelled by means of the Bang Calculus, a term language connecting CBPV and
Linear Logic.
  This paper presents a revisited version of the Bang Calculus, called $\lambda
!$, enjoying some important properties missing in the original system. Indeed,
the new calculus integrates commutative conversions to unblock value redexes
while being confluent at the same time. A second contribution is related to
non-idempotent types. We provide a quantitative type system for our $\lambda
!$-calculus, and we show that the length of the (weak) reduction of a typed
term to its normal form \emph{plus} the size of this normal form is bounded by
the size of its type derivation. We also explore the properties of this type
system with respect to CBN/CBV translations. We keep the original CBN
translation from $\lambda$-calculus to the Bang Calculus, which preserves
normal forms and is sound and complete with respect to the (quantitative) type
system for CBN. However, in the case of CBV, we reformulate both the
translation and the type system to restore two main properties: preservation of
normal forms and completeness. Last but not least, the quantitative system is
refined to a \emph{tight} one, which transforms the previous upper bound on the
length of reduction to normal form plus its size into two independent
\emph{exact} measures for them.

Title: SPA: Verbal Interactions between Agents and Avatars in Shared Virtual
  Environments using Propositional Planning
Authors: Andrew Best, Sahil Narang, Dinesh Manocha
Categories: cs.MA cs.CL
\\
  We present a novel approach for generating plausible verbal interactions
between virtual human-like agents and user avatars in shared virtual
environments. Sense-Plan-Ask, or SPA, extends prior work in propositional
planning and natural language processing to enable agents to plan with
uncertain information, and leverage question and answer dialogue with other
agents and avatars to obtain the needed information and complete their goals.
The agents are additionally able to respond to questions from the avatars and
other agents using natural-language enabling real-time multi-agent multi-avatar
communication environments.
  Our algorithm can simulate tens of virtual agents at interactive rates
interacting, moving, communicating, planning, and replanning. We find that our
algorithm creates a small runtime cost and enables agents to complete their
goals more effectively than agents without the ability to leverage
natural-language communication. We demonstrate quantitative results on a set of
simulated benchmarks and detail the results of a preliminary user-study
conducted to evaluate the plausibility of the virtual interactions generated by
SPA. Overall, we find that participants prefer SPA to prior techniques in 84\%
of responses including significant benefits in terms of the plausibility of
natural-language interactions and the positive impact of those interactions.

Title: Evolution of a Complex Predator-Prey Ecosystem on Large-scale
  Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jun Yamada, John Shawe-Taylor, Zafeirios Fountas
Categories: cs.MA
Comments: 9 pages, 13 figures
\\
  Simulation of population dynamics is a central research theme in
computational biology, which contributes to understanding the interactions
between predators and preys. Conventional mathematical tools of this theme,
however, are incapable of accounting for several important attributes of such
systems, such as the intelligent and adaptive behavior exhibited by individual
agents. This unrealistic setting is often insufficient to simulate properties
of population dynamics found in the real-world. In this work, we leverage
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, and we propose a new model of
large-scale predator-prey ecosystems. Using different variants of our proposed
environment, we show that multi-agent simulations can exhibit key real-world
dynamical properties. To obtain this behavior, we firstly define a mating
mechanism such that existing agents reproduce new individuals bound by the
conditions of the environment. Furthermore, we incorporate a real-time
evolutionary algorithm and show that reinforcement learning enhances the
evolution of the agents' physical properties such as speed, attack and
resilience against attacks.

Title: Resilient Consensus via Weight Learning and Its Application in
  Fault-Tolerant Clock Synchronization
Authors: Jian Hou, Zhiyong Chen, ZhiyunLin, Mengfan Xiang
Categories: cs.MA
\\
  This paper addresses the distributed consensus problem in the presence of
faulty nodes. A novel weight learning algorithm is introduced such that neither
network connectivity nor a sequence of history records is required to achieve
resilient consensus. The critical idea is to dynamically update the interaction
weights among neighbors learnt from their credibility measurement. Basically,
we define a reward function that is inversely proportional to the distance to
its neighbor, and then adjust the credibility based on the reward derived at
the present step and the previous credibility. In such a way, the interaction
weights are updated at every step, which integrates the historic information
and degrades the influences from faulty nodes. Both fixed and stochastic
topologies are considered in this paper. Furthermore, we apply this novel
approach in clock synchronization problem. By updating the logical clock skew
and offset via the corresponding weight learning algorithms, respectively, the
logical clock synchronization is eventually achieved regardless of faulty
nodes. Simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the
strategy.

Title: Qatten: A General Framework for Cooperative Multiagent Reinforcement
  Learning
Authors: Yaodong Yang, Jianye Hao, Ben Liao, Kun Shao, Guangyong Chen, Wulong
  Liu, Hongyao Tang
Categories: cs.MA
\\
  In many real-world settings, a team of cooperative agents must learn to
coordinate their behavior with private observations and communication
constraints. Deep multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms (Deep-MARL) have
shown superior performance in these realistic and difficult problems but still
suffer from challenges. One branch is the multiagent value decomposition, which
decomposes the global shared multiagent Q-value $Q_{tot}$ into individual
Q-values $Q^{i}$ to guide individuals' behaviors. However, previous work
achieves the value decomposition heuristically without valid theoretical
groundings, where VDN supposes an additive formation and QMIX adopts an
implicit inexplicable mixing method. In this paper, for the first time, we
theoretically derive a linear decomposing formation from $Q_{tot}$ to each
$Q^{i}$. Based on this theoretical finding, we introduce the multi-head
attention mechanism to approximate each term in the decomposing formula with
theoretical explanations. Experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art MARL methods on the widely adopted StarCraft benchmarks across
different scenarios, and attention analysis is also investigated with sights.

Title: Q-value Path Decomposition for Deep Multiagent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yaodong Yang, Jianye Hao, Guangyong Chen, Hongyao Tang, Yingfeng Chen,
  Yujing Hu, Changjie Fan, Zhongyu Wei
Categories: cs.MA
\\
  Recently, deep multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has become a highly
active research area as many real-world problems can be inherently viewed as
multiagent systems. A particularly interesting and widely applicable class of
problems is the partially observable cooperative multiagent setting, in which a
team of agents learns to coordinate their behaviors conditioning on their
private observations and commonly shared global reward signals. One natural
solution is to resort to the centralized training and decentralized execution
paradigm. During centralized training, one key challenge is the multiagent
credit assignment: how to allocate the global rewards for individual agent
policies for better coordination towards maximizing system-level's benefits. In
this paper, we propose a new method called Q-value Path Decomposition (QPD) to
decompose the system's global Q-values into individual agents' Q-values. Unlike
previous works which restrict the representation relation of the individual
Q-values and the global one, we leverage the integrated gradient attribution
technique into deep MARL to directly decompose global Q-values along trajectory
paths to assign credits for agents. We evaluate QPD on the challenging
StarCraft II micromanagement tasks and show that QPD achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous multiagent
scenarios compared with existing cooperative MARL algorithms.

Title: A Time-Frequency Perspective on Audio Watermarking
Authors: Haijian Zhang
Categories: cs.MM eess.AS
\\
  Existing audio watermarking methods usually treat the host audio signals of a
function of time or frequency individually, while considering them in the joint
time-frequency (TF) domain has received less attention. This paper proposes an
audio watermarking framework from the perspective of TF analysis. The proposed
framework treats the host audio signal in the 2-dimensional (2D) TF plane, and
selects a series of patches within the 2D TF image. These patches correspond to
the TF clusters with minimum averaged energy, and are used to form the feature
vectors for watermark embedding. Classical spread spectrum embedding schemes
are incorporated in the framework. The feature patches that carry the
watermarks only occupy a few TF regions of the host audio signal, thus leading
to improved imperceptibility property. In addition, since the feature patches
contain a neighborhood area of TF representation of audio samples, the
correlations among the samples within a single patch could be exploited for
improved robustness against a series of processing attacks. Extensive
experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
system, as compared to its counterpart systems. The aim of this work is to shed
some light on the notion of audio watermarking in TF feature domain, which may
potentially lead us to more robust watermarking solutions against malicious
attacks.

Title: Large-Scale Discrete Fourier Transform on TPUs
Authors: Tianjian Lu, Yi-Fan Chen, Blake Hechtman, Tao Wang, and John Anderson
Categories: cs.MS cs.DC
\\
  In this work, we present a parallel algorithm for large-scale discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) on Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) clusters. The algorithm
is implemented in TensorFlow because of its rich set of functionalities for
scientific computing and simplicity in realizing parallel computing algorithms.
The DFT formulation is based on matrix multiplications between the input data
and the Vandermonde matrix. This formulation takes full advantage of TPU's
strength in matrix multiplications and allows nonuniformly sampled input data
without modifying the implementation. For the parallel computing, both the
input data and the Vandermonde matrix are partitioned and distributed across
TPU cores. Through the data decomposition, the matrix multiplications are kept
local within TPU cores and can be performed completely in parallel. The
communication among TPU cores is achieved through the one-shuffle scheme, with
which sending and receiving data takes place simultaneously between two
neighboring cores and along the same direction on the interconnect network. The
one-shuffle scheme is designed for the interconnect topology of TPU clusters,
requiring minimal communication time among TPU cores. Numerical examples are
used to demonstrate the high parallel efficiency of the large-scale DFT on
TPUs.

sources to the inverse source model, we develop a novel strategy for recovering

to an easy-to-implement phase retrieval formula. Mathematically, the stability
of the phase retrieval approach is rigorously justified. Then we employ the
Fourier method to deal with the multi-frequency inverse source problem with
recovered phase information. Finally, some two and three dimensional numerical
results are presented to demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Title: Provably Physical-Constraint-Preserving Discontinuous Galerkin Methods
  for Multidimensional Relativistic MHD Equations
Authors: Kailiang Wu and Chi-Wang Shu
Categories: math.NA astro-ph.IM cs.NA physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn physics.plasm-ph
\\
  We propose and analyze a class of robust, uniformly high-order accurate
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for multidimensional relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) on general meshes. A distinct feature of the
schemes is their physical-constraint-preserving (PCP) property, i.e., they are
proven to preserve the subluminal constraint on the fluid velocity and the
positivity of density, pressure, and specific internal energy. Developing PCP
high-order schemes for RMHD is highly desirable but remains a challenging task,
especially in the multidimensional cases, due to the inherent strong
nonlinearity in the constraints and the effect of the magnetic divergence-free
condition. Inspired by some crucial observations at the PDE level, we construct
the provably PCP schemes by using the locally divergence-free DG schemes of the
recently proposed symmetrizable RMHD equations as the base schemes, a limiting
technique to enforce the PCP property of the DG solutions, and the
strong-stability-preserving methods for time discretization. We rigorously
prove the PCP property by using a novel "quasi-linearization" approach to
handle the highly nonlinear physical constraints, technical splitting to offset
the influence of divergence error, and sophisticated estimates to analyze the
beneficial effect of the additional source term in the symmetrizable RMHD
system. Several two-dimensional numerical examples are provided to confirm the
PCP property and to demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness and robustness of
the proposed PCP schemes.

The resulting factorization is composed of $O(\log n)$ sparse factors, each

$O(n^{3/2}\log n)$ computation and $O(n\log n)$ memory resources. The proposed

bifurcation points; 2) an inflation technique is backed up when the adaptive
tracking fails; 3) Puiseux series interpolation is used to compute bifurcation
points; and 4)the tangent cone structure of the bifurcation point is
approximated numerically to compute solutions on different branches. Various
numerical examples of nonlinear systems are given to illustrate the efficiency

Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 28 pages, 2 figures
\\
  In this paper, we study the Crank-Nicolson method for temporal dimension and
the piecewise quadratic polynomial collocation method for spatial dimensions of
time-dependent nonlocal problems. The new theoretical results of such
discretization are that the proposed numerical method is unconditionally stable
and its global truncation error is of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\tau^2+h^{4-\gamma}\right)$ with $0<\gamma<1$, where $\tau$
and $h$ are the discretization sizes in the temporal and spatial dimensions
respectively. Also we develop the conjugate gradient squared method to solving
the resulting discretized nonsymmetric and indefinite systems arising from
time-dependent nonlocal problems including two-dimensional cases. By using
additive and multiplicative Cauchy kernels in non-local problems, structured
coefficient matrix-vector multiplication can be performed efficiently in the
conjugate gradient squared iteration. Numerical examples are given to
illustrate our theoretical results and demonstrate that the computational cost
of the proposed method is of $O(M \log M)$ operations where $M$ is the number
of collocation points.

  Anderson acceleration (AA) is a technique for accelerating the convergence of

and modify the norm in its internal optimization problem to the
$\mathcal{H}^{-s}$ norm, for some integer $s$, to bias it towards low-frequency
spectral content in the residual. We analyze the convergence of AA by
quantifying its improvement over Picard iteration. We find that AA based on the

from second-order elliptic differential operators and a Helmholtz recovery
problem.

  In this article we consider a Monte Carlo-based method to filter partially

with the multilevel particle filter (MLPF) approach of Jasra et al (2017). A
numerical comparison of our new approach with the MLPF, on a single processor,

Title: Millions of Perrin pseudoprimes including a few giants
Authors: Holger Stephan
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.NT
MSC-class: 11B37, 11B39, 11B50
\\
  The calculation of many and large Perrin pseudoprimes is a challenge. This is
mainly due to their rarity. Perrin pseudoprimes are one of the rarest known
pseudoprimes. In order to calculate many such large numbers, one needs not only
a fast algorithm but also an idea how most of them are structured to minimize
the amount of numbers one have to test. We present a quick algorithm for
testing Perrin pseudoprimes and develop some ideas on how Perrin pseudoprimes
might be structured. This leads to some conjectures that still need to be
proved. We think that we have found well over 90% of all 20-digit Perrin
pseudoprimes. Overall, we have been able to calculate over 9 million Perrin
pseudoprimes with our method, including some very large ones. The largest
number found has 3101 digits. This seems to be a breakthrough, compared to the

Title: Reconstructing the Optical Parameters of a Layered Medium with Optical
  Coherence Elastography
Authors: Peter Elbau, Leonidas Mindrinos, Leopold Veselka
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.AP
Comments: 18 pages, 1 figure
\\
  In this work we consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the optical
properties of a layered medium from an elastography measurement where optical
coherence tomography is used as the imaging method. We hereby model the sample
as a linear dielectric medium so that the imaging parameter is given by its
electric susceptibility, which is a frequency- and depth-dependent parameter.
Additionally to the layered structure (assumed to be valid at least in the
small illuminated region), we allow for small scatterers which we consider to
be randomly distributed, a situation which seems more realistic compared to
purely homogeneous layers. We then show that a unique reconstruction of the
susceptibility of the medium (after averaging over the small scatterers) can be
achieved from optical coherence tomography measurements for different
compression states of the medium.

  New superconvergent structures are introduced by the finite volume element
method (FVEM), which allow us to choose the superconvergent points freely. The
general orthogonal condition and the modified M-decomposition (MMD) technique

In addition, the relationships between the orthogonal condition and the

Title: A Constraint Driven Solution Model for Discrete Domains with a Case
  Study of Exam Timetabling Problems
Authors: Anuraganand Sharma
Categories: cs.NE
Comments: 41 pages in double space
\\
  Many science and engineering applications require finding solutions to
planning and optimization problems by satisfying a set of constraints. These
constraint problems (CPs) are typically NP-complete and can be formalized as
constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) or constraint optimization problems
(COPs). Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are good solvers for optimization
problems ubiquitous in various problem domains, however traditional operators
for EAs are 'blind' to constraints or generally use problem dependent objective
functions; as they do not exploit information from the constraints in search
for solutions. A variation of EA, Intelligent constraint handling evolutionary
algorithm (ICHEA), has been demonstrated to be a versatile constraints-guided
EA for continuous constrained problems in our earlier works in (Sharma and
Sharma, 2012) where it extracts information from constraints and exploits it in
the evolutionary search to make the search more efficient. In this paper ICHEA
has been demonstrated to solve benchmark exam timetabling problems, a classic
COP. The presented approach demonstrates competitive results with other
state-of-the-art approaches in EAs in terms of quality of solutions. ICHEA
first uses its inter-marriage crossover operator to satisfy all the given
constraints incrementally and then uses combination of traditional and enhanced
operators to optimize the solution. Generally CPs solved by EAs are problem
dependent penalty based fitness functions. We also proposed a generic
preference based solution model that does not require a problem dependent
fitness function, however currently it only works for mutually exclusive
constraints.

Title: Understanding the Automated Parameter Optimization on Transfer Learning
  for CPDP: An Empirical Study
Authors: Ke Li, Zilin Xiang, Tao Chen, Shuo Wang, Kay Chen Tan
Categories: cs.NE cs.SE
\\
  Data-driven defect prediction has become increasingly important in software
engineering process. Since it is not uncommon that data from a software project
is insufficient for training a reliable defect prediction model, transfer
learning that borrows data/knowledge from other projects to facilitate the
model building at the current project, namely cross-project defect prediction
(CPDP), is naturally plausible. Most CPDP techniques involve two major steps,
i.e., transfer learning and classification, each of which has at least one
parameter to be tuned to achieve their optimal performance. This practice fits
well with the purpose of automated parameter optimization. However, there is a
lack of thorough understanding about what are the impacts of automated
parameter optimization on various CPDP techniques. In this paper, we present
the first empirical study that looks into such impacts on 62 CPDP techniques,
13 of which are chosen from the existing CPDP literature while the other 49
ones have not been explored before. We build defect prediction models over 20
real-world software projects that are of different scales and characteristics.
Our findings demonstrate that: (1) Automated parameter optimization
substantially improves the defect prediction performance of 77\% CPDP
techniques with a manageable computational cost. Thus more efforts on this
aspect are required in future CPDP studies. (2) Transfer learning is of
ultimate importance in CPDP. Given a tight computational budget, it is more
cost-effective to focus on optimizing the parameter configuration of transfer
learning algorithms (3) The research on CPDP is far from mature where it is
"not difficult" to find a better alternative by making a combination of
existing transfer learning and classification techniques. This finding provides
important insights about the future design of CPDP techniques.

Title: Surrogate Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm for Medium Scale Expensive
  Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems
Authors: Xiaoran Ruan, Ke Li, Bilel Derbel, Arnaud Liefooghe
Categories: cs.NE
\\
  Building a surrogate model of an objective function has shown to be effective
to assist evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to solve real-world complex
optimisation problems which involve either computationally expensive numerical
simulations or costly physical experiments. However, their effectiveness mostly
focuses on small-scale problems with less than 10 decision variables. The
scalability of surrogate assisted EAs (SAEAs) have not been well studied yet.
In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process surrogate model assisted EA for
medium-scale expensive multi-objective optimisation problems with up to 50
decision variables. There are three distinctive features of our proposed SAEA.
First, instead of using all decision variables in surrogate model building, we
only use those correlated ones to build the surrogate model for each objective
function. Second, rather than directly optimising the surrogate objective
functions, the original multi-objective optimisation problem is transformed to
a new one based on the surrogate models. Last but not the least, a subset
selection method is developed to choose a couple of promising candidate
solutions for actual objective function evaluations thus to update the training
dataset. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is validated on benchmark
problems with 10, 20, 50 variables, comparing with three state-of-the-art
SAEAs.

Title: Novelty Producing Synaptic Plasticity
Authors: Anil Yaman, Giovanni Iacca, Decebal Constantin Mocanu, George
  Fletcher, Mykola Pechenizkiy
Categories: cs.NE cs.AI
\\
  A learning process with the plasticity property often requires reinforcement
signals to guide the process. However, in some tasks (e.g. maze-navigation), it
is very difficult (or impossible) to measure the performance of an agent (i.e.
a fitness value) to provide reinforcements since the position of the goal is
not known. This requires finding the correct behavior among a vast number of
possible behaviors without having the knowledge of the reinforcement signals.
In these cases, an exhaustive search may be needed. However, this might not be
feasible especially when optimizing artificial neural networks in continuous
domains. In this work, we introduce novelty producing synaptic plasticity
(NPSP), where we evolve synaptic plasticity rules to produce as many novel
behaviors as possible to find the behavior that can solve the problem. We
evaluate the NPSP on maze-navigation on deceptive maze environments that
require complex actions and the achievement of subgoals to complete. Our
results show that the search heuristic used with the proposed NPSP is indeed
capable of producing much more novel behaviors in comparison with a random
search taken as baseline.

Title: Joint Satellite Gateway Placement and Routing for Integrated

Authors: Nariman Torkzaban, Anousheh Gholami, Chrysa Papagianni, John S. Baras
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: 6 pages, Accepted at IEEE ICC 2020
\\
  With the increasing attention to the integrated satellite-terrestrial
networks (ISTNs), the satellite gateway placement problem becomes of paramount
importance. The resulting network performance may vary depending on the
different design strategies. In this paper, a joint satellite gateway placement
and routing strategy for the terrestrial network is proposed to minimize the
overall cost of gateway deployment and traffic routing, while adhering to the
average delay requirement for traffic demands. Although traffic routing and
gateway placement can be solved independently, the dependence between the
routing decisions for different demands makes it more realistic to solve an
aggregated model instead. We develop a mixed-integer linear program (MILP)
formulation for the problem. We relax the integrality constraints to achieve a
linear program (LP) which reduces time-complexity at the expense of a
sub-optimal solution. We further propose a variant of the proposed model to
balance the load between the selected gateways.

Title: A Virtual Network Customization Framework for Multicast Services in

Comments: Accepted to IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications
\\
  The paradigm of network function virtualization (NFV) with the support of
software defined networking (SDN) emerges as a promising approach for
customizing network services in fifth generation (5G) networks. In this paper,
a multicast service orchestration framework is presented, where joint traffic
routing and virtual network function (NF) placement are studied for
accommodating multicast services over an NFV-enabled physical substrate
network. First, we investigate a joint routing and NF placement problem for a
single multicast request accommodated over a physical substrate network, with
both single-path and multipath traffic routing. The joint problem is formulated
as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem to minimize the function
and link provisioning costs, under the physical network resource constraints,
flow conservation constraints, and NF placement rules; Second, we develop an
MILP formulation that jointly handles the static embedding of multiple service
requests over the physical substrate network, where we determine the optimal
combination of multiple services for embedding and their joint routing and
placement configurations, such that the aggregate throughput of the physical
substrate is maximized, while the function and link provisioning costs are
minimized. Since the presented problem formulations are NP-hard, low complexity
heuristic algorithms are proposed to find an efficient solution for both
single-path and multipath routing scenarios. Simulation results are presented
to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed heuristic
algorithms.

Title: UAV Trajectory Optimization for Time Constrained Applications

Categories: cs.NI math.OC
\\
  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are poised to revolutionize communications.
Utilizing their flexibility and fast deployment, we can deliver content in
congested areas or provide services in areas without infrastructure. In this
paper, we consider a UAV that flies over multiple locations and serves as many
users as possible within a given time duration. We study the problem of optimal
trajectory design, which we formulate as a mixed-integer linear program. For
large instances of the problem where the options for trajectories become
prohibitively many, we establish a connection to the orienteering problem, and
propose a corresponding greedy algorithm. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm is fast and yields solutions close to the optimal ones. The
proposed algorithm can be used for trajectory planning in strategic content
caching or tactical field operations.

Title: Message Type Identification of Binary Network Protocols using Continuous
  Segment Similarity

Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, to be published in IEEE International Conference
  on Computer Communications. INFOCOM. Beijing, China, 2020
\\
  Protocol reverse engineering based on traffic traces infers the behavior of
unknown network protocols by analyzing observable network messages. To perform
correct deduction of message semantics or behavior analysis, accurate message
type identification is an essential first step. However, identifying message
types is particularly difficult for binary protocols, whose structural features
are hidden in their densely packed data representation. We leverage the
intrinsic structural features of binary protocols and propose an accurate
method for discriminating message types.
  Our approach uses a similarity measure with continuous value range by
comparing feature vectors where vector elements correspond to the fields in a
message, rather than discrete byte values. This enables a better recognition of
structural patterns, which remain hidden when only exact value matches are
considered. We combine Hirschberg alignment with DBSCAN as cluster algorithm to
yield a novel inference mechanism. By applying novel autoconfiguration schemes,
we do not require manually configured parameters for the analysis of an unknown
protocol, as required by earlier approaches.
  Results of our evaluations show that our approach has considerable advantages
in message type identification result quality and also execution performance
over previous approaches.

Title: Robust Online Composition, Routing and NF Placement for NFV-enabled
  Services
Authors: Omar Alhussein and Weihua Zhuang
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: To appear in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications
\\
  Network function virtualization (NFV) fosters innovation in the networking
field and reduces the complexity involved in managing modern-day conventional
networks. Via NFV, the provisioning of a network service becomes more agile,
whereby virtual network functions can be instantiated on commodity servers and
data centers on demand. Network functions can be either mandatory or
best-effort. The former type is strictly necessary for the correctness of a
network service, whereas the latter is preferrable yet not necessary. In this
paper, we study the online provisioning of NFV-enabled network services. We
consider both unicast and multicast NFV-enabled services with multiple
mandatory and best-effort NF instances. We propose a primal-dual based online
approximation algorithm that allocates both processing and transmission
resources to maximize a profit function, subject to resource constraints on
physical links and NFV nodes. The online algorithm resembles a joint admission
mechanism and an online composition, routing and NF placement framework. The
online algorithm is derived from an offline formulation through a primal-dual
based analysis. Such analysis offers direct insights and a fundamental
understanding on the nature of the profit-maximization problem for NFV-enabled
services with multiple resource types.

Title: PBE-CC: Congestion Control via Endpoint-Centric, Physical-Layer
  Bandwidth Measurements
Authors: Yaxiong Xie, Fan Yi, Kyle Jamieson
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Wireless networks are becoming ever more sophisticated and overcrowded,
imposing the most delay, jitter, and throughput damage to end-to-end network
flows in today's internet. We therefore argue for fine-grained mobile
endpoint-based wireless measurements to inform a precise congestion control
algorithm through a well-defined API to the mobile's wireless physical layer.
Our proposed congestion control algorithm is based on Physical-Layer Bandwidth
measurements taken at the Endpoint (PBE-CC), and captures the latest 5G New
Radio innovations that increase wireless capacity, yet create abrupt rises and
falls in available wireless capacity that the PBE-CC sender can react to
precisely and very rapidly. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the
PBE measurement module on software-defined radios and the PBE sender and
receiver in C. An extensive performance evaluation compares PBE-CC head to head
against the leading cellular-aware and wireless-oblivious congestion control
protocols proposed in the research community and in deployment, in mobile and
static mobile scenarios, and over busy and quiet networks. Results show 6.3%
higher average throughput than BBR, while simultaneously reducing 95th
percentile delay by 1.8x.

  Evolving amendments of 802.11 standards feature a large set of physical and
MAC layer control parameters to support the increasing communication objectives
spanning application requirements and network dynamics. The significant growth
and penetration of various devices come along with a tremendous increase in the
number of applications supporting various domains and services which will
impose a never-before-seen burden on wireless networks. The challenge however,
is that each scenario requires a different wireless protocol functionality and
parameter setting to optimally determine how to tune these functionalities and
parameters to adapt to varying network scenarios. The traditional trial-error
approach of manual tuning of parameters is not just becoming difficult to
repeat but also sub-optimal for different networking scenarios. In this paper,
we describe how we can leverage a deep reinforcement learning framework to be
trained to learn the relation between different parameters in the physical and
MAC layer and show that how our learning-based approach could help us in

Title: Engineering and Experimentally Benchmarking a Container-based Edge
  Computing System

Categories: cs.NI
\\
  While edge computing is envisioned to superbly serve latency sensitive
applications, the implementation-based studies benchmarking its performance are
few and far between. To address this gap, we engineer a modular edge cloud
computing system architecture that is built on latest advances in
containerization techniques, including Kafka, for data streaming, Docker, as
application platform, and Firebase Cloud, as realtime database system. We
benchmark the performance of the system in terms of scalability, resource
utilization and latency by comparing three scenarios: cloud-only, edge-only and
combined edge-cloud. The measurements show that edge-only solution outperforms
other scenarios only when deployed with data located at one edge only, i.e.,
without edge computing wide data synchronization. In case of applications
requiring data synchronization through the cloud, edge-cloud scales around a
factor 10 times better than cloud-only, until certain number of concurrent
users in the system, and above this point, cloud-only scales better. In terms
of resource utilization, we observe that whereas the mean utilization increases
linearly with the number of user requests, the maximum values for the memory
and the network I/O heavily increase when with an increasing amount of data.

Title: Dynamic Multi-Modulation Allocation Scheme for Elastic Optical Networks
Authors: Lucas R. Costa and Andr\'e C. Drummond
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: 10 pages, 16 figures
\\
  In order to deal with the recent rapid increase in Internet traffic, a
transmission technology is required to enable the efficient use of the optical
fiber spectrum while offering flexibility in network bandwidth. To meet these
challenges, the emergence of Elastic Optical Networks (EON) has brought new
conceptions in the operation of optical networks, improving flexibility and
efficiency for the next generation core networks. In EON, traffic demands are
typically supported by allocating bandwidth-variable optical channels with
heterogeneous modulation formats in a spectral-efficient manner. Elastic
optical path networks require the routing, modulation level, and spectrum
allocation (RMLSA) to efficiently allocate optical spectrum resources to
optical paths. To address the RMLSA problem, Modulation Scheme approaches have
recently been proposed to allow the use of any routing and spectrum assignment
(RSA) algorithm to solve the RMLSA problem. In this paper, we propose a new
Modulation Scheme that enables the routing of traffic through dynamic
multi-modulation allocation in multiple hops to achieve blocking performance
improvement. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive
modulation scheme achieves a reduction in bandwidth blocking of up to two
orders of magnitude in an underloaded network scenario, and 86% with higher
loads, playing an important role in spectrum savings compared with the
literature schemes.

Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Wi-Fi link is unpredictable and it has never been easy to measure it
perfectly; there is always bound to be some bias. As wireless becomes the
medium of choice, it is useful to capture Wi-Fi traces in order to evaluate,
tune, and adapt the different applications and protocols. Several methods have
been used for the purpose of experimenting with different wireless conditions:
simulation, experimentation, and trace-driven emulation. In this paper, we
argue that trace-driven emulation is the most favourable approach. In the
absence of a trace-driven emulation tool for Wi-Fi, we evaluate the
state-of-the-art trace driven emulation tool for Cellular networks and we
identify issues for Wi-Fi: interference with concurrent traffic, interference
with its own traffic if measurements are done on both uplink and downlink
simultaneously , and packet loss. We provide a solid argument as to why this
tool falls short from effectively capturing Wi-Fi traces. The outcome of our
analysis guides us to propose a number of suggestions on how the existing tool
can be tweaked to accurately capture Wi-Fi traces.

specific arrival rate. Based on this model, we analyze the impact of different
configurations of ordering service on system performance to find out the
bottleneck. Moreover, a mathematical configuration selection approach is
proposed to determine the best configuration which can maximize the system
throughput. Finally, extensive experiments are performed on a running system to
validate the proposed model and approaches.

  Hardware platforms in high performance computing are constantly getting more
complex to handle even when considering multicore CPUs alone. Numerous features
and configuration options in the hardware and the software environment that are
relevant for performance are not even known to most application users or
developers. Microbenchmarks, i.e., simple codes that fathom a particular aspect
of the hardware, can help to shed light on such issues, but only if they are
well understood and if the results can be reconciled with known facts or
performance models. The insight gained from microbenchmarks may then be applied
to real applications for performance analysis or optimization. In this paper we
investigate two modern Intel x86 server CPU architectures in depth: Broadwell
EP and Cascade Lake SP. We highlight relevant hardware configuration settings
that can have a decisive impact on code performance and show how to properly
measure on-chip and off-chip data transfer bandwidths. The new victim L3 cache
of Cascade Lake and its advanced replacement policy receive due attention.
Finally we use DGEMM, sparse matrix-vector multiplication, and the HPCG
benchmark to make a connection to relevant application scenarios.

workload allocation can greatly affect the overall system performance. This
paper deals with AI-oriented medical workload generated in emergency rooms (ER)
or intensive care units (ICU) in metropolitan areas. The goal is to optimize
AI-workload allocation to cloud clusters, edge servers, and end devices so that
minimum response time can be achieved in life-saving emergency applications.
  In particular, we developed a new workload allocation method for the AI
workload in distributed cloud/edge/device computing systems. An efficient
scheduling and allocation strategy is developed in order to reduce the overall
response time to satisfy multi-patient demands. We apply several ICU AI
workloads from a comprehensive edge computing benchmark Edge AIBench. The
healthcare AI applications involved are short-of-breath alerts, patient
phenotype classification, and life-death threats. Our experimental results
demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness in real-life health-care and
emergency applications.

  According to the topological design theory and method of parallel mechanism
(PM) based on position and orientation characteristic (POC) equations, this
paper studied a 3-DOF translational PM that has three advantages, i.e., (i) it
consists of three fixed actuated prismatic joints, (ii) the PM has analytic
solutions to the direct and inverse kinematic problems, and (iii) the PM is of
partial motion decoupling property. Firstly, the main topological
characteristics, such as the POC, degree of freedom and coupling degree were
calculated for kinematic modeling. Thanks to these properties, the direct and
inverse kinematic problems can be readily solved. Further, the conditions of
the singular configurations of the PM were analyzed which corresponds to its
partial motion decoupling property.

\\
  This paper presents a hierarchical framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning
that acquires motor skills for a variety of push recovery and balancing
behaviors, i.e., ankle, hip, foot tilting, and stepping strategies. The policy
is trained in a physics simulator with realistic setting of robot model and
low-level impedance control that are easy to transfer the learned skills to
real robots. The advantage over traditional methods is the integration of
high-level planner and feedback control all in one single coherent policy
network, which is generic for learning versatile balancing and recovery motions
against unknown perturbations at arbitrary locations (e.g., legs, torso).
Furthermore, the proposed framework allows the policy to be learned quickly by
many state-of-the-art learning algorithms. By comparing our learned results to
studies of preprogrammed, special-purpose controllers in the literature,
self-learned skills are comparable in terms of disturbance rejection but with
additional advantages of producing a wide range of adaptive, versatile and
robust behaviors.

Title: Mobile Wireless Network Infrastructure on Demand

\\
  In this work, we introduce Mobile Wireless Infrastructure on Demand: a
framework for providing wireless connectivity to multi-robot teams via
autonomously reconfiguring ad-hoc networks. In many cases, previous multi-agent
systems either presumed on the availability of existing communication
infrastructure or were required to create a network in addition to completing
their objective. Instead our system explicitly assumes the responsibility of
creating and sustaining a wireless network capable of satisfying the end-to-end
communication requirements of a task team performing an arbitrary objective. To
accomplish this goal, we propose a joint optimization framework that alternates
between finding optimal network routes to support data flows between the task
agents and updating the configuration of the network team to improve
performance. We demonstrate our approach in a set of simulations in which a
fleet of UAVs provide connectivity to a set of task agents patrolling a
perimeter.

Title: DenseCAvoid: Real-time Navigation in Dense Crowds using Anticipatory
  Behaviors

  Rohan Chandra, and Dinesh Manocha
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We present DenseCAvoid, a novel navigation algorithm for navigating a robot
through dense crowds and avoiding collisions by anticipating pedestrian
behaviors. Our formulation uses visual sensors and a pedestrian trajectory
prediction algorithm to track pedestrians in a set of input frames and provide
bounding boxes that extrapolate the pedestrian positions in a future time. Our
hybrid approach combines this trajectory prediction with a Deep Reinforcement
Learning-based collision avoidance method to train a policy to generate
smoother, safer, and more robust trajectories during run-time. We train our
policy in realistic 3-D simulations of static and dynamic scenarios with
multiple pedestrians. In practice, our hybrid approach generalizes well to
unseen, real-world scenarios and can navigate a robot through dense crowds
(~1-2 humans per square meter) in indoor scenarios, including narrow corridors
and lobbies. As compared to cases where prediction was not used, we observe
that our method reduces the occurrence of the robot freezing in a crowd by up
to 48%, and performs comparably with respect to trajectory lengths and mean
arrival times to goal.

Title: Bayesian Residual Policy Optimization: Scalable Bayesian Reinforcement
  Learning with Clairvoyant Experts
Authors: Gilwoo Lee, Brian Hou, Sanjiban Choudhury, Siddhartha S. Srinivasa
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
\\
  Informed and robust decision making in the face of uncertainty is critical
for robots that perform physical tasks alongside people. We formulate this as
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning over latent Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
While Bayes-optimality is theoretically the gold standard, existing algorithms
do not scale well to continuous state and action spaces. Our proposal builds on
the following insight: in the absence of uncertainty, each latent MDP is easier
to solve. We first obtain an ensemble of experts, one for each latent MDP, and
fuse their advice to compute a baseline policy. Next, we train a Bayesian
residual policy to improve upon the ensemble's recommendation and learn to
reduce uncertainty. Our algorithm, Bayesian Residual Policy Optimization
(BRPO), imports the scalability of policy gradient methods and task-specific
expert skills. BRPO significantly improves the ensemble of experts and
drastically outperforms existing adaptive RL methods.

Title: Node Templates to improve Reusability and Modularity of Behavior Trees
Authors: Evgenii Safronov
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Presented at Behavior Trees for Robotics Systems (IROS 2019 Workshop)
\\
  Behavior Trees (BTs) got the robotics society attention not least thanks to
their modularity and reusability. The subtrees of BTs could be treated as
separate behaviors and therefore reused. We address the following research
question: do we exploit the full power of BT on these properties? We suggest to
generalise the idea of subtree reuse to "node templates" concept, which allows
to represent an arbitrary nodes collection. In addition, previously hardcoded
behaviors such as Node* and many Decorator nodes could be implemented in a
memory-based BT by node templates.

Title: Tactile Dexterity: Manipulation Primitives with Tactile Feedback
Authors: Francois R. Hogan, Jose Ballester, Siyuan Dong, Alberto Rodriguez
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  This paper develops closed-loop tactile controllers for dexterous
manipulation with dual-arm robotic palms. Tactile dexterity is an approach to
dexterous manipulation that plans for robot/object interactions that render
interpretable tactile information for control. We divide the role of tactile
control into two goals: 1) control the contact state between the end-effector
and the object (contact/no-contact, stick/slip, forces) and 2) control the
object state by tracking the object with a tactile-based state estimator.
  Key to this formulation is the decomposition of manipulation plans into
sequences of manipulation primitives with simple mechanics and efficient
planners. We consider the scenario of manipulating an object from an initial
pose to a target pose on a flat surface while correcting for external
perturbations and uncertainty in the initial pose of the object. We validate
the approach with an ABB YuMi dual-arm robot and demonstrate the ability of the
tactile controller to handle external perturbations.

manipulative actions. We focus on constructing a system where an agent
interacts with its surrounding environment by selecting the most appropriate
action at any time in a task-oriented fashion. Our main innovation is to split
the planning problem into: (1) an RRT-based planner operating in the
configuration space of the object, and (2) a local planner which generates a
sequence of actions in the joint space that will move the object between two
pairs of nodes in the RRT.

Title: Multi-object Monocular SLAM for Dynamic Environments
Authors: Gokul B. Nair, Swapnil Daga, Rahul Sajnani, Anirudha Ramesh, Junaid

Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
Comments: Manuscript under review
\\
  Multibody monocular SLAM in dynamic environments remains a long-standing
challenge in terms of perception and state estimation. Although theoretical
solutions exist, practice lags behind, predominantly due to the lack of robust
perceptual and predictive models of dynamic participants. The quintessential
challenge in Multi-body monocular SLAM in dynamic scenes stems from the problem
of unobservability as it is not possible to triangulate a moving object from a
moving monocular camera. Under restrictions of object motion the problem can be
solved, however even here one is entailed to solve for the single family
solution to the relative scale problem. The relative scale problem exists since
the dynamic objects that get reconstructed with the monocular camera have a
different scale vis a vis the scale space in which the stationary scene is
reconstructed. We solve this rather intractable problem by reconstructing
dynamic vehicles/participants in single view in metric scale through an object
SLAM pipeline. Further, we lift the ego vehicle trajectory obtained from
Monocular ORB-SLAM also into metric scales making use of ground plane features
thereby resolving the relative scale problem. We present a multi pose-graph
optimization formulation to estimate the pose and track dynamic objects in the
environment. This optimization helps us reduce the average error in
trajectories of multiple bodies in KITTI Tracking sequences. To the best of our
knowledge, our method is the first practical monocular multi-body SLAM system
to perform dynamic multi-object and ego localization in a unified framework in
metric scale.

Title: Autonomous Planning Based on Spatial Concepts to Tidy Up Home
  Environments with Service Robots

Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
Comments: Submitted
\\
  Tidy-up tasks by service robots in home environments are challenging in the
application of robotics because they involve various interactions with the
environment. In particular, robots are required not only to grasp, move, and
release various home objects, but also plan the order and positions where to
put them away. In this paper, we propose a novel planning method that can
efficiently estimate the order and positions of the objects to be tidied up
based on the learning of the parameters of a probabilistic generative model.
The model allows the robot to learn the distributions of co-occurrence
probability of objects and places to tidy up by using multimodal sensor
information collected in a tidied environment. Additionally, we develop an
autonomous robotic system to perform the tidy-up operation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in an experimental simulation that
reproduces the conditions of the Tidy Up Here task of the World Robot Summit
international robotics competition. The simulation results showed that the
proposed method enables the robot to successively tidy up several objects and
achieves the best task score compared to baseline tidy-up methods.

Title: Investigating the Importance of Shape Features, Color Constancy, Color
  Spaces and Similarity Measures in Open-Ended 3D Object Recognition
Authors: S. Hamidreza Kasaei, Maryam Ghorbani, Jits Schilperoort, Wessel van
  der Rest
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Despite the recent success of state-of-the-art 3D object recognition
approaches, service robots are frequently failed to recognize many objects in
real human-centric environments. For these robots, object recognition is a
challenging task due to the high demand for accurate and real-time response
under changing and unpredictable environmental conditions. Most of the recent
approaches use either the shape information only and ignore the role of color
information or vice versa. Furthermore, they mainly utilize the $L_n$ Minkowski
family functions to measure the similarity of two object views, while there are
various distance measures that are applicable to compare two object views. In
this paper, we explore the importance of shape information, color constancy,
color spaces, and various similarity measures in open-ended 3D object
recognition. Towards this goal, we extensively evaluate the performance of
object recognition approaches in three different configurations, including
\textit{color-only}, \textit{shape-only}, and \textit{ combinations of color
and shape}, in both offline and online settings. Experimental results
concerning scalability, memory usage, and object recognition performance show
that all of the \textit{combinations of color and shape} yields significant
improvements over the \textit{shape-only} and \textit{color-only} approaches.
The underlying reason is that color information is an important feature to
distinguish objects that have very similar geometric properties with different
colors and vice versa. Moreover, by combining color and shape information, we
demonstrate that the robot can learn new object categories from very few
training examples in a real-world setting.

Title: Learning to Grasp 3D Objects using Deep Residual U-Nets
Authors: Yikun Li, Lambert Schomaker, S. Hamidreza Kasaei
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Affordance detection is one of the challenging tasks in robotics because it
must predict the grasp configuration for the object of interest in real-time to
enable the robot to interact with the environment. In this paper, we present a
new deep learning approach to detect object affordances for a given 3D object.
The method trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn a set of
grasping features from RGB-D images. We named our approach \emph{Res-U-Net}
since the architecture of the network is designed based on U-Net structure and
residual network-styled blocks. It devised to be robust and efficient to
compute and use. A set of experiments has been performed to assess the
performance of the proposed approach regarding grasp success rate on simulated
robotic scenarios. Experiments validate the promising performance of the
proposed architecture on a subset of ShapeNetCore dataset and simulated robot
scenarios.

Title: Proficiency Aware Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Aerial and Ground
  Robot Teaming
Authors: Qifei Yu, Zhexin Shen, Yijiang Pang and Rui Liu
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  Mixed Cooperation and competition are the actual scenarios of deploying
multi-robot systems, such as the multi-UAV/UGV teaming for tracking criminal
vehicles and protecting important individuals. Types and the total number of
robot are all important factors that influence mixed cooperation quality. In
various real-world environments, such as open space, forest, and urban building
clusters, robot deployments have been influenced largely, as different robots
have different configurations to support different environments. For example,
UGVs are good at moving on the urban roads and reach the forest area while UAVs
are good at flying in open space and around the high building clusters.
However, it is challenging to design the collective behaviors for robot
cooperation according to the dynamic changes in robot capabilities, working
status, and environmental constraints. To solve this question, we proposed a
novel proficiency-aware mixed environment multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (Mix-DRL). In Mix-DRL, robot capability and environment factors are
formalized into the model to update the policy to model the nonlinear relations
between heterogeneous team deployment strategies and the real-world
environmental conditions. Mix-DRL can largely exploit robot capability while
staying aware of the environment limitations. With the validation of a
heterogeneous team with 2 UAVs and 2 UGVs in tasks, such as social security for
criminal vehicle tracking, the Mix-DRL's effectiveness has been evaluated with
$14.20\%$ of cooperation improvement. Given the general setting of Mix-DRL, it
can be used to guide the general cooperation of UAVs and UGVs for multi-target
tracking.

Title: An Intelligent Quaternion SVDCKF AHRS Estimation with Variable Adaptive

  Aimed at solving the problem of Attitude and Heading Reference System(AHRS)
in the complex and dynamic conditions for small-UAV, An intelligent Singular
Value Decomposition Cubature Kalman Filter(SVDCKF) combined with the Variable
Adaptive Methods(VAM) is proposed in this paper. Considering the nonlinearity
of quaternion AHRS model and non-positive definite of the state covariance
matrix, the SVDCKF algorithm is presented with both the SVD and CKF in order to
better obtain the filter accuracy and reliability. Additionally, there are the
different changes of the values in the accelerometer measurement resulting from
the complex flying conditions. Thus, the VAM is designed to deal with
three-axis values of the acceleration and tune intelligently the measurement
noise matrix Ra. Moreover, the heading measurement from the three-axis values
of the magnetometer is calculated according to the whether to use the
three-axis values of the acceleration in the special situations. The simulation
and experiment results demonstrate that the proposed filter algorithm has the
more excellent attitude solution accuracy and robustness than both the
Complementary Filter(CF) and the Error State Kalman Filter(ESKF).

Title: First-Order Tests for Toricity
Authors: Hamid Rahkooy and Thomas Sturm
Categories: cs.SC q-bio.MN
\\
  Motivated by problems arising with the symbolic analysis of steady state
ideals in Chemical Reaction Network Theory, we consider the problem of testing
whether the points in a complex or real variety with non-zero coordinates form
a coset of a multiplicative group. That property corresponds to Shifted
Toricity, a recent generalization of toricity of the corresponding polynomial
ideal. The key idea is to take a geometric view on varieties rather than an
algebraic view on ideals. Recently, corresponding coset tests have been
proposed for complex and for real varieties. The former combine numerous
techniques from commutative algorithmic algebra with Gr\"obner bases as the
central algorithmic tool. The latter are based on interpreted first-order logic
in real closed fields with real quantifier elimination techniques on the
algorithmic side. Here we take a new logic approach to both theories, complex
and real, and beyond. Besides alternative algorithms, our approach provides a
unified view on theories of fields and helps to understand the relevance and
interconnection of the rich existing literature in the area, which has been
focusing on complex numbers, while from a scientific point of view the
(positive) real numbers are clearly the relevant domain in chemical reaction
network theory. We apply prototypical implementations of our new approach to a
set of 129 models from the BioModels repository.

Title: Compatible rewriting of noncommutative polynomials for proving operator
  identities
Authors: Cyrille Chenavier, Clemens Hofstadler, Clemens G. Raab, Georg
  Regensburger
Categories: cs.SC math.RT
Comments: 17 pages
\\
  The goal of this paper is to prove operator identities using equalities
between noncommutative polynomials. In general, a polynomial expression is not
valid in terms of operators, since it may not be compatible with domains and
codomains of the corresponding operators. Recently, some of the authors
introduced a framework based on labelled quivers to rigorously translate
polynomial identities to operator identities. In the present paper, we extend
and adapt the framework to the context of rewriting and polynomial reduction.
We give a sufficient condition on the polynomials used for rewriting to ensure
that standard polynomial reduction automatically respects domains and codomains
of operators. Finally, we adapt the noncommutative Buchberger procedure to
compute additional compatible polynomials for rewriting. In the package
OperatorGB, we also provide an implementation of the concepts developed.

Title: Sparse Polynomial Interpolation Based on Diversification
Authors: Qiao-Long Huang
Categories: cs.SC math.RA
Comments: 17 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables
ACM-class: I.1.2
\\
  We consider the problem of interpolating a sparse multivariate polynomial
over a finite field, represented with a black box. Building on the algorithm of
Ben-Or and Tiwari for interpolating polynomials over rings with characteristic
zero, we develop a new Monte Carlo algorithm over the finite field by doing
additional probes. To interpolate a polynomial $f\in F_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ with a
partial degree bound $D$ and a term bound $T$, our new algorithm costs
$O^\thicksim(nT\log ^2q+nT\sqrt{D}\log q)$ bit operations and uses $2(n+1)T$
probes to the black box. If $q\geq O(nT^2D)$, it has constant success rate to
return the correct polynomial. Compared with previous algorithms over general
finite field, our algorithm has better complexity in the parameters $n,T,D$ and
is the first one to achieve the complexity of fractional power about $D$, while
keeping linear in $n,T$. A key technique is a randomization which makes all
coefficients of the unknown polynomial distinguishable, producing a diverse
polynomial. This approach, called diversification, was proposed by Giesbrecht
and Roche in 2011. Our algorithm interpolates each variable independently using
$O(T)$ probes, and then uses the diversification to correlate terms in
different images. At last, we get the exponents by solving the discrete
logarithms and obtain coefficients by solving a linear system. We have
implemented our algorithm in Maple. Experimental results shows that our
algorithm can applied to sparse polynomials with large degree. We also analyze
the success rate of the algorithm.

Title: Sparse Polynomial Interpolation Based on Derivative
Authors: Qiao-Long Huang
Categories: cs.SC math.RA
Comments: 15 pages
ACM-class: I.1.2
\\
  In this paper, we propose two new interpolation algorithms for sparse
multivariate polynomials represented by a straight-line program(SLP). Both of
our algorithms work over any finite fields $F_q$ with large characteristic. The
first one is a Monte Carlo randomized algorithm. Its arithmetic complexity is
linear in the number $T$ of non-zero terms of $f$, in the number $n$ of
variables. If $q$ is $O((nTD)^{(1)})$, where $D$ is the partial degree bound,
then our algorithm has better complexity than other existing algorithms. The
second one is a deterministic algorithm. It has better complexity than existing
deterministic algorithms over a field with large characteristic. Its arithmetic
complexity is quadratic in $n,T,\log D$, i.e., quadratic in the size of the
sparse representation. And we also show that the complexity of our
deterministic algorithm is the same as the one of deterministic zero-testing of
Bl\"{a}ser et al. for the polynomial given by an SLP over finite field (for
large characteristic).

Title: Robust Deep Learning Framework For Predicting Respiratory Anomalies and
  Diseases
Authors: Lam Pham, Ian McLoughlin, Huy Phan, Minh Tran, Truc Nguyen, Ramaswamy

Categories: cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS
\\
  This paper presents a robust deep learning framework developed to detect
respiratory diseases from recordings of respiratory sounds. The complete
detection process firstly involves front end feature extraction where
recordings are transformed into spectrograms that convey both spectral and
temporal information. Then a back-end deep learning model classifies the
features into classes of respiratory disease or anomaly. Experiments, conducted
over the ICBHI benchmark dataset of respiratory sounds, evaluate the ability of
the framework to classify sounds. Two main contributions are made in this
paper. Firstly, we provide an extensive analysis of how factors such as
respiratory cycle length, time resolution, and network architecture, affect
final prediction accuracy. Secondly, a novel deep learning based framework is
proposed for detection of respiratory diseases and shown to perform extremely
well compared to state of the art methods.

Title: On Cross-Corpus Generalization of Deep Learning Based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Ashutosh Pandey and DeLiang Wang
Categories: cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: submitted to IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language
  Processing
\\
  In recent years, supervised approaches using deep neural networks (DNNs) have
become the mainstream for speech enhancement. It has been established that DNNs
generalize well to untrained noises and speakers if trained using a large
number of noises and speakers. However, we find that DNNs fail to generalize to
new speech corpora in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In this work,
we establish that the lack of generalization is mainly due to the channel
mismatch between the trained and untrained corpus. Additionally, we observe
that traditional channel normalization techniques are not effective in
improving cross-corpus generalization. Further, we evaluate publicly available
datasets that are promising for generalization. We find one particular corpus
to be significantly better than others. Finally, we find that using a smaller
frame shift in short-time processing of speech can significantly improve
cross-corpus generalization. The proposed techniques to address cross-corpus
generalization include channel normalization, better training corpus, and
smaller frame shift in short-time Fourier transform (STFT). These techniques
together improve the objective intelligibility and quality scores on untrained
corpora significantly.

Title: SLACC: Simion-based Language Agnostic Code Clones
Authors: George Mathew, Chris Parnin, Kathryn T Stolee

\\
  Successful cross-language clone detection could enable researchers and
developers to create robust language migration tools, facilitate learning
additional programming languages once one is mastered, and promote reuse of
code snippets over a broader codebase. However, identifying cross-language
clones presents special challenges to the clone detection problem. A lack of
common underlying representation between arbitrary languages means detecting
clones requires one of the following solutions: 1) a static analysis framework
replicated across each targeted language with annotations matching language
features across all languages, or 2) a dynamic analysis framework that detects
clones based on runtime behavior.
  In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of the latter solution, a
dynamic analysis approach called SLACC for cross-language clone detection. Like
prior clone detection techniques, we use input/output behavior to match clones,
though we overcome limitations of prior work by amplifying the number of inputs
and covering more data types; and as a result, achieve better clusters than
prior attempts. Since clusters are generated based on input/output behavior,
SLACC supports cross-language clone detection. As an added challenge, we target
a static typed language, Java, and a dynamic typed language, Python. Compared
to HitoshiIO, a recent clone detection tool for Java, SLACC retrieves 6 times
as many clusters and has higher precision (86.7% vs. 30.7%).
  This is the first work to perform clone detection for dynamic typed languages
(precision = 87.3%) and the first to perform clone detection across languages
that lack a common underlying representation (precision = 94.1%). It provides a
first step towards the larger goal of scalable language migration tools.

Title: Learning from, Understanding, and Supporting DevOps Artifacts for Docker
Authors: Jordan Henkel, Christian Bird, Shuvendu K. Lahiri, Thomas Reps
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: Published in ICSE'2020
DOI: 10.1145/3377811.3380406
\\
  With the growing use of DevOps tools and frameworks, there is an increased
need for tools and techniques that support more than code. The current
state-of-the-art in static developer assistance for tools like Docker is
limited to shallow syntactic validation. We identify three core challenges in
the realm of learning from, understanding, and supporting developers writing
DevOps artifacts: (i) nested languages in DevOps artifacts, (ii) rule mining,
and (iii) the lack of semantic rule-based analysis. To address these challenges
we introduce a toolset, binnacle, that enabled us to ingest 900,000 GitHub
repositories.
  Focusing on Docker, we extracted approximately 178,000 unique Dockerfiles,
and also identified a Gold Set of Dockerfiles written by Docker experts. We
addressed challenge (i) by reducing the number of effectively uninterpretable
nodes in our ASTs by over 80% via a technique we call phased parsing. To
address challenge (ii), we introduced a novel rule-mining technique capable of
recovering two-thirds of the rules in a benchmark we curated. Through this
automated mining, we were able to recover 16 new rules that were not found
during manual rule collection. To address challenge (iii), we manually
collected a set of rules for Dockerfiles from commits to the files in the Gold
Set. These rules encapsulate best practices, avoid docker build failures, and
improve image size and build latency. We created an analyzer that used these
rules, and found that, on average, Dockerfiles on GitHub violated the rules
five times more frequently than the Dockerfiles in our Gold Set. We also found
that industrial Dockerfiles fared no better than those sourced from GitHub.
  The learned rules and analyzer in binnacle can be used to aid developers in
the IDE when creating Dockerfiles, and in a post-hoc fashion to identify issues
in, and to improve, existing Dockerfiles.

Title: Importance-Driven Deep Learning System Testing

Comments: 12 pages
\\
  Deep Learning (DL) systems are key enablers for engineering intelligent
applications due to their ability to solve complex tasks such as image
recognition and machine translation. Nevertheless, using DL systems in safety-
and security-critical applications requires to provide testing evidence for
their dependable operation. Recent research in this direction focuses on
adapting testing criteria from traditional software engineering as a means of
increasing confidence for their correct behaviour. However, they are inadequate
in capturing the intrinsic properties exhibited by these systems. We bridge
this gap by introducing DeepImportance, a systematic testing methodology
accompanied by an Importance-Driven (IDC) test adequacy criterion for DL
systems. Applying IDC enables to establish a layer-wise functional
understanding of the importance of DL system components and use this
information to assess the semantic diversity of a test set. Our empirical
evaluation on several DL systems, across multiple DL datasets and with
state-of-the-art adversarial generation techniques demonstrates the usefulness
and effectiveness of DeepImportance and its ability to support the engineering
of more robust DL systems.

Title: Automating App Review Response Generation
Authors: Cuiyun Gao, Jichuan Zeng, Xin Xia, David Lo, Michael R. Lyu, Irwin

Categories: cs.SE
Comments: 12 pages, accepted by ASE'19
\\
  Previous studies showed that replying to a user review usually has a positive
effect on the rating that is given by the user to the app. For example, Hassan
et al. found that responding to a review increases the chances of a user
updating their given rating by up to six times compared to not responding. To
alleviate the labor burden in replying to the bulk of user reviews, developers
usually adopt a template-based strategy where the templates can express
appreciation for using the app or mention the company email address for users
to follow up. However, reading a large number of user reviews every day is not
an easy task for developers. Thus, there is a need for more automation to help
developers respond to user reviews.
  Addressing the aforementioned need, in this work we propose a novel approach
RRGen that automatically generates review responses by learning knowledge
relations between reviews and their responses. RRGen explicitly incorporates
review attributes, such as user rating and review length, and learns the
relations between reviews and corresponding responses in a supervised way from
the available training data. Experiments on 58 apps and 309,246 review-response
pairs highlight that RRGen outperforms the baselines by at least 67.4% in terms
of BLEU-4 (an accuracy measure that is widely used to evaluate dialogue
response generation systems). Qualitative analysis also confirms the
effectiveness of RRGen in generating relevant and accurate responses.

Title: FM4SN: A Feature-Oriented Approach to Tenant-Driven Customization of
  Multi-Tenant Service Networks
Authors: Indika Kumara, Jun Han, Alan Colman, Willem-Jan van den Heuvel, Damian
  Tamburri
Categories: cs.SE
DOI: 10.1109/SCC.2019.00028
\\
  In a multi-tenant service network, multiple virtual service networks (VSNs),
one for each tenant, coexist on the same service network. The tenants
themselves need to be able to dynamically create and customize their own VSNs
to support their initial and changing functional and performance requirements.
These tasks are problematic for them due to: 1) platform-specific knowledge
required, 2) the existence of a large number of customization options and their
dependencies, and 3) the complexity in deriving the right subset of options. In
this paper, we present an approach to enable and simplify the tenant-driven
customization of multi-tenant service networks. We propose to use feature as a
high-level customization abstraction. A regulated collaboration among a set of
services in the service network realizes a feature. A software engineer can
design a customization policy for a service network using the mappings between
features and collaborations, and enact the policy with the controller of the
service network. A tenant can then specify the requirements for its VSN as a
set of functional and performance features. A customization request from a
tenant triggers the customization policy of the service network, which
(re)configures the corresponding VSN at runtime to realize the selected
features. We show the feasibility of our approach with two case studies and a
performance evaluation.

  We present a dataset of open source software developed mainly by enterprises
rather than volunteers. This can be used to address known generalizability
concerns, and, also, to perform research on open source business software
development. Based on the premise that an enterprise's employees are likely to
contribute to a project developed by their organization using the email account
provided by it, we mine domain names associated with enterprises from open data
sources as well as through white- and blacklisting, and use them through three
heuristics to identify 17,252 enterprise GitHub projects. We provide these as a
dataset detailing their provenance and properties. A manual evaluation of a
dataset sample shows an identification accuracy of 89%. Through an exploratory
data analysis we found that projects are staffed by a plurality of enterprise
insiders, who appear to be pulling more than their weight, and that in a small
percentage of relatively large projects development happens exclusively through
enterprise insiders.

Title: E-APR: Mapping the Effectiveness of Automated Program Repair
Authors: Aldeida Aleti and Matias Martinez
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Automated Program Repair (APR) is a fast growing area with many new
techniques being developed to tackle one of the most challenging software
engineering problems. APR techniques have shown promising results, giving us
hope that one day it will be possible for software to repair itself. Existing
techniques, however, are only effective at repairing certain kinds of bugs. For
example, prior studies have shown that the effectiveness of APR techniques is
correlated with bug complexity, with most techniques producing patches for easy
bugs. This is a useful explanation that can help researchers improve APR
techniques. In this paper, we extend these explanations towards a more granular
level, with the aim of assessing the strengths and weaknesses of existing APR
techniques. To this end, we introduce e-APR, which is a new framework for
explaining the effectiveness of APR techniques. E-APR takes as input a set of
buggy programs, their features and a set of APR techniques, and generates the
footprints of APR techniques, i.e., the regions of the instance space of buggy
programs in which good performance is expected from each technique. In this
paper, we consider features of the whole program, such as the number of methods
and the depth of the inheritance tree, and more specific features of the buggy
part of the program, such as the number of Boolean operators in an if
statement. The e-APR framework performs machine learning and dimensionality
reduction over the feature space to identify the most significant features that
have an impact on the effectiveness of APR. The footprints of APR techniques
are presented both in a visual and numerical way, which enables us to determine
their strengths and weaknesses and how different the APR techniques are from
each-other. Finally, e-APR could be integrated to repair infrastructures and
repair bots to choose, given a buggy program, the most suitable APR tool.

Title: Building Implicit Vector Representations of Individual Coding Style
Authors: Vladimir Kovalenko, Egor Bogomolov, Timofey Bryksin, Alberto Bacchelli
Categories: cs.SE cs.SI
\\
  With the goal of facilitating team collaboration, we propose a new approach
to building vector representations of individual developers by capturing their
individual contribution style, or coding style. Such representations can find
use in the next generation of software development team collaboration tools,
for example by enabling the tools to track knowledge transfer in teams. The key
idea of our approach is to avoid using explicitly defined metrics of coding
style and instead build the representations through training a model for
authorship recognition and extracting the representations of individual
developers from the trained model. By empirically evaluating the output of our
approach, we find that implicitly built individual representations reflect some
properties of team structure: developers who report learning from each other
are represented closer to each other.

Title: Line Hypergraph Convolution Network: Applying Graph Convolution for
  Hypergraphs
Authors: Sambaran Bandyopadhyay, Kishalay Das, M. Narasimha Murty
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  Network representation learning and node classification in graphs got
significant attention due to the invent of different types graph neural
networks. Graph convolution network (GCN) is a popular semi-supervised
technique which aggregates attributes within the neighborhood of each node.
Conventional GCNs can be applied to simple graphs where each edge connects only
two nodes. But many modern days applications need to model high order
relationships in a graph. Hypergraphs are effective data types to handle such
complex relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to apply
graph convolution on hypergraphs with variable hyperedge sizes. We use the
classical concept of line graph of a hypergraph for the first time in the
hypergraph learning literature. Then we propose to use graph convolution on the
line graph of a hypergraph. Experimental analysis on multiple real world
network datasets shows the merit of our approach compared to state-of-the-arts.

Title: Scalable Vehicle Team Continuum Deformation Coordination with Eigen
  Decomposition
Authors: Hossein Rastgoftar, Ella M. Atkins, Ilya Kolmanovsky
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures
\\
  The continuum deformation leader-follower cooperative control strategy models
vehicles in a multi-agent system as particles of a deformable body. A desired
continuum deformation is defined based on leaders' trajectories and acquired by
followers in real-time through local communication. The existing continuum
deformation theory requires followers to be placed inside the convex simplex
defined by leaders. This constraint is relaxed in this paper. We prove that
under suitable assumptions any (n+1)(n=1,2,3) vehicles forming an n-D simplex
can be selected as leaders while followers, arbitrarily positioned inside or
outside the leading simplex, can acquire a desired continuum deformation in a
decentralized fashion. The paper's second contribution is to assign a
one-to-one mapping between leaders' smooth trajectories and homogeneous
deformation features obtained by continuum deformation eigen-decomposition.
Therefore, a safe and smooth continuum deformation coordination can be planned
either by shaping homogeneous transformation features or by choosing
appropriate leader trajectories. This is beneficial to efficiently plan and
guarantee inter-agent collision avoidance in a large-scale group. A simulation
case study is reported in which a virtual convex simplex contains a quadcopter
vehicle team at any time t; A* search is applied to optimize quadcopter team
continuum deformation in an obstacle-laden environment.

Title: Adaptive Output Consensus For Multi-Agent Systems With An Uncertain
  Leader
Authors: Shimin Wang and Xiangyu Meng
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In this technical note, the leader-following output consensus problem is
studied for a class of multi-agent systems subject to an uncertain leader
system. The leader system is described by the sum of sinusoids with unknown
amplitudes, frequencies and phases. A distributed adaptive observer is
established for each agent to estimate the state of the leader even if the
agent cannot directly access the output signal of the leader. It is shown that
if the output signal of the leader is sufficiently rich, all agents can learn
its frequencies based on the distributed adaptive observer. Utilizing the
estimated state of the leader and its output frequencies, a distributed
adaptive
  control law is synthesized for each agent to solve the leader-following
output consensus problem.

Title: Noticeability Versus Impact in Traffic Signal Tampering
Authors: Bilal Thonnam Thodi, Timothy Mulumba, Saif Eddin Jabari
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper investigates the vulnerability of urban traffic networks to
cyber-attacks on traffic lights. We model traffic signal tampering as a
bi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously seeks to reduce vehicular
throughput in the network over time (maximize impact) while introducing minimal
changes to network signal timings (minimize noticeability). We represent the
Spatio-temporal traffic dynamics as a static network flow problem on a
time-expanded graph. This allows us to reduce the (non-convex) attack problem
to a tractable form, which can be solved using traditional techniques used to
solve linear network programming problems. We show that minor but objective
adjustments in the signal timings over time can severely impact traffic
conditions at the network level. We investigate network vulnerability by
examining the concavity of the Pareto-optimal frontier obtained by solving the
bi-objective attack problem. Numerical experiments are carried to illustrate
the types of insights that can be extracted from the Pareto-optimal frontier.
For instance, our experiments suggest that the vulnerability of a traffic
network to signal tampering is independent of the demand levels.

  Lower leg prostheses could improve the lives of amputees by increasing
comfort and reducing energy to locomote, but currently the control methods make
it difficult to modulate behaviors based upon the human's experience. This
paper describes the first steps toward learning complex controllers for dynamic
robotic assistive devices. We provide the first example of behavioral cloning
to control a powered transfemoral knee and ankle prostheses using a Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) based recurrent neural network (RNN) running on a custom
hardware accelerator that exploits temporal sparsity. The RNN is trained on
data collected from the original prosthesis controller. The RNN inference is
realized by a novel EdgeDRNN accelerator in real-time. Experimental results
show that the RNN can model the dynamic system with impacts and replace the
nominal PD controller to realize end-to-end control of the AMPRO3 prosthetic
leg walking on flat ground and unforeseen slopes with comparable tracking
accuracy. EdgeRNN computes the RNN about 240 times faster than real time,
opening the possibility of more complex future optimizations. Implementing an
RNN on this real-time dynamic system with impacts sets the ground work to
incorporate other learned elements of the human-prosthesis system into
prosthesis control.

\\
  Research on fault diagnosis on highly nonlinear dynamic systems such as the
engine of a vehicle have garnered huge interest in recent years, especially
with the automotive industry heading towards self-driving technologies. This
article presents a novel opensource simulation testbed of a turbocharged spark
ignited (TCSI) petrol engine system for testing and evaluation of residuals
generation and fault diagnosis methods. Designed and developed using
Matlab/Simulink, the user interacts with the testbed using a GUI interface,
where the engine can be realistically simulated using industrial-standard
driving cycles such as the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedures
(WLTP), the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the Extra-Urban Driving Cycle
(EUDC), and EPA Federal Test Procedure (FTP-75). The engine is modeled using
the mean value engine model (MVEM) and is controlled using a
proportional-integral (PI)-based boost controller. The GUI interface also
allows the user to induce one of the 11 faults of interest, so that their
effects on the performance of the engine are better understood. This minimizes
the risk of causing permanent damages to the engine and shortening its
lifespan, should the tests be conducted onto the actual physical system. This
simulation testbed will serve 16 as an excellent platform where researchers can
generate critical data to develop and compare current and future research
methods for fault diagnosis of automotive engine systems.

  Although state estimation in networked control systems is a fundamental
problem, few efforts have been made to study distributed state estimation via
multiple access channels (MAC's). In this article, we give a characterization
of the zero-error capacity region of an M-input, single-output MAC at any
finite block-length. To this end, nonstochastic information-theoretic tools are
used to derive the converse and achievability proofs. Next, a tight condition
to be able to achieve uniformly bounded state estimation errors over such a MAC
is provided. The obtained condition establishes a connection between the
intrinsic topological entropies of the linear systems and the zero-error
capacity region of the MAC.

Title: Distributed Control Enforcing Group Sparsity in Smart Grids
Authors: Philipp Sauerteig and Yuning Jiang and Boris Houska and Karl Worthmann
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  In modern smart grids, charging of local energy storage devices is
coordinated on a residential level to compensate the volatile aggregated power
demand on the time interval of interest. However, this results in a perpetual
usage of all batteries which reduces their lifetime. We enforce group sparsity
by using an $\ell_{p,q}$-regularization on the control to counteract this
phenomenon. This leads to a non-smooth convex optimization problem, for which
we propose a tailored Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers algorithm. We
elaborate further how to embed it in a Model Predictive Control framework. We
show that the proposed scheme yields sparse control while achieving reasonable
overall peak shaving by numerical simulations.

Title: Adaptive super-twisting observer for fault reconstruction in
  electro-hydraulic systems

\\
  An adaptive-gain super-twisting sliding mode observer is proposed for fault
reconstruction in electro-hydraulic servo systems (EHSS) receiving bounded
perturbations with unknown bounds. The objective is to address challenging
problems in classic sliding mode observers: chattering effect, conservatism of
observer gains, strong condition on the distribution of faults and
uncertainties. In this paper, the proposed super-twisting sliding mode observer
relaxes the condition on the distribution of uncertainties and faults, and the
gain adaptation law leads to eliminate observer gain overestimation and
attenuate chattering effects. After using the equivalent output-error-injection
feature of sliding mode techniques, a fault reconstruction strategy is
proposed. The experimental results are presented, confirming the effectiveness
of the proposed adaptive super-twisting observer for precise fault
reconstruction in electro-hydraulic servo systems.

Title: On stability of linear dynamic systems with hysteresis feedback
Authors: Michael Ruderman
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 9 figures
\\
  The stability of linear dynamic systems with hysteresis in feedback is
considered. While the absolute stability for memoryless nonlinearities (known
as Lure's problem) can be proved by the well-known circle criterion, the
multivalued rate-independent hysteresis poses significant challenges for
feedback systems, especially for proof of convergence to an equilibrium state
correspondingly set. The dissipative behavior of clockwise input-output
hysteresis is considered with two boundary cases of energy losses at reversal
cycles. For upper boundary cases of maximal (parallelogram shape) hysteresis
loop, an equivalent transformation of the closed-loop system is provided. This
allows for the application of the circle criterion of absolute stability.
Invariant sets as a consequence of hysteresis are discussed. Several numerical
examples are demonstrated, including a feedback-controlled double-mass harmonic
oscillator with hysteresis and one stable and one unstable poles configuration.

Title: Secure Networked Control of Large-Scale Cyberphysical Systems Using
  Cryptographic Techniques
Authors: Yamin Yan, Zhiyong Chen, Vijay Varadharajan
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 13 pages, 5 figures
\\
  This paper aims to create a secure environment for networked control systems
composed of multiple dynamic entities and computational control units via
networking, in the presence of disclosure attacks. In particular, we consider
the situation where some dynamic entities or control units are vulnerable to
attacks and can become malicious. Our objective is to ensure that the input and
output data of the benign entities are protected from the malicious entities as
well as protected when they are transferred over the networks in a distributed
environment. Both these security requirements are achieved using cryptographic
techniques. However, the use of cryptographic mechanisms brings additional
challenges to the design of controllers in the encrypted state space; the
closed-loop system gains and states are required to match the specified
cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the
design of secure networked control systems integrating the cryptographic
mechanisms with the control algorithms. The approach is based on the separation
principle, with the cryptographic techniques addressing the security
requirements and the control algorithms satisfying their performance
requirements. This paper presents the design of private controllers for two
typical control problems, namely stabilization and consensus, as well as the
discussion of numerical simulations and results.

  For certain industrial control applications an explicit function capturing
the nontrivial trade-off between competing objectives in closed loop
performance is not available. In such scenarios it is common practice to use
the human innate ability to implicitly learn such a relationship and manually
tune the corresponding controller to achieve the desirable closed loop
performance. This approach has its deficiencies because of individual
variations due to experience levels and preferences in the absence of an
explicit calibration metric. Moreover, as the complexity of the underlying
system and/or the controller increase, in the effort to achieve better
performance, so does the tuning time and the associated tuning cost. To reduce
the overall tuning cost, a tuning framework is proposed herein, whereby a
supervised machine learning is used to extract the human-learned cost function
and an optimization algorithm that can efficiently deal with a large number of
variables, is used for optimizing the extracted cost function. Given the
interest in the implementation across many industrial domains and the
associated high degree of freedom present in the corresponding tuning process,
a Model Predictive Controller applied to air path control in a diesel engine is
tuned for the purpose of demonstrating the potential of the framework.

Title: Flyback-Based Multiple Output dc-dc Converter with Independent Voltage
  Regulation

Comments: 8 Pages, 10 figures
DOI: 10.1109/PEDG.2018.8447884
\\
  This paper proposes a new single input multiple output power supply by
integrating a flyback converter and several buck converters. The flyback
converter works as the main regulator, and the buck converters provide series
voltage compensation with the aim of tight regulation. A time multiplexing
switching scheme is proposed to deliver multiple output voltage levels via a
two winding transformer and to eliminate the cross regulation between output
channels. This configuration reduces the size of flyback transformer and filter
capacitors, and consequently improves the overall form factor. A detailed
steady state analysis is conducted on the circuit to obtain the design
criteria. A three output channel power supply is designed and the effectiveness
of the proposed configuration is validated via simulation with a
MATLAB/Simscape model. Simulation results also demonstrate satisfactory
transient response to load changes.

Title: Autonomous quadrotor obstacle avoidance based on dueling double deep
  recurrent Q network with monocular vision
Authors: Jiajun Ou, Xiao Guo, Ming Zhu, Wenjie Lou
Categories: eess.SY cs.RO cs.SY
Comments: 22 pages, 10 figures
\\
  The fast developing of unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) brings forward the higher
request to the ability of autonomous obstacle avoidance in crowded environment.
Small UAVs such as quadrotors usually integrate with simple sensors and
computation units because of the limited payload and power supply, which adds
difficulties for operating traditional obstacle avoidance method. In this
paper, we present a framework to control a quadrotor to fly through crowded
environments autonomously. This framework adopts a two-stage architecture, a
sensing module based on unsupervised deep learning method and a decision module
established on deep reinforcement learning method, which takes the monocular
image as inputs and outputs quadrotor actions. And it enables the quadrotor to
realize autonomous obstacle avoidance without any prior environment information
or labeled datasets. To eliminate the negative effects of limited observation
capacity of on-board monocular camera, the decision module uses dueling double
deep recurrent Q networks. The trained model shows high success rate as it
control a quadrotor to fly through crowded environments in simulation. And it
can have good performance after scenario transformed.

\\
  In modern transportation systems, traffic congestion is inevitable. To
minimize the loss caused by congestion, various control strategies have been
developed most of which rely on observing real-time traffic conditions. As
vintage traffic sensors are limited, traffic density estimation is very helpful
for gaining network-wide observability. This paper deals with this problem by
first, presenting a traffic model for stretched highway having multiple ramps
built based on asymmetric cell transmission model (ACTM). Second, based on the
assumption that the encompassed nonlinearity of the ACTM is Lipschitz, a robust
dynamic observer framework for performing traffic density estimation is
proposed. Numerical test results show that the observer yields a sufficient
performance in estimating traffic densities having noisy measurements, while
being computationally faster the Unscented Kalman Filter in performing
real-time estimation.

Title: Human-Machine Collaboration for Automated Vehicles via an Intelligent
  Two-Phase Haptic Interface
Authors: Chen Lv, Yutong Li, Yang Xing, Chao Huang, Dongpu Cao, Yifan Zhao,
  Yahui Liu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Prior to realizing fully autonomous driving, human intervention will be
required periodically to guarantee vehicle safety. This fact poses a new
challenge in human-machine interaction, particularly during control authority
transition from the automated functionality to a human driver. This paper
addresses this challenge by proposing an intelligent haptic interface based on
a newly developed two-phase human-machine interaction model. The intelligent
haptic torque is applied on the steering wheel and switches its functionality
between predictive guidance and haptic assistance according to the varying
state and control ability of human drivers, helping drivers gradually resume
manual control during takeover. The developed approach is validated by
conducting vehicle experiments with 26 human participants. The results suggest
that the proposed method can effectively enhance the driving state recovery and
control performance of human drivers during takeover compared with an existing
approach, further improving the safety and smoothness of the human-machine
interaction in automated vehicles.

Title: Comparison of Meta-Heuristics for the Planning of Meshed Power Systems
Authors: Florian Sch\"afer, Jan-Hendrik Menke, Martin Braun
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  The power system planning task is a combinatorial optimization problem. The
objective function minimizes the economic costs subject to a set of technical
and operational constraints. Meta-heuristics are often used as optimization
strategies to find solutions to this problem by combining switching, line
reinforcement or new line measures. Common heuristics are GA, PSO, HC, ILS or
newer methods such as GWO or FWA. In this paper, we compare these algorithms
within the same framework. We test each algorithm on 8 different test grids
ranging from 73 to 9421 buses. For each grid and algorithm, we start 50 runs
with a maximum run time of 1 hour. The results show that the performance of an
algorithm depends on the initial grid state, grid size and amount of measures.
The ILS method is very robust in most cases. In the larger test grids, more
exploratory heuristics, e.g., GA and PSO, find solutions in shorter run times.

Title: A Semi-global Hybrid Sensorless Observer for Permanent Magnets
  Synchronous Machines with Unknown Mechanical Model
Authors: Alessandro Bosso, Ilario A. Azzollini, Andrea Tilli
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: submitted to the 21st IFAC World Congress
\\
  In this paper, we present a hybrid sensorless observer for Permanent Magnets
Synchronous Machines, with no a priori knowledge of the mechanical dynamics and
without the typical assumption of constant or slowly-varying speed. Instead, we
impose the rotor speed to have a constant (unknown) sign and a non-zero
magnitude at all times. For the design of the proposed scheme, meaningful Lie
group formalism is adopted to describe the rotor position as an element of the
unit circle. This choice, however, leads to a non-contractible state space, and
therefore it introduces topological constraints that complicate the achievement
of global/semi-global and robust results. In this respect it is shown that the
proposed observer, which employs a clock to periodically reset the estimates,
is semi-globally practically asymptotically stable, and thus it improves a
continuous-time version designed under the same assumptions. As highlighted in
the simulation results, the novel hybrid strategy leads to enhanced transient
performance, notably without any modification of the gains employed in the
continuous-time solution. These features motivate to augment the observer with
a discrete-time identifier, leading to significantly faster rotor flux
reconstruction.

  A dual-rate control system is a hybrid system composed of continuous-time and
discrete-time elements with two sampling frequencies. In this work, a new
frequency domain analysis and design approach, based on the Quantitative
Feedback Theory (QFT) is developed, to cope with robust stability and tracking
specifications. Tracking specifications are considered not only in the
discrete-time but also in continuous-time, that allow a precise description of
the intersample behavior (ripples), and characterization of frequencies below
and beyond the Nyquist frequency. Several illustrative examples and a case
study has been developed.

Title: Determining optimal input-output properties: A data-driven approach
Authors: Anne Koch, Julian Berberich, Johannes K\"ohler and Frank Allg\"ower
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Due to their relevance in systems analysis and (robust) controller design, we
consider the problem of determining control-theoretic system properties of an a
priori unknown system from data only. More specifically, we introduce a
necessary and sufficient condition for a discrete-time linear time-invariant
system to satisfy a given integral quadratic constraint (IQC) over a finite
time horizon using only one input-output trajectory of finite length.
Furthermore, for certain classes of IQCs, we provide convex optimization
problems in form of semidefinite programs (SDPs) to retrieve the optimal, i.e.
the tightest, system property description that is satisfied by the unknown
system. Finally, we provide bounds on the difference between finite and
infinite horizon IQCs and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme
in a variety of simulation studies including noisy measurements and a high
dimensional system.

Title: Controllability of a Linear System with Nonnegative Sparse Controls
Authors: Geethu Joseph
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 6 pages, no figures
\\
  This paper studies controllability of a discrete-time linear dynamical system
using nonnegative and sparse inputs. These constraints on the control input
arise naturally in many real-life systems where the external influence on the
system is unidirectional, and activating each input node adds to the cost of
control. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability
of the system, without imposing any constraints on the system matrices. Unlike
the well-known Kalman rank based controllability criteria, the conditions
presented in this paper can be verified in polynomial time, and the
verification complexity is independent of the sparsity level. The proof of the
result is based on the analytical tools concerning the properties of a convex
cone. Our results also provide a closed-form expression for the minimum number
of control nodes to be activated at every time instant to ensure
controllability of the system using positive controls.

Title: Free-breathing Cardiovascular MRI Using a Plug-and-Play Method with
  Learned Denoiser
Authors: Sizhuo Liu, Edward Reehorst, Philip Schniter, and Rizwan Ahmad
Categories: eess.IV cs.AI
Comments: IEEE ISBI 2020, International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging
\\
  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a noninvasive imaging modality
that provides a comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system. The
clinical utility of CMR is hampered by long acquisition times, however. In this
work, we propose and validate a plug-and-play (PnP) method for CMR
reconstruction from undersampled multi-coil data. To fully exploit the rich
image structure inherent in CMR, we pair the PnP framework with a deep learning
(DL)-based denoiser that is trained using spatiotemporal patches from
high-quality, breath-held cardiac cine images. The resulting "PnP-DL" method
iterates over data consistency and denoising subroutines. We compare the
reconstruction performance of PnP-DL to that of compressed sensing (CS) using
eight breath-held and ten real-time (RT) free-breathing cardiac cine datasets.
We find that, for breath-held datasets, PnP-DL offers more than one dB
advantage over commonly used CS methods. For RT free-breathing datasets, where
ground truth is not available, PnP-DL receives higher scores in qualitative
evaluation. The results highlight the potential of PnP-DL to accelerate RT CMR.

\\
  The state-of-art approach for speaker verification consists of a neural
network based embedding extractor along with a backend generative model such as
the Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA). In this work, we propose
a neural network approach for backend modeling in speaker recognition. The
likelihood ratio score of the generative PLDA model is posed as a
discriminative similarity function and the learnable parameters of the score
function are optimized using a verification cost. The proposed model, termed as
neural PLDA (NPLDA), is initialized using the generative PLDA model parameters.
The loss function for the NPLDA model is an approximation of the minimum
detection cost function (DCF). The speaker recognition experiments using the
NPLDA model are performed on the speaker verificiation task in the VOiCES
datasets as well as the SITW challenge dataset. In these experiments, the NPLDA
model optimized using the proposed loss function improves significantly over
the state-of-art PLDA based speaker verification system.

\\
  Recent neural text-to-speech (TTS) models with fine-grained latent features
enable precise control of the prosody of synthesized speech. Such models
typically incorporate a fine-grained variational autoencoder (VAE) structure,
extracting latent features at each input token (e.g., phonemes). However,
generating samples with the standard VAE prior often results in unnatural and
discontinuous speech, with dramatic prosodic variation between tokens. This
paper proposes a sequential prior in a discrete latent space which can generate
more naturally sounding samples. This is accomplished by discretizing the
latent features using vector quantization (VQ), and separately training an
autoregressive (AR) prior model over the result. We evaluate the approach using
listening tests, objective metrics of automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance, and measurements of prosody attributes. Experimental results show
that the proposed model significantly improves the naturalness in random sample
generation. Furthermore, initial experiments demonstrate that randomly sampling
from the proposed model can be used as data augmentation to improve the ASR
performance.

Title: Vocoder-free End-to-End Voice Conversion with Transformer Network
Authors: June-Woo Kim, Ho-Young Jung, Minho Lee
Categories: eess.AS cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Work in progress
\\
  Mel-frequency filter bank (MFB) based approaches have the advantage of
learning speech compared to raw spectrum since MFB has less feature size.
However, speech generator with MFB approaches require additional vocoder that
needs a huge amount of computation expense for training process. The additional
pre/post processing such as MFB and vocoder is not essential to convert real
human speech to others. It is possible to only use the raw spectrum along with
the phase to generate different style of voices with clear pronunciation. In
this regard, we propose a fast and effective approach to convert realistic
voices using raw spectrum in a parallel manner. Our transformer-based model
architecture which does not have any CNN or RNN layers has shown the advantage
of learning fast and solved the limitation of sequential computation of
conventional RNN. In this paper, we introduce a vocoder-free end-to-end voice
conversion method using transformer network. The presented conversion model can
also be used in speaker adaptation for speech recognition. Our approach can
convert the source voice to a target voice without using MFB and vocoder. We
can get an adapted MFB for speech recognition by multiplying the converted
magnitude with phase. We perform our voice conversion experiments on TIDIGITS
dataset using the metrics such as naturalness, similarity, and clarity with
mean opinion score, respectively.

Title: Calibrate and Prune: Improving Reliability of Lottery Tickets Through
  Prediction Calibration
Authors: Bindya Venkatesh, Jayaraman J. Thiagarajan, Kowshik Thopalli and
  Prasanna Sattigeri
Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  The hypothesis that sub-network initializations (lottery) exist within the
initializations of over-parameterized networks, which when trained in isolation
produce highly generalizable models, has led to crucial insights into network
initialization and has enabled computationally efficient inferencing. In order
to realize the full potential of these pruning strategies, particularly when
utilized in transfer learning scenarios, it is necessary to understand the
behavior of winning tickets when they might overfit to the dataset
characteristics. In supervised and semi-supervised learning, prediction
calibration is a commonly adopted strategy to handle such inductive biases in
models. In this paper, we study the impact of incorporating calibration
strategies during model training on the quality of the resulting lottery
tickets, using several evaluation metrics. More specifically, we incorporate a
suite of calibration strategies to different combinations of architectures and
datasets, and evaluate the fidelity of sub-networks retrained based on winning
tickets. Furthermore, we report the generalization performance of tickets
across distributional shifts, when the inductive biases are explicitly
controlled using calibration mechanisms. Finally, we provide key insights and
recommendations for obtaining reliable lottery tickets, which we demonstrate to
achieve improved generalization.

Categories: eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We present a self-supervised deep multi-task learning framework for
electrocardiogram (ECG) -based emotion recognition. The proposed framework
consists of two stages of learning a) learning ECG representations and b)
learning to classify emotions. ECG representations are learned by a signal
transformation recognition network. The network learns high-level abstract
representations from unlabeled ECG data. Six different signal transformations
are applied to the ECG signals, and transformation recognition is performed as
pretext tasks. Training the model on pretext tasks helps our network learn
spatiotemporal representations that generalize well across different datasets
and different emotion categories. We transfer the weights of the
self-supervised network to an emotion recognition network, where the
convolutional layers are kept frozen and the dense layers are trained with
labelled ECG data. We show that our proposed method considerably improves the
performance compared to a network trained using fully-supervised learning. New
state-of-the-art results are set in classification of arousal, valence,
affective states, and stress for the four utilized datasets. Extensive
experiments are performed, providing interesting insights into the impact of
using a multi-task self-supervised structure instead of a single-task model, as
well as the optimum level of difficulty required for the pretext
self-supervised tasks.

Title: Statistically Efficient Off-Policy Policy Gradients
Authors: Nathan Kallus, Masatoshi Uehara
Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG math.OC
\\
  Policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning update policy parameters by
taking steps in the direction of an estimated gradient of policy value. In this
paper, we consider the statistically efficient estimation of policy gradients
from off-policy data, where the estimation is particularly non-trivial. We
derive the asymptotic lower bound on the feasible mean-squared error in both
Markov and non-Markov decision processes and show that existing estimators fail
to achieve it in general settings. We propose a meta-algorithm that achieves
the lower bound without any parametric assumptions and exhibits a unique 3-way
double robustness property. We discuss how to estimate nuisances that the
algorithm relies on. Finally, we establish guarantees on the rate at which we
approach a stationary point when we take steps in the direction of our new
estimated policy gradient.

Title: Magnetic Field Simulation with Data-Driven Material Modeling

Categories: physics.comp-ph cs.CE
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures
\\
  This paper developes a data-driven magnetostatic finite-element (FE) solver
which directly exploits measured material data instead of a material curve
constructed from it. The distances between the field solution and the
measurement points are minimized while enforcing Maxwell's equations. The
minimization problem is solved by employing the Lagrange multiplier approach.
The procedure wraps the FE method within an outer data-driven iteration. The
method is capable of considering anisotropic materials and is adapted to deal
with models featuring a combination of exact material knowledge and measured
material data. Thereto, three approaches with an increasing level of
intrusivity according to the FE formulation are proposed. The numerical results
for a quadrupole-magnet model show that data-driven field simulation is
feasible and affordable and overcomes the need of modeling the material law.

Title: Efficient ECM factorization in parallel with the Lyness map
Authors: Andrew N. W. Hone
Categories: math.NT cs.CR nlin.SI
\\
  The Lyness map is a birational map in the plane which provides one of the
simplest discrete analogues of a Hamiltonian system with one degree of freedom,
having a conserved quantity and an invariant symplectic form. As an example of
a symmetric Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) map, each generic orbit of the
Lyness map lies on a curve of genus one, and corresponds to a sequence of
points on an elliptic curve which is one of the fibres in a pencil of
biquadratic curves in the plane. Here we present a version of the elliptic
curve method (ECM) for integer factorization, which is based on iteration of
the Lyness map with a particular choice of initial data. More precisely, we
give an algorithm for scalar multiplication of a point on an elliptic curve,
which is represented by one of the curves in the Lyness pencil. In order to
avoid field inversion, and require only field multiplication (${\bf M}$),
squaring (${\bf S}$) and addition, projective coordinates in $\mathbb{P}^1
\times \mathbb{P}^1$ are used. Neglecting multiplication by curve constants
(assumed small), each addition of the chosen point uses $2{\bf M}$, while each
doubling step requires $15{\bf M}$. We further show that the doubling step can
be implemented efficiently in parallel with four processors, dropping the
effective cost to $4{\bf M}$. Our scalar multiplication algorithm should
require, on average, roughly twice as many multiplications per bit as the
fastest state of the art methods using twisted Edwards curves with small
constants, but it can be applied to any elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$,
whereas twisted Edwards curves (equivalent to Montgomery curves) correspond to
only a subset of all elliptic curves. Hence, if implemented in parallel, our
method may have potential advantages for integer factorization or elliptic
curve cryptography.

Title: Predictive online optimisation with applications to optical flow
Authors: Tuomo Valkonen
Categories: math.OC cs.CV cs.NA math.NA
\\
  Online optimisation revolves around new data being introduced into a problem
while it is still being solved; think of deep learning as more training samples
become available. We adapt the idea to dynamic inverse problems such as video
processing with optical flow. We introduce a corresponding predictive online
primal-dual proximal splitting method. The video frames now exactly correspond
to the algorithm iterations. A user-prescribed predictor describes the
evolution of the primal variable. To prove convergence we need a predictor for
the dual variable based on (proximal) gradient flow. This affects the model
that the method asymptotically minimises. We show that for inverse problems the
effect is, essentially, to construct a new dynamic regulariser based on infimal
convolution of the static regularisers with the temporal coupling. We develop
regularisation theory for dynamic inverse problems, and show the convergence of
the algorithmic solutions in terms of this theory. We finish by demonstrating
excellent real-time performance of our method in computational image
stabilisation.

  Human Identity verification has always been an eye-catching goal in digital
based security system. Authentication or identification systems developed using
human characteristics such as face, finger print, hand geometry, iris, and
voice are denoted as biometric systems. Among the various characteristics, Iris
recognition trusts on the idiosyncratic human iris patterns to find out and
corroborate the identity of a person. The image is normally contemplated as a
gathering of information. Existence of noises in the input or processed image
effects degradation in the image superiority. It should be paramount to restore
original image from noises for attaining maximum amount of information from
corrupted images. Noisy images in biometric identification system cannot give
accurate identity. So Image related data or information tends to loss or
damage. Images are affected by various sorts of noises. This paper mainly
focuses on Salt and Pepper noise, Gaussian noise, Uniform noise, Speckle noise.
Different filtering techniques can be adapted for noise diminution to develop
the visual quality as well as understandability of images. In this paper, four
types of noises have been undertaken and applied on some images. The filtering
of these noises uses different types of filters like Mean, Median, Weiner,
Gaussian filter etc. A relative interpretation is performed using four
different categories of filter with finding the value of quality determined
parameters like mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR),
average difference value (AD) and maximum difference value (MD).

Title: A Unified End-to-End Framework for Efficient Deep Image Compression
Authors: Jiaheng Liu, Guo Lu, Zhihao Hu, Dong Xu
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: have submited to journal
\\
  Image compression is a widely used technique to reduce the spatial redundancy
in images. Recently, learning based image compression has achieved significant
progress by using the powerful representation ability from neural networks.
However, the current state-of-the-art learning based image compression methods
suffer from the huge computational complexity, which limits their capacity for
practical applications. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called
Efficient Deep Image Compression (EDIC) based on three new technologies,
including a channel attention module, a Gaussian mixture model and a
decoder-side enhancement module. Specifically, we design an auto-encoder style
network for learning based image compression. To improve the coding efficiency,
we exploit the channel relationship between latent representations by using the
channel attention module. Besides, the Gaussian mixture model is introduced for
the entropy model and improves the accuracy for bitrate estimation.
Furthermore, we introduce the decoder-side enhancement module to further
improve image compression performance. Our EDIC method can also be readily
incorporated with the Deep Video Compression (DVC) framework to further improve
the video compression performance. Simultaneously, our EDIC method boosts the
coding performance significantly while bringing slightly increased
computational complexity. More importantly, experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art image
compression methods and is up to more than 150 times faster in terms of
decoding speed when compared with Minnen's method. The proposed framework also
successfully improves the performance of the recent deep video compression
system DVC.

Title: A Deep Learning Approach to Automate High-Resolution Blood Vessel
  Reconstruction on Computerized Tomography Images With or Without the Use of
  Contrast Agent
Authors: Anirudh Chandrashekar, Ashok Handa, Natesh Shivakumar, Pierfrancesco

\\
  Existing methods to reconstruct vascular structures from a computed
tomography (CT) angiogram rely on injection of intravenous contrast to enhance
the radio-density within the vessel lumen. However, pathological changes can be
present in the blood lumen, vessel wall or a combination of both that prevent
accurate reconstruction. In the example of aortic aneurysmal disease, a blood
clot or thrombus adherent to the aortic wall within the expanding aneurysmal
sac is present in 70-80% of cases. These deformations prevent the automatic
extraction of vital clinically relevant information by current methods. In this
study, we implemented a modified U-Net architecture with attention-gating to
establish a high-throughput and automated segmentation pipeline of pathological
blood vessels in CT images acquired with or without the use of a contrast
agent. Twenty-six patients with paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT
images within the ongoing Oxford Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (OxAAA) study were
randomly selected, manually annotated and used for model training and
evaluation (13/13). Data augmentation methods were implemented to diversify the
training data set in a ratio of 10:1. The performance of our Attention-based
U-Net in extracting both the inner lumen and the outer wall of the aortic
aneurysm from CT angiograms (CTA) was compared against a generic 3-D U-Net and
displayed superior results. Subsequent implementation of this network
architecture within the aortic segmentation pipeline from both
contrast-enhanced CTA and non-contrast CT images has allowed for accurate and
efficient extraction of the entire aortic volume. This extracted volume can be
used to standardize current methods of aneurysmal disease management and sets
the foundation for subsequent complex geometric and morphological analysis.
Furthermore, the proposed pipeline can be extended to other vascular
pathologies.

Title: Ultra High Fidelity Image Compression with $\ell_\infty$-constrained
  Encoding and Deep Decoding
Authors: Xi Zhang and Xiaolin Wu
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  In many professional fields, such as medicine, remote sensing and sciences,
users often demand image compression methods to be mathematically lossless. But
lossless image coding has a rather low compression ratio (around 2:1 for
natural images). The only known technique to achieve significant compression
while meeting the stringent fidelity requirements is the methodology of
$\ell_\infty$-constrained coding that was developed and standardized in
nineties. We make a major progress in $\ell_\infty$-constrained image coding
after two decades, by developing a novel CNN-based soft
$\ell_\infty$-constrained decoding method. The new method repairs compression
defects by using a restoration CNN called the $\ell_\infty\mbox{-SDNet}$ to map
a conventionally decoded image to the latent image. A unique strength of the
$\ell_\infty\mbox{-SDNet}$ is its ability to enforce a tight error bound on a
per pixel basis. As such, no small distinctive structures of the original image
can be dropped or distorted, even if they are statistical outliers that are
otherwise sacrificed by mainstream CNN restoration methods. More importantly,
this research ushers in a new image compression system of
$\ell_\infty$-constrained encoding and deep soft decoding
($\ell_\infty\mbox{-ED}^2$). The $\ell_\infty \mbox{-ED}^2$ approach beats the
best of existing lossy image compression methods (e.g., BPG, WebP, etc.) not
only in $\ell_\infty$ but also in $\ell_2$ error metric and perceptual quality,
for bit rates near the threshold of perceptually transparent reconstruction.
Operationally, the new compression system is practical, with a low-complexity
real-time encoder and a cascade decoder consisting of a fast initial decoder
and an optional CNN soft decoder.

\\
  Image compression is one of the most fundamental techniques and commonly used
applications in the image and video processing field. Earlier methods built a
well-designed pipeline, and efforts were made to improve all modules of the
pipeline by handcrafted tuning. Later, tremendous contributions were made,
especially when data-driven methods revitalized the domain with their excellent
modeling capacities and flexibility in incorporating newly designed modules and
constraints. Despite great progress, a systematic benchmark and comprehensive
analysis of end-to-end learned image compression methods are lacking. In this
paper, we first conduct a comprehensive literature survey of learned image
compression methods. The literature is organized based on several aspects to
jointly optimize the rate-distortion performance with a neural network, i.e.,
network architecture, entropy model and rate control. We describe milestones in
cutting-edge learned image-compression methods, review a broad range of
existing works, and provide insights into their historical development routes.
With this survey, the main challenges of image compression methods are
revealed, along with opportunities to address the related issues with recent
advanced learning methods. This analysis provides an opportunity to take a
further step towards higher-efficiency image compression. By introducing a
coarse-to-fine hyperprior model for entropy estimation and signal
reconstruction, we achieve improved rate-distortion performance, especially on
high-resolution images. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our model in coding efficiency and the potential for
acceleration by large-scale parallel computing devices.

Title: Fairness in Slot Allocation
Authors: Mehran Makhtoumi
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.CY
\\
  The recent interpretations of fairness in slot allocation of flights are
considered as the word equity and upon these interpretations for fairness,
aviation agencies as airspace administrators along with stakeholders have been
applying ground delay problem procedure with ration by schedule and compression
algorithms as fair distribution of slots among them in reduced capacity
airports. The drawback of these approaches is that the slots to be allocated to
flights are all of the equal size or duration since the flights to be assigned
to slots can not be differentiated. In fact, the absence of a scientific
framework of fairness in air traffic management has led to the different
contradictory interpretations for it. As proposed in this study, fairness is
the minimum deviation from the planned outcome in terms of time, quantity and
quality under the optimum share management rule for each stakeholder. To
achieve fairness in slot allocation of the airport under reduced and normal
capacity, a new allocation rule of ration by fairness is proposed in which the
elements of time, quantity and quality are proposed to be the original time of
departure or arrival, slot size or duration, and airspace safety and preflight
checklist, respectively.

Title: A Simulated Annealing Algorithm for the Directed Steiner Tree Problem
Authors: Matias Siebert, Shabbir Ahmed, and George Nemhauser
Categories: math.CO cs.DM
\\
  In \cite{siebert2019linear} the authors present a set of integer programs
(IPs) for the Steiner tree problem, which can be used for both, the directed
and the undirected setting of the problem. Each IP finds an optimal Steiner
tree with a specific structure. A solution with the lowest cost, corresponds to
an optimal solution to the entire problem. The authors show that the linear
programming relaxation of each IP is integral and, also, that each IP is
polynomial in the size of the instance, consequently, they can be solved in
polynomial time. The main issue is that the number of IPs to solve grows
exponentially with the number of terminal nodes, which makes this approach
impractical for large instances. In this paper, we propose a local search
procedure to solve the directed Steiner tree problem using the approach
presented in \cite{siebert2019linear}. In order to do this, we present a
dynamic programming algorithm to solve each IP efficiently. Then we provide a
characterization of the neighborhood of each tree structure. Finally, we use
the proposed algorithm and the neighborhood characterization to solve the
problem using a simulated annealing framework. Computational experiments show
that the quality of the solutions delivered by our approach is better than the
ones presented in the literature for the directed Steiner tree problem.

discrete set by the algebra of functions. We expand this mathematical framework
so that it is consistent with differential geometry, and works on spectral
graph theory and random walks. Consequently, our formulation comprehensively

Title: Introducing Graph Cumulants: What is the Kurtosis of your Social
  Network?

Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.DM cs.SI
Comments: Both authors contributed equally to this work
\\
  In an increasingly interconnected world, understanding and summarizing the
structure of these networks becomes increasingly relevant. However, this task
is nontrivial; proposed summary statistics are as diverse as the networks they
describe, and a standardized hierarchy has not yet been established. In
contrast, vector-valued random variables admit such a description in terms of
their cumulants (e.g., mean, (co)variance, skew, kurtosis). Here, we introduce
the natural analogue of cumulants for networks, building a hierarchical
description based on correlations between an increasing number of connections,
seamlessly incorporating additional information, such as directed edges, node
attributes, and edge weights. These graph cumulants provide a principled and
unifying framework for quantifying the propensity of a network to display any
substructure of interest (such as cliques to measure clustering). Moreover,
they give rise to a natural hierarchical family of maximum entropy models for
networks (i.e., ERGMs) that do not suffer from the "degeneracy problem", a
common practical pitfall of other ERGMs.

  We calculate the norm of the Fourier operator from $L^p(X)$ to $L^q(\hat{X})$
when $X$ is an infinite locally compact abelian group that is, furthermore,
compact or discrete. This subsumes the sharp Hausdorff-Young inequality on such
groups. In particular, we identify the region in $(p,q)$-space where the norm
is infinite, generalizing a result of Fournier, and setting up a contrast with
the case of finite abelian groups, where the norm was determined by Gilbert and
Rzeszotnik. As an application, uncertainty principles on such groups expressed
in terms of R\'enyi entropies are discussed.

develop some qualitative properties of the Stam region, showing for instance
that its closure is a logarithmically convex cone.

Title: DeepSIC: Deep Soft Interference Cancellation for Multiuser MIMO
  Detection
Authors: Nir Shlezinger, Rong Fu, and Yonina C. Eldar
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML
\\
  Digital receivers are required to recover the transmitted symbols from their
observed channel output. In multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
setups, where multiple symbols are simultaneously transmitted, accurate symbol
detection is challenging. A family of algorithms capable of reliably recovering
multiple symbols is based on interference cancellation. However, these methods
assume that the channel is linear, a model which does not reflect many relevant
channels, as well as require accurate channel state information (CSI), which
may not be available. In this work we propose a multiuser MIMO receiver which
learns to jointly detect in a data-driven fashion, without assuming a specific
channel model or requiring CSI. In particular, we propose a data-driven
implementation of the iterative soft interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm
which we refer to as DeepSIC. The resulting symbol detector is based on
integrating dedicated machine-learning (ML) methods into the iterative SIC
algorithm. DeepSIC learns to carry out joint detection from a limited set of
training samples without requiring the channel to be linear and its parameters
to be known. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that for linear channels
with full CSI, DeepSIC approaches the performance of iterative SIC, which is
comparable to the optimal performance, and outperforms previously proposed
ML-based MIMO receivers. Furthermore, in the presence of CSI uncertainty,
DeepSIC significantly outperforms model-based approaches. Finally, we show that
DeepSIC accurately detects symbols in non-linear channels, where conventional
iterative SIC fails even when accurate CSI is available.

Title: Edge-Isoperimetric Inequalities and Ball-Noise Stability: Linear
  Programming and Probabilistic Approaches
Authors: Lei Yu
Categories: math.CO cs.IT math.IT math.PR
Comments: 23 pages, no figures
\\
  Let $Q_{n}^{r}$ be the $r$-power of the hypercube $\{-1,1\}^{n}$. The
discrete edge-isoperimetric problem for $Q_{n}^{r}$ is that: For every
$\left(n,r,M\right)$ such that $1\le r\le n$ and $1\le M\le2^{n}$, determine
the minimum boundary-size of a subset of vertices of $Q_{n}^{r}$ with a given
size $M$. In this paper, we apply two different approaches to prove bounds for
this problem. Our first approach is a linear programming approach and the
second is a probabilistic approach. Our bound derived by using the first
approach generalizes the sharp bound for $M=2^{n-1}$ derived by Kahn, Kalai,
and Linial in 1989. Moreover, our bound is also sharp for $M=2^{n-2}$ and
$r\le\frac{n-1}{2}$. Our bound derived by using the second approach is
asymptotically sharp as $n\to\infty$ when $r=2\left\lfloor \frac{\beta
n}{2}\right\rfloor +1$ and $M=\left\lfloor \alpha2^{n}\right\rfloor $ for fixed
$\alpha,\beta\in(0,1)$, and sharp up to a constant factor when $r=2\left\lfloor
\frac{\beta n}{2}\right\rfloor $ and $M=\left\lfloor \alpha2^{n}\right\rfloor
$. Furthermore, the discrete edge-isoperimetric problem is equivalent to a
ball-noise stability problem which is a variant of the traditional (i.i.d.-)
noise stability problem. Our results imply bounds on the ball-noise stability
problem.

Title: Throughput Analysis and User Barring Design for Uplink NOMA-Enabled
  Random Access
Authors: Wenjuan Yu, Chuan Heng Foh, Atta ul Quddus, Yuanwei Liu, Rahim

Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Being able to accommodate multiple simultaneous transmissions on a single
channel, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) appears as an attractive
solution to support massive machine type communication (mMTC) that faces a
massive number of devices competing to access the limited number of shared
radio resources. In this paper, we first analytically study the throughput
performance of NOMA-based random access (RA), namely NOMA-RA. We show that
while increasing the number of power levels in NOMA-RA leads to a further gain
in maximum throughput, the growth of throughput gain is slower than linear.
This is due to the higher-power dominance characteristic in power-domain NOMA
known in the literature. We explicitly quantify the throughput gain for the
very first time in this paper. With our analytical model, we verify the
performance advantage of the proposed NOMA-RA scheme by comparing with the
baseline multi-channel slotted ALOHA (MS-ALOHA), with and without capture
effect. Despite the higher-power dominance effect, the maximum throughput of
NOMA-RA with four power levels achieves over three times that of the MS-ALOHA.
However, our analytical results also reveal the sensitivity of load on the
throughput of NOMA-RA. To cope with the potential bursty traffic in mMTC
scenarios, we propose adaptive load regulation through a practical user barring
algorithm. By estimating the current load based on the observable channel
feedback, the algorithm adaptively controls user access to maintain the optimal
loading of channels to achieve maximum throughput. When the proposed user
barring algorithm is applied, simulations demonstrate that the instantaneous
throughput of NOMA-RA always remains close to the maximum throughput confirming
the effectiveness of our load regulation.

Title: Implementation of ASK, FSK and PSK with BER vs. SNR comparison over AWGN
  channel
Authors: Subrato Bharati, Mohammad Atikur Rahman, Prajoy Podder
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 13 figures
\\
  This paper mainly discusses about three basic digital modulation process ASK,
FSK, PSK. These modulation schemes can be characterized by their transmitted
symbols which consist of a discrete set of values occurring at gradually spaced
intervals. The selection of a digital modulation technique for a specific
application depend not only the bandwidth efficiency and implementation
complexity but also error rate occurred in a bit (BER) and signal to noise
ratio. Binary modulation methods use two level symbols and are facile to
implement, provide good error substantiation. BER is a key parameter that used
for assessing systems that transmit signal data from one location to another.
SNR is well known measure of how the signal and noise power compare against
each other. It directly affects the probability of error performance of a
system. In this paper, we have implemented ASK, FSK and PSK using MATLAB.
Cosine signal has been used as a carrier wave. In this paper, a comparative
exploration of BER performance of ASK, FSK and PSK for channel utilization is
proposed and the investigation are carried out with SNR over AWGN channel as
the reference factor.

Title: Machine learning in quantum computers via general Boltzmann Machines:
  Generative and Discriminative training through annealing
Authors: Siddhartha Srivastava, Veera Sundararaghavan
Categories: quant-ph cs.LG math.PR stat.ML
\\
  We present a Hybrid-Quantum-classical method for learning Boltzmann machines
(BM) for generative and discriminative tasks. Boltzmann machines are undirected
graphs that form the building block of many learning architectures such as
Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM's) and Deep Boltzmann machines (DBM's). They
have a network of visible and hidden nodes where the former are used as the
reading sites while the latter are used to manipulate the probability of the
visible states. BM's are versatile machines that can be used for both learning
distributions as a generative task as well as for performing classification or
function approximation as a discriminative task. We show that minimizing
KL-divergence works best for training BM for applications of function
approximation. In our approach, we use Quantum annealers for sampling Boltzmann
states. These states are used to approximate gradients in a stochastic gradient
descent scheme. The approach is used to demonstrate logic circuits in the
discriminative sense and a specialized two-phase distribution using generative
BM.

Title: A Scalable Evolution Strategy with Directional Gaussian Smoothing for
  Blackbox Optimization
Authors: Jiaxin Zhang, Hoang Tran, Dan Lu, Guannan Zhang
Categories: math.OC cs.LG cs.NE
\\
  We developed a new scalable evolution strategy with directional Gaussian
smoothing (DGS-ES) for high-dimensional blackbox optimization. Standard ES
methods have been proved to suffer from the curse of dimensionality, due to the
random directional search and low accuracy of Monte Carlo estimation. The key
idea of this work is to develop Gaussian smoothing approach which only averages
the original objective function along $d$ orthogonal directions. In this way,
the partial derivatives of the smoothed function along those directions can be
represented by one-dimensional integrals, instead of $d$-dimensional integrals
in the standard ES methods. As such, the averaged partial derivatives can be
approximated using the Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule, as opposed to MC, which
significantly improves the accuracy of the averaged gradients. Moreover, the
smoothing technique reduces the barrier of local minima, such that global
minima become easier to achieve. We provide three sets of examples to
demonstrate the performance of our method, including benchmark functions for
global optimization, and a rocket shell design problem.

Title: Blind Source Separation for NMR Spectra with Negative Intensity

\\
  NMR spectral datasets, especially in systems with limited samples, can be
difficult to interpret if they contain multiple chemical components (phases,
polymorphs, molecules, crystals, glasses, etc...) and the possibility of
overlapping resonances. In this paper, we benchmark several blind source
separation techniques for analysis of NMR spectral datasets containing negative
intensity. For benchmarking purposes, we generated a large synthetic datasbase
of quadrupolar solid-state NMR-like spectra that model spin-lattice T1
relaxation or nutation tip/flip angle experiments. Our benchmarking approach
focused exclusively on the ability of blind source separation techniques to
reproduce the spectra of the underlying pure components. In general, we find
that FastICA (Fast Independent Component Analysis), SIMPLISMA
(SIMPLe-to-use-Interactive Self-modeling Mixture Analysis), and NNMF
(Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) are top-performing techniques. We
demonstrate that dataset normalization approaches prior to blind source
separation do not considerably improve outcomes. Within the range of noise
levels studied, we did not find drastic changes to the ranking of techniques.
The accuracy of FastICA and SIMPLISMA degrades quickly if excess (unreal) pure
components are predicted. Our results indicate poor performance of SVD
(Singular Value Decomposition) methods, and we propose alternative techniques
for matrix initialization. The benchmarked techniques are also applied to real
solid state NMR datasets. In general, the recommendations from the synthetic
datasets agree with the recommendations and results from the real data
analysis. The discussion provides some additional recommendations for
spectroscopists applying blind source separation to NMR datasets, and for
future benchmark studies.

Title: Extrapolation Towards Imaginary $0$-Nearest Neighbour and Its Improved
  Convergence Rate
Authors: Akifumi Okuno, Hidetoshi Shimodaira
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 31pages, 6 figures
\\
  $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$-NN) is one of the simplest and most widely-used
methods for supervised classification, that predicts a query's label by taking
weighted ratio of observed labels of $k$ objects nearest to the query. The
weights and the parameter $k \in \mathbb{N}$ regulate its bias-variance
trade-off, and the trade-off implicitly affects the convergence rate of the
excess risk for the $k$-NN classifier; several existing studies considered
selecting optimal $k$ and weights to obtain faster convergence rate. Whereas
$k$-NN with non-negative weights has been developed widely, it was proved that
negative weights are essential for eradicating the bias terms and attaining
optimal convergence rate. However, computation of the optimal weights requires
solving entangled equations. Thus, other simpler approaches that can find
optimal real-valued weights are appreciated in practice. In this paper, we
propose multiscale $k$-NN (MS-$k$-NN), that extrapolates unweighted $k$-NN
estimators from several $k \ge 1$ values to $k=0$, thus giving an imaginary
0-NN estimator. MS-$k$-NN implicitly corresponds to an adaptive method for
finding favorable real-valued weights, and we theoretically prove that the
MS-$k$-NN attains the improved rate, that coincides with the existing optimal
rate under some conditions.

Title: Projective Preferential Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Petrus Mikkola, Milica Todorovi\'c, Jari J\"arvi, Patrick Rinke,
  Samuel Kaski
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Bayesian optimization is an effective method for finding extrema of a
black-box function. We propose a new type of Bayesian optimization for learning
user preferences in high-dimensional spaces. The central assumption is that the
underlying objective function cannot be evaluated directly, but instead a
minimizer along a projection can be queried, which we call a projective
preferential query. The form of the query allows for feedback that is natural
for a human to give, and which enables interaction. This is demonstrated in a
user experiment in which the user feedback comes in the form of optimal
position and orientation of a molecule adsorbing to a surface. We demonstrate
that our framework is able to find a global minimum of a high-dimensional
black-box function, which is an infeasible task for existing preferential
Bayesian optimization frameworks that are based on pairwise comparisons.

Title: PixelHop++: A Small Successive-Subspace-Learning-Based (SSL-based) Model
  for Image Classification

\\
  The successive subspace learning (SSL) principle was developed and used to
design an interpretable learning model, known as the PixelHop method,for image
classification in our prior work. Here, we propose an improved PixelHop method
and call it PixelHop++. First, to make the PixelHop model size smaller, we
decouple a joint spatial-spectral input tensor to multiple spatial tensors (one
for each spectral component) under the spatial-spectral separability assumption
and perform the Saab transform in a channel-wise manner, called the
channel-wise (c/w) Saab transform.Second, by performing this operation from one
hop to another successively, we construct a channel-decomposed feature tree
whose leaf nodes contain features of one dimension (1D). Third, these 1D
features are ranked according to their cross-entropy values, which allows us to
select a subset of discriminant features for image classification. In
PixelHop++, one can control the learning model size of
fine-granularity,offering a flexible tradeoff between the model size and the
classification performance. We demonstrate the flexibility of PixelHop++ on
MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 three datasets.

Title: A data-driven choice of misfit function for FWI using reinforcement
  learning
Authors: Bingbing Sun and Tariq Alkhalifah
Categories: physics.geo-ph cs.LG
\\
  In the workflow of Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI), we often tune the
parameters of the inversion to help us avoid cycle skipping and obtain high
resolution models. For example, typically start by using objective functions
that avoid cycle skipping, like tomographic and image based or using only low
frequency, and then later, we utilize the least squares misfit to admit high
resolution information. We also may perform an isotropic (acoustic) inversion
to first update the velocity model and then switch to multi-parameter
anisotropic (elastic) inversions to fully recover the complex physics. Such
hierarchical approaches are common in FWI, and they often depend on our manual
intervention based on many factors, and of course, results depend on
experience. However, with the large data size often involved in the inversion
and the complexity of the process, making optimal choices is difficult even for
an experienced practitioner. Thus, as an example, and within the framework of
reinforcement learning, we utilize a deep-Q network (DQN) to learn an optimal
policy to determine the proper timing to switch between different misfit
functions. Specifically, we train the state-action value function (Q) to
predict when to use the conventional L2-norm misfit function or the more
advanced optimal-transport matching-filter (OTMF) misfit to mitigate the
cycle-skipping and obtain high resolution, as well as improve convergence. We
use a simple while demonstrative shifted-signal inversion examples to
demonstrate the basic principles of the proposed method.

Title: ML-misfit: Learning a robust misfit function for full-waveform inversion
  using machine learning
Authors: Bingbing Sun and Tariq Alkhalifah
Categories: physics.geo-ph cs.LG physics.app-ph
\\
  Most of the available advanced misfit functions for full waveform inversion
(FWI) are hand-crafted, and the performance of those misfit functions is
data-dependent. Thus, we propose to learn a misfit function for FWI, entitled
ML-misfit, based on machine learning. Inspired by the optimal transport of the
matching filter misfit, we design a neural network (NN) architecture for the
misfit function in a form similar to comparing the mean and variance for two
distributions. To guarantee the resulting learned misfit is a metric, we
accommodate the symmetry of the misfit with respect to its input and a Hinge
loss regularization term in a meta-loss function to satisfy the "triangle
inequality" rule. In the framework of meta-learning, we train the network by
running FWI to invert for randomly generated velocity models and update the
parameters of the NN by minimizing the meta-loss, which is defined as
accumulated difference between the true and inverted models. We first
illustrate the basic principle of the ML-misfit for learning a convex misfit
function for travel-time shifted signals. Further, we train the NN on 2D
horizontally layered models, and we demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of the learned ML-misfit by applying it to the well-known Marmousi
model.

Title: Conjoined Dirichlet Process
Authors: Michelle N. Ngo, Dustin S. Pluta, Alexander N. Ngo, Babak Shahbaba
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME
\\
  Biclustering is a class of techniques that simultaneously clusters the rows
and columns of a matrix to sort heterogeneous data into homogeneous blocks.
Although many algorithms have been proposed to find biclusters, existing
methods suffer from the pre-specification of the number of biclusters or place
constraints on the model structure. To address these issues, we develop a
novel, non-parametric probabilistic biclustering method based on Dirichlet
processes to identify biclusters with strong co-occurrence in both rows and
columns. The proposed method utilizes dual Dirichlet process mixture models to
learn row and column clusters, with the number of resulting clusters determined
by the data rather than pre-specified. Probabilistic biclusters are identified
by modeling the mutual dependence between the row and column clusters. We apply
our method to two different applications, text mining and gene expression
analysis, and demonstrate that our method improves bicluster extraction in many
settings compared to existing approaches.

  In this paper, we consider a model called CHARME (Conditional Heteroscedastic
Autoregressive Mixture of Experts), a class of generalized mixture of nonlinear
nonparametric AR-ARCH time series. Under certain Lipschitz-type conditions on
the autoregressive and volatility functions, we prove that this model is
stationary, ergodic and $\tau$-weakly dependent. These conditions are much
weaker than those presented in the literature that treats this model. Moreover,
this result forms the theoretical basis for deriving an asymptotic theory of
the underlying (non)parametric estimation, which we present for this model. As
an application, from the universal approximation property of neural networks
(NN), possibly with deep architectures, we develop a learning theory for the
NN-based autoregressive functions of the model, where the strong consistency
and asymptotic normality of the considered estimator of the NN weights and
biases are guaranteed under weak conditions.

Title: Better Theory for SGD in the Nonconvex World
Authors: Ahmed Khaled and Peter Richt\'arik

Comments: 28 pages, 3 figures, 4 theorems, and 4 propositions
\\
  Large-scale nonconvex optimization problems are ubiquitous in modern machine
learning, and among practitioners interested in solving them, Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) reigns supreme. We revisit the analysis of SGD in the
nonconvex setting and propose a new variant of the recently introduced expected
smoothness assumption which governs the behaviour of the second moment of the
stochastic gradient. We show that our assumption is both more general and more
reasonable than assumptions made in all prior work. Moreover, our results yield
the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ rate for finding a stationary point
of nonconvex smooth functions, and recover the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ rate for finding a global solution if the
Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition is satisfied. We compare against convergence
rates under convexity and prove a theorem on the convergence of SGD under
Quadratic Functional Growth and convexity, which might be of independent
interest. Moreover, we perform our analysis in a framework which allows for a
detailed study of the effects of a wide array of sampling strategies and
minibatch sizes for finite-sum optimization problems. We corroborate our
theoretical results with experiments on real and synthetic data.

Title: Stochastic tree ensembles for regularized nonlinear regression
Authors: Jingyu He, P. Richard Hahn
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME
\\
  This paper develops a novel stochastic tree ensemble method for nonlinear
regression, which we refer to as XBART, short for Accelerated Bayesian Additive
Regression Trees. By combining regularization and stochastic search strategies
from Bayesian modeling with computationally efficient techniques from recursive
partitioning approaches, the new method attains state-of-the-art performance:
in many settings it is both faster and more accurate than the widely-used
XGBoost algorithm. Via careful simulation studies, we demonstrate that our new
approach provides accurate point-wise estimates of the mean function and does
so faster than popular alternatives, such as BART, XGBoost and neural networks
(using Keras). We also prove a number of basic theoretical results about the
new algorithm, including consistency of the single tree version of the model
and stationarity of the Markov chain produced by the ensemble version.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that initializing standard Bayesian additive
regression trees Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) at XBART-fitted trees
considerably improves credible interval coverage and reduces total run-time.

\\
  Catheters are the second most common abnormal finding on radiographs. The
position of catheters must be assessed on all radiographs, as serious
complications can arise if catheters are malpositioned. However, due to the
large number of radiographs performed each day, there can be substantial delays
between the time a radiograph is performed and when it is interpreted by a
radiologist. Computer-aided approaches hold the potential to assist in
prioritizing radiographs with potentially malpositioned catheters for
interpretation and automatically insert text indicating the placement of
catheters in radiology reports, thereby improving radiologists' efficiency.
After 50 years of research in computer-aided diagnosis, there is still a
paucity of study in this area. With the development of deep learning
approaches, the problem of catheter assessment is far more solvable. Therefore,
we have performed a review of current algorithms and identified key challenges
in building a reliable computer-aided diagnosis system for assessment of
catheters on radiographs. This review may serve to further the development of
machine learning approaches for this important use case.

Title: Interpretable Companions for Black-Box Models
Authors: Danqing Pan, Tong Wang, Satoshi Hara
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures
\\
  We present an interpretable \emph{companion} model for any pre-trained
black-box classifiers. The idea is that for any input, a user can decide to
either receive a prediction from the black-box model, with high accuracy but no
explanations, or employ a \emph{companion rule} to obtain an interpretable
prediction with slightly lower accuracy. The companion model is trained from
data and the predictions of the black-box model, with the objective combining
area under the transparency--accuracy curve and model complexity. Our model
provides flexible choices for practitioners who face the dilemma of choosing
between always using interpretable models and always using black-box models for
a predictive task, so users can, for any given input, take a step back to
resort to an interpretable prediction if they find the predictive performance
satisfying, or stick to the black-box model if the rules are unsatisfying. To
show the value of companion models, we design a human evaluation on more than a
hundred people to investigate the tolerable accuracy loss to gain

Title: Semi-Implicit Back Propagation
Authors: Ren Liu, Xiaoqun Zhang
Categories: math.OC cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Neural network has attracted great attention for a long time and many
researchers are devoted to improve the effectiveness of neural network training
algorithms. Though stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and other explicit
gradient-based methods are widely adopted, there are still many challenges such
as gradient vanishing and small step sizes, which leads to slow convergence and
instability of SGD algorithms. Motivated by error back propagation (BP) and
proximal methods, we propose a semi-implicit back propagation method for neural
network training. Similar to BP, the difference on the neurons are propagated
in a backward fashion and the parameters are updated with proximal mapping. The
implicit update for both hidden neurons and parameters allows to choose large
step size in the training algorithm. Finally, we also show that any fixed point
of convergent sequences produced by this algorithm is a stationary point of the
objective loss function. The experiments on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate
that the proposed semi-implicit BP algorithm leads to better performance in
terms of both loss decreasing and training/validation accuracy, compared to SGD
and a similar algorithm ProxBP.

Title: Discrete Action On-Policy Learning with Action-Value Critic
Authors: Yuguang Yue, Yunhao Tang, Mingzhang Yin, Mingyuan Yin
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) in discrete action space is ubiquitous in
real-world applications, but its complexity grows exponentially with the
action-space dimension, making it challenge to apply existing on-policy
gradient based deep RL algorithms efficiently. To effectively operate in
multidimensional discrete action spaces, we construct a critic to estimate
action-value functions, apply it on correlated actions, and combine these
critic estimated action values to control the variance of gradient estimation.
We follow rigorous statistical analysis to design how to generate and combine
these correlated actions, and how to sparsify the gradients by shutting down
the contributions from certain dimensions. These efforts result in a new
discrete action on-policy RL algorithm that empirically outperforms related
on-policy algorithms relying on variance control techniques. We demonstrate
these properties on OpenAI Gym benchmark tasks, and illustrate how discretizing
the action space could benefit the exploration phase and hence facilitate
convergence to a better local optimal solution thanks to the flexibility of
discrete policy.

Title: Emotion Recognition Using Speaker Cues
Authors: Ismail Shahin
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD
Comments: 5 pages
\\
  This research aims at identifying the unknown emotion using speaker cues. In
this study, we identify the unknown emotion using a two-stage framework. The
first stage focuses on identifying the speaker who uttered the unknown emotion,
while the next stage focuses on identifying the unknown emotion uttered by the
recognized speaker in the prior stage. This proposed framework has been
evaluated on an Arabic Emirati-accented speech database uttered by fifteen
speakers per gender. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) have been used
as the extracted features and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been utilized as
the classifier in this work. Our findings demonstrate that emotion recognition
accuracy based on the two-stage framework is greater than that based on the
one-stage approach and the state-of-the-art classifiers and models such as
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Vector
Quantization (VQ). The average emotion recognition accuracy based on the
two-stage approach is 67.5%, while the accuracy reaches to 61.4%, 63.3%, 64.5%,
and 61.5%, based on the one-stage approach, GMM, SVM, and VQ, respectively. The
achieved results based on the two-stage framework are very close to those
attained in subjective assessment by human listeners.

\\
  Understanding the star-formation properties of galaxies as a function of
cosmic epoch is a critical exercise in studies of galaxy evolution.
Traditionally, stellar population synthesis models have been used to obtain
best fit parameters that characterise star formation in galaxies. As multiband
flux measurements become available for thousands of galaxies, an alternative
approach to characterising star formation using machine learning becomes
feasible. In this work, we present the use of deep learning techniques to
predict three important star formation properties -- stellar mass, star
formation rate and dust luminosity. We characterise the performance of our deep
learning models through comparisons with outputs from a standard stellar
population synthesis code.

Title: Representation Learning on Variable Length and Incomplete
  Wearable-Sensory Time Series
Authors: Xian Wu, Chao Huang, Pablo Roblesgranda, Nitesh Chawla
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The prevalence of wearable sensors (e.g., smart wristband) is enabling an
unprecedented opportunity to not only inform health and wellness states of
individuals, but also assess and infer demographic information and personality.
This can allow us a deeper personalized insight beyond how many steps we took
or what is our heart rate. However, before we can achieve this goal of
personalized insight about an individual, we have to resolve a number of
shortcomings: 1) wearable-sensory time series is often of variable-length and
incomplete due to different data collection periods (e.g., wearing behavior
varies by person); 2) inter-individual variability to external factors like
stress and environment. This paper addresses these challenges and brings us
closer to the potential of personalized insights whether about health or
personality or job performance about an individual by developing a novel
representation learning algorithm, HeartSpace. Specifically, HeartSpace is
capable of encoding time series data with variable-length and missing values
via the integration of a time series encoding module and a pattern aggregation
network. Additionally, HeartSpace implements a Siamese-triplet network to
optimize representations by jointly capturing intra- and inter-series
correlations during the embedding learning process. Our empirical evaluation
over two different data presents significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art baselines in a variety of applications, including personality
prediction, demographics inference, user identification.

Journal-ref: CAp 2018
\\
  Time series clustering is a challenging task due to the specific nature of
the data. Classical approaches do not perform well and need to be adapted
either through a new distance measure or a data transformation. In this paper
we investigate the combination of a convolutional autoencoder and a k-medoids
algorithm to perfom time series clustering. The convolutional autoencoder
allows to extract meaningful features and reduce the dimension of the data,
leading to an improvement of the subsequent clustering. Using simulation and
energy related data to validate the approach, experimental results show that
the clustering is robust to outliers thus leading to finer clusters than with
standard methods.

Title: Polynomial Optimization for Bounding Lipschitz Constants of Deep

\\
  The Lipschitz constant of a network plays an important role in many
applications of deep learning, such as robustness certification and Wasserstein
Generative Adversarial Network. We introduce a semidefinite programming
hierarchy to estimate the global and local Lipschitz constant of a multiple
layer deep neural network. The novelty is to combine a polynomial lifting for
ReLU functions derivatives with a weak generalization of Putinar's positivity
certificate. This idea could also apply to other, nearly sparse, polynomial
optimization problems in machine learning. We empirically demonstrate that our
method not only runs faster than state-of-the-art linear programming based
method, but also provides sharper bounds.

\\
  Second-order optimization methods have desirable convergence properties.
However, the exact Newton method requires expensive computation for the Hessian
and its inverse. In this paper, we propose SPAN, a novel approximate and fast
Newton method. SPAN computes the inverse of the Hessian matrix via low-rank
approximation and stochastic Hessian-vector products. Our experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPAN outperforms existing
first-order and second-order optimization methods in terms of the convergence
wall-clock time. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
per-iteration complexity, the approximation error, and the convergence rate.
Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposed
method achieves a better trade-off between the convergence rate and the
per-iteration efficiency.

  With the overwhelming online products available in recent years, there is an
increasing need to filter and deliver relevant personalized advice for users.
Recommender systems solve this problem by modeling and predicting individual
preferences for a great variety of items such as movies, books or research
articles. In this chapter, we explore rigorous network-based models that
outperform leading approaches for recommendation. The network models we
consider are based on the explicit assumption that there are groups of
individuals and of items, and that the preferences of an individual for an item
are determined only by their group memberships. The accurate prediction of
individual user preferences over items can be accomplished by different
methodologies, such as Monte Carlo sampling or Expectation-Maximization
methods, the latter resulting in a scalable algorithm which is suitable for
large datasets.

Title: On Contrastive Learning for Likelihood-free Inference
Authors: Conor Durkan, Iain Murray, George Papamakarios
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Likelihood-free methods perform parameter inference in stochastic simulator
models where evaluating the likelihood is intractable but sampling synthetic
data is possible. One class of methods for this likelihood-free problem uses a
classifier to distinguish between pairs of parameter-observation samples
generated using the simulator and pairs sampled from some reference
distribution, which implicitly learns a density ratio proportional to the
likelihood. Another popular class of methods fits a conditional distribution to
the parameter posterior directly, and a particular recent variant allows for
the use of flexible neural density estimators for this task. In this work, we
show that both of these approaches can be unified under a general contrastive
learning scheme, and clarify how they should be run and compared.

Title: Super-efficiency of automatic differentiation for functions defined as a
  minimum
Authors: Pierre Ablin, Gabriel Peyr\'e and Thomas Moreau
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 31 pages
\\
  In min-min optimization or max-min optimization, one has to compute the
gradient of a function defined as a minimum. In most cases, the minimum has no
closed-form, and an approximation is obtained via an iterative algorithm. There
are two usual ways of estimating the gradient of the function: using either an
analytic formula obtained by assuming exactness of the approximation, or
automatic differentiation through the algorithm. In this paper, we study the
asymptotic error made by these estimators as a function of the optimization
error. We find that the error of the automatic estimator is close to the square
of the error of the analytic estimator, reflecting a super-efficiency
phenomenon. The convergence of the automatic estimator greatly depends on the
convergence of the Jacobian of the algorithm. We analyze it for gradient
descent and stochastic gradient descent and derive convergence rates for the
estimators in these cases. Our analysis is backed by numerical experiments on
toy problems and on Wasserstein barycenter computation. Finally, we discuss the
computational complexity of these estimators and give practical guidelines to
chose between them.

Title: CO-Optimal Transport
Authors: Ivegen Redko, Titouan Vayer, R\'emi Flamary, Nicolas Courty
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Optimal transport (OT) is a powerful geometric and probabilistic tool for
finding correspondences and measuring similarity between two distributions.
Yet, its original formulation relies on the existence of a cost function
between the samples of the two distributions, which makes it impractical for
comparing data distributions supported on different topological spaces. To
circumvent this limitation, we propose a novel OT problem, named COOT for
CO-Optimal Transport, that aims to simultaneously optimize two transport maps
between both samples and features. This is different from other approaches that
either discard the individual features by focussing on pairwise distances (e.g.
Gromov-Wasserstein) or need to model explicitly the relations between the
features. COOT leads to interpretable correspondences between both samples and
feature representations and holds metric properties. We provide a thorough
theoretical analysis of our framework and establish rich connections with the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance. We demonstrate its versatility with two machine
learning applications in heterogeneous domain adaptation and co-clustering/data
summarization, where COOT leads to performance improvements over the competing
state-of-the-art methods.

\\
  Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) propagation channel characterization
plays a key role on the design and performance analysis of Vehicular Visible
Light Communication (VVLC) systems. Current OWC channel models based on
deterministic and stochastic methods, fail to address mobility induced ambient
light, optical turbulence and road reflection effects on channel
characterization. Therefore, alternative machine learning (ML) based schemes,
considering ambient light, optical turbulence, road reflection effects in
addition to intervehicular distance and geometry, are proposed to obtain
accurate VVLC channel loss and channel frequency response (CFR). This work
demonstrates synthesis of ML based VVLC channel model frameworks through multi
layer perceptron feed-forward neural network (MLP), radial basis function
neural network (RBF-NN) and Random Forest ensemble learning algorithms.
Predictor and response variables, collected through practical road
measurements, are employed to train and validate proposed models for various
conditions. Additionally, the importance of different predictor variables on
channel loss and CFR is assessed, normalized importance of features for
measured VVLC channel is introduced. We show that RBF-NN, Random Forest and MLP
based models yield more accurate channel loss estimations with 3.53 dB, 3.81
dB, 3.95 dB root mean square error (RMSE), respectively, when compared to
fitting curve based VVLC channel model with 7 dB RMSE. Moreover, RBF-NN and MLP
models are demonstrated to predict VVLC CFR with respect to distance, ambient
light and receiver inclination angle predictor variables with 3.78 dB and 3.60
dB RMSE respectively.

Categories: cond-mat.dis-nn cs.LG eess.SP
\\
  With an ongoing trend in computing hardware towards increased heterogeneity,
domain-specific co-processors are emerging as alternatives to centralized
paradigms. The tensor core unit (TPU) has shown to outperform graphic process
units by almost 3-orders of magnitude enabled by higher signal throughout and
energy efficiency. In this context, photons bear a number of synergistic
physical properties while phase-change materials allow for local nonvolatile
mnemonic functionality in these emerging distributed non van-Neumann
architectures. While several photonic neural network designs have been
explored, a photonic TPU to perform matrix vector multiplication and summation
is yet outstanding. Here we introduced an integrated photonics-based TPU by
strategically utilizing a) photonic parallelism via wavelength division
multiplexing, b) high 2 Peta-operations-per second throughputs enabled by 10s
of picosecond-short delays from optoelectronics and compact photonic integrated
circuitry, and c) zero power-consuming novel photonic multi-state memories
based on phase-change materials featuring vanishing losses in the amorphous
state. Combining these physical synergies of material, function, and system, we
show that the performance of this 8-bit photonic TPU can be 2-3 orders higher
compared to an electrical TPU whilst featuring similar chip areas. This work
shows that photonic specialized processors have the potential to augment
electronic systems and may perform exceptionally well in network-edge devices
in the looming 5G networks and beyond.

  This paper proposes a hierarchical, fine-grained and interpretable latent
variable model for prosody based on the Tacotron 2 text-to-speech model. It
achieves multi-resolution modeling of prosody by conditioning finer level
representations on coarser level ones. Additionally, it imposes hierarchical
conditioning across all latent dimensions using a conditional variational
auto-encoder (VAE) with an auto-regressive structure. Evaluation of
reconstruction performance illustrates that the new structure does not degrade
the model while allowing better interpretability. Interpretations of prosody
attributes are provided together with the comparison between word-level and
phone-level prosody representations. Moreover, both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations are used to demonstrate the improvement in the
disentanglement of the latent dimensions.

Comments: Code available at https://github.com/Miffyli/asv-cm-reinforce
\\
  The spoofing countermeasure (CM) systems in automatic speaker verification
(ASV) are not typically used in isolation of each other. These systems can be
combined, for example, into a cascaded system where CM produces first a
decision whether the input is synthetic or bona fide speech. In case the CM
decides it is a bona fide sample, then the ASV system will consider it for
speaker verification. End users of the system are not interested in the
performance of the individual sub-modules, but instead are interested in the
performance of the combined system. Such combination can be evaluated with
tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) measure, yet the individual components
are trained separately from each other using their own performance metrics. In
this work we study training the ASV and CM components together for a better
t-DCF measure by using reinforcement learning. We demonstrate that such
training procedure indeed is able to improve the performance of the combined
system, and does so with more reliable results than with the standard
supervised learning techniques we compare against.

Title: A Speaker Verification Backend for Improved Calibration Performance
  across Varying Conditions
Authors: Luciana Ferrer and Mitchell McLaren
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1911.11622
\\
  In a recent work, we presented a discriminative backend for speaker
verification that achieved good out-of-the-box calibration performance on most
tested conditions containing varying levels of mismatch to the training
conditions. This backend mimics the standard PLDA-based backend process used in
most current speaker verification systems, including the calibration stage. All
parameters of the backend are jointly trained to optimize the binary
cross-entropy for the speaker verification task. Calibration robustness is
achieved by making the parameters of the calibration stage a function of
vectors representing the conditions of the signal, which are extracted using a
model trained to predict condition labels. In this work, we propose a
simplified version of this backend where the vectors used to compute the
calibration parameters are estimated within the backend, without the need for a
condition prediction model. We show that this simplified method provides
similar performance to the previously proposed method while being simpler to
implement, and having less requirements on the training data. Further, we
provide an analysis of different aspects of the method including the effect of
initialization, the nature of the vectors used to compute the calibration
parameters, and the effect that the random seed and the number of training
epochs has on performance. We also compare the proposed method with the
trial-based calibration (TBC) method that, to our knowledge, was the
state-of-the-art for achieving good calibration across varying conditions. We
show that the proposed method outperforms TBC while also being several orders
of magnitude faster to run, comparable to the standard PLDA baseline.

Title: Unsupervised Adaptive Neural Network Regularization for Accelerated
  Radial Cine MRI
Authors: Andreas Kofler, Marc Dewey, Tobias Schaeffter, Christoph Kolbitsch and
  Markus Haltmeier
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this work, we propose an iterative reconstruction scheme (ALONE - Adaptive
Learning Of NEtworks) for 2D radial cine MRI based on ground truth-free
unsupervised learning of shallow convolutional neural networks. The network is
trained to approximate patches of the current estimate of the solution during
the reconstruction. By imposing a shallow network topology and constraining the
$L_2$-norm of the learned filters, the network's representation power is
limited in order not to be able to recover noise. Therefore, the network can be
interpreted to perform a low dimensional approximation of the patches for
stabilizing the inversion process. We compare the proposed reconstruction
scheme to two ground truth-free reconstruction methods, namely a well known
Total Variation (TV) minimization and an unsupervised adaptive Dictionary
Learning (DIC) method. The proposed method outperforms both methods with
respect to all reported quantitative measures. Further, in contrast to DIC,
where the sparse approximation of the patches involves the solution of a
complex optimization problem, ALONE only requires a forward pass of all patches
through the shallow network and therefore significantly accelerates the
reconstruction.

Title: Anomaly Detection using Deep Autoencoders for in-situ Wastewater Systems
  Monitoring Data

\\
  Due to the growing amount of data from in-situ sensors in wastewater systems,
it becomes necessary to automatically identify abnormal behaviours and ensure
high data quality. This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on a
deep autoencoder for in-situ wastewater systems monitoring data. The
autoencoder architecture is based on 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
layers where the convolutions are performed over the inputs across the temporal
axis of the data. Anomaly detection is then performed based on the
reconstruction error of the decoding stage. The approach is validated on
multivariate time series from in-sewer process monitoring data. We discuss the
results and the challenge of labelling anomalies in complex time series. We

Title: Time Series Alignment with Global Invariances
Authors: Titouan Vayer and Laetitia Chapel and Nicolas Courty and R\'emi
  Flamary and Yann Soullard and Romain Tavenard
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  In this work we address the problem of comparing time series while taking
into account both feature space transformation and temporal variability. The
proposed framework combines a latent global transformation of the feature space
with the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The latent global
transformation captures the feature invariance while the DTW (or its smooth
counterpart soft-DTW) deals with the temporal shifts. We cast the problem as a
joint optimization over the global transformation and the temporal alignments.
The versatility of our framework allows for several variants depending on the
invariance class at stake. Among our contributions we define a differentiable
loss for time series and present two algorithms for the computation of time
series barycenters under our new geometry. We illustrate the interest of our
approach on both simulated and real world data.

Title: Towards Mind Reading

\\
  In this paper we explore mind reading or continuous silent speech recognition
using electroencephalograpgy (EEG) signals. We implemented a connectionist
temporal classification (CTC) automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to
translate EEG signals recorded in parallel while subjects were reading English
sentences in their mind without producing any voice to text. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of using EEG signals for performing mind reading or
continuous silent speech recognition. We demonstrate our results for a limited
English vocabulary consisting of 30 unique sentences.

  Realistic music generation has always remained as a challenging problem as it
may lack structure or rationality. In this work, we propose a deep learning
based music generation method in order to produce old style music particularly
JAZZ with rehashed melodic structures utilizing a Bi-directional Long Short
Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Neural Network with Attention. Owing to the success in
modelling long-term temporal dependencies in sequential data and its success in
case of videos, Bi-LSTMs with attention serve as the natural choice and early
utilization in music generation. We validate in our experiments that Bi-LSTMs
with attention are able to preserve the richness and technical nuances of the
music performed.

Title: Missing Data Imputation using Optimal Transport
Authors: Boris Muzellec, Julie Josse, Claire Boyer, Marco Cuturi
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Missing data is a crucial issue when applying machine learning algorithms to
real-world datasets. Starting from the simple assumption that two batches
extracted randomly from the same dataset should share the same distribution, we
leverage optimal transport distances to quantify that criterion and turn it
into a loss function to impute missing data values. We propose practical
methods to minimize these losses using end-to-end learning, that can exploit or
not parametric assumptions on the underlying distributions of values. We
evaluate our methods on datasets from the UCI repository, in MCAR, MAR and MNAR
settings. These experiments show that OT-based methods match or out-perform
state-of-the-art imputation methods, even for high percentages of missing
values.

  Extraction of symbolic information from signals is an active field of
research enabling numerous applications especially in the Musical Information
Retrieval domain. This complex task, that is also related to other topics such
as pitch extraction or instrument recognition, is a demanding subject that gave
birth to numerous approaches, mostly based on advanced signal processing-based
algorithms. However, these techniques are often non-generic, allowing the
extraction of definite physical properties of the signal (pitch, octave), but
not allowing arbitrary vocabularies or more general annotations. On top of
that, these techniques are one-sided, meaning that they can extract symbolic
data from an audio signal, but cannot perform the reverse process and make
symbol-to-signal generation. In this paper, we propose an bijective approach
for signal/symbol translation by turning this problem into a density estimation
task over signal and symbolic domains, considered both as related random
variables. We estimate this joint distribution with two different variational
auto-encoders, one for each domain, whose inner representations are forced to
match with an additive constraint, allowing both models to learn and generate
separately while allowing signal-to-symbol and symbol-to-signal inference. In
this article, we test our models on pitch, octave and dynamics symbols, which
comprise a fundamental step towards music transcription and label-constrained
audio generation. In addition to its versatility, this system is rather light
during training and generation while allowing several interesting creative uses
that we outline at the end of the article.

Title: Regularized Optimal Transport is Ground Cost Adversarial
Authors: Fran\c{c}ois-Pierre Paty, Marco Cuturi
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Regularizing Wasserstein distances has proved to be the key in the recent
advances of optimal transport (OT) in machine learning. Most prominent is the
entropic regularization of OT, which not only allows for fast computations and
differentiation using Sinkhorn algorithm, but also improves stability with
respect to data and accuracy in many numerical experiments. Theoretical
understanding of these benefits remains unclear, although recent statistical
works have shown that entropy-regularized OT mitigates classical OT's curse of
dimensionality. In this paper, we adopt a more geometrical point of view, and
show using Fenchel duality that any convex regularization of OT can be
interpreted as ground cost adversarial. This incidentally gives access to a
robust dissimilarity measure on the ground space, which can in turn be used in
other applications. We propose algorithms to compute this robust cost, and
illustrate the interest of this approach empirically.

\\
  Active speaker detection (ASD) and virtual cinematography (VC) can
significantly improve the remote user experience of a video conference by
automatically panning, tilting and zooming of a video conferencing camera:
users subjectively rate an expert video cinematographer's video significantly
higher than unedited video. We describe a new automated ASD and VC that
performs within 0.3 MOS of an expert cinematographer based on subjective
ratings with a 1-5 scale. This system uses a 4K wide-FOV camera, a depth
camera, and a microphone array; it extracts features from each modality and
trains an ASD using an AdaBoost machine learning system that is very efficient
and runs in real-time. A VC is similarly trained using machine learning to
optimize the subjective quality of the overall experience. To avoid distracting
the room participants and reduce switching latency the system has no moving
parts -- the VC works by cropping and zooming the 4K wide-FOV video stream. The
system was tuned and evaluated using extensive crowdsourcing techniques and
evaluated on a dataset with N=100 meetings, each 2-5 minutes in length.

Title: A Fully Online Approach for Covariance Matrices Estimation of Stochastic
  Gradient Descent Solutions
Authors: Wanrong Zhu, Xi Chen, Wei Biao Wu
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is widely used for parameter
estimation especially in online setting. While this recursive algorithm is
popular for computation and memory efficiency, the problem of quantifying
variability and randomness of the solutions has been rarely studied. This paper
aims at conducting statistical inference of SGD-based estimates in online
setting. In particular, we propose a fully online estimator for the covariance
matrix of averaged SGD iterates (ASGD). Based on the classic asymptotic
normality results of ASGD, we construct asymptotically valid confidence
intervals for model parameters. Upon receiving new observations, we can quickly
update the covariance estimator and confidence intervals. This approach fits in
online setting even if the total number of data is unknown and takes the full
advantage of SGD: efficiency in both computation and memory.

Comments: 8 pages,3 figure, the paper will be presented on European Control
  Conference,2020
MSC-class: 90Cxx
\\
  This paper considers a distributed stochastic strongly convex optimization,
where agents connected over a network aim to cooperatively minimize the average
of all agents' local cost functions. Due to the stochasticity of gradient
estimation and distributedness of local objective, fast linearly convergent
distributed algorithms have not been achieved yet. This work proposes a novel
distributed stochastic gradient tracking algorithm with variance reduction,
where the local gradients are estimated by an increasing batch-size of sampled
gradients. With an undirected connected communication graph and a geometrically
increasing batch-size, the iterates are shown to converge in mean to the
optimal solution at a geometric rate (achieving linear convergence). The
iteration, communication, and oracle complexity for obtaining an
$\epsilon$-optimal solution are established as well. Particulary, the
communication complexity is $\mathcal{O}(\ln (1/\epsilon))$ while the oracle
complexity (number of sampled gradients) is $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$, which
is of the same order as that of centralized approaches.
  Hence, the proposed scheme is communication-efficient without requiring extra
sampled gradients. Numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the theoretic
results.

Title: Numerical solution to stress distribution of a hole with corners on

Authors: Weiqi Wang
Categories: math.AP cs.NA math.NA
\\
  In this paper, we consider the stress of a hole with the given fourfold shape
(with corner) on an infinite plane under uniaxial tension. Complex Goursat
functions formulation by Muskhelishvili (1953) gives a set of singular integral
equations on the boundary to solve this problem. We develope a numerical method
using a set of Chebyshev polynomial with some constraints to represent the
Goursat function on the boundary and apply the collocation method on roots of
Legendre polynomial to solve integral equations. Our results show that the
numerical method spectrally converges to the known exact solution when boundary
shape is a circle, ellipse. We also applied our numerical method on two
overlapped circle shape (with corner) and find the result also converge to the
exact solution on Ling (1948).

\\
  Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) is emerging as a potential green enabler for
massive Internet of Things (IoT). Herein, we analyze Channel State Information
(CSI)-free multi-antenna strategies for powering wirelessly a large set of
single-antenna IoT devices. The CSI-free schemes are AA-SS (AA-IS), where all
antennas transmit the same (independent) signal(s), and SA, where just one
antenna transmits at a time such that all antennas are utilized during the
coherence block. We characterize the distribution of the provided energy under
correlated Rician fading for each scheme and find out that while AA-IS and SA
cannot take advantage of the multiple antennas to improve the average provided
energy, its dispersion can be significantly reduced. Meanwhile, AA-SS provides
the greatest average energy, but also the greatest energy dispersion, and the
gains depend critically on the mean phase shifts between the antenna elements.
We find that consecutive antennas must be $\pi$ phase-shifted for optimum
average energy performance under AA-SS. Our numerical results evidenced that
correlation is beneficial under AA-SS, while a greater line of sight (LOS)
and/or number of antennas is not always beneficial under such scheme.
Meanwhile, both AA-IS and SA schemes benefit from small correlation, large LOS
and/or large number of antennas.

  Tropical Differential Algebraic Geometry considers difficult or even
intractable problems in Differential Equations and tries to extract information
on their solutions from a restricted structure of the input. The Fundamental
Theorem of Tropical Differential Algebraic Geometry states that the support of
solutions of systems of ordinary differential equations with formal power
series coefficients over an uncountable algebraically closed field of
characteristic zero can be obtained by solving a so-called tropicalized
differential system. Tropicalized differential equations work on a completely
different algebraic structure which may help in theoretical and computational
questions. We show that the Fundamental Theorem can be extended to the case of
systems of partial differential equations by introducing vertex sets of Newton
polygons.

Title: An empirical analysis of information encoded in disentangled neural

  Shrikanth Narayanan
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: Submitted to Speaker Odyssey 2020
\\
  The primary characteristic of robust speaker representations is that they are
invariant to factors of variability not related to speaker identity.
Disentanglement of speaker representations is one of the techniques used to
improve robustness of speaker representations to both intrinsic factors that
are acquired during speech production (e.g., emotion, lexical content) and
extrinsic factors that are acquired during signal capture (e.g., channel,
noise). Disentanglement in neural speaker representations can be achieved
either in a supervised fashion with annotations of the nuisance factors
(factors not related to speaker identity) or in an unsupervised fashion without
labels of the factors to be removed. In either case it is important to
understand the extent to which the various factors of variability are entangled
in the representations. In this work, we examine speaker representations with
and without unsupervised disentanglement for the amount of information they
capture related to a suite of factors. Using classification experiments we
provide empirical evidence that disentanglement reduces the information with
respect to nuisance factors from speaker representations, while retaining
speaker information. This is further validated by speaker verification
experiments on the VOiCES corpus in several challenging acoustic conditions. We
also show improved robustness in speaker verification tasks using data
augmentation during training of disentangled speaker embeddings. Finally, based
on our findings, we provide insights into the factors that can be effectively
separated using the unsupervised disentanglement technique and discuss
potential future directions.

\\
  We consider a matching market where buyers and sellers arrive according to
independent Poisson processes at the same rate and independently abandon the
market if not matched after an exponential amount of time with the same mean.
In this centralized market, the utility for the system manager from matching
any buyer and any seller is a general random variable. We consider a sequence
of systems indexed by $n$ where the arrivals in the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ system
are sped up by a factor of $n$. We analyze two families of one-parameter
policies: the population threshold policy immediately matches an arriving agent
to its best available mate only if the number of mates in the system is above a
threshold, and the utility threshold policy matches an arriving agent to its
best available mate only if the corresponding utility is above a threshold.
Using an asymptotic fluid analysis of the two-dimensional Markov process of
buyers and sellers, we show that when the matching utility distribution is
light-tailed, % (i.e., the expected value of the maximum of many random
variables is a regularly varying function with $\alpha=0$) the population
threshold policy with threshold $\frac{n}{\ln n}$ is asymptotically optimal
among all policies that make matches only at agent arrival epochs. In the
heavy-tailed case% (i.e., $\alpha\in(0,1)$), we characterize the optimal
threshold level for both policies. %although they do not attain the performance
of our loose upper bound. We also study the utility threshold policy in an
unbalanced matching market with heavy-tailed matching utilities, and find that
the buyers and sellers have the same asymptotically optimal utility threshold.

Title: Scaling of contact networks for epidemic spreading in urban transit

Authors: Xinwu Qian, Lijun Sun, Satish V.Ukkusuri
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.SI physics.data-an
\\
  Improved mobility not only contributes to more intensive human activities but
also facilitates the spread of communicable disease, thus constituting a major
threat to billions of urban commuters. In this study, we present a multi-city
investigation of communicable diseases percolating among metro travelers. We
use smart card data from three megacities in China to construct
individual-level contact networks, based on which the spread of disease is
modeled and studied. We observe that, though differing in urban forms, network
layouts, and mobility patterns, the metro systems of the three cities share
similar contact network structures. This motivates us to develop a universal
generation model that captures the distributions of the number of contacts as
well as the contact duration among individual travelers. This model explains
how the structural properties of the metro contact network are associated with
the risk level of communicable diseases. Our results highlight the
vulnerability of urban mass transit systems during disease outbreaks and
suggest important planning and operation strategies for mitigating the risk of
communicable diseases.

Title: Small world is not enough: Criteria for network choice and

Comments: Was accepted by JASSS on Apr 18th 2010 but was never technically

\\
  Most agent-based models include a social network that describes the structure
of interactions within the artificial population. Because of the dramatic
impact of this structure on the simulated dynamics, modelers create this
network for it to match criteria of plausibility (e.g. the small-world
property). Networks are actually created by one network generator compliant
with these criteria, like the Watts-Strogatz algorithm in the case of
small-world networks. However, this practice comes to study the model's
dynamics over the specific networks generated by one algorithm instead of the
dynamics over the class of networks of interest, possibly inducing a strong
bias in results. We identify three problematics related to this bias: (i)
representativity of a network generator to a class of networks, (ii)
conclusiveness of simulations over a class of networks and (iii) the gain in
conclusiveness when refining the criteria for network choice. We propose an
experimental protocol and instantiate it on small-world networks for epidemics,
opinion and culture dynamics. We show that (i) Watts-Strogatz networks are not
representative of small-world networks (ii) simulation results over
small-worlds are arguably inconclusive, and (iii) even small-world networks
having the same size, density, transitivity and average path length do not lead
to coherent results. Beyond questioning the relevance of simulation results
obtained from artificial networks, this research also constitute one more
argument for the exploration of other approaches that are not solely focused on
networks' statistical properties.

The best candidates from all potential additional residuals are selected using

\\
  Diffusion adaptation is a powerful strategy for distributed estimation and
learning over networks. Motivated by the concept of combining adaptive filters,
this work proposes a combination framework that aggregates the operation of
multiple diffusion strategies for enhanced performance. By assigning a
combination coefficient to each node, and using an adaptation mechanism to
minimize the network error, we obtain a combined diffusion strategy that
benefits from the best characteristics of all component strategies
simultaneously in terms of excess-mean-square error (EMSE). Analyses of the
universality are provided to show the superior performance of affine
combination scheme and to characterize its behavior in the mean and mean-square
sense. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed strategies, as well as the accuracy of theoretical findings.

  For crowded and hotspot area, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are usually
deployed to increase the coverage rate. In the considered model, there are
three types of services for UAV assisted communication: control message,
non-realtime communication, and real-time communication, which can cover most
of the actual demands of users in a UAV assisted communication system. A
bandwidth allocation problem is considered to minimize the total energy
consumption of this system while satisfying the requirements. Two techniques
are introduced to enhance the performance of the system. The first method is to
categorize the ground users into multiple user groups and offer each group a
unique RF channel with different bandwidth. The second method is to deploy more
than one UAVs in the system. Bandwidth optimization in each scheme is proved to
be a convex problem. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed
schemes in terms of energy consumption.

Title: Continuous-time Lower Bounds for Gradient-based Algorithms
Authors: Michael Muehlebach and Michael I. Jordan
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  This article derives lower bounds on the convergence rate of continuous-time
gradient-based optimization algorithms. The algorithms are subjected to a
time-normalization constraint that avoids a reparametrization of time in order
to make the discussion of continuous-time convergence rates meaningful. We
reduce the multi-dimensional problem to a single dimension, recover well-known
lower bounds from the discrete-time setting, and provide insights into why
these lower bounds occur. We further explicitly provide algorithms that achieve
the proposed lower bounds, even when the function class under consideration
includes certain non-convex functions.
