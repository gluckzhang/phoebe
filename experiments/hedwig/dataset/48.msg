Title: A Probabilistic Simulator of Spatial Demand for Product Allocation
Authors: Porter Jenkins, Hua Wei, J. Stockton Jenkins, Zhenhui Li
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 8 pages, The AAAI-20 Workshop on Intelligent Process Automation
\\
  Connecting consumers with relevant products is a very important problem in
both online and offline commerce. In physical retail, product placement is an
effective way to connect consumers with products. However, selecting product
locations within a store can be a tedious process. Moreover, learning important
spatial patterns in offline retail is challenging due to the scarcity of data
and the high cost of exploration and experimentation in the physical world. To
address these challenges, we propose a stochastic model of spatial demand in
physical retail. We show that the proposed model is more predictive of demand
than existing baselines. We also perform a preliminary study into different
automation techniques and show that an optimal product allocation policy can be
learned through Deep Q-Learning.

Title: Deep Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Path Following of Autonomous
  Underwater Vehicle
Authors: Qilei Zhang, Jinying Lin, Qixin Sha, Bo He and Guangliang Li
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) plays an increasingly important role in
ocean exploration. Existing AUVs are usually not fully autonomous and generally
limited to pre-planning or pre-programming tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL)
and deep reinforcement learning have been introduced into the AUV design and
research to improve its autonomy. However, these methods are still difficult to
apply directly to the actual AUV system because of the sparse rewards and low
learning efficiency. In this paper, we proposed a deep interactive
reinforcement learning method for path following of AUV by combining the
advantages of deep reinforcement learning and interactive RL. In addition,
since the human trainer cannot provide human rewards for AUV when it is running
in the ocean and AUV needs to adapt to a changing environment, we further
propose a deep reinforcement learning method that learns from both human
rewards and environmental rewards at the same time. We test our methods in two
path following tasks---straight line and sinusoids curve following of AUV by
simulating in the Gazebo platform. Our experimental results show that with our
proposed deep interactive RL method, AUV can converge faster than a DQN learner
from only environmental reward. Moreover, AUV learning with our deep RL from
both human and environmental rewards can also achieve a similar or even better
performance than that with the deep interactive RL method and can adapt to the
actual environment by further learning from environmental rewards.

Title: A Unified Conversational Assistant Framework for Business Process
  Automation
Authors: Yara Rizk, Abhishek Bhandwalder, Scott Boag, Tathagata Chakraborti,
  Vatche Isahagian, Yasaman Khazaeni, Falk Pollock, Merve Unuvar
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Business process automation is a booming multi-billion-dollar industry that
promises to remove menial tasks from workers' plates -- through the
introduction of autonomous agents -- and free up their time and brain power for
more creative and engaging tasks. However, an essential component to the
successful deployment of such autonomous agents is the ability of business
users to monitor their performance and customize their execution. A simple and
user-friendly interface with a low learning curve is necessary to increase the
adoption of such agents in banking, insurance, retail and other domains. As a
result, proactive chatbots will play a crucial role in the business automation
space. Not only can they respond to users' queries and perform actions on their
behalf but also initiate communication with the users to inform them of the
system's behavior. This will provide business users a natural language
interface to interact with, monitor and control autonomous agents. In this
work, we present a multi-agent orchestration framework to develop such
proactive chatbots by discussing the types of skills that can be composed into
agents and how to orchestrate these agents. Two use cases on a travel
preapproval business process and a loan application business process are
adopted to qualitatively analyze the proposed framework based on four criteria:
performance, coding overhead, scalability, and agent overlap.

Title: Multi-Objective Optimisation of Damper Placement for Improved Seismic
  Response in Dynamically Similar Adjacent Buildings
Authors: Mahesh B. Patil, Ramakrishna U., Mohan S. C
Categories: cs.CE cs.NE
Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables
\\
  Multi-objective optimisation of damper placement in dynamically symmetric
adjacent buildings is considered with identical viscoelastic dampers used for
vibration control. First, exhaustive search is used to describe the solution
space in terms of various quantities of interest such as maximum top floor
displacement, maximum floor acceleration, base shear, and interstorey drift.
With the help of examples, it is pointed out that the Pareto fronts in these
problems contain a very small number of solutions. The effectiveness of two
commonly used multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, viz., NSGA-II and MOPSO,
is evaluated for a specific example.

Title: A stable SPH with adaptive B-spline kernel
Authors: Saptarshi Kumar Lahiri, Kanishka Bhattacharya, Amit Shaw, L S
  Ramachandra
Categories: cs.CE
Comments: 34 Pages, 22 Figures
\\
  Tensile instability, often observed in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH),
is a numerical artifact that manifests itself by unphysical clustering or
separation of particles. The instability originates in estimating the
derivatives of the smoothing functions which, when interact with material
constitution may result in negative stiffness in the discretized system. In the
present study, a stable formulation of SPH is developed where the kernel
function is continuously adapted at every material point depending on its state
of stress. Bspline basis function with a variable intermediate knot is used as
the kernel function. The shape of the kernel function is then modified by
changing the intermediate knot position such that the condition associated with
instability does not arise. While implementing the algorithm the simplicity and
computational efficiency of SPH are not compromised. One-dimensional dispersion
analysis is performed to understand the effect adaptive kernel on the
stability. Finally, the efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated through some
benchmark elastic dynamics problems.

Title: A machine learning based plasticity model using proper orthogonal
  decomposition
Authors: Dengpeng Huang, Jan Niklas Fuhg, Christian Wei{\ss}enfels, Peter
  Wriggers
Categories: cs.CE cs.LG
\\
  Data-driven material models have many advantages over classical numerical
approaches, such as the direct utilization of experimental data and the
possibility to improve performance of predictions when additional data is
available. One approach to develop a data-driven material model is to use
machine learning tools. These can be trained offline to fit an observed
material behaviour and then be applied in online applications. However,
learning and predicting history dependent material models, such as plasticity,
is still challenging. In this work, a machine learning based material modelling
framework is proposed for both elasticity and plasticity. The machine learning
based hyperelasticity model is developed with the Feed forward Neural Network
(FNN) directly whereas the machine learning based plasticity model is developed
by using of a novel method called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Feed forward
Neural Network (PODFNN). In order to account for the loading history, the
accumulated absolute strain is proposed to be the history variable of the
plasticity model. Additionally, the strain-stress sequence data for plasticity
is collected from different loading-unloading paths based on the concept of
sequence for plasticity. By means of the POD, the multi-dimensional stress
sequence is decoupled leading to independent one dimensional coefficient
sequences. In this case, the neural network with multiple output is replaced by
multiple independent neural networks each possessing a one-dimensional output,
which leads to less training time and better training performance. To apply the
machine learning based material model in finite element analysis, the tangent
matrix is derived by the automatic symbolic differentiation tool AceGen. The
effectiveness and generalization of the presented models are investigated by a
series of numerical examples using both 2D and 3D finite element analysis.

Title: The Very Best of Perfect Non-crossing Matchings
Authors: Ioannis Mantas, Marko Savi\'c, Hendrik Schrezenmaier
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  Given a set of points in the plane, we are interested in matching them with
straight line segments. We focus on perfect (all points are matched)
non-crossing (no two edges intersect) matchings. Apart from the well known
MinMax variation, where the length of the longest edge is minimized, we extend
work by looking into different optimization variants such as MaxMin, MinMin,
and MaxMax. We consider both the monochromatic and bichromatic versions of
these problems and provide efficient algorithms for various input point
configurations.

Title: Simulating Lexical Semantic Change from Sense-Annotated Data
Authors: Dominik Schlechtweg and Sabine Schulte im Walde
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: EvoLang, 8 pages
\\
  We present a novel procedure to simulate lexical semantic change from
synchronic sense-annotated data, and demonstrate its usefulness for assessing
lexical semantic change detection models. The induced dataset represents a
stronger correspondence to empirically observed lexical semantic change than
previous synthetic datasets, because it exploits the intimate relationship
between synchronic polysemy and diachronic change. We publish the data and
provide the first large-scale evaluation gold standard for LSC detection
models.

  The development of natural language processing algorithms and the explosive
growth of conversational data are encouraging researches on the human-computer
conversation. Still, getting qualified conversational data on a large scale is
difficult and expensive. In this paper, we verify the feasibility of
constructing a data-driven chatbot with processed online community posts by
using them as pseudo-conversational data. We argue that chatbots for various
purposes can be built extensively through the pipeline exploiting the common
structure of community posts. Our experiment demonstrates that chatbots created
along the pipeline can yield the proper responses.

Title: Learning to Multi-Task Learn for Better Neural Machine Translation
Authors: Poorya Zaremoodi, Gholamreza Haffari
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Scarcity of parallel sentence pairs is a major challenge for training high
quality neural machine translation (NMT) models in bilingually low-resource
scenarios, as NMT is data-hungry. Multi-task learning is an elegant approach to
inject linguistic-related inductive biases into NMT, using auxiliary syntactic
and semantic tasks, to improve generalisation. The challenge, however, is to
devise effective training schedules, prescribing when to make use of the
auxiliary tasks during the training process to fill the knowledge gaps of the
main translation task, a setting referred to as biased-MTL. Current approaches
for the training schedule are based on hand-engineering heuristics, whose
effectiveness vary in different MTL settings. We propose a novel framework for
learning the training schedule, ie learning to multi-task learn, for the MTL
setting of interest. We formulate the training schedule as a Markov decision
process which paves the way to employ policy learning methods to learn the
scheduling policy. We effectively and efficiently learn the training schedule
policy within the imitation learning framework using an oracle policy algorithm
that dynamically sets the importance weights of auxiliary tasks based on their
contributions to the generalisability of the main NMT task. Experiments on
low-resource NMT settings show the resulting automatically learned training
schedulers are competitive with the best heuristics, and lead to up to +1.1
BLEU score improvements.

Title: Machine Learning Approaches for Amharic Parts-of-speech Tagging
Authors: Ibrahim Gashaw and H L. Shashirekha
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG
Comments: 15th International Conference on Natural Language Processing
  (ICON-2018)
\\
  Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is considered as one of the basic but necessary
tools which are required for many Natural Language Processing (NLP)
applications such as word sense disambiguation, information retrieval,
information processing, parsing, question answering, and machine translation.
Performance of the current POS taggers in Amharic is not as good as that of the
contemporary POS taggers available for English and other European languages.
The aim of this work is to improve POS tagging performance for the Amharic
language, which was never above 91%. Usage of morphological knowledge, an
extension of the existing annotated data, feature extraction, parameter tuning
by applying grid search and the tagging algorithms have been examined and
obtained significant performance difference from the previous works. We have
used three different datasets for POS experiments.

Title: Co-evolution of language and agents in referential games
Authors: Gautier Dagan, Dieuwke Hupkes and Elia Bruni
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 10 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Referential games offer a grounded learning environment for neural agents,
that accounts for the functional aspects of language. However, they fail to
account for another fundamental aspect of human language: Because languages are
transmitted from generation to generation, they have to be learnable by new
language users, which makes them subject to cultural evolution. Recent work has
shown that incorporating cultural evolution in referential game results in
considerable improvements in the properties of the languages that emerge in the
game. In this work, we first substantiate this claim with a different data set
and a wider array of evaluation metrics. Then, drawing inspiration from
linguistic theories of human language evolution, we consider a scenario in
which not only cultural but also genetic evolution is integrated. As our core
contribution, we introduce the Language Transmission Engine, in which cultural
evolution of the language is combined with genetic evolution of the agents'
architecture. We show that this co-evolution scenario leads to across-the-board
improvements on all considered metrics. These results stress that cultural
evolution is important for language emergence studies, but also the suitability
of the architecture itself should be considered.

Title: Secure multiparty computations in floating-point arithmetic

Categories: cs.CR cs.IT cs.LG cs.NA math.IT math.NA stat.CO

\\
  Secure multiparty computations enable the distribution of so-called shares of
sensitive data to multiple parties such that the multiple parties can
effectively process the data while being unable to glean much information about
the data (at least not without collusion among all parties to put back together
all the shares). Thus, the parties may conspire to send all their processed
results to a trusted third party (perhaps the data provider) at the conclusion
of the computations, with only the trusted third party being able to view the
final results. Secure multiparty computations for privacy-preserving
machine-learning turn out to be possible using solely standard floating-point
arithmetic, at least with a carefully controlled leakage of information less
than the loss of accuracy due to roundoff, all backed by rigorous mathematical
proofs of worst-case bounds on information loss and numerical stability in
finite-precision arithmetic. Numerical examples illustrate the high performance
attained on commodity off-the-shelf hardware for generalized linear models,
including ordinary linear least-squares regression, binary and multinomial
logistic regression, probit regression, and Poisson regression.

Title: Voltage regulator assisted lightweight countermeasure against fault
  injection attacks
Authors: Ali Vosoughi, Longfei Wang, and Sel\c{c}uk K\"ose
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  The impeccable design of sensitive and cryptographic circuits (CC) against
fault injection attacks is essential for modern data storage, communication,
and computation systems that are susceptible to fault injection attacks. The
robustness of a CC against voltage glitch attacks increases with an on-chip
voltage regulator that considers the impact of topology and component selection
on the fault injection robustness. With an emphasis on increasing the number of
phases in a multiphase voltage regulator and component selection, an on-chip
voltage regulator with multiphase configuration and an optimal operating point
is proposed as a lightweight countermeasure to minimize injected glitches.
Furthermore, an infective countermeasure is added to the on-chip multiphase
voltage regulator that contaminates the computation of the cryptographic
algorithm when a voltage glitch reaches to the CC. By increasing the number of
phases from 1 to 16, the confrontation with fault attacks increases by 52.45%,
which is equal to 91.82% if the number of phases increases to 32. Using the
infective countermeasure for fault resiliency, the security-enhanced CC
provides a robust and resilient solution against fault attacks that improve the
security and availability of the device.

Title: QSOR: Quantum-Safe Onion Routing
Authors: Zsolt Tujner, Thomas Rooijakkers, Maran van Heesch, Melek \"Onen
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  In this work, we propose a study on the use of post-quantum cryptographic
primitives for the Tor network in order to make it safe in a quantum world.
With this aim, the underlying keying material has first been analysed. We
observe that breaking the security of the algorithms/protocols that use long-
and medium-term keys (usually RSA keys) have the highest impact in security.
Therefore, we investigate the cost of quantum-safe variants. These include key
generation, key encapsulation and decapsulation. Six different post-quantum
cryptographic algorithms that ensure level 1 NIST security are evaluated. We
further target the Tor circuit creation operation and evaluate the overhead of
the post-quantum variant. This comparative study is performed through a
reference implementation based on SweetOnions that simulates Tor with slight
simplifications. We show that a quantum-safe Tor circuit creation is possible
and suggest two versions - one that can be used in a purely quantum-safe
setting, and one that can be used in a hybrid setting.

\\
  Unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms aim to transfer the knowledge
learned from one domain to another (e.g., synthetic to real images). The
adapted representations often do not capture pixel-level domain shifts that are
crucial for dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). In this
paper, we present a novel pixel-wise adversarial domain adaptation algorithm.
By leveraging image-to-image translation methods for data augmentation, our key
insight is that while the translated images between domains may differ in
styles, their predictions for the task should be consistent. We exploit this
property and introduce a cross-domain consistency loss that enforces our
adapted model to produce consistent predictions. Through extensive experimental
results, we show that our method compares favorably against the
state-of-the-art on a wide variety of unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.

Comments: This is the full paper for arXiv:1908.04646 with more applications,
  experiments, and ablation study
\\
  We present MatrixNets (xNets), a new deep architecture for object detection.
xNets map objects with similar sizes and aspect ratios into many specialized
layers, allowing xNets to provide a scale and aspect ratio aware architecture.
We leverage xNets to enhance single-stage object detection frameworks. First,
we apply xNets on anchor-based object detection, for which we predict object
centers and regress the top-left and bottom-right corners. Second, we use
MatrixNets for corner-based object detection by predicting top-left and
bottom-right corners. Each corner predicts the center location of the object.
We also enhance corner-based detection by replacing the embedding layer with
center regression. Our final architecture achieves mAP of 47.8 on MS COCO,
which is higher than its CornerNet counterpart by +5.6 mAP while also closing
the gap between single-stage and two-stage detectors. The code is available at

\\
  This paper is about localising a vehicle in an overhead image using FMCW
radar mounted on a ground vehicle. FMCW radar offers extraordinary promise and
efficacy for vehicle localisation. It is impervious to all weather types and
lighting conditions. However the complexity of the interactions between
millimetre radar wave and the physical environment makes it a challenging
domain. Infrastructure-free large-scale radar-based localisation is in its
infancy. Typically here a map is built and suitable techniques, compatible with
the nature of sensor, are brought to bear. In this work we eschew the need for
a radar-based map; instead we simply use an overhead image -- a resource
readily available everywhere. This paper introduces a method that not only
naturally deals with the complexity of the signal type but does so in the
context of cross modal processing.

Title: A Deep Neural Networks Approach for Pixel-Level Runway Pavement Crack
  Segmentation Using Drone-Captured Images
Authors: Liming Jiang, Yuanchang Xie, Tianzhu Ren
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: 13 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Pavement conditions are a critical aspect of asset management and directly
affect safety. This study introduces a deep neural network method called U-Net
for pavement crack segmentation based on drone-captured images to reduce the
cost and time needed for airport runway inspection. The proposed approach can
also be used for highway pavement conditions assessment during off-peak periods
when there are few vehicles on the road. In this study, runway pavement images
are collected using drone at various heights from the Fitchburg Municipal
Airport (FMA) in Massachusetts to evaluate their quality and applicability for
crack segmentation, from which an optimal height is determined. Drone images
captured at the optimal height are then used to evaluate the crack segmentation
performance of the U-Net model. Deep learning methods typically require a huge
set of annotated training datasets for model development, which can be a major
obstacle for their applications. An online annotated pavement image dataset is
used together with the FMA data to train the U-Net model. The results show that
U-Net performs well on the FMA testing data even with limited FMA training
images, suggesting that it has good generalization ability and great potential
to be used for both airport runways and highway pavements.

Title: Image Inpainting by Multiscale Spline Interpolation
Authors: Ghazale Ghorbanzade, Zahra Nabizadeh, Nader Karimi, Shadrokh Samavi
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: six pages and five figures
\\
  Recovering the missing regions of an image is a task that is called image
inpainting. Depending on the shape of missing areas, different methods are
presented in the literature. One of the challenges of this problem is
extracting features that lead to better results. Experimental results show that
both global and local features are useful for this purpose. In this paper, we
propose a multi-scale image inpainting method that utilizes both local and
global features. The first step of this method is to determine how many scales
we need to use, which depends on the width of the lines in the map of the
missing region. Then we apply adaptive image inpainting to the damaged areas of
the image, and the lost pixels are predicted. Each scale is inpainted and the
result is resized to the original size. Then a voting process produces the
final result. The proposed method is tested on damaged images with scratches
and creases. The metric that we use to evaluate our approach is PSNR. On
average, we achieved 1.2 dB improvement over some existing inpainting
approaches.

Title: Visual Question Answering on 360{\deg} Images
Authors: Shih-Han Chou, Wei-Lun Chao, Wei-Sheng Lai, Min Sun, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to WACV 2020
\\
  In this work, we introduce VQA 360, a novel task of visual question answering
on 360 images. Unlike a normal field-of-view image, a 360 image captures the
entire visual content around the optical center of a camera, demanding more
sophisticated spatial understanding and reasoning. To address this problem, we
collect the first VQA 360 dataset, containing around 17,000 real-world
image-question-answer triplets for a variety of question types. We then study
two different VQA models on VQA 360, including one conventional model that
takes an equirectangular image (with intrinsic distortion) as input and one
dedicated model that first projects a 360 image onto cubemaps and subsequently
aggregates the information from multiple spatial resolutions. We demonstrate
that the cubemap-based model with multi-level fusion and attention diffusion
performs favorably against other variants and the equirectangular-based models.
Nevertheless, the gap between the humans' and machines' performance reveals the
need for more advanced VQA 360 algorithms. We, therefore, expect our dataset
and studies to serve as the benchmark for future development in this
challenging task. Dataset, code, and pre-trained models are available online.

Title: RTM3D: Real-time Monocular 3D Detection from Object Keypoints for
  Autonomous Driving
Authors: Peixuan Li, Huaici Zhao, Pengfei Liu, Feidao Cao
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO eess.IV
Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures and 7 tables
\\
  In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate monocular 3D detection
framework in single shot. Most successful 3D detectors take the projection
constraint from the 3D bounding box to the 2D box as an important component.
Four edges of a 2D box provide only four constraints and the performance
deteriorates dramatically with the small error of the 2D detector. Different
from these approaches, our method predicts the nine perspective keypoints of a
3D bounding box in image space, and then utilize the geometric relationship of
3D and 2D perspectives to recover the dimension, location, and orientation in
3D space. In this method, the properties of the object can be predicted stably
even when the estimation of keypoints is very noisy, which enables us to obtain
fast detection speed with a small architecture. Training our method only uses
the 3D properties of the object without the need for external networks or
supervision data. Our method is the first real-time system for monocular image
3D detection while achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI
benchmark. Code will be released at https://github.com/Banconxuan/RTM3D.

Title: NWPU-Crowd: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Crowd Counting
Authors: Qi Wang, Junyu Gao, Wei Lin, Xuelong Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures
\\
  In the last decade, crowd counting attracts much attention of researchers due
to its wide-spread applications, including crowd monitoring, public safety,
space design, etc. Many Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are designed for
tackling this task. However, currently released datasets are so small-scale
that they can not meet the needs of the supervised CNN-based algorithms. To
remedy this problem, we construct a large-scale congested crowd counting
dataset, NWPU-Crowd, consisting of $5,109$ images, in a total of $2,133,238$
annotated heads. Compared with other real-world datasets, it contains various
illumination scenes and has the largest density range ($0\!\sim\!20,033$).
Besides, a benchmark website is developed for impartially evaluating the
different methods, which allows researchers to submit the results of the test
set. Based on the proposed dataset, we further describe the data
characteristics, evaluate the performance of some mainstream state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, and analyze the new problems that arise on the new data. What's
more, NWPU-Crowd Dataset is available at \url{http://www.crowdbenchmark.com/},

Title: Seismic horizon detection with neural networks
Authors: Alexander Koryagin, Darima Mylzenova, Roman Khudorozhkov, Sergey

Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Over the last few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were
successfully adopted in numerous domains to solve various image-related tasks,
ranging from simple classification to fine borders annotation. Tracking seismic
horizons is no different, and there are a lot of papers proposing the usage of
such models to avoid time-consuming hand-picking. Unfortunately, most of them
are (i) either trained on synthetic data, which can't fully represent the
complexity of subterranean structures, (ii) trained and tested on the same
cube, or (iii) lack reproducibility and precise descriptions of the
model-building process. With all that in mind, the main contribution of this
paper is an open-sourced research of applying binary segmentation approach to
the task of horizon detection on multiple real seismic cubes with a focus on
inter-cube generalization of the predictive model.

Title: DSGN: Deep Stereo Geometry Network for 3D Object Detection
Authors: Yilun Chen, Shu Liu, Xiaoyong Shen, Jiaya Jia
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Most state-of-the-art 3D object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR sensors and
there remains a large gap in terms of performance between image-based and
LiDAR-based methods, caused by inappropriate representation for the prediction
in 3D scenarios. Our method, called Deep Stereo Geometry Network (DSGN),
reduces this gap significantly by detecting 3D objects on a differentiable
volumetric representation -- 3D geometric volume, which effectively encodes 3D
geometric structure for 3D regular space. With this representation, we learn
depth information and semantic cues simultaneously. For the first time, we
provide a simple and effective one-stage stereo-based 3D detection pipeline
that jointly estimates the depth and detects 3D objects in an end-to-end
learning manner. Our approach outperforms previous stereo-based 3D detectors
(about 10 higher in terms of AP) and even achieves comparable performance with
a few LiDAR-based methods on the KITTI 3D object detection leaderboard. Code
will be made publicly available.

Title: Improving Image Autoencoder Embeddings with Perceptual Loss
Authors: Gustav Grund Pihlgren (1), Fredrik Sandin (1), Marcus Liwicki (1) ((1)

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Autoencoders are commonly trained using element-wise loss. However,
element-wise loss disregards high-level structures in the image which can lead
to embeddings that disregard them as well. A recent improvement to autoencoders
that help alleviate this problem is the use of perceptual loss. This work
investigate perceptual loss from the perspective of encoder embeddings
themselves. Autoencoders are trained to embed images from three different
computer vision datasets using perceptual loss based on a pretrained model as
well as pixel-wise loss. A host of different predictors are trained to perform
object positioning and classification on the datasets given the embedded images
as input. The two kinds of losses are evaluated by comparing how the predictors
performed with embeddings from the differently trained autoencoders. The
results show that, in the image domain, the embeddings generated by
autoencoders trained with perceptual loss enable more accurate predictions than
those trained with element-wise loss. Furthermore, the results show that, on
the task of object-positioning of a small-scale feature, perceptual loss can
improve the results by a factor 10. The experimental setup is available online:

Title: Matrix-LSTM: a Differentiable Recurrent Surface for Asynchronous
  Event-Based Data
Authors: Marco Cannici, Marco Ciccone, Andrea Romanoni, Matteo Matteucci
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVSs) asynchronously stream events in correspondence
of pixels subject to brightness changes. Differently from classic vision
devices, they produce a sparse representation of the scene. Therefore, to apply
standard computer vision algorithms, events need to be integrated into a frame
or event-surface. This is usually attained through hand-crafted grids that
reconstruct the frame using ad-hoc heuristics. In this paper, we propose
Matrix-LSTM, a grid of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to learn end-to-end
a task-dependent event-surfaces. Compared to existing reconstruction
approaches, our learned event-surface shows good flexibility and expressiveness
improving the baselines on optical flow estimation on the MVSEC benchmark and
the state-of-the-art of event-based object classification on the N-Cars
dataset.

\\
  In recent years, Deep Learning(DL) techniques have been extensively deployed
for computer vision tasks, particularly visual classification problems, where
new algorithms reported to achieve or even surpass the human performance .
While many recent works demonstrated that DL models are vulnerable to
adversarial examples.Fortunately, generating adversarial examples usually
requires white-box access to the victim model, and real-world cloud-based image
classification services are more complex than white-box classifier,the
architecture and parameters of DL models on cloud platforms cannot be obtained
by the attacker. The attacker can only access the APIs opened by cloud
platforms. Thus, keeping models in the cloud can usually give a (false) sense
of security.In this paper, we mainly focus on studying the security of
real-world cloud-based image classification services. Specifically, (1) We
propose two novel attack methods, Image Fusion(IF) attack and Fast Featuremap
Loss PGD (FFL-PGD) attack based on Substitution model ,which achieve a high
bypass rate with a very limited number of queries. Instead of millions of
queries in previous studies, our methods find the adversarial examples using
only two queries per image ; and (2) we make the first attempt to conduct an
extensive empirical study of black-box attacks against real-world cloud-based
classification services. Through evaluations on four popular cloud platforms
including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Clarifai, we demonstrate that Spatial
Transformation (ST) attack has a success rate of approximately 100\% except
Amazon approximately 50\%, IF and FFL-PGD attack have a success rate over 90\%
among different classification services. (3) We discuss the possible defenses
to address these security challenges in cloud-based classification services.Our
defense technology is mainly divided into model training stage and image
preprocessing stage.

Title: Compressive sensing based privacy for fall detection
Authors: Ronak Gupta, Prashant Anand, Santanu Chaudhury, Brejesh Lall, Sanjay
  Singh
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: accepted in NCVPRIPG 2019
\\
  Fall detection holds immense importance in the field of healthcare, where
timely detection allows for instant medical assistance. In this context, we
propose a 3D ConvNet architecture which consists of 3D Inception modules for
fall detection. The proposed architecture is a custom version of Inflated 3D
(I3D) architecture, that takes compressed measurements of video sequence as
spatio-temporal input, obtained from compressive sensing framework, rather than
video sequence as input, as in the case of I3D convolutional neural network.
This is adopted since privacy raises a huge concern for patients being
monitored through these RGB cameras. The proposed framework for fall detection
is flexible enough with respect to a wide variety of measurement matrices. Ten
action classes randomly selected from Kinetics-400 with no fall examples, are
employed to train our 3D ConvNet post compressive sensing with different types
of sensing matrices on the original video clips. Our results show that 3D
ConvNet performance remains unchanged with different sensing matrices. Also,
the performance obtained with Kinetics pre-trained 3D ConvNet on compressively
sensed fall videos from benchmark datasets is better than the state-of-the-art
techniques.

  We release SVIRO, a synthetic dataset for sceneries in the passenger

learning-based approaches for their generalization capacities and reliability
when trained on a limited number of variations (e.g. identical backgrounds and
textures, few instances per class). This is in contrast to the intrinsically
high variability of common benchmark datasets, which focus on improving the
state-of-the-art of general tasks. Our dataset contains bounding boxes for
object detection, instance segmentation masks, keypoints for pose estimation
and depth images for each synthetic scenery as well as images for each
individual seat for classification. The advantage of our use-case is twofold:
The proximity to a realistic application to benchmark new approaches under
novel circumstances while reducing the complexity to a more tractable
environment, such that applications and theoretical questions can be tested on
a more challenging dataset as toy problems. The data and evaluation server are

\\
  Low-rank and sparse decompositions and robust PCA (RPCA) are highly
successful techniques in image processing and have recently found use in
groupwise image registration. In this paper, we investigate the drawbacks of
the most common RPCA-dissimi\-larity metric in image registration and derive an
improved version. In particular, this new metric models low-rank requirements
through explicit constraints instead of penalties and thus avoids the pitfalls
of the established metric. Equipped with total variation regularization, we
present a theoretically justified multilevel scheme based on first-order
primal-dual optimization to solve the resulting non-parametric registration
problem. As confirmed by numerical experiments, our metric especially lends
itself to data involving recurring changes in object appearance and potential
sparse perturbations. We numerically compare its peformance to a number of
related approaches.

Title: Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks with Self-Supervision
Authors: Mathilde Caron, Ari Morcos, Piotr Bojanowski, Julien Mairal and Armand
  Joulin
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE
\\
  Convolutional neural networks trained without supervision come close to
matching performance with supervised pre-training, but sometimes at the cost of
an even higher number of parameters. Extracting subnetworks from these large
unsupervised convnets with preserved performance is of particular interest to
make them less computationally intensive. Typical pruning methods operate
during training on a task while trying to maintain the performance of the
pruned network on the same task. However, in self-supervised feature learning,
the training objective is agnostic on the representation transferability to
downstream tasks. Thus, preserving performance for this objective does not
ensure that the pruned subnetwork remains effective for solving downstream
tasks. In this work, we investigate the use of standard pruning methods,
developed primarily for supervised learning, for networks trained without
labels (i.e. on self-supervised tasks). We show that pruned masks obtained with
or without labels reach comparable performance when re-trained on labels,
suggesting that pruning operates similarly for self-supervised and supervised
learning. Interestingly, we also find that pruning preserves the transfer
performance of self-supervised subnetwork representations.

Title: Video Coding for Machines: A Paradigm of Collaborative Compression and
  Intelligent Analytics
Authors: Ling-Yu Duan, Jiaying Liu, Wenhan Yang, Tiejun Huang, Wen Gao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Video coding, which targets to compress and reconstruct the whole frame, and
feature compression, which only preserves and transmits the most critical
information, stand at two ends of the scale. That is, one with compactness and
efficiency to serve for machine vision, and the other with full fidelity,
bowing to human perception. The recent endeavors in imminent trends of video
compression, e.g. deep learning based coding tools and end-to-end image/video
coding, and MPEG-7 compact feature descriptor standards, i.e. Compact
Descriptors for Visual Search and Compact Descriptors for Video Analysis,
promote the sustainable and fast development in their own directions,
respectively. In this paper, thanks to booming AI technology, e.g. prediction
and generation models, we carry out exploration in the new area, Video Coding
for Machines (VCM), arising from the emerging MPEG standardization efforts.
Towards collaborative compression and intelligent analytics, VCM attempts to
bridge the gap between feature coding for machine vision and video coding for
human vision. Aligning with the rising Analyze then Compress instance Digital
Retina, the definition, formulation, and paradigm of VCM are given first.
Meanwhile, we systematically review state-of-the-art techniques in video
compression and feature compression from the unique perspective of MPEG
standardization, which provides the academic and industrial evidence to realize
the collaborative compression of video and feature streams in a broad range of
AI applications. Finally, we come up with potential VCM solutions, and the
preliminary results have demonstrated the performance and efficiency gains.
Further direction is discussed as well.

Title: In Defense of Grid Features for Visual Question Answering
Authors: Huaizu Jiang, Ishan Misra, Marcus Rohrbach, Erik Learned-Miller,
  Xinlei Chen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Popularized as 'bottom-up' attention, bounding box (or region) based visual
features have recently surpassed vanilla grid-based convolutional features as
the de facto standard for vision and language tasks like visual question
answering (VQA). However, it is not clear whether the advantages of regions
(e.g. better localization) are the key reasons for the success of bottom-up
attention. In this paper, we revisit grid features for VQA and find they can
work surprisingly well-running more than an order of magnitude faster with the
same accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we verify that this observation
holds true across different VQA models, datasets, and generalizes well to other
tasks like image captioning. As grid features make the model design and
training process much simpler, this enables us to train them end-to-end and
also use a more flexible network design. We learn VQA models end-to-end, from
pixels directly to answers, and show that strong performance is achievable
without using any region annotations in pre-training. We hope our findings help
further improve the scientific understanding and the practical application of
VQA. Code and features will be made available.

Title: Theory In, Theory Out: How social theory can solve problems that machine

Authors: Jason Radford and Kenneth Joseph
Categories: cs.CY cs.LG
\\
  Research at the intersection of machine learning and the social sciences has
provided critical new insights into social behavior. At the same time, scholars
have identified myriad ways in which machine learning, when applied without
care, can also lead to incorrect and harmful claims about people (e.g. about
the biological nature of sexuality), and/or to discriminatory outcomes. Here,
we argue that such issues arise primarily because of the lack of, or misuse of,
social theory. Walking through every step of the machine learning pipeline, we
identify ways in which social theory must be involved in order to address
problems that technology alone cannot solve, and provide a pathway towards the
use of theory to this end.

Title: A Complex Networks Approach to Find Latent Clusters of Terrorist Groups

\\
  Given the extreme heterogeneity of actors and groups participating in
terrorist actions, investigating and assessing their characteristics can be
important to extract relevant information and enhance the knowledge on their
behaviors. The present work will seek to achieve this goal via a complex
networks approach. This approach will allow finding latent clusters of similar
terror groups using information on their operational characteristics.
Specifically, using open access data of terrorist attacks occurred worldwide
from 1997 to 2016, we build a multi-partite network that includes terrorist
groups and related information on tactics, weapons, targets, active regions. We
propose a novel algorithm for cluster formation that expands our earlier work
that solely used Gower's coefficient of similarity via the application of Von
Neumann entropy for mode-weighting. This novel approach is compared with our
previous Gower-based method and a heuristic clustering technique that only
focuses on groups' ideologies. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the
entropy-based approach tends to reliably reflect the structure of the data that
naturally emerges from the baseline Gower-based method. Additionally, it
provides interesting results in terms of behavioral and ideological
characteristics of terrorist groups. We furthermore show that the
ideology-based procedure tends to distort or hide existing patterns. Among the
main statistical results, our work reveals that groups belonging to opposite
ideologies can share very common behaviors and that Islamist/jihadist groups
hold peculiar behavioral characteristics with respect to the others.
Limitations and potential work directions are also discussed, introducing the
idea of a dynamic entropy-based framework.

Title: Ethics of Technology needs more Political Philosophy
Authors: Johannes Himmelreich
Categories: cs.CY
ACM-class: K.4.0; K.4.1

\\
  The ongoing debate on the ethics of self-driving cars typically focuses on
two approaches to answering ethical questions: moral philosophy and social
science. I argue that these two approaches are both lacking. We should neither
deduce answers from individual moral theories nor should we expect social
science to give us complete answers. To supplement these approaches, we should
turn to political philosophy. The issues we face are collective decisions that
we make together rather than individual decisions we make in light of what we
each have reason to value. Political philosophy adds three basic concerns to
our conceptual toolkit: reasonable pluralism, human agency, and legitimacy.
These three concerns have so far been largely overlooked in the debate on the
ethics of self-driving cars.

Title: Measuring Women Representation and Impact in Films over Time
Authors: Luoying Yang, Zhou Xu, Jiebo Luo
Categories: cs.CY cs.SI
Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICWSM 20
\\
  Women have always been underrepresented in movies and not until recently do
women representation in movies improve. To investigate the improvement of women
representation and its relationship with a movie's success, we propose a new
measure, the female cast ratio, and compare it to the commonly used Bechdel
test result. We employ generalized linear regression with $L_1$ penalty and a
Random Forest model to identify the predictors that are influential on women
representation, and evaluate the relationship between women representation and
a movie's success in three aspects: revenue/budget ratio, rating and
popularity. Three important findings in our study have highlighted the
difficulties women in the film industry face in both upstream and downstream.
First, female filmmakers especially female screenplay writers are instrumental
for movies to have better women representation, but the percentage of female
filmmakers has been very low. Second, lower budgets are often made to support
movies that could tell good stories about women, and this usually cause the
films to in turn receive more criticisms. Finally, the demand for better women
presentation from moviegoers has also not been strong enough to compel the film
industry for a change, as movies that have poor women representation can still
be very popular and successful in the box office.

Title: Should Artificial Intelligence Governance be Centralised? Design Lessons
  from History
Authors: Peter Cihon, Matthijs M. Maas, Luke Kemp
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
Comments: A shorter version of the paper is to be published in the proceedings
  of AAAI/ACM AIES 2020
\\
  Can effective international governance for artificial intelligence remain
fragmented, or is there a need for a centralised international organisation for
AI? We draw on the history of other international regimes to identify
advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some
considerations, such as efficiency and political power, speak in favour of
centralisation. Conversely, the risk of creating a slow and brittle institution
speaks against it, as does the difficulty in securing participation while
creating stringent rules. Other considerations depend on the specific design of
a centralised institution. A well-designed body may be able to deter forum
shopping and ensure policy coordination. However, forum shopping can be
beneficial and a fragmented landscape of institutions can be self-organising.
Centralisation entails trade-offs and the details matter. We conclude with two
core recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a
central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set of
coherent issues could be beneficial. But locking-in an inadequate structure may
pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second, for now fragmentation will likely
persist. This should be closely monitored to see if it is self-organising or
simply inadequate.

Title: Designing a Bit-Based Model to Accelerate Query Processing Over
  Encrypted Databases in Cloud
Authors: Sultan Almakdi and Brajendra Panda
Categories: cs.DB cs.CR
Comments: 19 pages, Accepted at CloudComp 2019 - 9th EAI International
  Conference on Cloud Computing, Sydney, Australia, December 4-5, 2019
\\
  Database users have started moving toward the use of cloud computing as a
service because it provides computation and storage needs at affordable prices.
However, for most of the users, the concern of privacy plays a major role as
they cannot control data access once their data are outsourced, especially if
the cloud provider is curious about their data. Data encryption is an effective
way to solve privacy concerns, but executing queries over encrypted data is a
problem that needs attention. In this research, we introduce a bit-based model
to execute different relational algebra operators over encrypted databases at
the cloud without decrypting the data. To encrypt data, we use the randomized
encryption algorithm (Advanced Encryption Standard-CBC) to provide the
maximum-security level. The idea is based on classifying attributes as
sensitive and non-sensitive, where only sensitive attributes are encrypted. For
each sensitive attribute, the table owner predefined the possible partition
domains on which the tuples will be encoded into bit vectors before the
encryption. We store the bit vectors in an additional column(s) in the
encrypted table in the cloud. We use those bits to retrieve only part of
encrypted records that are candidates for a specific query. We implemented and
evaluated our model and found that the proposed model is practical and success
to minimize the range of the retrieved encrypted records to less than 30
percent of the whole set of encrypted records in a table.

  In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of the new geotagged
media management system. A large amount of daily geo-tagged media data
generated by user's smart phone, mobile device, dash cam and camera. Geotagged
media, such as geovideos and geophotos, can be captured with spatial temporal
information such as time, location, visible area, camera direction, moving
direction and visible distance information. Due to the increase in geo-tagged
multimedia data, the researches for efficient managing and mining geo-tagged
multimedia are newly expected to be a new area in database and data mining.
This paper proposes a geo-tagged media management system, so called Open
GeoCMS(Geotagged media Contents Management System). Open GeoCMS is a new
framework to manage geotagged media data on the web. Our framework supports
various types which are for moving point, moving photo - a sequence of photos
by a drone, moving double and moving video. Also, GeoCMS has the label viewer
and editor system for photos and videos. The Open GeoCMS have been developed as
an open source system.

Title: Trace Clustering on Very Large Event Data in Healthcare Using Frequent

\\
  Trace clustering has increasingly been applied to find homogenous process
executions. However, current techniques have difficulties in finding a
meaningful and insightful clustering of patients on the basis of healthcare
data. The resulting clusters are often not in line with those of medical
experts, nor do the clusters guarantee to help return meaningful process maps
of patients' clinical pathways. After all, a single hospital may conduct
thousands of distinct activities and generate millions of events per year. In
this paper, we propose a novel trace clustering approach by using sample sets
of patients provided by medical experts. More specifically, we learn frequent
sequence patterns on a sample set, rank each patient based on the patterns, and
use an automated approach to determine the corresponding cluster. We find each
cluster separately, while the frequent sequence patterns are used to discover a
process map. The approach is implemented in ProM and evaluated using a large
data set obtained from a university medical center. The evaluation shows
F1-scores of 0.7 for grouping kidney injury, 0.9 for diabetes, and 0.64 for
head/neck tumor, while the process maps show meaningful behavioral patterns of
the clinical pathways of these groups, according to the domain experts.

Title: Self-stabilizing Uniform Reliable Broadcast
Authors: Oskar Lundstr\"om and Michel Raynal and Elad M. Schiller
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  We study a well-known communication abstraction called Uniform Reliable
Broadcast (URB). URB is central in the design and implementation of
fault-tolerant distributed systems, as many non-trivial fault-tolerant
distributed applications require communication with provable guarantees on
message deliveries. Our study focuses on fault-tolerant implementations for
time-free message-passing systems that are prone to node-failures. Moreover, we
aim at the design of an even more robust communication abstraction. We do so
through the lenses of self-stabilization---a very strong notion of
fault-tolerance. In addition to node and communication failures,
self-stabilizing algorithms can recover after the occurrence of arbitrary
transient faults; these faults represent any violation of the assumptions
according to which the system was designed to operate (as long as the algorithm
code stays intact).
  This work proposes the first self-stabilizing URB solution for time-free
message-passing systems that are prone to node-failures. The proposed algorithm
has an O(bufferUnitSize) stabilization time (in terms of asynchronous cycles)
from arbitrary transient faults, where bufferUnitSize is a predefined constant
that can be set according to the available memory. Moreover, the communication
costs of our algorithm are similar to the ones of the non-self-stabilizing
state-of-the-art. The main differences are that our proposal considers repeated
gossiping of O(1) bits messages and deals with bounded space (which is a
prerequisite for self-stabilization). Specifically, each node needs to store up
to bufferUnitSize n records and each record is of size O(v + n log n) bits,
where n is the number of nodes in the system and v is the number of bits needed
to encode a single URB instance.

Title: RMWPaxos: Fault-Tolerant In-Place Consensus Sequences
Authors: Jan Skrzypczak, Florian Schintke, Thorsten Sch\"utt
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Building consensus sequences based on distributed, fault-tolerant consensus,
as used for replicated state machines, typically requires a separate
distributed state for every new consensus instance. Allocating and maintaining
this state causes significant overhead. In particular, freeing the distributed,
outdated states in a fault-tolerant way is not trivial and adds further
complexity and overhead to the system. In this paper, we propose an extension
to the single-decree Paxos protocol that can learn a sequence of consensus
decisions 'in-place', i.e., with a single set of distributed states. Our
protocol does not require dynamic log structures and hence has no need for
distributed log pruning, snapshotting, compaction, or dynamic resource
allocation. The protocol builds a fault-tolerant atomic register that supports
arbitrary read-modify-write operations. We use the concept of consistent
quorums to detect whether the previous consensus still needs to be consolidated
or is already finished so that the next consensus value can be safely proposed.
Reading a consolidated consensus is done without state modification and is
thereby free of concurrency control and demand for serialisation. A proposer
that is not interrupted reaches agreement on consecutive consensuses within a
single message round-trip per consensus decision by preparing the acceptors
eagerly with the preceding request.

Title: An Efficient Universal Construction for Large Objects
Authors: Panagiota Fatourou, Nikolaos D. Kallimanis and Eleni Kanellou
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  This paper presents L-UC, a universal construction that efficiently
implements dynamic objects of large state in a wait-free manner. The step
complexity of L-UC is O(n+kw), where n is the number of processes, k is the
interval contention (i.e., the maximum number of active processes during the
execution interval of an operation), and w is the worst-case time complexity to
perform an operation on the sequential implementation of the simulated object.
L-UC efficiently implements objects whose size can change dynamically. It
improves upon previous universal constructions either by efficiently handling
objects whose state is large and can change dynamically, or by achieving better
step complexity.

\\
  Recent breakthroughs in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have fueled a growing
demand for DNN chips. However, designing DNN chips is non-trivial because: (1)
mainstream DNNs have millions of parameters and operations; (2) the large
design space due to the numerous design choices of dataflows, processing
elements, memory hierarchy, etc.; and (3) an algorithm/hardware co-design is
needed to allow the same DNN functionality to have a different decomposition,
which would require different hardware IPs to meet the application
specifications. Therefore, DNN chips take a long time to design and require
cross-disciplinary experts. To enable fast and effective DNN chip design, we
propose AutoDNNchip - a DNN chip generator that can automatically generate both
FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN chip implementation given DNNs from machine learning
frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) for a designated application and dataset.
Specifically, AutoDNNchip consists of two integrated enablers: (1) a Chip
Predictor, built on top of a graph-based accelerator representation, which can
accurately and efficiently predict a DNN accelerator's energy, throughput, and
area based on the DNN model parameters, hardware configuration,
technology-based IPs, and platform constraints; and (2) a Chip Builder, which
can automatically explore the design space of DNN chips (including IP
selection, block configuration, resource balancing, etc.), optimize chip design
via the Chip Predictor, and then generate optimized synthesizable RTL to
achieve the target design metrics. Experimental results show that our Chip
Predictor's predicted performance differs from real-measured ones by < 10% when
validated using 15 DNN models and 4 platforms (edge-FPGA/TPU/GPU and ASIC).
Furthermore, accelerators generated by our AutoDNNchip can achieve better (up
to 3.86X improvement) performance than that of expert-crafted state-of-the-art
accelerators.

Title: OO-VR: NUMA Friendly Object-Oriented VR Rendering Framework For Future
  NUMA-Based Multi-GPU Systems
Authors: Chenhao Xie, Xin Fu, Mingsong Chen, Shuaiwen Leon Song
Categories: cs.DC cs.GR
DOI: 10.1145/3307650.3322247
\\
  With the strong computation capability, NUMA-based multi-GPU system is a
promising candidate to provide sustainable and scalable performance for Virtual
Reality. However, the entire multi-GPU system is viewed as a single GPU which
ignores the data locality in VR rendering during the workload distribution,
leading to tremendous remote memory accesses among GPU models. By conducting
comprehensive characterizations on different kinds of parallel rendering
frameworks, we observe that distributing the rendering object along with its
required data per GPM can reduce the inter-GPM memory accesses. However, this
object-level rendering still faces two major challenges in NUMA-based multi-GPU
system: (1) the large data locality between the left and right views of the
same object and the data sharing among different objects and (2) the unbalanced
workloads induced by the software-level distribution and composition
mechanisms. To tackle these challenges, we propose object-oriented VR rendering
framework (OO-VR) that conducts the software and hardware co-optimization to
provide a NUMA friendly solution for VR multi-view rendering in NUMA-based
multi-GPU systems. We first propose an object-oriented VR programming model to
exploit the data sharing between two views of the same object and group objects
into batches based on their texture sharing levels. Then, we design an object
aware runtime batch distribution engine and distributed hardware composition
unit to achieve the balanced workloads among GPMs. Finally, evaluations on our
VR featured simulator show that OO-VR provides 1.58x overall performance
improvement and 76% inter-GPM memory traffic reduction over the
state-of-the-art multi-GPU systems. In addition, OO-VR provides NUMA friendly
performance scalability for the future larger multi-GPU scenarios with ever
increasing asymmetric bandwidth between local and remote memory.

Title: Assignment-based Path Choice Estimation for Metro Systems Using Smart
  Card Data
Authors: Baichuan Mo, Zhenliang Ma, Haris N. Koutsopoulosc, Jinhua Zhao
Categories: cs.DS stat.AP
\\
  Urban rail services are the principal means of public transportation in many
cities. To understand the crowding patterns and develop efficient operation
strategies in the system, obtaining path choices is important. This paper
proposed an assignment-based path choice estimation framework using automated
fare collection (AFC) data. The framework captures the inherent correlation of
crowding among stations, as well as the interaction between path choice and
left behind. The path choice estimation is formulated as an optimization
problem. The original problem is intractable because of a non-analytical
constraint and a non-linear equation constraint. A solution procedure is
proposed to decompose the original problem into three tractable sub-problems,
which can be solved efficiently. The model is validated using both synthetic
data and real-world AFC data in Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system.
The synthetic data test validates the model's effectiveness in estimating path
choice parameters, which can outperform the purely simulation-based
optimization methods in both accuracy and efficiency. The test results using
actual data show that the estimated path shares are more reasonable than
survey-derived path shares and uniform path shares. Model robustness in terms
of different initial values and different case study dates are also verified.

Title: Optimal dynamic information provision in traffic routing
Authors: Emily Meigs, Francesca Parise, Asuman Ozdaglar, Daron Acemoglu
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  We consider a two-road dynamic routing game where the state of one of the
roads (the "risky road") is stochastic and may change over time. This generates
room for experimentation. A central planner may wish to induce some of the
(finite number of atomic) agents to use the risky road even when the expected
cost of travel there is high in order to obtain accurate information about the
state of the road. Since agents are strategic, we show that in order to
generate incentives for experimentation the central planner however needs to
limit the number of agents using the risky road when the expected cost of
travel on the risky road is low. In particular, because of congestion, too much
use of the risky road when the state is favorable would make experimentation no
longer incentive compatible. We characterize the optimal incentive compatible
recommendation system, first in a two-stage game and then in an
infinite-horizon setting. In both cases, this system induces only partial,
rather than full, information sharing among the agents (otherwise there would
be too much exploitation of the risky road when costs there are low).

\\
  State-of-the-art drone technologies have severe flight time limitations due
to weight constraints, which inevitably lead to a relatively small amount of
available energy. Therefore, frequent battery replacement or recharging is
necessary in applications such as delivery, exploration, or support to the
wireless infrastructure. Mobile charging stations (i.e., mobile stations with
charging equipment) for outdoor ad-hoc battery charging is one of the feasible
solutions to address this issue. However, the ability of these platforms to
charge the drones is limited in terms of the number and charging time. This
paper designs an auction-based mechanism to control the charging schedule in
multi-drone setting. In this paper, charging time slots are auctioned, and
their assignment is determined by a bidding process. The main challenge in
developing this framework is the lack of prior knowledge on the distribution of
the number of drones participating in the auction. Based on optimal
second-price-auction, the proposed formulation, then, relies on deep learning
algorithms to learn such distribution online. Numerical results from extensive
simulations show that the proposed deep learning-based approach provides
effective battery charging control in multi-drone scenarios.

\\
  As robots become more prevalent, the importance of the field of human-robot
interaction (HRI) grows accordingly. As such, we should endeavor to employ the
best statistical practices. Likert scales are commonly used metrics in HRI to
measure perceptions and attitudes. Due to misinformation or honest mistakes,
most HRI researchers do not adopt best practices when analyzing Likert data. We
conduct a review of psychometric literature to determine the current standard
for Likert scale design and analysis. Next, we conduct a survey of four years
of the International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (2016 through 2019)
and report on incorrect statistical practices and design of Likert scales.
During these years, only 3 of the 110 papers applied proper statistical testing
to correctly-designed Likert scales. Our analysis suggests there are areas for
meaningful improvement in the design and testing of Likert scales. Lastly, we
provide recommendations to improve the accuracy of conclusions drawn from
Likert data.

Title: Du Bois Wrapped Bar Chart: Visualizing categorical data with

Authors: Alireza Karduni, Ryan Wesslen, Isaac Cho, Wenwen Dou
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 10 pages, 14 figures
\\
  We propose a visualization technique, Du Bois wrapped bar chart, inspired by
work of W.E.B Du Bois. Du Bois wrapped bar charts enable better large-to-small
bar comparison by wrapping large bars over a certain threshold. We first
present two crowdsourcing experiments comparing wrapped and standard bar charts
to evaluate (1) the benefit of wrapped bars in helping participants identify
and compare values; (2) the characteristics of data most suitable for wrapped
bars. In the first study (n=98) using real-world datasets, we find that wrapped
bar charts lead to higher accuracy in identifying and estimating ratios between
bars. In a follow-up study (n=190) with 13 simulated datasets, we find
participants were consistently more accurate with wrapped bar charts when
certain category values are disproportionate as measured by entropy and
H-spread. Finally, in an in-lab study, we investigate participants' experience
and strategies, leading to guidelines for when and how to use wrapped bar
charts.

Title: Optimal Sensor Position for a Computer Mouse
Authors: Sunjun Kim, Byungjoo Lee, Thomas van Gemert, Antti Oulasvirta

\\
  Computer mice have their displacement sensors in various locations (center,
front, and rear). However, there has been little research into the effects of
sensor position or on engineering approaches to exploit it. This paper first
discusses the mechanisms via which sensor position affects mouse movement and
reports the results from a study of a pointing task in which the sensor
position was systematically varied. Placing the sensor in the center turned out
to be the best compromise: improvements over front and rear were in the 11--14%
range for throughput and 20--23% for path deviation. However, users varied in
their personal optima. Accordingly, variable-sensor-position mice are then
presented, with a demonstration that high accuracy can be achieved with two
static optical sensors. A virtual sensor model is described that allows
software-side repositioning of the sensor. Individual-specific calibration
should yield an added 4% improvement in throughput over the default center
position.

Title: Open Domain Question Answering Using Web Tables
Authors: Kaushik Chakrabarti, Zhimin Chen, Siamak Shakeri, Guihong Cao
Categories: cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  Tables extracted from web documents can be used to directly answer many web
search queries. Previous works on question answering (QA) using web tables have
focused on factoid queries, i.e., those answerable with a short string like
person name or a number. However, many queries answerable using tables are
non-factoid in nature. In this paper, we develop an open-domain QA approach
using web tables that works for both factoid and non-factoid queries. Our key
insight is to combine deep neural network-based semantic similarity between the
query and the table with features that quantify the dominance of the table in
the document as well as the quality of the information in the table. Our
experiments on real-life web search queries show that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline approaches. Our solution is
used in production in a major commercial web search engine and serves direct
answers for tens of millions of real user queries per month.

Title: Linking Social Media Posts to News with Siamese Transformers

\\
  Many computational social science projects examine online discourse
surrounding a specific trending topic. These works often involve the
acquisition of large-scale corpora relevant to the event in question to analyze
aspects of the response to the event. Keyword searches present a
precision-recall trade-off and crowd-sourced annotations, while effective, are
costly. This work aims to enable automatic and accurate ad-hoc retrieval of
comments discussing a trending topic from a large corpus, using only a handful
of seed news articles.

Title: Securing Distributed Function Approximation via Coding for Continuous
  Compound Channels
Authors: Matthias Frey, Igor Bjelakovi\'c and S{\l}awomir Sta\'nczak
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  We revisit the problem of distributed approximation of functions over
multiple-access channels. Contrary to previous works, however, we do not
consider the approximation problem itself, but instead we propose a method of
incorporating security constraints into a class of approximation schemes to
protect against passive eavesdropping. We specifically consider a scenario in
which the jamming signal is stronger for the legitimate receiver than it is for
the eavesdropper, and we show that in this case jamming techniques are feasible
in the sense that they can deteriorate the eavesdropper's signal while not
affecting the usefulness of the legitimate receiver's signal. Key ingredients
for our scheme are channel resolvability as well as a newly proven result for
coding for compound channels with continuous alphabets which is more general
than similar results from prior works and may thus be of independent interest.

Title: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Multi-antenna Downlink Communication
  Systems: Spectral and Energy Efficiency Tradeoff
Authors: Gui Zhou and Yijie Mao and Bruno Clerckx
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Rate-splitting (RS) has recently been recognized as a promising
physical-layer technique for multi-antenna broadcast channels (BC). Due to its
ability to partially decode the interference and partially treat the remaining
interference as noise, RS is an enabler for a powerful multiple access, namely
rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), that has been shown to achieve higher
spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) than both space division
multiple access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in a wide
range of user deployments and network loads. As SE maximization and EE
maximization are two conflicting objectives, the study of the tradeoff between
the two criteria is of particular interest. In this work, we address the SE-EE
tradeoff by studying the joint SE and EE maximization problem of RSMA in
multiple input single output (MISO) BC with rate-dependent circuit power
consumption at the transmitter. To tackle the challenges coming from multiple
objective functions and rate-dependent circuit power consumption, we first
propose two methods to transform the original problem into a single-objective
problem, namely, weighted-sum method and weighted-power method. A successive
convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is then proposed to jointly optimize
the precoders and RS message split of the transformed problem. Numerical
results show that our algorithm converges much faster than existing algorithms.
In addition, the performance of RS is superior to or equal to non-RS strategy
in terms of both SE and EE and their tradeoff.

Title: Gaussian Approximation of Quantization Error for Estimation from
  Compressed Data
Authors: Alon Kipnis, Galen Reeves
Categories: cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
\\
  We consider the distributional connection between the lossy compressed
representation of a high-dimensional signal $X$ using a random spherical code
and the observation of $X$ under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). We
show that the Wasserstein distance between a bitrate-$R$ compressed version of
$X$ and its observation under an AWGN-channel of signal-to-noise ratio
$2^{2R}-1$ is sub-linear in the problem dimension. We utilize this fact to
connect the risk of an estimator based on an AWGN-corrupted version of $X$ to
the risk attained by the same estimator when fed with its bitrate-$R$ quantized
version. We demonstrate the usefulness of this connection by deriving various
novel results for inference problems under compression constraints, including
noisy source coding and limited-bitrate parameter estimation.

Title: Online Estimation and Adaptation for Random Access with Successive
  Interference Cancellation
Authors: Sang-Woon Jeon and Hu Jin
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ISIT 2020
\\
  This paper proposes an adaptive transmission algorithm for slotted random
access systems supporting the successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the
access point (AP). When multiple users transmit packets simultaneously in a
slot, owing to the SIC technique, the AP is able to decode them through SIC
resolve procedures (SRPs), which may occupy multiple consequent slots. While
such an SRP could potentially improve the system throughput, how to fully
exploit this capability in practical systems is still questionable. In
particular, the number of active users contending for the channel varies over
time which complicates the algorithm design. By fully exploiting the potential
of SIC, the proposed algorithm is designed to maximize the system throughput
and minimize the access delay. For this purpose, an online estimation is
introduced to estimate the number of active users in real-time and controls
their transmissions accordingly. It is shown that the throughput of the
proposed algorithm can reach up to 0.693 packets/slot under practical
assumptions, which is the first result achieving the throughput limit proved by
Yu-Giannakis. It is further shown that the system throughput of 0.559
packets/slot (80.6$\%$ of the throughput limit) is still achievable when the
SIC capability is restricted by two.

Title: Energy-Minimizing Bit Allocation For Powerline OFDM With Multiple Delay
  Constraints
Authors: Kaemmatat Jiravanstit and Wiroonsak Santipach
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  We propose a bit-allocation scheme for powerline orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) that minimizes total transmit energy
subject to total-bit and delay constraints. Multiple delay requirements stem
from different sets of data that a transmitter must time-multiplex and transmit
to a receiver. The proposed bit allocation takes into account the channel
power-to-noise density ratio of subchannels as well as statistic of narrowband
interference and impulsive noise that is pervasive in powerline communication
(PLC) channels. The proposed scheme is optimal with 1 or 2 sets of data, and is
suboptimal with more than 2 sets of data. However, numerical examples show that
the proposed scheme performs close to the optimum. Also, it is less
computationally complex than the optimal scheme especially when minimizing
total energy over large number of data sets. We also compare the proposed
scheme with some existing schemes and find that our scheme requires less total
transmit energy when the number of delay constraints is large.

Title: Simultaneous Signal-and-Interference Alignment for Two-Cell Over-the-Air
  Computation
Authors: Qiao Lan, Hyo Seung Kang, Kaibin Huang
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  The next-generation wireless networks are envisioned to support large-scale
sensing and distributed machine learning, thereby enabling new intelligent
mobile applications. One common network operation will be the aggregation of
distributed data (such as sensor observations or AI-model updates) for
functional computation (e.g., averaging) so as to support large-scale sensing
and distributed machine learning. An efficient solution for data aggregation,
called "over-the-air computation" (AirComp), embeds functional computation into
simultaneous access by many edge devices. Such schemes exploit the waveform
superposition of a multi-access channel to allow an access point to receive a
desired function of simultaneous signals. In this work, we aim at realizing
AirComp in a two-cell multi-antenna system. To this end, a novel scheme of
simultaneous signal-and-interference alignment (SIA) is proposed that builds on
classic IA to manage interference for multi-cell AirComp. The principle of SIA
is to divide the spatial channel space into two subspaces with equal
dimensions: one for signal alignment required by AirComp and the other for
inter-cell IA. As a result, the number of interference-free spatially
multiplexed functional streams received by each AP is maximized (equal to half
of the available spatial degrees-of-freedom). Furthermore, the number is
independent of the population of devices in each cell. In addition, the
extension to SIA for more than two cells is discussed.

Title: Error Probability Analysis of NOMA-based Diamond Relaying Network
Authors: Ferdi Kara and Hakan Kaya
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
DOI: 10.1109/TVT.2019.2956199
\\
  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based cooperative relaying systems
(CRS) are very promising to overcome spectral inefficiency of conventional
cooperative communications. Although NOMA-CRS have great recent attention,
almost all studies investigate NOMA-CRS only in terms of capacity and outage
probability. Error performances of NOMA-CRS have not been well-studied. In this
paper, we analyze error performance of NOMA-based diamond relaying network
(NOMA-DRN) with imperfect successive interference canceler (SIC) as a NOMA-CRS
scheme. We derive exact bit error probability (BEP) for NOMA-DRN and provide a
tight approximated BEP in the closed-form. In addition, high-SNR analysis is
conducted to present that NOMA-DRN has an error floor. Moreover, it is proved
that NOMA-DRN turns out to be a non-equiprobable communication system and we
derive priori probabilities of symbols. All derived expressions are validated
via computer simulations.

Title: Two Applications of Deep Learning in the Physical Layer of Communication
  Systems
Authors: Emil Bj\"ornson and Pontus Giselsson
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures, submitted as a lecture note to IEEE Signal
  Processing Magazine
\\
  Deep learning has proved itself to be a powerful tool to develop data-driven
signal processing algorithms for challenging engineering problems. By learning
the key features and characteristics of the input signals, instead of requiring
a human to first identify and model them, learned algorithms can beat many
man-made algorithms. In particular, deep neural networks are capable of
learning the complicated features in nature-made signals, such as photos and
audio recordings, and use them for classification and decision making.
  The situation is rather different in communication systems, where the
information signals are man-made, the propagation channels are relatively easy
to model, and we know how to operate close to the Shannon capacity limits. Does
this mean that there is no role for deep learning in the development of future
communication systems?

Title: Computable Lower Bounds for Capacities of Input-Driven Finite-State
  Channels
Authors: V. Arvind Rameshwar and Navin Kashyap
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, submitted to International Symposium on
  Information Theory, 2020
\\
  This paper studies the capacities of input-driven finite-state channels,
i.e., channels whose current state is a time-invariant deterministic function
of the previous state and the current input. We lower bound the capacity of
such a channel using a dynamic programming formulation of a bound on the
maximum reverse directed information rate. We show that the dynamic
programming-based bounds can be simplified by solving the corresponding Bellman
equation explicitly. In particular, we provide analytical lower bounds on the
capacities of $(d, k)$-runlength-limited input-constrained binary symmetric and
binary erasure channels. Furthermore, we provide a single-letter lower bound
based on a class of input distributions with memory.

Title: DNA Linear Block Codes: Generation, Error-detection and Error-correction
  of DNA Codeword

\\
  In modern age, the increasing complexity of computation and communication
technology is leading us towards the necessity of new paradigm. As a result,
unconventional approach like DNA coding theory is gaining considerable
attention. The storage capacity, information processing and transmission
properties of DNA molecules stimulate the notion of DNA coding theory as well
as DNA cryptography. In this paper we generate DNA codeword using DNA (n, k)
linear block codes which ensures the secure transmission of information. In the
proposed code design strategy DNA-based XOR operation (DNAX) is applied for
effective construction of DNA codewords which are quadruples generated over the
set of alphabets {A,T,G,C}. By worked out examples we explain the use of
generator matrix and parity check matrix in encryption and decryption of coded
data in the form of short single stranded DNA sequences. The newly developed
technique is capable of detecting as well as correcting error in transmission
of DNA codewords from sender to the intended receiver.

information bit has $k$ mutually disjoint recovery sets. The main problem under
this paradigm is to minimize the number of encoded bits given the values of $s$

Title: Wiretap channels with causal state information: revisited
Authors: Te Sun Han and Masahide Sasaki
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  The coding problem for wiretap channels with causal channel state information
(CSI) available at the encoder (Alice) and/or the decoder (Bob) is studied. We
are concerned here particularily with the problem of achievable secret-message
secret-key rate pairs under the semantic security criterion. Our main result
extends all the previous results on achievable rates as given by Chia and El
Gamal [10], Fujita [11], and Han and Sasaki [23]. In order to do this, we first
derive a unifying theorem (Theorem 2) with causal CSI at Alice, which follows
immediately by leveraging the unifying seminal theorem for wiretap channels
with non-causal CSI at Alice as recently established by Bunin et al. [22]. The
only thing to do here is just to re-interpret the latter non-causal one in a
causal manner. A prominent feature of this approach is that we are able to
dispense with the block-Markov encoding scheme as used in the previous works.
Also, the exact secret-message key capacity region for wiretap channels with
non-causal CSI at both Alice and Bob is given.

Title: Variable-Length Coding for Zero-Error Channel Capacity
Authors: Nicolas Charpenay and Ma\"el Le Treust
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  The zero-error channel capacity is the maximum asymptotic rate that can be
reached with error probability exactly zero, instead of a vanishing error
probability. The nature of this problem, essentially combinatorial rather than
probabilistic, has led to various researches both in Information Theory and
Combinatorics. However, the zero-error capacity is still an open problem, for
example the capacity of the noisy-typewriter channel with 7 letters is unknown.
In this article, we propose a new approach to construct optimal zero-error
codes, based on the concatenation of words of variable-length, taken from a
generator set. Three zero-error variable-length coding schemes, referred to as
"variable-length coding", "intermingled coding" and "automata-based coding",
are under study. We characterize their asymptotic performances via linear
difference equations, in terms of simple properties of the generator set, e.g.
the roots of the characteristic polynomial, the spectral radius of an adjacency
matrix, the inverse of the convergence radius of a generator series. For a
specific example, we construct an "intermingled" coding scheme that achieves
asymptotically the zero-error capacity.

Comments: 33 pages, to be submitted to TIT, a short version submitted to ISIT

\\
  Coded caching has the potential to greatly reduce network traffic by
leveraging the cheap and abundant storage available in end-user devices so as
to create multicast opportunities in the delivery phase. In the seminal work by
Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN), the shared-link coded caching problem was
formulated, where each user demands one file (i.e., single file retrieval).
This paper generalizes the MAN problem so as to allow users to request scalar
linear functions of the files. This paper proposes a novel coded delivery
scheme that, based on MAN uncoded cache placement, is shown to allow for the
decoding of arbitrary scalar linear functions of the files (on arbitrary finite
fields). Interestingly, and quite surprisingly, it is shown that the load for
cache-aided scalar linear function retrieval depends on the number of linearly
independent functions that are demanded, akin to the cache-aided single-file
retrieval problem where the load depends on the number of distinct file
requests. The proposed scheme is optimal under the constraint of uncoded cache
placement, in terms of worst-case load, and within a factor 2 otherwise. The
key idea of this paper can be extended to all scenarios which the original MAN
scheme has been extended to, including demand-private and/or device-to-device
settings.

Title: Authentication Against a Myopic Adversary
Authors: Allison Beemer, Eric Graves, Joerg Kliewer, Oliver Kosut, Paul Yu
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  We consider keyless authentication for point-to-point communication in the
presence of a myopic adversary. In particular, the adversary has access to a
non-causal noisy version of the transmission and may use this knowledge to
choose the channel state of an arbitrarily-varying channel between legitimate
users; the receiver is successful if it either decodes to the correct message
or correctly detects adversarial interference. We show that a channel condition
called U-overwritability, which allows the adversary to make its false message
appear legitimate and untampered with, is a sufficient condition for zero
authentication capacity. We present a useful way to compare adversarial
channels, and show that once an AVC becomes U-overwritable, it remains
U-overwritable for all "less myopic" adversaries. Finally, we show that
stochastic encoders are necessary for positive authentication capacity in some
cases, and examine in detail a binary adversarial channel that illustrates this
necessity. Namely, for this binary channel, we show that when the adversarial
channel is degraded with respect to the main channel between users, the
no-adversary capacity of the underlying channel is achievable with a
deterministic encoder. Otherwise, provided the channel to the adversary is not
perfect, a stochastic encoder is necessary for positive authentication
capacity; if such an encoder is allowed, the no-adversary capacity is again
achievable.

Title: A Collaborative Learning Framework via Federated Meta-Learning
Authors: Sen Lin, Guang Yang and Junshan Zhang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Many IoT applications at the network edge demand intelligent decisions in a
real-time manner. The edge device alone, however, often cannot achieve
real-time edge intelligence due to its constrained computing resources and
limited local data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a platform-aided
collaborative learning framework where a model is first trained across a set of
source edge nodes by a federated meta-learning approach, and then it is rapidly
adapted to learn a new task at the target edge node, using a few samples only.
Further, we investigate the convergence of the proposed federated meta-learning
algorithm under mild conditions on node similarity and the adaptation
performance at the target edge. To combat against the vulnerability of
meta-learning algorithms to possible adversarial attacks, we further propose a
robust version of the federated meta-learning algorithm based on
distributionally robust optimization, and establish its convergence under mild
conditions. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed Federated Meta-Learning based framework.

  This paper studies structured sparse training of CNNs with a gradual pruning
technique that leads to fixed, sparse weight matrices after a set number of
epochs. We simplify the structure of the enforced sparsity so that it reduces
overhead caused by regularization. The proposed training methodology Campfire
explores pruning at granularities within a convolutional kernel and filter.
  We study various tradeoffs with respect to pruning duration, level of
sparsity, and learning rate configuration. We show that our method creates a
sparse version of ResNet-50 and ResNet-50 v1.5 on full ImageNet while remaining
within a negligible <1% margin of accuracy loss. To ensure that this type of
sparse training does not harm the robustness of the network, we also
demonstrate how the network behaves in the presence of adversarial attacks. Our
results show that with 70% target sparsity, over 75% top-1 accuracy is
achievable.

Title: Internal representation dynamics and geometry in recurrent neural
  networks
Authors: Stefan Horoi, Guillaume Lajoie and Guy Wolf
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE math.DS
\\
  The efficiency of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in dealing with sequential
data has long been established. However, unlike deep, and convolution networks
where we can attribute the recognition of a certain feature to every layer, it
is unclear what "sub-task" a single recurrent step or layer accomplishes. Our
work seeks to shed light onto how a vanilla RNN implements a simple
classification task by analysing the dynamics of the network and the geometric
properties of its hidden states. We find that early internal representations
are evocative of the real labels of the data but this information is not
directly accessible to the output layer. Furthermore the network's dynamics and
the sequence length are both critical to correct classifications even when
there is no additional task relevant information provided.

Title: Backdoor Attacks against Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Deep
  Learning Models

\\
  Transfer learning, that transfer the learned knowledge of pre-trained Teacher
models over large datasets via fine-tuning, provides an effective solution for
feasibly and fast customize accurate Student models. Many pre-trained Teacher
models are publicly available and maintained by public platforms, increasing
their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate a
backdoor threat to transfer learning tasks on both image and time-series data
leveraging the knowledge of publicly accessible Teacher models, aimed at
defeating three commonly-adopted defenses: pruning-based, retraining-based and
input pre-processing-based defenses. Specifically, (A) ranking-based selection
mechanism to speed up the backdoor trigger generation and perturbation process
while defeating pruning-based and/or retraining-based defenses. (B)
autoencoder-powered trigger generation is proposed to produce a robust trigger
that can defeat the input pre-processing-based defense, while guaranteeing that
selected neuron(s) can be significantly activated. (C) defense-aware retraining
to generate the manipulated model using reverse-engineered model inputs. We use
the real-world image and bioelectric signal analytics applications to
demonstrate the power of our attack and conduct a comprehensive empirical
analysis of the possible factors that affect the attack. The
efficiency/effectiveness and feasibility/easiness of such attacks are validated
by empirically evaluating the state-of-the-art image, Electroencephalography
(EEG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) learning systems.

Title: Probabilistic K-means Clustering via Nonlinear Programming
Authors: Yujian Li, Bowen Liu, Zhaoying Liu, and Ting Zhang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures
\\
  K-means is a classical clustering algorithm with wide applications. However,
soft K-means, or fuzzy c-means at m=1, remains unsolved since 1981. To address
this challenging open problem, we propose a novel clustering model, i.e.
Probabilistic K-Means (PKM), which is also a nonlinear programming model
constrained on linear equalities and linear inequalities. In theory, we can
solve the model by active gradient projection, while inefficiently. Thus, we
further propose maximum-step active gradient projection and fast maximum-step
active gradient projection to solve it more efficiently. By experiments, we
evaluate the performance of PKM and how well the proposed methods solve it in
five aspects: initialization robustness, clustering performance, descending
stability, iteration number, and convergence speed.

  While deep neural net inference was considered a task for servers only,
latest advances in technology allow the task of inference to be moved to mobile
and embedded devices, desired for various reasons ranging from latency to
privacy. These devices are not only limited by their compute power and battery,
but also by their inferior physical memory and cache, and thus, an efficient
memory manager becomes a crucial component for deep neural net inference at the
edge. In this paper, we explore various strategies to smartly share memory
buffers among intermediate tensors in deep neural networks. Employing these can
result in up to 10.5x smaller memory footprint than running inference without
one and up to 11% smaller memory consumption than the state of the art.

Title: Guess First to Enable Better Compression and Adversarial Robustness
Authors: Sicheng Zhu, Bang An, Shiyu Niu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by NeurIPS 2019 workshop on Information Theory and Machine
  Learning
\\
  Machine learning models are generally vulnerable to adversarial examples,
which is in contrast to the robustness of humans. In this paper, we try to
leverage one of the mechanisms in human recognition and propose a bio-inspired
classification framework in which model inference is conditioned on label
hypothesis. We provide a class of training objectives for this framework and an
information bottleneck regularizer which utilizes the advantage that label
information can be discarded during inference. This framework enables better
compression of the mutual information between inputs and latent representations
without loss of learning capacity, at the cost of tractable inference
complexity. Better compression and elimination of label information further
bring better adversarial robustness without loss of natural accuracy, which is
demonstrated in the experiment.

Title: Adaptive Anomaly Detection for IoT Data in Hierarchical Edge Computing
Authors: Mao V. Ngo, Hakima Chaouchi, Tie Luo, Tony Q.S. Quek
Categories: cs.LG cs.NI stat.ML
Comments: To be published in the AAAI Workshop on Artificial Intelligence of
  Things (AIoT), Feb 2020
\\
  Advances in deep neural networks (DNN) greatly bolster real-time detection of
anomalous IoT data. However, IoT devices can barely afford complex DNN models
due to limited computational power and energy supply. While one can offload
anomaly detection tasks to the cloud, it incurs long delay and requires large
bandwidth when thousands of IoT devices stream data to the cloud concurrently.
In this paper, we propose an adaptive anomaly detection approach for
hierarchical edge computing (HEC) systems to solve this problem. Specifically,
we first construct three anomaly detection DNN models of increasing complexity,
and associate them with the three layers of HEC from bottom to top, i.e., IoT
devices, edge servers, and cloud. Then, we design an adaptive scheme to select
one of the models based on the contextual information extracted from input
data, to perform anomaly detection. The selection is formulated as a contextual
bandit problem and is characterized by a single-step Markov decision process,
with an objective of achieving high detection accuracy and low detection delay
simultaneously. We evaluate our proposed approach using a real IoT dataset, and
demonstrate that it reduces detection delay by 84% while maintaining almost the
same accuracy as compared to offloading detection tasks to the cloud. In
addition, our evaluation also shows that it outperforms other baseline schemes.

Title: Temporally Folded Convolutional Neural Networks for Sequence Forecasting
Authors: Matthias Weissenbacher
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IJCAI 2020 Proceedings
\\
  In this work we propose a novel approach to utilize convolutional neural
networks for time series forecasting. The time direction of the sequential data
with spatial dimensions $D=1,2$ is considered democratically as the input of a
spatiotemporal $(D+1)$-dimensional convolutional neural network. Latter then
reduces the data stream from $D +1 \to D$ dimensions followed by an
incriminator cell which uses this information to forecast the subsequent time
step. We empirically compare this strategy to convolutional LSTM's and LSTM's
on their performance on the sequential MNIST and the JSB chorals dataset,
respectively. We conclude that temporally folded convolutional neural networks
(TFC's) may outperform the conventional recurrent strategies.

Title: Learning credit assignment

Categories: cs.LG cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.NC stat.ML
Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, a generalized BackProp proposed to learn credit
  assignment from an network ensemble perspective
\\
  Deep learning has achieved impressive prediction accuracies in a variety of
scientific and industrial domains. However, the nested non-linear feature of
deep learning makes the learning highly non-transparent, i.e., it is still
unknown how the learning coordinates a huge number of parameters to achieve a
decision making. To explain this hierarchical credit assignment, we propose a
mean-field learning model by assuming that an ensemble of sub-networks, rather
than a single network, are trained for a classification task. Surprisingly, our
model reveals that apart from some deterministic synaptic weights connecting
two neurons at neighboring layers, there exist a large number of connections
that can be absent, and other connections can allow for a broad distribution of
their weight values. Therefore, synaptic connections can be classified into
three categories: very important ones, unimportant ones, and those of
variability that may partially encode nuisance factors. Therefore, our model
learns the credit assignment leading to the decision, and predicts an ensemble
of sub-networks that can accomplish the same task, thereby providing insights
toward understanding the macroscopic behavior of deep learning through the lens
of distinct roles of synaptic weights.

Title: Inductive Document Network Embedding with Topic-Word Attention
Authors: Robin Brochier, Adrien Guille and Julien Velcin
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL cs.IR stat.ML
\\
  Document network embedding aims at learning representations for a structured
text corpus i.e. when documents are linked to each other. Recent algorithms
extend network embedding approaches by incorporating the text content
associated with the nodes in their formulations. In most cases, it is hard to
interpret the learned representations. Moreover, little importance is given to
the generalization to new documents that are not observed within the network.
In this paper, we propose an interpretable and inductive document network
embedding method. We introduce a novel mechanism, the Topic-Word Attention
(TWA), that generates document representations based on the interplay between
word and topic representations. We train these word and topic vectors through
our general model, Inductive Document Network Embedding (IDNE), by leveraging
the connections in the document network. Quantitative evaluations show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various networks and we
qualitatively show that our model produces meaningful and interpretable
representations of the words, topics and documents.

Title: microbatchGAN: Stimulating Diversity with Multi-Adversarial
  Discrimination
Authors: Gon\c{c}alo Mordido, Haojin Yang, Christoph Meinel
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV stat.ML
Comments: WACV 2020
\\
  We propose to tackle the mode collapse problem in generative adversarial
networks (GANs) by using multiple discriminators and assigning a different
portion of each minibatch, called microbatch, to each discriminator. We
gradually change each discriminator's task from distinguishing between real and
fake samples to discriminating samples coming from inside or outside its
assigned microbatch by using a diversity parameter $\alpha$. The generator is
then forced to promote variety in each minibatch to make the microbatch
discrimination harder to achieve by each discriminator. Thus, all models in our
framework benefit from having variety in the generated set to reduce their
respective losses. We show evidence that our solution promotes sample diversity
since early training stages on multiple datasets.

Title: SUPAID: A Rule mining based method for automatic rollout decision aid
  for supervisors in fleet management systems
Authors: Sahil Manchanda, Arun Rajkumar, Simarjot Kaur, Narayanan Unny
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  The decision to rollout a vehicle is critical to fleet management companies
as wrong decisions can lead to additional cost of maintenance and failures
during journey. With the availability of large amount of data and advancement
of machine learning techniques, the rollout decisions of a supervisor can be
effectively automated and the mistakes in decisions made by the supervisor
learnt. In this paper, we propose a novel learning algorithm SUPAID which under
a natural 'one-way efficiency' assumption on the supervisor, uses a rule mining
approach to rank the vehicles based on their roll-out feasibility thus helping
prevent the supervisor from makingerroneous decisions. Our experimental results
on real data from a public transit agency from a city in U.S show that the
proposed method SUPAID can result in significant cost savings.

Title: Debate Dynamics for Human-comprehensible Fact-checking on Knowledge

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL stat.ML
Comments: AAAI 2019 Fall Symposium Series. arXiv admin note: substantial text
  overlap with arXiv:2001.00461
\\
  We propose a novel method for fact-checking on knowledge graphs based on
debate dynamics. The underlying idea is to frame the task of triple
classification as a debate game between two reinforcement learning agents which
extract arguments -- paths in the knowledge graph -- with the goal to justify
the fact being true (thesis) or the fact being false (antithesis),
respectively. Based on these arguments, a binary classifier, referred to as the
judge, decides whether the fact is true or false. The two agents can be
considered as sparse feature extractors that present interpretable evidence for
either the thesis or the antithesis. In contrast to black-box methods, the
arguments enable the user to gain an understanding for the decision of the
judge. Moreover, our method allows for interactive reasoning on knowledge
graphs where the users can raise additional arguments or evaluate the debate
taking common sense reasoning and external information into account. Such
interactive systems can increase the acceptance of various AI applications
based on knowledge graphs and can further lead to higher efficiency,
robustness, and fairness.

Title: Explaining the Explainer: A First Theoretical Analysis of LIME
Authors: Damien Garreau, Ulrike von Luxburg
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted to AISTATS 2020
\\
  Machine learning is used more and more often for sensitive applications,
sometimes replacing humans in critical decision-making processes. As such,
interpretability of these algorithms is a pressing need. One popular algorithm
to provide interpretability is LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic
Explanation). In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of LIME.
We derive closed-form expressions for the coefficients of the interpretable
model when the function to explain is linear. The good news is that these
coefficients are proportional to the gradient of the function to explain: LIME
indeed discovers meaningful features. However, our analysis also reveals that
poor choices of parameters can lead LIME to miss important features.

Title: What is the Value of Data? On Mathematical Methods for Data Quality
  Estimation
Authors: Netanel Raviv, Siddharth Jain, Jehoshua Bruck
Categories: cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
\\
  Data is one of the most important assets of the information age, and its
societal impact is undisputed. Yet, rigorous methods of assessing the quality
of data are lacking. In this paper, we propose a formal definition for the
quality of a given dataset. We assess a dataset's quality by a quantity we call
the expected diameter, which measures the expected disagreement between two
randomly chosen hypotheses that explain it, and has recently found applications
in active learning. We focus on Boolean hyperplanes, and utilize a collection
of Fourier analytic, algebraic, and probabilistic methods to come up with
theoretical guarantees and practical solutions for the computation of the
expected diameter. We also study the behaviour of the expected diameter on
algebraically structured datasets, conduct experiments that validate this
notion of quality, and demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques.

Title: A sequential resource investment planning framework using reinforcement

  expansion
Authors: S. Tsianikas, N. Yousefi, J. Zhou, M. Rodgers, D. W. Coit
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  A model and expansion plan have been developed to optimally determine
microgrid designs as they evolve to dynamically react to changing conditions
and to exploit energy storage capabilities. In the wake of the highly
electrified future ahead of us, the role of energy storage is crucial wherever
distributed generation is abundant, such as microgrid settings. Given the
variety of storage options that are recently becoming more economical,
determining which type of storage technology to invest in, along with the
appropriate timing and capacity becomes a critical research question. In
problems where the investment timing is of high priority, like this one,
developing analytical and systematic frameworks for rigorously considering
these issues is indispensable. From a business perspective, these strategic
frameworks will aim to optimize the process of investment planning, by
leveraging novel approaches and by capturing all the problem details that
traditional approaches are unable to. Reinforcement learning algorithms have
recently proven to be successful in problems where sequential decision-making
is inherent. In the operations planning area, these algorithms are already used
but mostly in short-term problems with well-defined constraints and low levels
of uncertainty modeling. On the contrary, in this work, we expand and tailor
these techniques to long-term investment planning by utilizing model-free
approaches, like the Q-learning algorithm, combined with simulation-based
models. We find that specific types of energy storage units, including the
vanadium-redox battery, can be expected to be at the core of the future
microgrid applications, and therefore, require further attention. Another key
finding is that the optimal storage capacity threshold for a system depends
heavily on the price movements of the available storage units in the market.

Title: Autoencoding undirected molecular graphs with neural networks
Authors: Jeppe Johan Waarkj{\ae}r Olsen, Peter Ebert Christensen, Martin
  Hangaard Hansen, and Alexander Rosenberg Johansen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose a machine learning model, inspired by language modeling from
natural language processing, which can automatically correct molecules in
discrete representations using a structure rule learned from a collection of
undirected molecular graphs. Using discrete representations of molecules allows
cheap, fast, and coarse grained insights. We introduce an adaption on a modern
neural network architecture, the Transformer, which can learn relationships
between atoms and bonds. The algorithm thereby solves the unsupervised task of
recovering partially observed molecules represented as undirected graphs. This
is to our knowledge, the first work that can automatically learn any discrete
molecular structure rule with input exclusively consisting of a training set of
molecules. In this work the neural network successfully approximates the octet
rule, relations in hypervalent molecules and ions when trained on the ZINC and
QM9 dataset. These results provides encouraging evidence that neural networks
can learn advanced molecular structure rules and dataset specific properties,
as the transformer surpasses a strong octet-rule baseline.

\\
  With the rising costs of conventional sources of energy, the world is moving
towards sustainable energy sources including wind energy. Wind turbines consist
of several electrical and mechanical components and experience an enormous
amount of irregular loads, making their operational behaviour at times
inconsistent. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is a key factor in monitoring
such inconsistent behaviour of the turbines in order to predict and prevent any
incipient faults which may occur in the near future. Machine learning has been
applied to the domain of wind energy over the last decade for analysing,
diagnosing and predicting wind turbine faults. In particular, we follow the
idea of modelling a turbine's performance as a power curve where any power
outputs that fall off the curve can be seen as performance errors. Existing
work using this idea has used data from a turbine's Supervisory Control &
Acquisition (SCADA) system to filter and analyse fault & alarm data using
regression techniques. In contrast to previous work, we explore how deep
learning can be applied to fault prediction from open access meteorological
data only.

all the devices and the distributed resources and renewable resources are
embedded which leads to reduce cost. A smart energy management system,
Transactive management (TM) is a concept to improve the efficiency and
reliability of the power system. The aim of this article is to look for the
current development of TM methods based on AI and Machine Learning (ML)
technology. In AI paradigm, MultiAgent System (MAS) based method is an active
research area and are still in evolution. Hence this article describes how MAS
based method applied in TM. This paper also finds that MAS based method faces
major difficulty to design or set up goal to various agents and describes how
ML technique can contribute to that solution. A brief comparison analysis
between MAS and ML techniques are also presented. At the end, this article
summarizes the most relevant open challenges and issues on the AI based methods
for transactive energy management.

  In multi-agent systems, complex interacting behaviors arise due to the high
correlations among agents. However, previous work on modeling multi-agent
interactions from demonstrations is primarily constrained by assuming the
independence among policies and their reward structures. In this paper, we cast
the multi-agent interactions modeling problem into a multi-agent imitation
learning framework with explicit modeling of correlated policies by
approximating opponents' policies, which can recover agents' policies that can
regenerate similar interactions. Consequently, we develop a Decentralized
Adversarial Imitation Learning algorithm with Correlated policies (CoDAIL),
which allows for decentralized training and execution. Various experiments
demonstrate that CoDAIL can better regenerate complex interactions close to the
demonstrators and outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent imitation learning
methods.

  Criminal organizations exploit their presence on territories and local
communities to recruit new workforce in order to carry out their criminal
activities and business. The ability to attract individuals is crucial for
maintaining power and control over the territories in which these groups are
settled. This study proposes the formalization, development and analysis of an
agent-based model (ABM) that simulates a neighborhood of Palermo (Sicily) with
the aim to understand the pathways that lead individuals to recruitment into
organized crime groups (OCGs). Using empirical data on social, economic and
criminal conditions of the area under analysis, we use a multi-layer network
approach to simulate this scenario. As the final goal, we test different
policies to counter recruitment into OCGs. These scenarios are based on two
different dimensions of prevention and intervention: (i) primary and secondary
socialization and (ii) law enforcement targeting strategies.

Title: Adaptive Control of Embedding Strength in Image Watermarking using
  Neural Networks

\\
  Digital image watermarking has been widely used in different applications
such as copyright protection of digital media, such as audio, image, and video
files. Two opposing criteria of robustness and transparency are the goals of
watermarking methods. In this paper, we propose a framework for determining the
appropriate embedding strength factor. The framework can use most DWT and DCT
based blind watermarking approaches. We use Mask R-CNN on the COCO dataset to
find a good strength factor for each sub-block. Experiments show that this
method is robust against different attacks and has good transparency.

Title: QoE-driven Coupled Uplink and Downlink Rate Adaptation for 360-degree
  Video Live Streaming
Authors: Jie Li, Ransheng Feng, Zhi Liu, Wei Sun, Qiyue Li
Categories: cs.MM
\\
  360-degree video provides an immersive 360-degree viewing experience and has
been widely used in many areas. The 360-degree video live streaming systems
involve capturing, compression, uplink (camera to video server) and downlink
(video server to user) transmissions. However, few studies have jointly
investigated such complex systems, especially the rate adaptation for the
coupled uplink and downlink in the 360-degree video streaming under limited
bandwidth constraints. In this letter, we propose a quality of experience
(QoE)-driven 360-degree video live streaming system, in which a video server
performs rate adaptation based on the uplink and downlink bandwidths and
information concerning each user's real-time field-of-view (FOV). We formulate
it as a nonlinear integer programming problem and propose an algorithm, which
combines the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition and branch and bound method, to
solve it. The numerical results show that the proposed optimization model can
improve users' QoE significantly in comparison with other baseline schemes.

Title: Exploratory Study on User's Dynamic Visual Acuity and Quality Perception

Categories: cs.MM cs.HC

\\
  In this paper we assess the impact of head movement on user's visual acuity
and their quality perception of impaired images. There are physical limitations
on the amount of visual information a person can perceive and physical
limitations regarding the speed at which our body, and as a consequence our
head, can explore a scene. In these limitations lie fundamental solutions for
the communication of multimedia systems. As such, subjects were asked to
evaluate the perceptual quality of static images presented on a TV screen while
their head was in a dynamic (moving) state. The idea is potentially applicable
to virtual reality applications and therefore, we also measured the image
quality perception of each subject on a head mounted display. Experiments show
the significant decrease in visual acuity and quality perception when the
user's head is not static, and give an indication on how much the quality can
be reduced without the user noticing any impairments.

Title: The $\mathbf{Q}$-tensor Model with Uniaxial Constraint
Authors: Juan Pablo Borthagaray and Shawn W. Walker
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This chapter is about the modeling of nematic liquid crystals (LCs) and their
numerical simulation. We begin with an overview of the basic physics of LCs and
discuss some of their many applications. Next, we delve into the modeling
arguments needed to obtain macroscopic order parameters which can be used to
formulate a continuum model. We then survey different continuum descriptions,
namely the Oseen-Frank, Ericksen, and Landau-deGennes ($\mathbf{Q}$-tensor)
models, which essentially model the LC material like an anisotropic elastic
material. In particular, we review the mathematical theory underlying the three
different continuum models and highlight the different trade-offs of using
these models.
  Next, we consider the numerical simulation of these models with a survey of
various methods, with a focus on the Ericksen model. We then show how
techniques from the Ericksen model can be combined with the Landau-deGennes
model to yield a $\mathbf{Q}$-tensor model that exactly enforces uniaxiality,
which is relevant for modeling many nematic LC systems. This is followed by an
in-depth numerical analysis, using tools from $\Gamma$-convergence, to justify
our discrete method. We also show several numerical experiments and comparisons
with the standard Landau-deGennes model.

Title: Linearizations for interpolation bases -- a comparison I

\\
  One strategy to solve a nonlinear eigenvalue problem $T(\lambda)x=0$ is to
solve a polynomial eigenvalue problem (PEP) $P(\lambda)x=0$ that approximates
the original problem through interpolation. Then, this PEP is usually solved by
linearization. Most of the literature about linearizations assumes that
$P(\lambda)$ is expressed in the monomial basis but, because of the polynomial
approximation techniques, in this context, $P(\lambda)$ is expressed in a
non-monomial basis. The bases used with most frequency are the Chebyshev basis,
the Newton basis and the Lagrange basis. In this paper we construct a family of
linearizations of $P(\lambda)$ that is easy to construct from the matrix
coefficients of $P(\lambda)$ when this polynomial is expressed in any of those
three bases. We also provide recovery formulas of eigenvectors (when
$P(\lambda)$ is regular) and recovery formulas of minimal bases and minimal
indices (when $P(\lambda)$ is singular). Our ultimate goal is to compare the
numerical behavior of these linearizations, within the same family (to select
the best one) and with the linearizations of other families based on the
location of the eigenvalues with respect to the interpolation nodes.

\\
  We propose a novel composite framework that enables finding unknown fields in
the context of inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs). We
blend the high expressibility of deep neural networks as universal function
estimators with the accuracy and reliability of existing numerical algorithms
for partial differential equations. Our design brings together techniques of
computational mathematics, machine learning and pattern recognition under one
umbrella to seamlessly incorporate any domain-specific knowledge and insights
through modeling. The network is explicitly aware of the governing physics
through a hard-coded PDE solver stage; this subsequently focuses the
computational load to only the discovery of the hidden fields. In addition,
techniques of pattern recognition and surface reconstruction are used to
further represent the unknown fields in a straightforward fashion. Most
importantly, our inverse-PDE solver allows effortless integration of
domain-specific knowledge about the physics of underlying fields, such as
symmetries and proper basis functions. We call this approach Blended
Inverse-PDE Networks (hereby dubbed BIPDE-Nets) and demonstrate its
applicability on recovering the variable diffusion coefficient in Poisson
problems in one and two spatial dimensions. We also show that this approach is
robust to noise.

Title: Fault Tolerance for Service Function Chains
Authors: Milad Ghaznavi, Elaheh Jalalpour, Bernard Wong, Raouf Boutaba
Categories: cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Traffic in enterprise networks typically traverses a sequence of middleboxes
forming a service function chain, or simply a chain. The ability to tolerate
failures when they occur along chains is imperative to the availability and
reliability of enterprise applications. Service outages due to chain failures
severely impact customers and cause significant financial losses. Making a
chain fault-tolerant is challenging since, in the case of failures, the state
of faulty middleboxes must be correctly and quickly recovered while providing
high throughput and low latency. In this paper, we present FTC, a novel system
design and protocol for fault-tolerant service function chaining. FTC provides
strong consistency with up to f middlebox failures for chains of length f + 1
or longer without requiring dedicated replica nodes. In FTC, state updates
caused by packet processing at a middlebox are collected, piggybacked onto the
packet, and sent along the chain to be replicated. We implement and evaluate a
prototype of FTC. Our results for a chain of 2-5 middleboxes show that FTC
improves throughput by 2-3.5x compared with state of the art [50] and adds only
20 us latency overhead per middlebox. In a geo-distributed Cloud deployment,
our system recovers lost state in ~271 ms.

Title: Joint Time Scheduling and Transaction Fee Selection in Blockchain-based
  RF-Powered Backscatter Cognitive Radio Network
Authors: Tran The Anh, Nguyen Cong Luong, Zehui Xiong, Dusit Niyato, and Dong
  In Kim
Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
\\
  In this paper, we develop a new framework called blockchain-based Radio
Frequency (RF)-powered backscatter cognitive radio network. In the framework,
IoT devices as secondary transmitters transmit their sensing data to a
secondary gateway by using the RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio
technology. The data collected at the gateway is then sent to a blockchain
network for further verification, storage and processing. As such, the
framework enables the IoT system to simultaneously optimize the spectrum usage
and maximize the energy efficiency. Moreover, the framework ensures that the
data collected from the IoT devices is verified, stored and processed in a
decentralized but in a trusted manner. To achieve the goal, we formulate a
stochastic optimization problem for the gateway under the dynamics of the
primary channel, the uncertainty of the IoT devices, and the unpredictability
of the blockchain environment. In the problem, the gateway jointly decides (i)
the time scheduling, i.e., the energy harvesting time, backscatter time, and
transmission time, among the IoT devices, (ii) the blockchain network, and
(iii) the transaction fee rate to maximize the network throughput while
minimizing the cost. To solve the stochastic optimization problem, we then
propose to employ, evaluate, and assess the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
with Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (D3QN) to derive the optimal policy for the
gateway. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed solution
outperforms the conventional baseline approaches such as the conventional
Q-Learning algorithm and non-learning algorithms in terms of network throughput
and convergence speed. Furthermore, the proposed solution guarantees that the
data is stored in the blockchain network at a reasonable cost.

\\
  Solidity is the dominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
This paper presents a high-level formalization of the Solidity language with a
focus on the memory model. The presented formalization covers all features of
the language related to managing state and memory. In addition, the
formalization we provide is effective: all but few features can be encoded in
the quantifier-free fragment of standard SMT theories. This enables precise and
efficient reasoning about the state of smart contracts written in Solidity. The
formalization is implemented in the solc-verify verifier and we provide an
extensive set of tests that covers the breadth of the required semantics. We
also provide an evaluation on the test set that validates the semantics and
shows the novelty of the approach compared to other Solidity-level contract
analysis tools.

Title: Multi-layer Optimizations for End-to-End Data Analytics
Authors: Amir Shaikhha, Maximilian Schleich, Alexandru Ghita, Dan Olteanu
Categories: cs.PL cs.DB cs.LG
\\
  We consider the problem of training machine learning models over
multi-relational data. The mainstream approach is to first construct the
training dataset using a feature extraction query over input database and then
use a statistical software package of choice to train the model. In this paper
we introduce Iterative Functional Aggregate Queries (IFAQ), a framework that
realizes an alternative approach. IFAQ treats the feature extraction query and
the learning task as one program given in the IFAQ's domain-specific language,
which captures a subset of Python commonly used in Jupyter notebooks for rapid
prototyping of machine learning applications. The program is subject to several
layers of IFAQ optimizations, such as algebraic transformations, loop
transformations, schema specialization, data layout optimizations, and finally
compilation into efficient low-level C++ code specialized for the given
workload and data.
  We show that a Scala implementation of IFAQ can outperform mlpack, Scikit,
and TensorFlow by several orders of magnitude for linear regression and
regression tree models over several relational datasets.

\\
  Aerial Cable Towed Systems (ACTS) are composed of several Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) connected to a payload by cables. Compared to towing objects
from individual aerial vehicles, an ACTS has significant advantages such as
heavier payload capacity, modularity, and full control of the payload pose.
They are however generally large with limited ability to meet geometric
constraints while avoiding collisions between UAVs. This paper presents the
modelling, performance analysis, design, and a proposed controller for a novel
ACTS with variable cable lengths, named Variable Aerial Cable Towed System
(VACTS).Winches are embedded on the UAVs for actuating the cable lengths
similar to a Cable-Driven Parallel Robot to increase the versatility of the
ACTS. The general geometric, kinematic and dynamic models of the VACTS are
derived, followed by the development of a centralized feedback linearization
controller. The design is based on a wrench analysis of the VACTS, without
constraining the cables to pass through the UAV center of mass, as in current
works. Additionally, the performance of the VACTS and ACTS are compared showing
that the added versatility comes at the cost of payload and configuration
flexibility. A prototype confirms the feasibility of the system.

Title: Are you still with me? Continuous Engagement Assessment from a Robot's
  Point of View
Authors: Francesco Del Duchetto, Paul Baxter, Marc Hanheide
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Continuously measuring the engagement of users with a robot in a Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) setting paves the way towards in-situ reinforcement learning,
improve metrics of interaction quality, and can guide interaction design and
behaviour optimisation. However, engagement is often considered very
multi-faceted and difficult to capture in a workable and generic computational
model that can serve as an overall measure of engagement. Building upon the
intuitive ways humans successfully can assess situation for a degree of
engagement when they see it, we propose a novel regression model (utilising CNN
and LSTM networks) enabling robots to compute a single scalar engagement during
interactions with humans from standard video streams, obtained from the point
of view of an interacting robot. The model is based on a long-term dataset from
an autonomous tour guide robot deployed in a public museum, with continuous
annotation of a numeric engagement assessment by three independent coders. We
show that this model not only can predict engagement very well in our own
application domain but show its successful transfer to an entirely different
dataset (with different tasks, environment, camera, robot and people). The
trained model and the software is available to the HRI community as a tool to
measure engagement in a variety of settings.

Title: Real-Time Long Range Trajectory Replanning for UAVs in Presence of
  Dynamics Obstacles
Authors: Geesara Kulathunga, Roman Fedorenko, Sergey Kopylov, Alexandr Klimchik
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Real-time long-range local planning is a challenging task, especially in the
presence of dynamics obstacles. We propose a complete system which is capable
of performing the local replanning in real-time. It requires to provide the
desired trajectory to be followed in the system initialization phase.
Subsequently, it starts initializing sub-components of the system including
point cloud processor, trajectory estimator and planner. Afterwards, the
multi-rotary aerial vehicle starts moving on the given trajectory. When it
detects obstacles, it replans the trajectory from the current pose to
pre-defined distance incorporating the desired trajectory. Point cloud
processor is employed to identify the closest obstacles around the vehicle. For
replanning, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT*) is used with two
modifications which allow planning the trajectory in milliseconds scales. Once
we replanned trajectory, velocity components(x,y and z) and yaw rate are
calculated. Those values are sent to the controller at a constant frequency to
navigate the vehicle autonomously. Finally, we have evaluated each of the
components separately and tested the complete system in the simulated and real
environment.

Title: Searching a Database of Source Codes Using Contextualized Code Search
Authors: Rohan Mukherjee, Swarat Chaudhuri, Chris Jermaine
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  We assume a database containing a large set of program source codes and
consider the problem of contextualized code search over that database. A
programmer has written some part of a program, but has left part of the program
(such as a method or a function body) incomplete. The goal is to use the
context surrounding the missing code to automatically 'figure out' which of the
codes in the database would be useful to the programmer in order to help
complete the missing code, in the sense that the programmer could either
re-purpose the retrieved code and use the re-purposed code to fill the missing
spot in the program. Or, the user could use the retrieved code as a model for
implementing the missing code. The search is 'contextualized' in the sense that
the search engine should use clues in the partially-completed code to figure
out which database code is most useful. The user should not be required to
formulate an explicit query.
  We cast contextualized code search as a learning problem, where the goal is
to learn a distribution function computing the likelihood that each database
code completes the program, and propose a neural model for predicting which
database code is likely to be most useful. Because it will be prohibitively
expensive to apply a neural model to each code in a database of millions or
billions of codes at search time, one of our key technical concerns is ensuring
a speedy search. We address this by learning a 'reverse encoder' that can be
used to reduce the problem of evaluating each database code to computing a
convolution of two normal distributions, making it possible to search a large
database of codes in a reasonable time.

Title: The Effectiveness of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms in
  Predicting Software Refactoring
Authors: Maur\'icio Aniche, Erick Maziero, Rafael Durelli, Vinicius Durelli
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Refactoring is the process of changing the internal structure of software to
improve its quality without modifying its external behavior. Empirical studies
have repeatedly shown that refactoring has a positive impact on the
understandability and maintainability of software systems. However, before
carrying out refactoring activities, developers need to identify refactoring
opportunities. Currently, refactoring opportunity identification heavily relies
on developers' expertise and intuition. In this paper, we investigate the
effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting software
refactorings. More specifically, we train six different machine learning
algorithms (i.e., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine,
Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Network) with a dataset comprising
over two million refactorings from 11,149 real-world projects from the Apache,
F-Droid, and GitHub ecosystems. The resulting models predict 20 different
refactorings at class, method, and variable-levels with an accuracy often
higher than 90%. Our results show that (i) Random Forests are the best models
for predicting software refactoring, (ii) process and ownership metrics seem to
play a crucial role in the creation of better models, and (iii) models
generalize well in different contexts.

  Industry in all sectors is experiencing a profound digital transformation
that puts software at the core of their businesses. In order to react to
continuously changing user requirements and dynamic markets, companies need to
build robust workflows that allow them to increase their agility in order to
remain competitive. This increasingly rapid transformation, especially in
domains like IoT or Cloud computing, poses significant challenges to guarantee
high quality software, since dynamism and agile short-term planning reduce the
ability to detect and manage risks. In this paper, we describe the main
challenges related to managing risk in agile software development, building on
the experience of more than 20 agile coaches operating continuously for 15
years with hundreds of teams in industries in all sectors. We also propose a
framework to manage risks that considers those challenges and supports
collaboration, agility, and continuous development. An implementation of that
framework is then described in a tool that handles risks and mitigation actions
associated with the development of multi-cloud applications. The methodology
and the tool have been validated by a team of evaluators that were asked to
consider its use in developing an urban smart mobility service and an airline
flight scheduling system.

Title: Optimizing the Efficiency of Accelerated Reliability Testing for the
  Internet Router Motherboard
Authors: Hanxiao Zhang, Shouzhou Liu and Yan-Fu Li
Categories: cs.SE cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  With the rapid development of internet Router, the complexity of its
mainboard has been growing dramatically. The high reliability requirement
renders the number of testing cases increasing exponentially, which becomes the
bottleneck that prevents further elevation of the production efficiency. In
this work, we develop a novel optimization method of two major steps to largely
reduce the testing time and increase the testing efficiency. In the first step,
it optimizes the selection of test cases given the required amount of testing
time reduction while ensuring the coverage of failures. In the second step,
selected test cases are optimally scheduled to maximize the efficiency of
mainboard testing. A numerical experiment is investigated to illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results show that the optimal subset
of the test cases can be selected satisfying the 10% testing time reduction
requirement, and the effectiveness index of the scheduled sequence can be
improved by more than 75% with test case sequencing. Moreover, our method can
self-adjust to the new failure data, which realizes the automatic configuration
of board test cases.

Title: Measuring Similarity between Brands using Followers' Post in Social
  Media
Authors: Yiwei Zhang, Xueting Wang, Yoshiaki Sakai, and Toshihiko Yamasaki
Categories: cs.SI cs.MM
Comments: Accepted to ACM Multimedia Asia 2019
\\
  In this paper, we propose a new measure to estimate the similarity between
brands via posts of brands' followers on social network services (SNS). Our
method was developed with the intention of exploring the brands that customers
are likely to jointly purchase. Nowadays, brands use social media for targeted
advertising because influencing users' preferences can greatly affect the
trends in sales. We assume that data on SNS allows us to make quantitative
comparisons between brands. Our proposed algorithm analyzes the daily photos
and hashtags posted by each brand's followers. By clustering them and
converting them to histograms, we can calculate the similarity between brands.
We evaluated our proposed algorithm with purchase logs, credit card
information, and answers to the questionnaires. The experimental results show
that the purchase data maintained by a mall or a credit card company can
predict the co-purchase very well, but not the customer's willingness to buy
products of new brands. On the other hand, our method can predict the users'
interest on brands with a correlation value over 0.53, which is pretty high
considering that such interest to brands are high subjective and individual
dependent.

  Superbubbles are acyclic induced subgraphs of a digraph with single entrance
and exit that naturally arise in the context of genome assembly and the
analysis of genome alignments in computational biology. These structures can be
computed in linear time and are confined to non-symmetric digraphs. We
demonstrate empirically that graph parameters derived from superbubbles provide
a convenient means of distinguishing different classes of real-world graphical
models, while being largely unrelated to simple, commonly used parameters.

Title: Counterexample: scale-free networked graphs with invariable diameter and
  density feature
Authors: Fei Ma, Xiaomin Wang, Ping Wang
Categories: cs.SI physics.soc-ph
\\
  Here, we propose a class of scale-free networked graphs $G(t;m)$ with some
intriguing properties, which can not be simultaneously held by all the
theoretical models with power-law degree distribution in the existing
literature, including (i) average degrees $\langle k\rangle$ of all the
generated graphs are no longer a constant in the limit of large graph size,
implying that they are not sparse but dense, (ii) power-law parameters $\gamma$
of these models are precisely calculated equal to $2$, as well (iii) their
diameters $D$ are all an invariant in the growth process of models. While our
models have deterministic structure with clustering coefficients equivalent to
zero, we might be able to obtain various candidates with nonzero clustering
coefficient based on original graphs using some reasonable approaches, for
instance, randomly adding some new edges under the premise of keeping the three
important properties above unchanged. In addition, we study trapping problem on
graphs $G(t;m)$ and then obtain closed-form solutions $\langle HT\rangle_{t}$
to mean hitting time. As opposed to other models, our results show an
unexpected phenomenon that $\langle HT\rangle_{t}$ is approximately close to
the logarithm of order of graphs $G(t;m)$ however not to the order itself. From
the theoretical point of view, these networked graphs considered here can be
thought of as counterexamples for most of the published models obeying
power-law distribution in current study.

Title: A Supervisory Frequency Support Control Scheme for Distributed PV
Authors: Qinmiao Li, Mesut Baran
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 9 pages, 13 figures
\\
  Increasing penetration of Photovoltaic (PV) generation brings an opportunity,
and sometimes necessity, for this new resource to provide ancillary services
such as frequency support. Recent efforts toward this goal focused mainly on
the large-scale PV plants, and the proposed methods may not be easily adopted
for distributed PV, which are smaller in size and connected to distributed
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel control scheme for the same purpose
but focusing on distributed PV. To address the diversities among distributed
PV, we first derive a reduced-order aggregate model to represent their overall
dynamic behavior. Then, using this model, a tracking linear quadratic regulator
(LQR) based controller is used as a supervisory controller that can control a
group of distributed PV to provide frequency support. We also propose an
inversion method for the controller to invert the control signals for aggregate
model back to each individual PV. The proposed reduced-order aggregate model is
validated against a group of distributed PV systems represented by detailed
nonlinear models. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme,
as well as the inversion method, through time-domain simulations using a
standard test system.

Title: Behavioral and Game-Theoretic Security Investments in Interdependent
  Systems Modeled by Attack Graphs
Authors: Mustafa Abdallah, Parinaz Naghizadeh, Ashish R. Hota, Timothy Cason,

\\
  We consider a system consisting of multiple interdependent assets, and a set
of defenders, each responsible for securing a subset of the assets against an
attacker. The interdependencies between the assets are captured by an attack
graph, where an edge from one asset to another indicates that if the former
asset is compromised, an attack can be launched on the latter asset. Each edge
has an associated probability of successful attack, which can be reduced via
security investments by the defenders. In such scenarios, we investigate the
security investments that arise under certain features of human decision-making
that have been identified in behavioral economics. In particular, humans have
been shown to perceive probabilities in a nonlinear manner, typically
overweighting low probabilities and underweighting high probabilities. We show
that suboptimal investments can arise under such weighting in certain network
topologies. We also show that pure strategy Nash equilibria exist in settings
with multiple (behavioral) defenders, and study the inefficiency of the
equilibrium investments by behavioral defenders compared to a centralized
socially optimal solution.

Title: A General Initialization Scheme for Electromagnetic Transient
  Simulation: Towards Large-Scale Hybrid AC-DC Grids
Authors: Ye Liu, Yankan Song, Le Zhao, Ying Chen, Chen Shen
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  With the large-scale hybrid AC-DC grids coming into being, electromagnetic
transient (EMT) simulation is required to accurately describe the dynamics of
systems. However, the EMT steady-state initialization for hybrid AC-DC system
is difficult and time-consuming when the system scale is huge. In order to
provide a stable snapshot for EMT simulation with nonlinear components and
black-box components, this paper proposes a general initialization scheme for
EMT simulation (EMT-GIS) which can be implemented in the electromagnetic
transient program (EMTP)-type simulators. First, an integrated power flow (IPF)
algorithm is introduced to provide the steady-state results. Then, an
initialized snapshot calculation-and-splicing mechanism is designed for
EMT-GIS. The proposed EMT-GIS is tested using a hybrid AC-DC system in China on
the CloudPSS simulation platform. Test results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed EMT-GIS.

Title: Decentralized Optimization of Vehicle Route Planning -- A Cross-City
  Comparative Study
Authors: Brionna Davis, Grace Jennings, Taylor Pothast, Ilias Gerostathopoulos,

Categories: eess.SY cs.AI cs.DC cs.MA cs.SY
\\
  New mobility concepts are at the forefront of research and innovation in
smart cities. The introduction of connected and autonomous vehicles enables new
possibilities in vehicle routing. Specifically, knowing the origin and
destination of each agent in the network can allow for real-time routing of the
vehicles to optimize network performance. However, this relies on individual
vehicles being "altruistic" i.e., being willing to accept an alternative
non-preferred route in order to achieve a network-level performance goal. In
this work, we conduct a study to compare different levels of agent altruism and
the resulting effect on the network-level traffic performance. Specifically,
this study compares the effects of different underlying urban structures on the
overall network performance, and investigates which characteristics of the
network make it possible to realize routing improvements using a decentralized
optimization router. The main finding is that, with increased vehicle altruism,
it is possible to balance traffic flow among the links of the network. We show
evidence that the decentralized optimization router is more effective with
networks of high load while we study the influence of cities characteristics,
in particular: networks with a higher number of nodes (intersections) or edges
(roads) per unit area allow for more possible alternate routes, and thus higher
potential to improve network performance.

Title: Fast Resource Scheduling for Distribution Systems Enabled with Discrete
  Control Devices
Authors: Alireza Nouri, Alireza Soroudi, Andrew Keane
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper proposes a framework for fast short-term scheduling and
steady-state voltage control in distribution systems enabled with both
continuous control devices, e.g., inverter interfaced DGs and discrete control
devices (dcds), e.g., on-load tap changers (oltcs). The voltage-dependent
nature of loads is taken into account to further reduce the operating cost by
managing the voltage levels. The branch and cut method is applied to handle the
integrality constraints associated with the operation of dcds. A globally
convergent trust-region algorithm (tra) is applied to solve the integer relaxed
problems at each node during the branching process. The tra sub-problems are
solved using the interior point method. To reduce the branching burden of the
branch and cut algorithm, before applying tra at each node, a simplified
optimization problem is first solved. Using the convergence status and value of
the objective function of this problem, a faster decision is made on stopping
the regarding branch. Solving the simplified problem obviates the application
of tra at most nodes. It is shown that the method converges to the optimal
solution with a considerable saving in computation time according to the
numerical studies.

the response of the system to external large disturbances. This paper provides
a comparative analysis of established transient stability indices. The indices
studied in this paper include rotor-angle difference based transient stability
index (TSI), rate of machine acceleration (ROMA), transient kinetic energy

Title: Identification and nonlinearity compensation of hysteresis using NARX
  models
Authors: Petrus E. O. G. B. Abreu, Lucas A. Tavares, Bruno O. S. Teixeira, Luis
  A. Aguirre
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper deals with two problems: the identification and compensation of
hysteresis nonlinearity in dynamical systems using nonlinear polynomial
autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX). First, based on gray-box
identification techniques, some constraints on the structure and parameters of
NARX models are proposed to ensure that the identified models display a
key-feature of hysteresis. In addition, a more general framework is developed
to explain how hysteresis occurs in such models. Second, two strategies to
design hysteresis compensators are presented. In one strategy the compensation
law is obtained through simple algebraic manipulations performed on the
identified models. It has been found that the compensators based on gray-box
models outperform the cases with models identified using black-box techniques.
In the second strategy, the compensation law is directly identified from the
data. Both numerical and experimental results are presented to illustrate the
efficiency of the proposed procedures.

Title: On the distribution of orders of Frobenius action on $\ell$-torsion of
  abelian surfaces
Authors: Nikita Kolesnikov and Semyon Novoselov
Categories: math.NT cs.CR
MSC-class: 14Q05 14Q15 11M38
\\
  The computation of the order of Frobenius action on the $\ell$-torsion is a
part of Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm for point counting on an elliptic curve
$E$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. The idea of Schoof's algorithm is to
compute the trace of Frobenius $t$ modulo primes $\ell$ and restore it by the
Chinese remainder theorem. Atkin's improvement consists of computing the order
$r$ of the Frobenius action on $E[\ell]$ and of restricting the number $t
\pmod{\ell}$ to enumerate by using the formula $t^2 \equiv q (\zeta +
\zeta^{-1})^2 \pmod{\ell}$. Here $\zeta$ is a primitive $r$-th root of unity.
In this paper, we generalize Atkin's formula to the general case of abelian
variety of dimension $g$. Classically, finding of the order $r$ involves
expensive computation of modular polynomials. We study the distribution of the
Frobenius orders in case of abelian surfaces and $q \equiv 1 \pmod{\ell}$ in
order to replace these expensive computations by probabilistic algorithms.

Title: Vertebra-Focused Landmark Detection for Scoliosis Assessment
Authors: Jingru Yi, Pengxiang Wu, Qiaoying Huang, Hui Qu, Dimitris N. Metaxas
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to ISBI2020
\\
  Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a lifetime disease that arises in
children. Accurate estimation of Cobb angles of the scoliosis is essential for
clinicians to make diagnosis and treatment decisions. The Cobb angles are
measured according to the vertebrae landmarks. Existing regression-based
methods for the vertebra landmark detection typically suffer from large dense
mapping parameters and inaccurate landmark localization. The segmentation-based
methods tend to predict connected or corrupted vertebra masks. In this paper,
we propose a novel vertebra-focused landmark detection method. Our model first
localizes the vertebra centers, based on which it then traces the four corner
landmarks of the vertebra through the learned corner offset. In this way, our
method is able to keep the order of the landmarks. The comparison results
demonstrate the merits of our method in both Cobb angle measurement and
landmark detection on low-contrast and ambiguous X-ray images. Code is
available at: \url{https://github.com/yijingru/Vertebra-Landmark-Detection}.

  Colorectal cancer, largely arising from precursor lesions called polyps,
remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Current
clinical standards require the resection and histopathological analysis of
polyps due to test accuracy and sensitivity of optical biopsy methods falling
substantially below recommended levels. In this study, we design a novel
capsule network architecture (D-Caps) to improve the viability of optical
biopsy of colorectal polyps. Our proposed method introduces several technical
novelties including a novel capsule architecture with a capsule-average pooling
(CAP) method to improve efficiency in large-scale image classification. We
demonstrate improved results over the previous state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network (CNN) approach by as much as 43%. This work provides an
important benchmark on the new Mayo Polyp dataset, a significantly more
challenging and larger dataset than previous polyp studies, with results
stratified across all available categories, imaging devices and modalities, and
focus modes to promote future direction into AI-driven colorectal cancer

Title: Convolutional Neural Networks based Focal Loss for Class Imbalance
  Problem: A Case Study of Canine Red Blood Cells Morphology Classification
Authors: Kitsuchart Pasupa, Supawit Vatathanavaro, Suchat Tungjitnob
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Morphologies of red blood cells are normally interpreted by a pathologist. It
is time-consuming and laborious. Furthermore, a misclassified red blood cell
morphology will lead to false disease diagnosis and improper treatment. Thus, a
decent pathologist must truly be an expert in classifying red blood cell
morphology. In the past decade, many approaches have been proposed for
classifying human red blood cell morphology. However, those approaches have not
addressed the class imbalance problem in classification. A class imbalance
problem---a problem where the numbers of samples in classes are very
different---is one of the problems that can lead to a biased model towards the
majority class. Due to the rarity of every type of abnormal blood cell
morphology, the data from the collection process are usually imbalanced. In
this study, we aimed to solve this problem specifically for classification of
dog red blood cell morphology by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)---a
well-known deep learning technique---in conjunction with a focal loss function,
adept at handling class imbalance problem. The proposed technique was conducted
on a well-designed framework: two different CNNs were used to verify the
effectiveness of the focal loss function and the optimal hyper-parameters were
determined by 5-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that both
CNNs models augmented with the focal loss function achieved higher
$F_{1}$-scores, compared to the models augmented with a conventional
cross-entropy loss function that does not address class imbalance problem. In
other words, the focal loss function truly enabled the CNNs models to be less
biased towards the majority class than the cross-entropy did in the
classification task of imbalanced dog red blood cell data.

Title: The Logic of Strategic Assets: From Oil to Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Jeffrey Ding and Allan Dafoe
Categories: econ.GN cs.CY q-fin.EC
\\
  What resources and technologies are strategic? This question is often the
focus of policy and theoretical debates, where the label "strategic" designates
those assets that warrant the attention of the highest levels of the state. But
these conversations are plagued by analytical confusion, flawed heuristics, and
the rhetorical use of "strategic" to advance particular agendas. We aim to
improve these conversations through conceptual clarification, introducing a
theory based on important rivalrous externalities for which socially optimal
behavior will not be produced alone by markets or individual national security
entities. We distill and theorize the most important three forms of these
externalities, which involve cumulative-, infrastructure-, and
dependency-strategic logics. We then employ these logics to clarify three
important cases: the Avon 2 engine in the 1950s, the U.S.-Japan technology
rivalry in the late 1980s, and contemporary conversations about artificial
intelligence.

Title: Real-Time RFI Mitigation for the Apertif Radio Transient System
Authors: Alessio Sclocco, Dany Vohl and Rob V. van Nieuwpoort
Categories: astro-ph.IM cs.DC
Comments: 6 pages, 10 figures. To appear in Proceedings from the 2019 Radio
  Frequency Interference workshop (RFI 2019), Toulouse, France (23-26
  September)
\\
  Current and upcoming radio telescopes are being designed with increasing
sensitivity to detect new and mysterious radio sources of astrophysical origin.
While this increased sensitivity improves the likelihood of discoveries, it
also makes these instruments more susceptible to the deleterious effects of
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). The challenge posed by RFI is exacerbated
by the high data-rates achieved by modern radio telescopes, which require
real-time processing to keep up with the data. Furthermore, the high data-rates
do not allow for permanent storage of observations at high resolution. Offline
RFI mitigation is therefore not possible anymore. The real-time requirement
makes RFI mitigation even more challenging because, on one side, the techniques
used for mitigation need to be fast and simple, and on the other side they also
need to be robust enough to cope with just a partial view of the data.
  The Apertif Radio Transient System (ARTS) is the real-time, time-domain,
transient detection instrument of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope
(WSRT), processing 73 Gb of data per second. Even with a deep learning
classifier, the ARTS pipeline requires state-of-the-art real-time RFI
mitigation to reduce the number of false-positive detections. Our solution to
this challenge is RFIm, a high-performance, open-source, tuned, and extensible
RFI mitigation library. The goal of this library is to provide users with RFI
mitigation routines that are designed to run in real-time on many-core
accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units, and that can be highly-tuned
to achieve code and performance portability to different hardware platforms and
scientific use-cases. Results on the ARTS show that we can achieve real-time
RFI mitigation, with a minimal impact on the total execution time of the search
pipeline, and considerably reduce the number of false-positives.

\\
  The burning number of a graph was recently introduced by Bonato et al.
Although they mention that the burning number generalises naturally to directed
graphs, no further research on this has been done. Here, we introduce graph
burning for directed graphs, and we study bounds for the corresponding burning
number and the hardness of finding this number. We derive sharp bounds from
simple algorithms and examples. The hardness question yields more surprising
results: finding the burning number of a directed tree is NP-hard, but FPT;
however, it is W[2]-complete for DAGs. Finally, we give a fixed-parameter
algorithm to find the burning number of a digraph, with a parameter inspired by
research in phylogenetic networks.

Title: An Improvement to Chv\'atal and Thomassen's Upper Bound for Oriented
  Diameter
Authors: Jasine Babu, Deepu Benson, Deepak Rajendraprasad and Sai Nishant Vaka

  An orientation of an undirected graph $G$ is an assignment of exactly one
direction to each edge of $G$. An orientation of a graph $G$ is called a strong
orientation, if from each vertex there is a directed path to every other
vertex. The oriented diameter of a graph $G$ is the smallest diameter among all
the strong orientations of $G$. The maximum oriented diameter of a family of
graphs $\mathscr{F}$ is the maximum oriented diameter among all the graphs in
$\mathscr{F}$. Chv\'atal and Thomassen gave a lower bound of $\frac{1}{2}d^2+d$
and an upper bound of $2d^2+2d$ for the maximum oriented diameter of the family
of $2$-edge connected graphs of diameter $d$. We improve this upper bound to $
1.373 d^2 + 6.971d-1 $, which outperforms the former upper bound for all values
of $d$ greater than or equal to $8$. For the family of $2$-edge connected
graphs of diameter $3$, Kwok, Liu and West obtained improved lower and upper
bounds of $9$ and $11$ respectively. For the family of $2$-edge connected
graphs of diameter $4$, the bounds provided by Chv\'atal and Thomassen are $12$
and $40$ and no better bounds were known. By extending the method we used for
diameter $d$ graphs, along with a generalized version of a technique used by
Chv\'atal and Thomassen, we have improved this upper bound to $21$.

Title: Dynamic Interaction between Shared Autonomous Vehicles and Public
  Transit: A Competitive Perspective
Authors: Baichuan Mo, Zhejing Cao, Hongmou Zhang, Yu Shen, Jinhua Zhao
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.GT econ.GN q-fin.EC
\\
  The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is anticipated to influence the
public transportation (PT) system. Many possible relationships between AV and
PT are proposed depending on the policy and institution, where competition and
cooperation are two main categories. This paper focuses on the former in a
hypothetical scenario-"if both AV and PT operators were only profit-oriented."
We aim to quantitatively evaluate the system performance (e.g. level of
service, operators' financial viability, transport efficiency) when AV and PT
are profit-oriented competitors with dynamic adjustable supply strategies under
certain policy constraints. We assume AV can adjust the fleetsize and PT can
adjust the headway. Service fare and bus routes are fixed. The competition
process is analyzed through an agent-based simulation platform, which
incorporates a proposed heuristic dynamic supply updating algorithm (HDSUA).
The first-mile scenario in Singapore Tampines area is selected as the case
study, where only bus is considered for PT system. We found that when AV and
bus operators are given the flexibility to adjust supply, both of them will
re-distribute their supply spatially and temporally, leading to higher profits.
In temporal dimension, both AV and bus will concentrate their supplies in
morning and evening peak hours, and reduce the supplies in off-peak hours. The
competition between AV and PT decreases passengers' travel time but increase
their travel cost. The generalized travel cost is still reduced when counting
the value of time. The bus supply adjustment can increase the bus average load
and reduce total passenger car equivalent (PCE), which is good for transport
efficiency and sustainability. But the AV supply adjustment shows the opposite
effect. Overall, the competition does not necessarily bring out loss-gain
results. A win-win outcome is also possible under certain policy interventions.

Title: Chebyshev Inertial Iteration for Accelerating Fixed-Point Iterations
Authors: Tadashi Wadayama and Satoshi Takabe
Categories: math.OC cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  A novel method which is called the Chebyshev inertial iteration for
accelerating the convergence speed of fixed-point iterations is presented. The
Chebyshev inertial iteration can be regarded as a valiant of the successive
over relaxation or Krasnosel'ski\v{\i}-Mann iteration utilizing the inverse of
roots of a Chebyshev polynomial as iteration dependent inertial factors. One of
the most notable features of the proposed method is that it can be applied to
nonlinear fixed-point iterations in addition to linear fixed-point iterations.
Linearization around the fixed point is the key for the analysis on the local
convergence rate of the proposed method. The proposed method appears effective
in particular for accelerating the proximal gradient methods such as ISTA. It
is also proved that the proposed method can successfully accelerate almost any
fixed-point iterations if all the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at the fixed
point are real.

Title: Sum Rate Maximization for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted
  Device-to-Device Communications
Authors: Yashuai Cao, Tiejun Lv
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures
\\
  In this letter, we propose to employ reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) for enhancing the D2D underlaying system performance. We study the joint
power control, receive beamforming, and passive beamforming for RIS assisted
D2D underlaying cellular communication systems, which is formulated as a sum
rate maximization problem. To address this issue, we develop a block coordinate
descent method where uplink power, receive beamformer and refection phase
shifts are alternatively optimized. Then, we provide the closed-form solutions
for both uplink power and receive beamformer. We further propose a quadratic
transform based semi-definite relaxation algorithm to optimize the RIS phase
shifts, where the original passive beamforming problem is translated into a
separable quadratically constrained quadratic problem. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed RIS assisted design significantly improves the
sum-rate performance.

Title: Identifying Distinct, Effective Treatments for Acute Hypotension with

\\
  Hypotension in critical care settings is a life-threatening emergency that
must be recognized and treated early. While fluid bolus therapy and
vasopressors are common treatments, it is often unclear which interventions to
give, in what amounts, and for how long. Observational data in the form of
electronic health records can provide a source for helping inform these choices
from past events, but often it is not possible to identify a single best
strategy from observational data alone. In such situations, we argue it is
important to expose the collection of plausible options to a provider. To this
end, we develop SODA-RL: Safely Optimized, Diverse, and Accurate Reinforcement
Learning, to identify distinct treatment options that are supported in the
data. We demonstrate SODA-RL on a cohort of 10,142 ICU stays where hypotension
presented. Our learned policies perform comparably to the observed physician
behaviors, while providing different, plausible alternatives for treatment
decisions.

Title: Supporting supervised learning in fungal Biosynthetic Gene Cluster
  discovery: new benchmark datasets
Authors: Hayda Almeida, Adrian Tsang, Abdoulaye Banir\'e Diallo
Categories: q-bio.GN cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in
  Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics (MABM2019) at IEEE BIBM 2019
\\
  Fungal Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) of secondary metabolites are
clusters of genes capable of producing natural products, compounds that play an
important role in the production of a wide variety of bioactive compounds,
including antibiotics and pharmaceuticals. Identifying BGCs can lead to the
discovery of novel natural products to benefit human health. Previous work has
been focused on developing automatic tools to support BGC discovery in plants,
fungi, and bacteria. Data-driven methods, as well as probabilistic and
supervised learning methods have been explored in identifying BGCs. Most
methods applied to identify fungal BGCs were data-driven and presented limited
scope. Supervised learning methods have been shown to perform well at
identifying BGCs in bacteria, and could be well suited to perform the same task
in fungi. But labeled data instances are needed to perform supervised learning.
Openly accessible BGC databases contain only a very small portion of previously
curated fungal BGCs. Making new fungal BGC datasets available could motivate
the development of supervised learning methods for fungal BGCs and potentially
improve prediction performance compared to data-driven methods. In this work we
propose new publicly available fungal BGC datasets to support the BGC discovery
task using supervised learning. These datasets are prepared to perform binary
classification and predict candidate BGC regions in fungal genomes. In addition
we analyse the performance of a well supported supervised learning tool
developed to predict BGCs.

Title: Choosing the Sample with Lowest Loss makes SGD Robust
Authors: Vatsal Shah, Xiaoxia Wu, Sujay Sanghavi
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  The presence of outliers can potentially significantly skew the parameters of
machine learning models trained via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this
paper we propose a simple variant of the simple SGD method: in each step, first
choose a set of k samples, then from these choose the one with the smallest
current loss, and do an SGD-like update with this chosen sample. Vanilla SGD
corresponds to k = 1, i.e. no choice; k >= 2 represents a new algorithm that is
however effectively minimizing a non-convex surrogate loss. Our main
contribution is a theoretical analysis of the robustness properties of this
idea for ML problems which are sums of convex losses; these are backed up with
linear regression and small-scale neural network experiments

  The stock market prediction has always been crucial for stakeholders, traders
and investors. We developed an ensemble Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model
that includes two-time frequencies (annual and daily parameters) in order to
predict the next-day Closing price (one step ahead). Based on a four-step
approach, this methodology is a serial combination of two LSTM algorithms. The
empirical experiment is applied to 417 NY stock exchange companies. Based on
Open High Low Close metrics and other financial ratios, this approach proves
that the stock market prediction can be improved.

Title: Time-Varying Graph Learning with Constraints on Graph Temporal Variation
Authors: Koki Yamada, Yuichi Tanaka, Antonio Ortega
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
Comments: 13 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
\\
  We propose a novel framework for learning time-varying graphs from
spatiotemporal measurements. Given an appropriate prior on the temporal
behavior of signals, our proposed method can estimate time-varying graphs from
a small number of available measurements. To achieve this, we introduce two
regularization terms in convex optimization problems that constrain sparseness
of temporal variations of the time-varying networks. Moreover, a
computationally-scalable algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the
optimization problem. The experimental results with synthetic and real datasets
(point cloud and temperature data) demonstrate our proposed method outperforms
the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Data-Dependence of Plateau Phenomenon in Learning with Neural Network
  --- Statistical Mechanical Analysis
Authors: Yuki Yoshida, Masato Okada
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at NeurIPS 2019
\\
  The plateau phenomenon, wherein the loss value stops decreasing during the
process of learning, has been reported by various researchers. The phenomenon
is actively inspected in the 1990s and found to be due to the fundamental
hierarchical structure of neural network models. Then the phenomenon has been
thought as inevitable. However, the phenomenon seldom occurs in the context of
recent deep learning. There is a gap between theory and reality. In this paper,
using statistical mechanical formulation, we clarified the relationship between
the plateau phenomenon and the statistical property of the data learned. It is
shown that the data whose covariance has small and dispersed eigenvalues tend
to make the plateau phenomenon inconspicuous.

  Despite its well-known shortcomings, $k$-means remains one of the most widely
used approaches to data clustering. Current research continues to tackle its
flaws while attempting to preserve its simplicity. Recently, the \textit{power
$k$-means} algorithm was proposed to avoid trapping in local minima by
annealing through a family of smoother surfaces. However, the approach lacks
theoretical justification and fails in high dimensions when many features are
irrelevant. This paper addresses these issues by introducing \textit{entropy
regularization} to learn feature relevance while annealing. We prove
consistency of the proposed approach and derive a scalable
majorization-minimization algorithm that enjoys closed-form updates and
convergence guarantees. In particular, our method retains the same
computational complexity of $k$-means and power $k$-means, but yields
significant improvements over both. Its merits are thoroughly assessed on a
suite of real and synthetic data experiments.

  Random forests are powerful non-parametric regression method but are severely
limited in their usage in the presence of randomly censored observations, and
naively applied can exhibit poor predictive performance due to the incurred
biases. Based on a local adaptive representation of random forests, we develop
its regression adjustment for randomly censored regression quantile models.
Regression adjustment is based on a new estimating equation that adapts to
censoring and leads to quantile score whenever the data do not exhibit
censoring. The proposed procedure named {\it censored quantile regression
forest}, allows us to estimate quantiles of time-to-event without any
parametric modeling assumption. We establish its consistency under mild model
specifications. Numerical studies showcase a clear advantage of the proposed
procedure.

Title: A Two-step-training Deep Learning Framework for Real-time Computational
  Imaging without Physics Priors
Authors: Ruibo Shang, Kevin Hoffer-Hawlik, Geoffrey P. Luke
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG
Comments: 16 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Deep learning (DL) is a powerful tool in computational imaging for many
applications. A common strategy is to reconstruct a preliminary image as the
input of a neural network to achieve an optimized image. Usually, the
preliminary image is acquired with the prior knowledge of the model. One
outstanding challenge, however, is that the model is sometimes difficult to
acquire with high accuracy. In this work, a two-step-training DL (TST-DL)
framework is proposed for real-time computational imaging without prior
knowledge of the model. A single fully-connected layer (FCL) is trained to
directly learn the model with the raw measurement data as input and the image
as output. Then, this pre-trained FCL is fixed and connected with an un-trained
deep convolutional network for a second-step training to improve the output
image fidelity. This approach has three main advantages. First, no prior
knowledge of the model is required since the first-step training is to directly
learn the model. Second, real-time imaging can be achieved since the raw
measurement data is directly used as the input to the model. Third, it can
handle any dimension of the network input and solve the input-output dimension
mismatch issues which arise in convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate
this framework in the applications of single-pixel imaging and photoacoustic
imaging for linear model cases. The results are quantitatively compared with
those from other DL frameworks and model-based optimization approaches. Noise
robustness and the required size of the training dataset are studied for this
framework. We further extend this concept to nonlinear models in the
application of image de-autocorrelation by using multiple FCLs in the
first-step training. Overall, this TST-DL framework is widely applicable to
many computational imaging techniques for real-time image reconstruction
without the physics priors.

\\
  Low-power sensing technologies, such as wearables, have emerged in the
healthcare domain since they enable continuous and non-invasive monitoring of
physiological signals. In order to endow such devices with clinical value,
classical signal processing has encountered numerous challenges. However,
data-driven methods, such as machine learning, offer attractive accuracies at
the expense of being resource and memory demanding. In this paper, we focus on
the inference of neural networks running in microcontrollers and low-power
processors which wearable sensors and devices are generally equipped with. In
particular, we adapted an existing convolutional-recurrent neural network,
designed to detect and classify cardiac arrhythmias from a single-lead
electrocardiogram, to the low-power embedded System-on-Chip nRF52 from Nordic
Semiconductor with an ARM's Cortex-M4 processing core. We show our
implementation in fixed-point precision, using the CMSIS-NN libraries, yields a
drop of $F_1$ score from 0.8 to 0.784, from the original implementation, with a
memory footprint of 195.6KB, and a throughput of 33.98MOps/s.

Title: Biophysical models of cis-regulation as interpretable neural networks

Comments: Presented at the 14th conference on Machine Learning in Computational
  Biology (MLCB 2019), Vancouver, Canada
\\
  The adoption of deep learning techniques in genomics has been hindered by the
difficulty of mechanistically interpreting the models that these techniques
produce. In recent years, a variety of post-hoc attribution methods have been
proposed for addressing this neural network interpretability problem in the
context of gene regulation. Here we describe a complementary way of approaching
this problem. Our strategy is based on the observation that two large classes
of biophysical models of cis-regulatory mechanisms can be expressed as deep
neural networks in which nodes and weights have explicit physiochemical
interpretations. We also demonstrate how such biophysical networks can be
rapidly inferred, using modern deep learning frameworks, from the data produced
by certain types of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). These results
suggest a scalable strategy for using MPRAs to systematically characterize the
biophysical basis of gene regulation in a wide range of biological contexts.
They also highlight gene regulation as a promising venue for the development of
scientifically interpretable approaches to deep learning.

Title: Parameter learning and fractional differential operators: application in
  image regularization and decomposition
Authors: S\"oren Bartels and Nico Weber
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
\\
  In this paper, we focus on learning optimal parameters for PDE-based image
regularization and decomposition. First we learn the regularization parameter
and the differential operator for gray-scale image denoising using the
fractional Laplacian in combination with a bilevel optimization problem. In our
setting the fractional Laplacian allows the use of Fourier transform, which
enables the optimization of the denoising operator. We prove stable and
explainable results as an advantage in comparison to other machine learning
approaches. The numerical experiments correlate with our theoretical model
setting and show a reduction of computing time in contrast to the ROF model.
Second we introduce a new image decomposition model with the fractional
Laplacian and the Riesz potential. We provide an explicit formula for the
unique solution and the numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency.

  Generalizing an idea of Davie and Gaines (2001), we present a method for the
simulation of fully discrete samples of the solution to the stochastic heat
equation on an interval. We provide a condition for the validity of the
approximation, which holds particularly when the number of temporal and spatial
observations tends to infinity. Hereby, the quality of the approximation is
measured in total variation distance. In a simulation study we calculate
temporal and spatial quadratic variations from sample paths generated both via
our method and via naive truncation of the Fourier series representation of the
process. Hereby, the results provided by our method are more accurate at a
considerably lower computational cost.

Title: Generalized L$_p$-norm joint inversion of gravity and magnetic data
  using cross-gradient constraint
Authors: Saeed Vatankhah, Shuang Liu, Rosemary A. Renaut, Xiangyun Hu, Mostafa
  Gharloghi
Categories: physics.geo-ph cs.NA math.NA
\\
  A generalized unifying approach for $L_{p}$-norm joint inversion of gravity
and magnetic data using the cross-gradient constraint is presented. The
presented framework incorporates stabilizers that use $L_{0}$, $L_{1}$, and
$L_{2}$-norms of the model parameters, and/or the gradient of the model
parameters. Furthermore, the formulation is developed from standard approaches
for independent inversion of single data sets, and, thus, also facilitates the
inclusion of necessary model and data weighting matrices that provide, for
example, depth weighting and imposition of hard constraint data. The developed
efficient algorithm can, therefore, be employed to provide physically-relevant
smooth, sparse, or blocky target(s) which are relevant to the geophysical
community.
  Here, the nonlinear objective function, that describes the inclusion of all
stabilizing terms and the fit to data measurements, is minimized iteratively by
imposing stationarity on the linear equation that results from applying
linearization of the objective function about a starting model. To numerically
solve the resulting linear system, at each iteration, the conjugate gradient
algorithm is used. The general framework is then validated for
three-dimensional synthetic models for both sparse and smooth reconstructions,
and the results are compared with those of individual gravity and magnetic
inversions. It is demonstrated that the presented joint inversion algorithm is
practical and significantly improves reconstructed models obtained by
independent inversion.

MSC-class: 35L50, 93E20, 60H10, 65C20
\\
  In this paper, we address the task of setting up an optimal production plan
taking into account an uncertain demand. The energy system is represented by a
system of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and the uncertain
demand stream is captured by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We determine the
optimal inflow depending on the producer's risk preferences. The resulting
output is intended to optimally match the stochastic demand for the given risk
criteria. We use uncertainty quantification for an adaptation to different
levels of risk aversion. More precisely, we use two types of chance constraints
to formulate the requirement of demand satisfaction at a prescribed probability
level. In a numerical analysis, we analyze the chance-constrained optimization
problem for the Telegrapher's equation and a real-world coupled gas-to-power
network.

\\
  Simulating sonar devices requires modeling complex underwater acoustics,
simultaneously rendering time-efficient data. Existing methods focus on basic
implementation of one sonar type, where most of sound properties are
disregarded. In this context, this work presents a multi-device sonar simulator
capable of processing an underwater scene by a hybrid pipeline on GPU:
Rasterization computes the primary intersections, while only the reflective
areas are ray-traced. Our proposed system launches few rays when compared to a
full ray-tracing based method, achieving a significant performance gain without
quality loss in the final rendering. Resulting reflections are then
characterized as two sonar parameters: Echo intensity and pulse distance.
Underwater acoustic features, such as speckle noise, transmission loss,
reverberation and material properties of observable objects are also computed
in the final generated acoustic image. Visual and numerical performance
assessments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed simulator to render
underwater scenes in comparison to real-world sonar devices.

  Networks are natural geometric objects. Yet the discrete metric structure of
shortest path lengths in a network, known as chemical distances, is definitely
not the only reservoir of geometric distances that characterize many networks.
The other forms of network-related geometries are the geometry of continuous
latent spaces underlying many networks, and the effective geometry induced by
dynamical processes in networks. A solid and rapidly growing amount of evidence
shows that the three approaches are intimately related. Network geometry is
immensely efficient in discovering hidden symmetries, such as scale-invariance,
and other fundamental physical and mathematical properties of networks, as well
as in a variety of practical applications, ranging from the understanding how
the brain works, to routing in the Internet. Here, we review the most important
theoretical and practical developments in network geometry in the last two
decades, and offer perspectives on future research directions and challenges in
this novel frontier in the study of complexity.

Title: Fuel-Efficient Powered Descent Guidance on Large Planetary Bodies via
  Theory of Functional Connections
Authors: Hunter Johnston, Enrico Schiassi, Roberto Furfaro, and Daniele Mortari
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 17 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables
MSC-class: 49M99
\\
  In this paper we present a new approach to solve the fuel-efficient powered
descent guidance problem on large planetary bodies with no atmosphere (e.g. the
Moon or Mars) using the recently developed Theory of Functional Connections.
The problem is formulated using the indirect method which casts the optimal
guidance problem as a system of nonlinear two-point boundary value problems.
Using the Theory of Functional Connections, the problem constraints are
analytically embedded into a "constrained expression," which maintains a
free-function that is expanded using orthogonal polynomials with unknown
coefficients. The constraints are satisfied regardless of the values of the
unknown coefficients which convert the two-point boundary value problem into an
unconstrained optimization problem. This process casts the solution into the
admissible subspace of the problem and therefore simple numerical techniques
can be used (i.e. in this paper a nonlinear least-squares method is used). In
addition to the derivation of this technique, the method is validated in two
scenarios and the results are compared to those obtained by the general purpose
optimal control software, GPOPS-II. In general, the proposed technique produces
solutions of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10})$. Additionally, for the proposed test
cases, it is reported that each individual TFC-based inner-loop iteration
converges within 6 iterations, each iteration exhibiting a computational time
between 72 and 81 milliseconds within the MATLAB legacy implementation.
Consequently, the proposed methodology is potentially suitable for on-board
generation of optimal trajectories in real-time.
