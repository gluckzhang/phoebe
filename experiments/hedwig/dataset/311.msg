  Explainability has been an important goal since the early days of Artificial
Intelligence. Several approaches for producing explanations have been
developed. However, many of these approaches were tightly coupled with the
capabilities of the artificial intelligence systems at the time. With the
proliferation of AI-enabled systems in sometimes critical settings, there is a
need for them to be explainable to end-users and decision-makers. We present a
historical overview of explainable artificial intelligence systems, with a
focus on knowledge-enabled systems, spanning the expert systems, cognitive
assistants, semantic applications, and machine learning domains. Additionally,
borrowing from the strengths of past approaches and identifying gaps needed to
make explanations user- and context-focused, we propose new definitions for
explanations and explainable knowledge-enabled systems.

  Interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence has been growing
for decades and has accelerated recently. As Artificial Intelligence models
have become more complex, and often more opaque, with the incorporation of
complex machine learning techniques, explainability has become more critical.
Recently, researchers have been investigating and tackling explainability with
a user-centric focus, looking for explanations to consider trustworthiness,
comprehensibility, explicit provenance, and context-awareness. In this chapter,
we leverage our survey of explanation literature in Artificial Intelligence and
closely related fields and use these past efforts to generate a set of
explanation types that we feel reflect the expanded needs of explanation for
today's artificial intelligence applications. We define each type and provide
an example question that would motivate the need for this style of explanation.
We believe this set of explanation types will help future system designers in
their generation and prioritization of requirements and further help generate
explanations that are better aligned to users' and situational needs.

Title: Construe: a software solution for the explanation-based interpretation
  of time series
Authors: Tomas Teijeiro and Paulo Felix
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV cs.LO
Comments: Original Software Publication. 10 pages, 4 figures
ACM-class: I.2; I.5
\\
  This paper presents a software implementation of a general framework for time
series interpretation based on abductive reasoning. The software provides a
data model and a set of algorithms to make inference to the best explanation of
a time series, resulting in a description in multiple abstraction levels of the
processes underlying the time series. As a proof of concept, a comprehensive
knowledge base for the electrocardiogram (ECG) domain is provided, so it can be
used directly as a tool for ECG analysis. This tool has been successfully
validated in several noteworthy problems, such as heartbeat classification or
atrial fibrillation detection.

Title: Learning to Optimize Autonomy in Competence-Aware Systems

Categories: cs.AI cs.RO
Comments: To be published in Proceedings of the 19th International Conference
  on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2020). 9 pages
ACM-class: I.2.8; I.2.9
\\
  Interest in semi-autonomous systems (SAS) is growing rapidly as a paradigm to
deploy autonomous systems in domains that require occasional reliance on
humans. This paradigm allows service robots or autonomous vehicles to operate
at varying levels of autonomy and offer safety in situations that require human
judgment. We propose an introspective model of autonomy that is learned and
updated online through experience and dictates the extent to which the agent
can act autonomously in any given situation. We define a competence-aware
system (CAS) that explicitly models its own proficiency at different levels of
autonomy and the available human feedback. A CAS learns to adjust its level of
autonomy based on experience to maximize overall efficiency, factoring in the
cost of human assistance. We analyze the convergence properties of CAS and
provide experimental results for robot delivery and autonomous driving domains
that demonstrate the benefits of the approach.

Title: TTDM: A Travel Time Difference Model for Next Location Prediction
Authors: Qingjie Liu, Yixuan Zuo, Xiaohui Yu, Meng Chen
Categories: cs.AI cs.SI
Journal-ref: 2019 20th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management
  (MDM)
DOI: 10.1109/MDM.2019.00-54
\\
  Next location prediction is of great importance for many location-based
applications and provides essential intelligence to business and governments.
In existing studies, a common approach to next location prediction is to learn
the sequential transitions with massive historical trajectories based on
conditional probability. Unfortunately, due to the time and space complexity,
these methods (e.g., Markov models) only use the just passed locations to
predict next locations, without considering all the passed locations in the
trajectory. In this paper, we seek to enhance the prediction performance by
considering the travel time from all the passed locations in the query
trajectory to a candidate next location. In particular, we propose a novel
method, called Travel Time Difference Model (TTDM), which exploits the
difference between the shortest travel time and the actual travel time to
predict next locations. Further, we integrate the TTDM with a Markov model via
a linear interpolation to yield a joint model, which computes the probability
of reaching each possible next location and returns the top-rankings as
results. We have conducted extensive experiments on two real datasets: the
vehicle passage record (VPR) data and the taxi trajectory data. The
experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction
accuracy over existing solutions. For example, compared with the Markov model,
the top-1 accuracy improves by 40% on the VPR data and by 15.6% on the Taxi
data.

Title: Enhancing the Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm for Video Game Testing
Authors: Sinan Ariyurek, Aysu Betin-Can, Elif Surer
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In this paper, we study the effects of several Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
modifications for video game testing. Although MCTS modifications are highly
studied in game playing, their impacts on finding bugs are blank. We focused on
bug finding in our previous study where we introduced synthetic and human-like
test goals and we used these test goals in Sarsa and MCTS agents to find bugs.
In this study, we extend the MCTS agent with several modifications for game
testing purposes. Furthermore, we present a novel tree reuse strategy. We
experiment with these modifications by testing them on three testbed games,
four levels each, that contain 45 bugs in total. We use the General Video Game
Artificial Intelligence (GVG-AI) framework to create the testbed games and
collect 427 human tester trajectories using the GVG-AI framework. We analyze
the proposed modifications in three parts: we evaluate their effects on bug
finding performances of agents, we measure their success under two different
computational budgets, and we assess their effects on human-likeness of the
human-like agent. Our results show that MCTS modifications improve the bug
finding performance of the agents.

Title: Sandwiches for Promise Constraint Satisfaction
Authors: Guofeng Deng, Ezzeddine El Sai, Trevor Manders, Peter Mayr, Poramate

Categories: cs.CC
\\
  Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problems (PCSP) were proposed recently by
Brakensiek and Guruswami arXiv:1704.01937 as a framework to study
approximations for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). Informally a PCSP
asks to distinguish between whether a given instance of a CSP has a solution or
not even a specified relaxation can be satisfied. All currently known tractable
PCSPs can be reduced in a natural way to tractable CSPs. Barto arXiv:1909.04878
presented an example of a PCSP over Boolean structures for which this reduction
requires solving a CSP over an infinite structure. We give a first example of a
PCSP over Boolean structures which reduces to a tractable CSP over a structure
of size $3$ but not smaller. Further we investigate properties of PCSPs that
reduce to systems of linear equations or to CSPs over structures with
semilattice or majority polymorphism.

  A suite of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations geared towards
chemical process equipment modelling has been developed and validated with
experimental results from the literature. Various regression based active
learning strategies are explored with these CFD simulators in-the-loop under
the constraints of a limited function evaluation budget. Specifically, five
different sampling strategies and five regression techniques are compared,
considering a set of three test cases of industrial significance and varying
complexity. Gaussian process regression was observed to have a consistently
good performance for these applications. The present quantitative study
outlines the pros and cons of the different available techniques and highlights
the best practices for their adoption. The test cases and tools are available
with an open-source license, to ensure reproducibility and engage the wider
research community in contributing to both the CFD models and developing and
benchmarking new improved algorithms tailored to this field.

Title: Effective Response of Heterogeneous Materials using the Recursive
  Projection Method
Authors: Xiaoyao Peng, Dhriti Nepal, Kaushik Dayal
Categories: cs.CE
Journal-ref: Comput. Methods. Appl. Mech. Engrg. 364:112946, 2020
DOI: 10.1016/j.cma.2020.112946
\\
  This paper applies the Recursive Projection Method (RPM) to the problem of
finding the effective mechanical response of a periodic heterogeneous solid.
Previous works apply the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in combination with
various fixed-point methods to solve the problem on the periodic unit cell.
These have proven extremely powerful in a range of problems ranging from
image-based modeling to dislocation plasticity. However, the fixed-point
iterations can converge very slowly, or not at all, if the elastic properties
have high contrast, such as in the case of voids. The paper examines the
reasons for slow, or lack of convergence, in terms of a variational
perspective. In particular, when the material contains regions with zero or
very small stiffness, there is lack of uniqueness, and the energy landscape has
flat or shallow directions. Therefore, in this work, the fixed-point iteration
is replaced by the RPM iteration. The RPM uses the fixed-point iteration to
adaptively identify the subspace on which fixed-point iterations are unstable,
and performs Newton iterations only on the unstable subspace, while fixed-point
iterations are performed on the complementary stable subspace. This combination
of efficient fixed-point iterations where possible, and expensive but
well-convergent Newton iterations where required, is shown to lead to robust
and efficient convergence of the method. In particular, RPM-FFT converges well
for a wide range of choices of the reference medium, while usual fixed-point
iterations are usually sensitive to this choice.

Title: On beta-Plurality Points in Spatial Voting Games
Authors: Boris Aronov and Mark de Berg and Joachim Gudmundsson and Michael
  Horton
Categories: cs.CG
Comments: 18 pages, 8 figures, SoCG'20
ACM-class: F.2.2
\\
  Let $V$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, called voters. A point
$p\in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a plurality point for $V$ when the following holds: for
every $q\in\mathbb{R}^d$ the number of voters closer to $p$ than to $q$ is at
least the number of voters closer to $q$ than to $p$. Thus, in a vote where
each $v\in V$ votes for the nearest proposal (and voters for which the
proposals are at equal distance abstain), proposal $p$ will not lose against
any alternative proposal $q$. For most voter sets a plurality point does not
exist. We therefore introduce the concept of $\beta$-plurality points, which
are defined similarly to regular plurality points except that the distance of
each voter to $p$ (but not to $q$) is scaled by a factor $\beta$, for some
constant $0<\beta\leq 1$. We investigate the existence and computation of
$\beta$-plurality points, and obtain the following results.
  * Define $\beta^*_d := \sup \{ \beta : \text{any finite multiset $V$ in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a $\beta$-plurality point} \}$. We prove that $\beta^*_2
= \sqrt{3}/2$, and that $1/\sqrt{d} \leq \beta^*_d \leq \sqrt{3}/2$ for all
$d\geq 3$.
  * Define $\beta(V) := \sup \{ \beta : \text{$V$ admits a $\beta$-plurality
point}\}$. We present an algorithm that, given a voter set $V$ in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, computes an $(1-\varepsilon)\cdot \beta(V)$ plurality point in
time $O(\frac{n^2}{\varepsilon^{3d-2}} \cdot \log \frac{n}{\varepsilon^{d-1}}
\cdot \log^2 \frac {1}{\varepsilon})$.

Title: Book Embeddings of Nonplanar Graphs with Small Faces in Few Pages
Authors: Michael A. Bekos, Giordano Da Lozzo, Svenja Griesbach, Martin
  Gronemann, Fabrizio Montecchiani, Chrysanthi Raftopoulou
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  An embedding of a graph in a book, called book embedding, consists of a
linear ordering of its vertices along the spine of the book and an assignment
of its edges to the pages of the book, so that no two edges on the same page
cross. The book thickness of a graph is the minimum number of pages over all
its book embeddings. For planar graphs, a fundamental result is due to
Yannakakis, who proposed an algorithm to compute embeddings of planar graphs in
books with four pages. Our main contribution is a technique that generalizes
this result to a much wider family of nonplanar graphs, which is characterized
by a biconnected skeleton of crossing-free edges whose faces have bounded
degree. Notably, this family includes all 1-planar and all optimal 2-planar
graphs as subgraphs. We prove that this family of graphs has bounded book
thickness, and as a corollary, we obtain the first constant upper bound for the
book thickness of optimal 2-planar graphs.

Title: The Parameterized Complexity of Guarding Almost Convex Polygons
Authors: Akanksha Agrawal, Kristine V.K. Knudsen, Daniel Lokshtanov, Saket

\\
  Art Gallery is a fundamental visibility problem in Computational Geometry.
The input consists of a simple polygon P, (possibly infinite) sets G and C of
points within P, and an integer k; the task is to decide if at most k guards
can be placed on points in G so that every point in C is visible to at least
one guard. In the classic formulation of Art Gallery, G and C consist of all
the points within P. Other well-known variants restrict G and C to consist
either of all the points on the boundary of P or of all the vertices of P.
Recently, three new important discoveries were made: the above mentioned
variants of Art Gallery are all W[1]-hard with respect to k [Bonnet and
Miltzow, ESA'16], the classic variant has an O(log k)-approximation algorithm
[Bonnet and Miltzow, SoCG'17], and it may require irrational guards [Abrahamsen
et al., SoCG'17]. Building upon the third result, the classic variant and the
case where G consists only of all the points on the boundary of P were both
shown to be \exists R-complete~[Abrahamsen et al., STOC'18]. Even when both G
and C consist only of all the points on the boundary of P, the problem is not
known to be in NP.
  Given the first discovery, the following question was posed by Giannopoulos
[Lorentz Center Workshop, 2016]: Is Art Gallery FPT with respect to r, the
number of reflex vertices? We focus on the variant where G and C are all the
vertices of P, called Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery. We show that Vertex-Vertex Art
Gallery is solvable in time r^{O(r^2)}n^{O(1)}. Our approach also extends to
assert that Vertex-Boundary Art Gallery and Boundary-Vertex Art Gallery are
both FPT. We utilize structural properties of "almost convex polygons" to
present a two-stage reduction from Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery to a new
constraint satisfaction problem (whose solution is also provided in this paper)
where constraints have arity 2 and involve monotone functions.

  In this paper, we present an analysis of computationally generated
mixed-modality definite referring expressions using combinations of gesture and
linguistic descriptions. In doing so, we expose some striking formal semantic
properties of the interactions between gesture and language, conditioned on the
introduction of content into the common ground between the (computational)
speaker and (human) viewer, and demonstrate how these formal features can
contribute to training better models to predict viewer judgment of referring
expressions, and potentially to the generation of more natural and informative
referring expressions.

  Motivation: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Normalisation (NEN) are core
components of any text-mining system for biomedical texts. In a traditional
concept-recognition pipeline, these tasks are combined in a serial way, which
is inherently prone to error propagation from NER to NEN. We propose a parallel
architecture, where both NER and NEN are modeled as a sequence-labeling task,
operating directly on the source text. We examine different harmonisation
strategies for merging the predictions of the two classifiers into a single
output sequence. Results: We test our approach on the recent Version 4 of the
CRAFT corpus. In all 20 annotation sets of the concept-annotation task, our
system outperforms the pipeline system reported as a baseline in the CRAFT
shared task 2019. Our analysis shows that the strengths of the two classifiers
can be combined in a fruitful way. However, prediction harmonisation requires
individual calibration on a development set for each annotation set. This
allows achieving a good trade-off between established knowledge (training set)
and novel information (unseen concepts). Availability and Implementation:

blackbox machine learning techniques, these frameworks cannot be trusted by the
clinicians due to the lack of clinical explainability. To obtain the trust of
clinicians, we explore the big question, can twitter posts provide enough
information to fill up clinical PTSD assessment surveys that have been
traditionally trusted by clinicians? To answer the above question, we propose,
LAXARY (Linguistic Analysis-based Exaplainable Inquiry) model, a novel
Explainable Artificial Intelligent (XAI) model to detect and represent PTSD
assessment of twitter users using a modified Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(LIWC) analysis. First, we employ clinically validated survey tools for
collecting clinical PTSD assessment data from real twitter users and develop a
PTSD Linguistic Dictionary using the PTSD assessment survey results. Then, we
use the PTSD Linguistic Dictionary along with machine learning model to fill up
the survey tools towards detecting PTSD status and its intensity of
corresponding twitter users. Our experimental evaluation on 210 clinically
validated veteran twitter users provides promising accuracies of both PTSD
classification and its intensity estimation. We also evaluate our developed
PTSD Linguistic Dictionary's reliability and validity.

Title: A Label Proportions Estimation technique for Adversarial Domain
  Adaptation in Text Classification
Authors: Zhuohao Chen
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Many text classification tasks are domain-dependent, and various domain
adaptation approaches have been proposed to predict unlabeled data in a new
domain. Domain-adversarial neural networks(DANN) and their variants have been
actively used recently and have achieved state-of-the-art results for this
problem. However, most of these approaches assume that the label proportions of
the source and target domains are similar, which rarely holds in real-world
scenarios. Sometimes the label shift is very large and the DANN fails to learn
domain-invariant features. In this study, we focus on unsupervised domain
adaptation of text classification with label shift and introduce a domain
adversarial network with label proportions estimation (DAN-LPE) framework. The
DAN-LPEsimultaneously trains a domain adversarial net and processes label
proportions estimation by the distributions of the predictions. Experiments
show the DAN-LPE achieves a good estimate of the target label distributions and
reduces the label shift to improve the classification performance.

  Twenty-five years ago, morphologically aligned Hebrew-Finnish and
Greek-Finnish bitexts (texts accompanied by a translation) were constructed
manually in order to create an analytical concordance (Luoto et al., 1997) for
a Finnish Bible translation. The creators of the bitexts recently secured the
publisher's permission to release its fine-grained alignment, but the alignment
was still dependent on proprietary, third-party resources such as a copyrighted
text edition and proprietary morphological analyses of the source texts. In
this paper, we describe a nontrivial editorial process starting from the
creation of the original one-purpose database and ending with its
reconstruction using only freely available text editions and annotations. This
process produced an openly available dataset that contains (i) the source texts
and their translations, (ii) the morphological analyses, (iii) the
cross-lingual morpheme alignments.

Title: Offensive Language Identification in Greek
Authors: Zeses Pitenis, Marcos Zampieri, Tharindu Ranasinghe
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to LREC 2020
\\
  As offensive language has become a rising issue for online communities and
social media platforms, researchers have been investigating ways of coping with
abusive content and developing systems to detect its different types:
cyberbullying, hate speech, aggression, etc. With a few notable exceptions,
most research on this topic so far has dealt with English. This is mostly due
to the availability of language resources for English. To address this
shortcoming, this paper presents the first Greek annotated dataset for
offensive language identification: the Offensive Greek Tweet Dataset (OGTD).
OGTD is a manually annotated dataset containing 4,779 posts from Twitter
annotated as offensive and not offensive. Along with a detailed description of
the dataset, we evaluate several computational models trained and tested on
this data.

\\
  Due to the significance and value in human-computer interaction and natural
language processing, task-oriented dialog systems are attracting more and more
attention in both academic and industrial communities. In this paper, we survey
recent advances and challenges in an issue-specific manner. We discuss three
critical topics for task-oriented dialog systems: (1) improving data efficiency
to facilitate dialog system modeling in low-resource settings, (2) modeling
multi-turn dynamics for dialog policy learning to achieve better
task-completion performance, and (3) integrating domain ontology knowledge into
the dialog model in both pipeline and end-to-end models. We also review the
recent progresses in dialog evaluation and some widely-used corpora. We believe
that this survey can shed a light on future research in task-oriented dialog
systems.

  In the United States, 25% or greater than 200 billion dollars of hospital
spending accounts for administrative costs that involve services for medical
coding and billing. With the increasing number of patient records, manual
assignment of the codes performed is overwhelming, time-consuming and
error-prone, causing billing errors. Natural language processing can automate
the extraction of codes/labels from unstructured clinical notes, which can aid
human coders to save time, increase productivity, and verify medical coding
errors. Our objective is to identify appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes
from clinical notes by performing multi-label classification. We used
de-identified data of critical care patients from the MIMIC-III database and
subset the data to select the ten (top-10) and fifty (top-50) most common
diagnoses and procedures, which covers 47.45% and 74.12% of all admissions
respectively. We implemented state-of-the-art Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) to fine-tune the language model on 80%
of the data and validated on the remaining 20%. The model achieved an overall
accuracy of 87.08%, an F1 score of 85.82%, and an AUC of 91.76% for top-10
codes. For the top-50 codes, our model achieved an overall accuracy of 93.76%,
an F1 score of 92.24%, and AUC of 91%. When compared to previously published
research, our model outperforms in predicting codes from the clinical text. We
discuss approaches to generalize the knowledge discovery process of our
MIMIC-BERT to other clinical notes. This can help human coders to save time,
prevent backlogs, and additional costs due to coding errors.

  Personalized dialogue systems are an essential step toward better
human-machine interaction. Existing personalized dialogue agents rely on
properly designed conversational datasets, which are mostly monolingual (e.g.,
English), which greatly limits the usage of conversational agents in other
languages. In this paper, we propose a multi-lingual extension of Persona-Chat,
namely XPersona. Our dataset includes persona conversations in six different
languages other than English for building and evaluating multilingual
personalized agents. We experiment with both multilingual and cross-lingual
trained baselines, and evaluate them against monolingual and
translation-pipeline models using both automatic and human evaluation.
Experimental results show that the multilingual trained models outperform the
translation-pipeline and that they are on par with the monolingual models, with
the advantage of having a single model across multiple languages. On the other
hand, the state-of-the-art cross-lingual trained models achieve inferior
performance to the other models, showing that cross-lingual conversation
modeling is a challenging task. We hope that our dataset and
baselines~\footnote{Datasets and all the baselines will be released} will
accelerate research in multilingual dialogue systems.

  Mental health poses a significant challenge for an individual's well-being.
Text analysis of rich resources, like social media, can contribute to deeper
understanding of illnesses and provide means for their early detection. We
tackle a challenge of detecting social media users' mental status through deep
learning-based models, moving away from traditional approaches to the task. In
a binary classification task on predicting if a user suffers from one of nine
different disorders, a hierarchical attention network outperforms previously
set benchmarks for four of the disorders. Furthermore, we explore the
limitations of our model and analyze phrases relevant for classification by
inspecting the model's word-level attention weights.

\\
  Most approaches to emotion analysis regarding social media, literature, news,
and other domains focus exclusively on basic emotion categories as defined by
Ekman or Plutchik. However, art (such as literature) enables engagement in a
broader range of more complex and subtle emotions that have been shown to also
include mixed emotional responses. We consider emotions as they are elicited in
the reader, rather than what is expressed in the text or intended by the
author. Thus, we conceptualize a set of aesthetic emotions that are predictive
of aesthetic appreciation in the reader, and allow the annotation of multiple
labels per line to capture mixed emotions within context. We evaluate this
novel setting in an annotation experiment both with carefully trained experts
and via crowdsourcing. Our annotation with experts leads to an acceptable
agreement of kappa=.70, resulting in a consistent dataset for future large
scale analysis. Finally, we conduct first emotion classification experiments
based on BERT, showing that identifying aesthetic emotions is challenging in
our data, with up to .52 F1-micro on the German subset. Data and resources are

  Entity alignment seeks to find entities in different knowledge graphs (KGs)
that refer to the same real-world object. Recent advancement in KG embedding
impels the advent of embedding-based entity alignment, which encodes entities
in a continuous embedding space and measures entity similarities based on the
learned embeddings. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive experimental
study of this emerging field. This study surveys 23 recent embedding-based
entity alignment approaches and categorizes them based on their techniques and
characteristics. We further observe that current approaches use different
datasets in evaluation, and the degree distributions of entities in these
datasets are inconsistent with real KGs. Hence, we propose a new KG sampling
algorithm, with which we generate a set of dedicated benchmark datasets with
various heterogeneity and distributions for a realistic evaluation. This study
also produces an open-source library, which includes 12 representative
embedding-based entity alignment approaches. We extensively evaluate these
approaches on the generated datasets, to understand their strengths and
limitations. Additionally, for several directions that have not been explored
in current approaches, we perform exploratory experiments and report our
preliminary findings for future studies. The benchmark datasets, open-source
library and experimental results are all accessible online and will be duly
maintained.

Title: Rethinking Batch Normalization in Transformers
Authors: Sheng Shen, Zhewei Yao, Amir Gholami, Michael Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  The standard normalization method for neural network (NN) models used in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is layer normalization (LN). This is
different than batch normalization (BN), which is widely-adopted in Computer
Vision. The preferred use of LN in NLP is principally due to the empirical
observation that a (naive/vanilla) use of BN leads to significant performance
degradation for NLP tasks; however, a thorough understanding of the underlying
reasons for this is not always evident. In this paper, we perform a systematic
study of NLP transformer models to understand why BN has a poor performance, as
compared to LN. We find that the statistics of NLP data across the batch
dimension exhibit large fluctuations throughout training. This results in
instability, if BN is naively implemented. To address this, we propose Power
Normalization (PN), a novel normalization scheme that resolves this issue by
(i) relaxing zero-mean normalization in BN, (ii) incorporating a running
quadratic mean instead of per batch statistics to stabilize fluctuations, and
(iii) using an approximate backpropagation for incorporating the running
statistics in the forward pass. We show theoretically, under mild assumptions,
that PN leads to a smaller Lipschitz constant for the loss, compared with BN.
Furthermore, we prove that the approximate backpropagation scheme leads to
bounded gradients. We extensively test PN for transformers on a range of NLP
tasks, and we show that it significantly outperforms both LN and BN. In
particular, PN outperforms LN by 0.4/0.6 BLEU on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 5.6/3.0 PPL
on PTB/WikiText-103.

  We analyze the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol for structural
weaknesses using the Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer (CPSA) in the first
formal analysis of SRP (specifically, Version 3).
  SRP is a widely deployed Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol
used in 1Password, iCloud Keychain, and other products. As with many PAKE
protocols, two participants use knowledge of a pre-shared password to
authenticate each other and establish a session key. SRP aims to resist
dictionary attacks, not store plaintext-equivalent passwords on the server,
avoid patent infringement, and avoid export controls by not using encryption.
Formal analysis of SRP is challenging in part because existing tools provide no
simple way to reason about its use of the mathematical expression $v + g^b \mod
q$.
  Modeling $v + g^b$ as encryption, we complete an exhaustive study of all
possible execution sequences of SRP. Ignoring possible algebraic attacks, this
analysis detects no major structural weakness, and in particular no leakage of
any secrets. We do uncover one notable weakness of SRP, which follows from its
design constraints. It is possible for a malicious server to fake an
authentication session with a client, without the client's participation. This
action might facilitate an escalation of privilege attack, if the client has
higher privileges than does the server. We conceived of this attack before we
used CPSA and confirmed it by generating corresponding execution shapes using
CPSA.

Title: Physical Time-Varying Transfer Functions as Generic Low-Overhead
  Power-SCA Countermeasure
Authors: Archisman Ghosh, Debayan Das and Shreyas Sen
Categories: cs.CR cs.AR
\\
  Mathematically-secure cryptographic algorithms leak significant side channel
information through their power supplies when implemented on a physical
platform. These side channel leakages can be exploited by an attacker to
extract the secret key of an embedded device. The existing state-of-the-art
countermeasures mainly focus on the power balancing, gate-level masking, or
signal-to-noise (SNR) reduction using noise injection and signature
attenuation, all of which suffer either from the limitations of high power/area
overheads, performance degradation or are not synthesizable. In this article,
we propose a generic low-overhead digital-friendly power SCA countermeasure
utilizing physical Time-Varying Transfer Functions (TVTF) by randomly shuffling
distributed switched capacitors to significantly obfuscate the traces in the
time domain. System-level simulation results of the TVTF-AES implemented in
TSMC 65nm CMOS technology show > 4000x MTD improvement over the unprotected
implementation with nearly 1.25x power and 1.2x area overheads, and without any
performance degradation.

Title: SMACS: Smart Contract Access Control Service
Authors: Bowen Liu, Siwei Sun, Pawel Szalachowski
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: IEEE/IFIP DSN'20
\\
  Although blockchain-based smart contracts promise a ``trustless'' way of
enforcing agreements even with monetary consequences, they suffer from multiple
security issues. Many of these issues could be mitigated via an effective
access control system, however, its realization is challenging due to the
properties of current blockchain platforms (like lack of privacy, costly
on-chain resources, or latency). To address this problem, we propose the SMACS
framework, where updatable and sophisticated Access Control Rules (ACRs)} for
smart contracts can be realized with low cost. SMACS shifts the burden of
expensive ACRs validation and management operations to an off-chain
infrastructure, while implementing on-chain only lightweight token-based access
control. SMACS is flexible and in addition to simple access control lists can
easily implement rules enhancing the runtime security of smart contracts. With
dedicated ACRs backed by vulnerability-detection tools, SMACS can protect
vulnerable contracts after deployment. We fully implement SMACS and evaluate
it.

  Risk-based authentication (RBA) is an adaptive security measure to strengthen
password-based authentication. RBA monitors additional implicit features during
password entry such as device or geolocation information, and requests
additional authentication factors if a certain risk level is detected. RBA is
recommended by the NIST digital identity guidelines, is used by several large
online services, and offers protection against security risks such as password
database leaks, credential stuffing, insecure passwords and large-scale
guessing attacks. Despite its relevance, the procedures used by
RBA-instrumented online services are currently not disclosed. Consequently,
there is little scientific research about RBA, slowing down progress and deeper
understanding, making it harder for end users to understand the security
provided by the services they use and trust, and hindering the widespread
adoption of RBA.
  In this paper, with a series of studies on eight popular online services, we
(i) analyze which features and combinations/classifiers are used and are useful
in practical instances, (ii) develop a framework and a methodology to measure
RBA in the wild, and (iii) survey and discuss the differences in the user
interface for RBA. Following this, our work provides a first deeper
understanding of practical RBA deployments and helps fostering further research
in this direction.

Title: Privacy-preserving Weighted Federated Learning within Oracle-Aided MPC
  Framework
Authors: Huafei Zhu, Zengxiang Li, Merivyn Cheah, Rick Siow Mong Goh
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  This paper studies privacy-preserving weighted federated learning within the
oracle-aided multi-party computation (MPC) framework. The contribution of this
paper mainly comprises the following three-fold:
  In the first fold, a new notion which we call weighted federated learning
(wFL) is introduced and formalized inspired by McMahan et al.'s seminal paper.
The weighted federated learning concept formalized in this paper differs from
that presented in McMahan et al.'s paper since both addition and multiplication
operations are executed over ciphers in our model while these operations are
executed over plaintexts in McMahan et al.'s model.
  In the second fold, an oracle-aided MPC solution for computing weighted
federated learning is formalized by decoupling the security of federated
learning systems from that of underlying multi-party computations. Our
decoupling formulation may benefit machine learning developers to select their
best security practices from the state-of-the-art security tool sets;
  In the third fold, a concrete solution to the weighted federated learning
problem is presented and analysed. The security of our implementation is
guaranteed by the security composition theorem assuming that the underlying
multiplication algorithm is secure against honest-but-curious adversaries.

Title: Pretraining Image Encoders without Reconstruction via Feature Prediction
  Loss
Authors: Gustav Grund Pihlgren (1), Fredrik Sandin (1), Marcus Liwicki (1) ((1)

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  This work investigates three different loss functions for autoencoder-based
pretraining of image encoders: The commonly used reconstruction loss, the more
recently introduced perceptual similarity loss, and a feature prediction loss
proposed here; the latter turning out to be the most efficient choice. Former
work shows that predictions based on embeddings generated by image autoencoders
can be improved by training with perceptual loss. So far the autoencoders
trained with perceptual loss networks implemented an explicit comparison of the
original and reconstructed images using the loss network. However, given such a
loss network we show that there is no need for the timeconsuming task of
decoding the entire image. Instead, we propose to decode the features of the
loss network, hence the name "feature prediction loss". To evaluate this method
we compare six different procedures for training image encoders based on
pixel-wise, perceptual similarity, and feature prediction loss. The
embedding-based prediction results show that encoders trained with feature
prediction loss is as good or better than those trained with the other two
losses. Additionally, the encoder is significantly faster to train using
feature prediction loss in comparison to the other losses. The method
implementation used in this work is available online:

  The existing real time object detection algorithm is based on the deep neural
network of convolution need to perform multilevel convolution and pooling
operations on the entire image to extract a deep semantic characteristic of the
image. The detection models perform better for large objects. However, these
models do not detect small objects with low resolution and noise, because the
features of existing models do not fully represent the essential features of
small objects after repeated convolution operations. We have introduced a novel
real time detection algorithm which employs upsampling and skip connection to
extract multiscale features at different convolution levels in a learning task
resulting a remarkable performance in detecting small objects. The detection
precision of the model is shown to be higher and faster than that of the
state-of-the-art models.

Title: Object-Centric Image Generation from Layouts

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Despite recent impressive results on single-object and single-domain image
generation, the generation of complex scenes with multiple objects remains
challenging. In this paper, we start with the idea that a model must be able to
understand individual objects and relationships between objects in order to
generate complex scenes well. Our layout-to-image-generation method, which we
call Object-Centric Generative Adversarial Network (or OC-GAN), relies on a
novel Scene-Graph Similarity Module (SGSM). The SGSM learns representations of
the spatial relationships between objects in the scene, which lead to our
model's improved layout-fidelity. We also propose changes to the conditioning
mechanism of the generator that enhance its object instance-awareness. Apart
from improving image quality, our contributions mitigate two failure modes in
previous approaches: (1) spurious objects being generated without corresponding
bounding boxes in the layout, and (2) overlapping bounding boxes in the layout
leading to merged objects in images. Extensive quantitative evaluation and
ablation studies demonstrate the impact of our contributions, with our model
outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches on both the COCO-Stuff and
Visual Genome datasets. Finally, we address an important limitation of
evaluation metrics used in previous works by introducing SceneFID -- an
object-centric adaptation of the popular Fr{\'e}chet Inception Distance metric,
that is better suited for multi-object images.

Title: SlimConv: Reducing Channel Redundancy in Convolutional Neural Networks
  by Weights Flipping
Authors: Jiaxiong Qiu, Cai Chen, Shuaicheng Liu, Bing Zeng
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: 20 pages
\\
  The channel redundancy in feature maps of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) results in the large consumption of memories and computational
resources. In this work, we design a novel Slim Convolution (SlimConv) module
to boost the performance of CNNs by reducing channel redundancies. Our SlimConv
consists of three main steps: Reconstruct, Transform and Fuse, through which
the features are splitted and reorganized in a more efficient way, such that
the learned weights can be compressed effectively. In particular, the core of
our model is a weight flipping operation which can largely improve the feature
diversities, contributing to the performance crucially. Our SlimConv is a
plug-and-play architectural unit which can be used to replace convolutional
layers in CNNs directly. We validate the effectiveness of SlimConv by
conducting comprehensive experiments on ImageNet, MS COCO2014, Pascal VOC2012
segmentation, and Pascal VOC2007 detection datasets. The experiments show that
SlimConv-equipped models can achieve better performances consistently, less
consumption of memory and computation resources than non-equipped conterparts.
For example, the ResNet-101 fitted with SlimConv achieves 77.84% top-1
classification accuracy with 4.87 GFLOPs and 27.96M parameters on ImageNet,
which shows almost 0.5% better performance with about 3 GFLOPs and 38%
parameters reduced.

\\
  Arbitrary shape text detection is a challenging task due to the high variety
and complexity of scenes texts. In this paper, we propose a novel unified
relational reasoning graph network for arbitrary shape text detection. In our
method, an innovative local graph bridges a text proposal model via
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a deep relational reasoning network via
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), making our network end-to-end trainable. To
be concrete, every text instance will be divided into a series of small
rectangular components, and the geometry attributes (e.g., height, width, and
orientation) of the small components will be estimated by our text proposal
model. Given the geometry attributes, the local graph construction model can
roughly establish linkages between different text components. For further
reasoning and deducing the likelihood of linkages between the component and its
neighbors, we adopt a graph-based network to perform deep relational reasoning
on local graphs. Experiments on public available datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of our method.

\\
  Exploring the intrinsic interconnections between the knowledge encoded in
PRe-trained Deep Neural Networks (PR-DNNs) of heterogeneous tasks sheds light
on their mutual transferability, and consequently enables knowledge transfer
from one task to another so as to reduce the training effort of the latter. In
this paper, we propose the DEeP Attribution gRAph (DEPARA) to investigate the
transferability of knowledge learned from PR-DNNs. In DEPARA, nodes correspond
to the inputs and are represented by their vectorized attribution maps with
regards to the outputs of the PR-DNN. Edges denote the relatedness between
inputs and are measured by the similarity of their features extracted from the
PR-DNN. The knowledge transferability of two PR-DNNs is measured by the
similarity of their corresponding DEPARAs. We apply DEPARA to two important yet
under-studied problems in transfer learning: pre-trained model selection and
layer selection. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in solving both these
problems. Code, data and models reproducing the results in this paper are
available at \url{https://github.com/zju-vipa/DEPARA}.

Title: Predictively Encoded Graph Convolutional Network for Noise-Robust
  Skeleton-based Action Recognition
Authors: Jongmin Yu, Yongsang Yoon, and Moongu Jeon
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: Submitted to ECCV 2020
\\
  In skeleton-based action recognition, graph convolutional networks (GCNs),
which model human body skeletons using graphical components such as nodes and
connections, have achieved remarkable performance recently. However, current
state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based action recognition usually work on
the assumption that the completely observed skeletons will be provided. This
may be problematic to apply this assumption in real scenarios since there is
always a possibility that captured skeletons are incomplete or noisy. In this
work, we propose a skeleton-based action recognition method which is robust to
noise information of given skeleton features. The key insight of our approach
is to train a model by maximizing the mutual information between normal and
noisy skeletons using a predictive coding manner. We have conducted
comprehensive experiments about skeleton-based action recognition with defected
skeletons using NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics-Skeleton datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that our approach achieves outstanding performance when
skeleton samples are noised compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Augmented Parallel-Pyramid Net for Attention Guided Pose-Estimation
Authors: Luanxuan Hou and Jie Cao and Yuan Zhao and Haifeng Shen and Yiping
  Meng and Ran He and Jieping Ye
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The target of human pose estimation is to determine body part or joint
locations of each person from an image. This is a challenging problems with
wide applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes an augmented
parallel-pyramid net with attention partial module and differentiable auto-data
augmentation. Technically, a parallel pyramid structure is proposed to
compensate the loss of information. We take the design of parallel structure
for reverse compensation. Meanwhile, the overall computational complexity does
not increase. We further define an Attention Partial Module (APM) operator to
extract weighted features from different scale feature maps generated by the
parallel pyramid structure. Compared with refining through upsampling operator,
APM can better capture the relationship between channels. At last, we proposed
a differentiable auto data augmentation method to further improve estimation
accuracy. We define a new pose search space where the sequences of data
augmentations are formulated as a trainable and operational CNN component.
Experiments corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, our
method achieves the top-1 accuracy on the challenging COCO keypoint benchmark
and the state-of-the-art results on the MPII datasets.

Title: Revisiting the Sibling Head in Object Detector
Authors: Guanglu Song, Yu Liu, Xiaogang Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accept to CVPR 2020 & Method of Champion of OpenImage Challenge 2019,
  detection track
\\
  The ``shared head for classification and localization'' (sibling head),
firstly denominated in Fast RCNN~\cite{girshick2015fast}, has been leading the
fashion of the object detection community in the past five years. This paper
provides the observation that the spatial misalignment between the two object
functions in the sibling head can considerably hurt the training process, but
this misalignment can be resolved by a very simple operator called task-aware
spatial disentanglement (TSD). Considering the classification and regression,
TSD decouples them from the spatial dimension by generating two disentangled
proposals for them, which are estimated by the shared proposal. This is
inspired by the natural insight that for one instance, the features in some
salient area may have rich information for classification while these around
the boundary may be good at bounding box regression. Surprisingly, this simple
design can boost all backbones and models on both MS COCO and Google OpenImage
consistently by ~3% mAP. Further, we propose a progressive constraint to
enlarge the performance margin between the disentangled and the shared
proposals, and gain ~1% more mAP. We show the \algname{} breaks through the
upper bound of nowadays single-model detector by a large margin (mAP 49.4 with
ResNet-101, 51.2 with SENet154), and is the core model of our 1st place
solution on the Google OpenImage Challenge 2019.

Title: KPNet: Towards Minimal Face Detector
Authors: Guanglu Song, Yu Liu, Yuhang Zang, Xiaogang Wang, Biao Leng, Qingsheng

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  The small receptive field and capacity of minimal neural networks limit their
performance when using them to be the backbone of detectors. In this work, we
find that the appearance feature of a generic face is discriminative enough for
a tiny and shallow neural network to verify from the background. And the
essential barriers behind us are 1) the vague definition of the face bounding
box and 2) tricky design of anchor-boxes or receptive field. Unlike most
top-down methods for joint face detection and alignment, the proposed KPNet
detects small facial keypoints instead of the whole face by in a bottom-up
manner. It first predicts the facial landmarks from a low-resolution image via
the well-designed fine-grained scale approximation and scale adaptive
soft-argmax operator. Finally, the precise face bounding boxes, no matter how
we define it, can be inferred from the keypoints. Without any complex head
architecture or meticulous network designing, the KPNet achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on generic face detection and alignment benchmarks
with only $\sim1M$ parameters, which runs at 1000fps on GPU and is easy to
perform real-time on most modern front-end chips.

Title: 1st Place Solutions for OpenImage2019 -- Object Detection and Instance
  Segmentation
Authors: Yu Liu, Guanglu Song, Yuhang Zang, Yan Gao, Enze Xie, Junjie Yan, Chen
  Change Loy, Xiaogang Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This article introduces the solutions of the two champion teams, `MMfruit'
for the detection track and `MMfruitSeg' for the segmentation track, in
OpenImage Challenge 2019. It is commonly known that for an object detector, the
shared feature at the end of the backbone is not appropriate for both
classification and regression, which greatly limits the performance of both
single stage detector and Faster RCNN \cite{ren2015faster} based detector. In
this competition, we observe that even with a shared feature, different
locations in one object has completely inconsistent performances for the two
tasks. \textit{E.g. the features of salient locations are usually good for
classification, while those around the object edge are good for regression.}
Inspired by this, we propose the Decoupling Head (DH) to disentangle the object
classification and regression via the self-learned optimal feature extraction,
which leads to a great improvement. Furthermore, we adjust the soft-NMS
algorithm to adj-NMS to obtain stable performance improvement. Finally, a
well-designed ensemble strategy via voting the bounding box location and
confidence is proposed. We will also introduce several training/inferencing
strategies and a bag of tricks that give minor improvement. Given those masses
of details, we train and aggregate 28 global models with various backbones,
heads and 3+2 expert models, and achieves the 1st place on the OpenImage 2019
Object Detection Challenge on the both public and private leadboards. Given
such good instance bounding box, we further design a simple instance-level
semantic segmentation pipeline and achieve the 1st place on the segmentation
challenge.

Title: GFTE: Graph-based Financial Table Extraction
Authors: Yiren Li, Zheng Huang, Junchi Yan, Yi Zhou, Fan Ye and Xianhui Liu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Tabular data is a crucial form of information expression, which can organize
data in a standard structure for easy information retrieval and comparison.
However, in financial industry and many other fields tables are often disclosed
in unstructured digital files, e.g. Portable Document Format (PDF) and images,
which are difficult to be extracted directly. In this paper, to facilitate deep
learning based table extraction from unstructured digital files, we publish a
standard Chinese dataset named FinTab, which contains more than 1,600 financial
tables of diverse kinds and their corresponding structure representation in
JSON. In addition, we propose a novel graph-based convolutional neural network
model named GFTE as a baseline for future comparison. GFTE integrates image
feature, position feature and textual feature together for precise edge
prediction and reaches overall good results.

Title: Neural Mesh Refiner for 6-DoF Pose Estimation

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  How can we effectively utilise the 2D monocular image information for
recovering the 6D pose (6-DoF) of the visual objects? Deep learning has shown
to be effective for robust and real-time monocular pose estimation. Oftentimes,
the network learns to regress the 6-DoF pose using a naive loss function.
However, due to a lack of geometrical scene understanding from the directly
regressed pose estimation, there are misalignments between the rendered mesh
from the 3D object and the 2D instance segmentation result, \emph{e.g.},
bounding boxes and masks prediction. This paper bridges the gap between 2D mask
generation and 3D location prediction via a differentiable neural mesh
renderer. We utilise the overlay between the accurate mask prediction and less
accurate mesh prediction to iteratively optimise the direct regressed 6D pose
information with a focus on translation estimation. By leveraging geometry, we
demonstrate that our technique significantly improves direct regression
performance on the difficult task of translation estimation and achieve the
state of the art results on Peking University/Baidu - Autonomous Driving
dataset and the ApolloScape 3D Car Instance dataset. The code can be found at

Title: Feedback Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-based Action
  Recognition

Comments: 18 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted considerable attention in
computer vision since skeleton data is more robust to the dynamic circumstance
and complicated background than other modalities. Recently, many researchers
have used the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to model spatial-temporal
features of skeleton sequences by an end-to-end optimization. However,
conventional GCNs are feedforward networks which are impossible for low-level
layers to access semantic information in the high-level layers. In this paper,
we propose a novel network, named Feedback Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN).
This is the first work that introduces the feedback mechanism into GCNs and
action recognition. Compared with conventional GCNs, FGCN has the following
advantages: (1) a multi-stage temporal sampling strategy is designed to extract
spatial-temporal features for action recognition in a coarse-to-fine
progressive process; (2) A dense connections based Feedback Graph Convolutional
Block (FGCB) is proposed to introduce feedback connections into the GCNs. It
transmits the high-level semantic features to the low-level layers and flows
temporal information stage by stage to progressively model global
spatial-temporal features for action recognition; (3) The FGCN model provides
early predictions. In the early stages, the model receives partial information
about actions. Naturally, its predictions are relatively coarse. The coarse
predictions are treated as the prior to guide the feature learning of later
stages for a accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the datasets,
NTU-RGB+D, NTU-RGB+D120 and Northwestern-UCLA, demonstrate that the proposed
FGCN is effective for action recognition. It achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on the three datasets.

Title: Heat and Blur: An Effective and Fast Defense Against Adversarial
  Examples
Authors: Haya Brama and Tal Grinshpoun
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE
Comments: Submitted to IJCAI 2020 conference
\\
  The growing incorporation of artificial neural networks (NNs) into many
fields, and especially into life-critical systems, is restrained by their
vulnerability to adversarial examples (AEs). Some existing defense methods can
increase NNs' robustness, but they often require special architecture or
training procedures and are irrelevant to already trained models. In this
paper, we propose a simple defense that combines feature visualization with
input modification, and can, therefore, be applicable to various pre-trained
networks. By reviewing several interpretability methods, we gain new insights
regarding the influence of AEs on NNs' computation. Based on that, we
hypothesize that information about the "true" object is preserved within the
NN's activity, even when the input is adversarial, and present a feature
visualization version that can extract that information in the form of
relevance heatmaps. We then use these heatmaps as a basis for our defense, in
which the adversarial effects are corrupted by massive blurring. We also
provide a new evaluation metric that can capture the effects of both attacks
and defenses more thoroughly and descriptively, and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the defense and the utility of the suggested evaluation
measurement with VGG19 results on the ImageNet dataset.

Title: Weakly-Supervised 3D Human Pose Learning via Multi-view Images in the
  Wild
Authors: Umar Iqbal and Pavlo Molchanov and Jan Kautz
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: CVPR 2020
\\
  One major challenge for monocular 3D human pose estimation in-the-wild is the
acquisition of training data that contains unconstrained images annotated with
accurate 3D poses. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a
weakly-supervised approach that does not require 3D annotations and learns to
estimate 3D poses from unlabeled multi-view data, which can be acquired easily
in in-the-wild environments. We propose a novel end-to-end learning framework
that enables weakly-supervised training using multi-view consistency. Since
multi-view consistency is prone to degenerated solutions, we adopt a 2.5D pose
representation and propose a novel objective function that can only be
minimized when the predictions of the trained model are consistent and
plausible across all camera views. We evaluate our proposed approach on two
large scale datasets (Human3.6M and MPII-INF-3DHP) where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among semi-/weakly-supervised methods.

\\
  Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved fantastic success in
various scenarios, it's difficult to employ DNNs on many systems with limited
resources due to their high energy consumption. It's well known that spiking
neural networks (SNNs) are attracting more attention due to the capability of
energy-efficient computing. Recently many works focus on converting DNNs into
SNNs with little accuracy degradation in image classification on MNIST,
CIFAR-10/100. However, few studies on shortening latency, and spike-based
modules of more challenging tasks on complex datasets. In this paper, we focus
on the similarity matching method of deep spike features and present a first
spike-based Siamese network for object tracking called SiamSNN. Specifically,
we propose a hybrid spiking similarity matching method with membrane potential
and time step to evaluate the response map between exemplar and candidate
images, with the same function as correlation layer in SiamFC. Then we present
a coding scheme for utilizing temporal information of spike trains, and
implement it in output spiking layers to improve the performance and shorten
the latency. Our experiments show that SiamSNN achieves short latency and low
precision loss of the original SiamFC on the tracking datasets OTB-2013,
OTB-2015 and VOT2016. Moreover, SiamSNN achieves real-time (50 FPS) and
extremely low energy consumption on TrueNorth.

Title: Rectified Meta-Learning from Noisy Labels for Robust Image-based Plant
  Disease Diagnosis
Authors: Ruifeng Shi, Deming Zhai, Xianming Liu, Junjun Jiang, WenGao
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Plant diseases serve as one of main threats to food security and crop
production. It is thus valuable to exploit recent advances of artificial
intelligence to assist plant disease diagnosis. One popular approach is to
transform this problem as a leaf image classification task, which can be then
addressed by the powerful convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the
performance of CNN-based classification approach depends on a large amount of
high-quality manually labeled training data, which are inevitably introduced
noise on labels in practice, leading to model overfitting and performance
degradation. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates rectified meta-learning module into common CNN paradigm to train a
noise-robust deep network without using extra supervision information. The
proposed method enjoys the following merits: i) A rectified meta-learning is
designed to pay more attention to unbiased samples, leading to accelerated
convergence and improved classification accuracy. ii) Our method is free on
assumption of label noise distribution, which works well on various kinds of
noise. iii) Our method serves as a plug-and-play module, which can be embedded
into any deep models optimized by gradient descent based method. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our
algorithm over the state-of-the-arts.

Title: Building Computationally Efficient and Well-Generalizing Person
  Re-Identification Models with Metric Learning
Authors: Vladislav Sovrasov and Dmitry Sidnev
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Submitted to International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR
  2020)
\\
  This work considers the problem of domain shift in person
re-identification.Being trained on one dataset, a re-identification model
usually performs much worse on unseen data. Partially this gap is caused by the
relatively small scale of person re-identification datasets (compared to face
recognition ones, for instance), but it is also related to training objectives.
We propose to use the metric learning objective, namely AM-Softmax loss, and
some additional training practices to build well-generalizing, yet,
computationally efficient models. We use recently proposed Omni-Scale Network
(OSNet) architecture combined with several training tricks and architecture

Title: Unsupervised Learning of Category-Specific Symmetric 3D Keypoints from
  Point Sets

\\
  Automatic discovery of category-specific 3D keypoints from a collection of
objects of some category is a challenging problem. One reason is that not all
objects in a category necessarily have the same semantic parts. The level of
difficulty adds up further when objects are represented by 3D point clouds,
with variations in shape and unknown coordinate frames. We define keypoints to
be category-specific, if they meaningfully represent objects' shape and their
correspondences can be simply established order-wise across all objects. This
paper aims at learning category-specific 3D keypoints, in an unsupervised
manner, using a collection of misaligned 3D point clouds of objects from an
unknown category. In order to do so, we model shapes defined by the keypoints,
within a category, using the symmetric linear basis shapes without assuming the
plane of symmetry to be known. The usage of symmetry prior leads us to learn
stable keypoints suitable for higher misalignments. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work on learning such keypoints directly from 3D
point clouds. Using categories from four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the
quality of our learned keypoints by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
Our experiments also show that the keypoints discovered by our method are
geometrically and semantically consistent.

  Models

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  This paper proposes a method for detecting anomalies in video data. A
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used for reducing the dimensionality of video
frames, generating latent space information that is comparable to
low-dimensional sensory data (e.g., positioning, steering angle), making
feasible the development of a consistent multi-modal architecture for
autonomous vehicles. An Adapted Markov Jump Particle Filter defined by discrete
and continuous inference levels is employed to predict the following frames and
detecting anomalies in new video sequences. Our method is evaluated on
different video scenarios where a semi-autonomous vehicle performs a set of
tasks in a closed environment.

Title: Motion-Excited Sampler: Video Adversarial Attack with Sparked Prior
Authors: Hu Zhang, Linchao Zhu, Yi Zhu and Yi Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Deep neural networks are known to be susceptible to adversarial noise, which
are tiny and imperceptible perturbations. Most of previous work on adversarial
attack mainly focus on image models, while the vulnerability of video models is
less explored. In this paper, we aim to attack video models by utilizing
intrinsic movement pattern and regional relative motion among video frames. We
propose an effective motion-excited sampler to obtain motion-aware noise prior,
which we term as sparked prior. Our sparked prior underlines frame correlations
and utilizes video dynamics via relative motion. By using the sparked prior in
gradient estimation, we can successfully attack a variety of video
classification models with fewer number of queries. Extensive experimental
results on four benchmark datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed
method.

Title: EventSR: From Asynchronous Events to Image Reconstruction, Restoration,
  and Super-Resolution via End-to-End Adversarial Learning
Authors: Lin Wang, Tae-Kyun Kim, Kuk-Jin Yoon
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020
\\
  Event cameras sense intensity changes and have many advantages over
conventional cameras. To take advantage of event cameras, some methods have
been proposed to reconstruct intensity images from event streams. However, the
outputs are still in low resolution (LR), noisy, and unrealistic. The
low-quality outputs stem broader applications of event cameras, where high
spatial resolution (HR) is needed as well as high temporal resolution, dynamic
range, and no motion blur. We consider the problem of reconstructing and
super-resolving intensity images from LR events, when no ground truth (GT) HR
images and down-sampling kernels are available. To tackle the challenges, we
propose a novel end-to-end pipeline that reconstructs LR images from event
streams, enhances the image qualities and upsamples the enhanced images, called
EventSR. For the absence of real GT images, our method is primarily
unsupervised, deploying adversarial learning. To train EventSR, we create an
open dataset including both real-world and simulated scenes. The use of both
datasets boosts up the network performance, and the network architectures and
various loss functions in each phase help improve the image qualities. The
whole pipeline is trained in three phases. While each phase is mainly for one
of the three tasks, the networks in earlier phases are fine-tuned by respective
loss functions in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that EventSR
reconstructs high-quality SR images from events for both simulated and
real-world data.

Title: M$^5$L: Multi-Modal Multi-Margin Metric Learning for RGBT Tracking
Authors: Zhengzheng Tu, Chun Lin, Chenglong Li, Jin Tang and Bin Luo
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Classifying the confusing samples in the course of RGBT tracking is a quite
challenging problem, which hasn't got satisfied solution. Existing methods only
focus on enlarging the boundary between positive and negative samples, however,
the structured information of samples might be harmed, e.g., confusing positive
samples are closer to the anchor than normal positive samples.To handle this
problem, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Margin Metric Learning framework,
named M$^5$L for RGBT tracking in this paper. In particular, we design a
multi-margin structured loss to distinguish the confusing samples which play a
most critical role in tracking performance boosting. To alleviate this problem,
we additionally enlarge the boundaries between confusing positive samples and
normal ones, between confusing negative samples and normal ones with predefined
margins, by exploiting the structured information of all samples in each
modality.Moreover, a cross-modality constraint is employed to reduce the
difference between modalities and push positive samples closer to the anchor
than negative ones from two modalities.In addition, to achieve quality-aware
RGB and thermal feature fusion, we introduce the modality attentions and learn
them using a feature fusion module in our network. Extensive experiments on
large-scale datasets testify that our framework clearly improves the tracking
performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art RGBT trackers.

Title: Weakly-Supervised Salient Object Detection via Scribble Annotations
Authors: Jing Zhang, Xin Yu, Aixuan Li, Peipei Song, Bowen Liu and Yuchao Dai
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by IEEE/CVF CVPR 2020
\\
  Compared with laborious pixel-wise dense labeling, it is much easier to label
data by scribbles, which only costs 1$\sim$2 seconds to label one image.
However, using scribble labels to learn salient object detection has not been
explored. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised salient object
detection model to learn saliency from such annotations. In doing so, we first
relabel an existing large-scale salient object detection dataset with
scribbles, namely S-DUTS dataset. Since object structure and detail information
is not identified by scribbles, directly training with scribble labels will
lead to saliency maps of poor boundary localization. To mitigate this problem,
we propose an auxiliary edge detection task to localize object edges
explicitly, and a gated structure-aware loss to place constraints on the scope
of structure to be recovered. Moreover, we design a scribble boosting scheme to
iteratively consolidate our scribble annotations, which are then employed as
supervision to learn high-quality saliency maps. As existing saliency
evaluation metrics neglect to measure structure alignment of the predictions,
the saliency map ranking metric may not comply with human perception. We
present a new metric, termed saliency structure measure, to measure the
structure alignment of the predicted saliency maps, which is more consistent
with human perception. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing
weakly-supervised/unsupervised methods, but also is on par with several
fully-supervised state-of-the-art models. Our code and data is publicly
available at https://github.com/JingZhang617/Scribble_Saliency.

Comments: 9 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Arbitrary image style transfer is a challenging task which aims to stylize a
content image conditioned on an arbitrary style image. In this task the
content-style feature transformation is a critical component for a proper
fusion of features. Existing feature transformation algorithms often suffer
from unstable learning, loss of content and style details, and non-natural
stroke patterns. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free
algorithm, Style Projection, for fast yet effective content-style
transformation. To leverage the proposed Style Projection~component, this paper
further presents a real-time feed-forward model for arbitrary style transfer,
including a regularization for matching the content semantics between inputs
and outputs. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed method in terms of qualitative analysis,
quantitative evaluation, and user study.

Title: $F$, $B$, Alpha Matting
Authors: Marco Forte and Fran\c{c}ois Piti\'e
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Submitted to ECCV2020
\\
  Cutting out an object and estimating its opacity mask, known as image
matting, is a key task in many image editing applications. Deep learning
approaches have made significant progress by adapting the encoder-decoder
architecture of segmentation networks. However, most of the existing networks
only predict the alpha matte and post-processing methods must then be used to
recover the original foreground and background colours in the transparent
regions. Recently, two methods have shown improved results by also estimating
the foreground colours, but at a significant computational and memory cost.
  In this paper, we propose a low-cost modification to alpha matting networks
to also predict the foreground and background colours. We study variations of
the training regime and explore a wide range of existing and novel loss
functions for the joint prediction.
  Our method achieves the state of the art performance on the Adobe
Composition-1k dataset for alpha matte and composite colour quality. It is also
the current best performing method on the alphamatting.com online evaluation.

Title: Multimodal Shape Completion via Conditional Generative Adversarial
  Networks
Authors: Rundi Wu, Xuelin Chen, Yixin Zhuang, Baoquan Chen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Several deep learning methods have been proposed for completing partial data
from shape acquisition setups, i.e., filling the regions that were missing in
the shape. These methods, however, only complete the partial shape with a
single output, ignoring the ambiguity when reasoning the missing geometry.
Hence, we pose a multi-modal shape completion problem, in which we seek to
complete the partial shape with multiple outputs by learning a one-to-many
mapping. We develop the first multimodal shape completion method that completes
the partial shape via conditional generative modeling, without requiring paired
training data. Our approach distills the ambiguity by conditioning the
completion on a learned multimodal distribution of possible results. We
extensively evaluate the approach on several datasets that contain varying
forms of shape incompleteness, and compare among several baseline methods and
variants of our methods qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating the
merit of our method in completing partial shapes with both diversity and
quality.

Comments: Accepted to CVPR2020 (Oral)
\\
  Face recognition systems are usually faced with unseen domains in real-world
applications and show unsatisfactory performance due to their poor
generalization. For example, a well-trained model on webface data cannot deal
with the ID vs. Spot task in surveillance scenario. In this paper, we aim to
learn a generalized model that can directly handle new unseen domains without
any model updating. To this end, we propose a novel face recognition method via
meta-learning named Meta Face Recognition (MFR). MFR synthesizes the
source/target domain shift with a meta-optimization objective, which requires
the model to learn effective representations not only on synthesized source
domains but also on synthesized target domains. Specifically, we build
domain-shift batches through a domain-level sampling strategy and get
back-propagated gradients/meta-gradients on synthesized source/target domains
by optimizing multi-domain distributions. The gradients and meta-gradients are
further combined to update the model to improve generalization. Besides, we
propose two benchmarks for generalized face recognition evaluation. Experiments
on our benchmarks validate the generalization of our method compared to several
baselines and other state-of-the-arts. The proposed benchmarks will be
available at https://github.com/cleardusk/MFR.

Title: A Novel Online Action Detection Framework from Untrimmed Video Streams
Authors: Da-Hye Yoon, Nam-Gyu Cho, Seong-Whan Lee
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Online temporal action localization from an untrimmed video stream is a
challenging problem in computer vision. It is challenging because of i) in an
untrimmed video stream, more than one action instance may appear, including
background scenes, and ii) in online settings, only past and current
information is available. Therefore, temporal priors, such as the average
action duration of training data, which have been exploited by previous action
detection methods, are not suitable for this task because of the high
intra-class variation in human actions. We propose a novel online action
detection framework that considers actions as a set of temporally ordered
subclasses and leverages a future frame generation network to cope with the
limited information issue associated with the problem outlined above.
Additionally, we augment our data by varying the lengths of videos to allow the
proposed method to learn about the high intra-class variation in human actions.
We evaluate our method using two benchmark datasets, THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet,
for an online temporal action localization scenario and demonstrate that the
performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods that have been proposed
for offline settings.

Title: Geometric Approaches to Increase the Expressivity of Deep Neural
  Networks for MR Reconstruction

Comments: Accepted for IEEE JSTSP Special Issue on Domain Enriched Learning for
  Medical Imaging
\\
  Recently, deep learning approaches have been extensively investigated to
reconstruct images from accelerated magnetic resonance image (MRI) acquisition.
Although these approaches provide significant performance gain compared to
compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI), it is not clear how to choose a suitable
network architecture to balance the trade-off between network complexity and
performance. Recently, it was shown that an encoder-decoder convolutional
neural network (CNN) can be interpreted as a piecewise linear basis-like
representation, whose specific representation is determined by the ReLU
activation patterns for a given input image. Thus, the expressivity or the
representation power is determined by the number of piecewise linear regions.
As an extension of this geometric understanding, this paper proposes a
systematic geometric approach using bootstrapping and subnetwork aggregation
using an attention module to increase the expressivity of the underlying neural
network. Our method can be implemented in both k-space domain and image domain
that can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that the
proposed schemes significantly improve reconstruction performance with
negligible complexity increases.

Title: Multi-modal Dense Video Captioning
Authors: Vladimir Iashin and Esa Rahtu
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS eess.IV
Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Dense video captioning is a task of localizing interesting events from an
untrimmed video and producing textual description (captions) for each localized
event. Most of the previous works in dense video captioning are solely based on
visual information and completely ignore the audio track. However, audio, and
speech, in particular, are vital cues for a human observer in understanding an
environment. In this paper, we present a new dense video captioning approach
that is able to utilize any number of modalities for event description.
Specifically, we show how audio and speech modalities may improve a dense video
captioning model. We apply automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to obtain
a temporally aligned textual description of the speech (similar to subtitles)
and treat it as a separate input alongside video frames and the corresponding
audio track. We formulate the captioning task as a machine translation problem
and utilize recently proposed Transformer architecture to convert multi-modal
input data into textual descriptions. We demonstrate the performance of our
model on ActivityNet Captions dataset. The ablation studies indicate a
considerable contribution from audio and speech components suggesting that
these modalities contain substantial complementary information to video frames.
Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the ActivityNet Caption results
by leveraging the category tags obtained from original YouTube videos. The
program code of our method and evaluations will be made publicly available.

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  It has long been noticed that high dimension data exhibits strange patterns.
This has been variously interpreted as either a "blessing" or a "curse",
causing uncomfortable inconsistencies in the literature. We propose that these
patterns arise from an intrinsically hierarchical generative process. Modeling
the process creates a web of constraints that reconcile many different theories
and results. The model also implies high dimensional data posses an innate
separability that can be exploited for machine learning. We demonstrate how
this permits the open-set learning problem to be defined mathematically,
leading to qualitative and quantitative improvements in performance.

We observe that trained ConvNets show a significant statistical bias towards

Title: Burst Denoising of Dark Images
Authors: Ahmet Serdar Karadeniz, Erkut Erdem, Aykut Erdem
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Capturing images under extremely low-light conditions poses significant
challenges for the standard camera pipeline. Images become too dark and too
noisy, which makes traditional image enhancement techniques almost impossible
to apply. Very recently, researchers have shown promising results using
learning based approaches. Motivated by these ideas, in this paper, we propose
a deep learning framework for obtaining clean and colorful RGB images from
extremely dark raw images. The backbone of our framework is a novel
coarse-to-fine network architecture that generates high-quality outputs in a
progressive manner. The coarse network predicts a low-resolution, denoised raw
image, which is then fed to the fine network to recover fine-scale details and
realistic textures. To further reduce noise and improve color accuracy, we
extend this network to a permutation invariant structure so that it takes a
burst of low-light images as input and merges information from multiple images
at the feature-level. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
leads to perceptually more pleasing results than state-of-the-art methods by
producing much sharper and higher quality images.

Title: Latent Embedding Feedback and Discriminative Features for Zero-Shot
  Classification
Authors: Sanath Narayan, Akshita Gupta, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Cees G. M. Snoek,
  Ling Shao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Zero-shot learning strives to classify unseen categories for which no data is
available during training. In the generalized variant, the test samples can
further belong to seen or unseen categories. The state-of-the-art relies on
Generative Adversarial Networks that synthesize unseen class features by
leveraging class-specific semantic embeddings. During training, they generate
semantically consistent features, but discard this constraint during feature
synthesis and classification. We propose to enforce semantic consistency at all
stages of (generalized) zero-shot learning: training, feature synthesis and
classification. We further introduce a feedback loop, from a semantic embedding
decoder, that iteratively refines the generated features during both the
training and feature synthesis stages. The synthesized features together with
their corresponding latent embeddings from the decoder are transformed into
discriminative features and utilized during classification to reduce
ambiguities among categories. Experiments on (generalized) zero-shot learning
for object and action classification reveal the benefit of semantic consistency
and iterative feedback for GAN-based networks, outperforming existing methods
on six zero-shot learning benchmarks.

\\
  3D multi-object tracking (MOT) and trajectory forecasting are two critical
components in modern 3D perception systems that require accurate modeling of
multi-agent interaction. We hypothesize that it is beneficial to unify both
tasks under one framework in order to learn a shared feature representation of
agent interaction. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose a unified solution
for 3D MOT and trajectory forecasting which also incorporates two additional
novel computational units. First, we propose a feature interaction technique by
introducing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the way in which multiple
agents interact with one another. The GNN is able to model complex hierarchical
interactions, improve the discriminative feature learning for MOT association,
and provide socially-aware context for trajectory forecasting. Second, we use a
diversity sampling function to improve the quality and diversity of our
forecasted trajectories. The learned sampling function is trained to
efficiently extract a variety of outcomes from a generative trajectory
distribution and helps avoid the problem of generating many duplicate
trajectory samples. We evaluate on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, showing
that our unified method with feature interaction and diversity sampling
achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both 3D MOT and trajectory
forecasting. Our code will be made available at

Title: Learning to Structure an Image with Few Colors
Authors: Yunzhong Hou, Liang Zheng, Stephen Gould
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Color and structure are the two pillars that construct an image. Usually, the
structure is well expressed through a rich spectrum of colors, allowing objects
in an image to be recognized by neural networks. However, under extreme
limitations of color space, the structure tends to vanish, and thus a neural
network might fail to understand the image. Interested in exploring this
interplay between color and structure, we study the scientific problem of
identifying and preserving the most informative image structures while
constraining the color space to just a few bits, such that the resulting image
can be recognized with possibly high accuracy. To this end, we propose a color
quantization network, ColorCNN, which learns to structure the images from the
classification loss in an end-to-end manner. Given a color space size, ColorCNN
quantizes colors in the original image by generating a color index map and an
RGB color palette. Then, this color-quantized image is fed to a pre-trained
task network to evaluate its performance. In our experiment, with only a 1-bit
color space (i.e., two colors), the proposed network achieves 82.1% top-1
accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset, outperforming traditional color quantization
methods by a large margin. For applications, when encoded with PNG, the
proposed color quantization shows superiority over other image compression
methods in the extremely low bit-rate regime. The code is available at:

Title: Blur, Noise, and Compression Robust Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Takuhiro Kaneko, Tatsuya Harada
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML
\\
  Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs), which learn data
distributions through adversarial training, have gained special attention owing
to their high image reproduction ability. However, one limitation of standard
GANs is that they recreate training images faithfully despite image degradation
characteristics such as blur, noise, and compression. To remedy this, we
address the problem of blur, noise, and compression robust image generation.
Our objective is to learn a non-degraded image generator directly from degraded
images without prior knowledge of image degradation. The recently proposed
noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) already provides a solution to the problem of noise
degradation. Therefore, we first focus on blur and compression degradations. We
propose blur robust GAN (BR-GAN) and compression robust GAN (CR-GAN), which
learn a kernel generator and quality factor generator, respectively, with
non-degraded image generators. Owing to the irreversible blur and compression
characteristics, adjusting their strengths is non-trivial. Therefore, we
incorporate switching architectures that can adapt the strengths in a
data-driven manner. Based on BR-GAN, NR-GAN, and CR-GAN, we further propose
blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN), which unifies these three
models into a single model with additionally introduced adaptive consistency
losses that suppress the uncertainty caused by the combination. We provide
benchmark scores through large-scale comparative studies on CIFAR-10 and a
generality analysis on FFHQ dataset.

Title: Axial-DeepLab: Stand-Alone Axial-Attention for Panoptic Segmentation
Authors: Huiyu Wang, Yukun Zhu, Bradley Green, Hartwig Adam, Alan Yuille,
  Liang-Chieh Chen
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Convolution exploits locality for efficiency at a cost of missing long range
context. Self-attention has been adopted to augment CNNs with non-local
interactions. Recent works prove it possible to stack self-attention layers to
obtain a fully attentional network by restricting the attention to a local
region. In this paper, we attempt to remove this constraint by factorizing 2D
self-attention into two 1D self-attentions. This reduces computation complexity
and allows performing attention within a larger or even global region. In
companion, we also propose a position-sensitive self-attention design.
Combining both yields our position-sensitive axial-attention layer, a novel
building block that one could stack to form axial-attention models for image
classification and dense prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model on four large-scale datasets. In particular, our model outperforms all
existing stand-alone self-attention models on ImageNet. Our Axial-DeepLab
improves 2.8% PQ over bottom-up state-of-the-art on COCO test-dev. This
previous state-of-the-art is attained by our small variant that is 3.8x
parameter-efficient and 27x computation-efficient. Axial-DeepLab also achieves
state-of-the-art results on Mapillary Vistas and Cityscapes.

\\
  Nowadays fake news are heavily discussed in public and political debates.
Even though the phenomenon of intended false information is rather old,
misinformation reaches a new level with the rise of the internet and
participatory platforms. Due to Facebook and Co., purposeful false information
- often called fake news - can be easily spread by everyone. Because of a high
data volatility and variety in content types (text, images,...) debunking of
fake news is a complex challenge. This is especially true for automated
approaches, which are prone to fail validating the veracity of the information.
This work focuses on an a gamified approach to strengthen the resilience of
consumers towards fake news. The game FakeYou motivates its players to
critically analyze headlines regarding their trustworthiness. Further, the game
follows a "learning by doing strategy": by generating own fake headlines, users
should experience the concepts of convincing fake headline formulations. We
introduce the game itself, as well as the underlying technical infrastructure.
A first evaluation study shows, that users tend to use specific stylistic
devices to generate fake news. Further, the results indicate, that creating
good fakes and identifying correct headlines are challenging and hard to learn.

  Qatar expects more than a million visitors during the 2022 World Cup, which
will pose significant challenges. The high number of people will likely cause a
rise in road traffic congestion, vehicle crashes, injuries and deaths. To
tackle this problem, Naturalistic Driver Behavior can be utilised which will
collect and analyze data to estimate the current Qatar traffic system,
including traffic data infrastructure, safety planning, and engineering
practices and standards. In this paper, an IoT based solution to facilitate
such a study in Qatar is proposed. Different data points from a driver are
collected and recorded in an unobtrusive manner, such as trip data, GPS
coordinates, compass heading, minimum, average, and maximum speed and his
driving behavior, including driver's drowsiness level. Analysis of these data
points will help in prediction of crashes and road infrastructure improvements
to reduce such events. It will also be used for drivers risk assessment and to
detect extreme road user behaviors. A framework that will help to visualize and
manage this data is also proposed, along with a Deep Learning-based application
that detects drowsy driving behavior that netted an 82 percent accuracy.

Title: Risk Management Practices in Information Security: Exploring the Status

Authors: Michael Brunner, Clemens Sauerwein, Michael Felderer and Ruth Breu

  Information security management aims at ensuring proper protection of
information values and information processing systems (i.e. assets).
Information security risk management techniques are incorporated to deal with
threats and vulnerabilities that impose risks to information security
properties of these assets. This paper investigates the current state of risk
management practices being used in information security management in the DACH
region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). We used an anonymous online survey
targeting strategic and operative information security and risk managers and
collected data from 26 organizations. We analyzed general practices,
documentation artifacts, patterns of stakeholder collaboration as well as tool
types and data sources used by enterprises to conduct information security
management activities. Our findings show that the state of practice of
information security risk management is in need of improvement. Current
industrial practice heavily relies on manual data collection and complex
potentially subjective decision processes with multiple stakeholders involved.
Dedicated risk management tools and methods are used selectively and neglected
in favor of general-purpose documentation tools and direct communication
between stakeholders. In light of our results we propose guidelines for the
development of risk management practices that are better aligned with the
current operational situation in information security management.

  Healthcare is one of the most promising areas for machine learning models to
make a positive impact. However, successful adoption of AI-based systems in
healthcare depends on engaging and educating stakeholders from diverse
backgrounds about the development process of AI models. We present a broadly
accessible overview of the development life cycle of clinical AI models that is
general enough to be adapted to most machine learning projects, and then give
an in-depth case study of the development process of a deep learning based
system to detect aortic aneurysms in Computed Tomography (CT) exams. We hope
other healthcare institutions and clinical practitioners find the insights we
share about the development process useful in informing their own model
development efforts and to increase the likelihood of successful deployment and
integration of AI in healthcare.

\\
  Machine learning models often make predictions that bias against certain
subgroups of input data. When undetected, machine learning biases can
constitute significant financial and ethical implications. Semi-automated tools
that involve humans in the loop could facilitate bias detection. Yet, little is
known about the considerations involved in their design. In this paper, we
report on an interview study with 11 machine learning practitioners for
investigating the needs surrounding semi-automated bias detection tools. Based
on the findings, we highlight four considerations in designing to guide system
designers who aim to create future tools for bias detection.

  Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Information and Communication,

\\
  This paper analyzes how candidate choice prediction improves by different
psychological predictors. To investigate this question, it collected an
original survey dataset featuring the popular TV series "Game of Thrones". The
respondents answered which character they anticipated to win in the final
episode of the series, and explained their choice of the final candidate in
free text from which sentiments were extracted. These sentiments were compared
to feature sets derived from candidate likeability and candidate personality
ratings. In our benchmarking of 10-fold cross-validation in 100 repetitions,
all feature sets except the likeability ratings yielded a 10-11% improvement in
accuracy on the holdout set over the base model. Treating the class imbalance
with synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) increased holdout set performance
by 20-34% but surprisingly not testing set performance. Taken together, our
study provides a quantified estimation of the additional predictive value of
psychological predictors. Likeability ratings were clearly outperformed by the
feature sets based on personality, emotional valence, and basic emotions.

Title: Supporting Early and Scalable Discovery of Disinformation Websites
Authors: Austin Hounsel, Jordan Holland, Ben Kaiser, Kevin Borgolte, Nick

Categories: cs.CY
\\
  Online disinformation is a serious and growing sociotechnical problem that
threatens the integrity of public discourse, democratic governance, and
commerce. The internet has made it easier than ever to spread false
information, and academic research is just beginning to comprehend the
consequences. In response to this growing problem, online services have
established processes to counter disinformation. These processes predominantly
rely on costly and painstaking manual analysis, however, often responding to
disinformation long after it has spread. We design, develop, and evaluate a new
approach for proactively discovering disinformation websites. Our approach is
inspired by the information security literature on identifying malware
distribution, phishing, and scam websites using distinctive non-perceptual
infrastructure characteristics. We show that automated identification with
similar features can effectively support human judgments for early and scalable
discovery of disinformation websites. Our system significantly exceeds the
state of the art in detecting disinformation websites, and we present the first
reported real-time evaluation of automation-supported disinformation discovery.
We also demonstrate, as a proof of concept, how our approach could be easily
operationalized in ordinary consumer web browsers.

Title: Augmented reality as a tool for open science platform by research

Comments: 10 pages, Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Augmented
  Reality in Education
\\
  The provision of open science is defined as a general policy aimed at
overcoming the barriers that hinder the implementation of the European Research
Area (ERA). An open science foundation seeks to capture all the elements needed
for the functioning of ERA: research data, scientific instruments, ICT services
(connections, calculations, platforms, and specific studies such as portals).
Managing shared resources for the community of scholars maximizes the benefits
to society. In the field of digital infrastructure, this has already
demonstrated great benefits. It is expected that applying this principle to an
open science process will improve management by funding organizations in
collaboration with stakeholders through mechanisms such as public consultation.
This will increase the perception of joint ownership of the infrastructure. It
will also create clear and non-discriminatory access rules, along with a sense
of joint ownership that stimulates a higher level of participation,
collaboration and social reciprocity. The article deals with the concept of
open science. The concept of the European cloud of open science and its
structure are presented. According to the study, it has been shown that the
structure of the cloud of open science includes an augmented reality as an
open-science platform. An example of the practical application of this tool is
the general description of MaxWhere, developed by Hungarian scientists, and is
a platform of aggregates of individual 3D spaces.

Title: Data-Driven Metadata Tagging for Building Automation Systems: A Unified

\\
  This article presents a Unified Architecture for automated point tagging of
Building Automation System data, based on a combination of data-driven
approaches. Advanced energy analytics applications-including fault detection
and diagnostics and supervisory control-have emerged as a significant
opportunity for improving the performance of our built environment. Effective
application of these analytics depends on harnessing structured data from the
various building control and monitoring systems, but typical Building
Automation System implementations do not employ any standardized metadata
schema. While standards such as Project Haystack and Brick Schema have been
developed to address this issue, the process of structuring the data, i.e.,
tagging the points to apply a standard metadata schema, has, to date, been a
manual process. This process is typically costly, labor-intensive, and
error-prone. In this work we address this gap by proposing a UA that automates
the process of point tagging by leveraging the data accessible through
connection to the BAS, including time series data and the raw point names. The
UA intertwines supervised classification and unsupervised clustering techniques
from machine learning and leverages both their deterministic and probabilistic
outputs to inform the point tagging process. Furthermore, we extend the UA to
embed additional input and output data-processing modules that are designed to
address the challenges associated with the real-time deployment of this
automation solution. We test the UA on two datasets for real-life buildings: 1.
commercial retail buildings and 2. office buildings from the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory campus. The proposed methodology correctly applied 85-90
percent and 70-75 percent of the tags in each of these test scenarios,
respectively.

  Nighttime lights satellite imagery has been used for decades as a uniform,
global source of data for studying a wide range of socioeconomic factors.
Recently, another more terrestrial source is producing data with similarly
uniform global coverage: anonymous and aggregated smart phone location. This
data, which measures the movement patterns of people and populations rather
than the light they produce, could prove just as valuable in decades to come.
In fact, since human mobility is far more directly related to the socioeconomic
variables being predicted, it has an even greater potential. Additionally,
since cell phone locations can be aggregated in real time while preserving
individual user privacy, it will be possible to conduct studies that would
previously have been impossible because they require data from the present. Of
course, it will take quite some time to establish the new techniques necessary
to apply human mobility data to problems traditionally studied with satellite
imagery and to conceptualize and develop new real time applications. In this
study we demonstrate that it is possible to accelerate this process by
inferring artificial nighttime satellite imagery from human mobility data,
while maintaining a strong differential privacy guarantee. We also show that
these artificial maps can be used to infer socioeconomic variables, often with
greater accuracy than using actual satellite imagery. Along the way, we find
that the relationship between mobility and light emissions is both nonlinear
and varies considerably around the globe. Finally, we show that models based on
human mobility can significantly improve our understanding of society at a
global scale.

  The recent enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) is due principally to
advances in deep learning. Deep learning methods are remarkably accurate, but
also opaque, which limits their potential use in safety-critical applications.
To achieve trust and accountability, designers and operators of machine
learning algorithms must be able to explain the inner workings, the results and
the causes of failures of algorithms to users, regulators, and citizens. The
originality of this paper is to combine technical, legal and economic aspects
of explainability to develop a framework for defining the "right" level of
explain-ability in a given context. We propose three logical steps: First,
define the main contextual factors, such as who the audience of the explanation
is, the operational context, the level of harm that the system could cause, and
the legal/regulatory framework. This step will help characterize the
operational and legal needs for explanation, and the corresponding social
benefits. Second, examine the technical tools available, including post hoc
approaches (input perturbation, saliency maps...) and hybrid AI approaches.
Third, as function of the first two steps, choose the right levels of global
and local explanation outputs, taking into the account the costs involved. We
identify seven kinds of costs and emphasize that explanations are socially
useful only when total social benefits exceed costs.

Categories: cs.DB
Comments: 16 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables
\\
  With the advent of the Internet and Internet-connected devices, modern
business applications can experience rapid increases as well as variability in
transactional workloads. Database replication has been employed to scale
performance and improve availability of relational databases but past
approaches have suffered from various issues including limited scalability,
performance versus consistency tradeoffs, and requirements for database or
application modifications. This paper presents Hihooi, a replication-based
middleware system that is able to achieve workload scalability, strong
consistency guarantees, and elasticity for existing transactional databases at
a low cost. A novel replication algorithm enables Hihooi to propagate database
modifications asynchronously to all replicas at high speeds, while ensuring
that all replicas are consistent. At the same time, a fine-grained routing
algorithm is used to load balance incoming transactions to available replicas
in a consistent way. Our thorough experimental evaluation with several
well-established benchmarks shows how Hihooi is able to achieve almost linear
workload scalability for transactional databases.

Comments: Technical Report, 16 pages. Shorter version to be published in SIGMOD

\\
  Querying a relational database is difficult because it requires users to know
both the SQL language and be familiar with the schema. On the other hand, many
users possess enough domain familiarity or expertise to describe their desired
queries by alternative means. For such users, two major alternatives to writing
SQL are natural language interfaces (NLIs) and programming-by-example (PBE).
Both of these alternatives face certain pitfalls: natural language queries
(NLQs) are often ambiguous, even for human interpreters, while current PBE
approaches require either low-complexity queries, user schema knowledge, exact
example tuples from the user, or a closed-world assumption to be tractable.
Consequently, we propose dual-specification query synthesis, which consumes
both a NLQ and an optional PBE-like table sketch query that enables users to
express varied levels of domain-specific knowledge. We introduce the novel
dual-specification Duoquest system, which leverages guided partial query
enumeration to efficiently explore the space of possible queries. We present
results from user studies in which Duoquest demonstrates a 62.5% absolute
increase in query construction accuracy over a state-of-the-art NLI and
comparable accuracy to a PBE system on a more limited workload supported by the
PBE system. In a simulation study on the prominent Spider benchmark, Duoquest
demonstrates a >2x increase in top-1 accuracy over both NLI and PBE.

\\
  The ROOT TTree data format encodes hundreds of petabytes of High Energy and
Nuclear Physics events. Its columnar layout drives rapid analyses, as only
those parts ("branches") that are really used in a given analysis need to be
read from storage. Its unique feature is the seamless C++ integration, which
allows users to directly store their event classes without explicitly defining
data schemas. In this contribution, we present the status and plans of the
future ROOT 7 event I/O. Along with the ROOT 7 interface modernization, we aim
for robust, where possible compile-time safe C++ interfaces to read and write
event data. On the performance side, we show first benchmarks using ROOT's new
experimental I/O subsystem that combines the best of TTrees with recent
advances in columnar data formats. A core ingredient is a strong separation of
the high-level logical data layout (C++ classes) from the low-level physical
data layout (storage backed nested vectors of simple types). We show how the
new, optimized physical data layout speeds up serialization and deserialization
and facilitates parallel, vectorized and bulk operations. This lets ROOT I/O
run optimally on the upcoming ultra-fast NVRAM storage devices, as well as
file-less storage systems such as object stores.

answers to queries. However, the evaluation of ontology-mediated queries (OMQs)
over relational databases is computationally hard. This raises the question
when OMQ evaluation is efficient, in the sense of being tractable in combined
complexity or fixed-parameter tractable. We study this question for a range of
ontology-mediated query languages based on several important and widely-used
DLs, using unions of conjunctive queries as the actual queries. For the DL ELHI
extended with the bottom concept, we provide a characterization of the classes
of OMQs that are fixed-parameter tractable. For its fragment EL extended with
domain and range restrictions and the bottom concept (which restricts the use
of inverse roles), we provide a characterization of the classes of OMQs that
are tractable in combined complexity. Both results are in terms of equivalence
to OMQs of bounded tree width and rest on a reasonable assumption from
parameterized complexity theory. They are similar in spirit to Grohe's seminal
characterization of the tractable classes of conjunctive queries over
relational databases. We further study the complexity of the meta problem of
deciding whether a given OMQ is equivalent to an OMQ of bounded tree width,
providing several completeness results that range from NP to 2ExpTime,
depending on the DL used. We also consider the DL-Lite family of DLs, including
members that admit functional roles.

Title: Adapting Persistent Data Structures for Concurrency and Speculation
Authors: Thomas Dickerson
Categories: cs.DC cs.DS cs.PL
Comments: PhD Thesis, Brown University (2019)
\\
  This work unifies insights from the systems and functional programming
communities, in order to enable compositional reasoning about software which is
nonetheless efficiently realizable in hardware. It exploits a correspondence
between design goals for efficient concurrent data structures and efficient
immutable persistent data structures, to produce novel implementations of
mutable concurrent trees with low contention and an efficient snapshot
operation to support speculative execution models. It also exploits
commutativity to characterize a design space for integrating traditional
high-performance concurrent data structures into Software Transactional Memory
(STM) runtimes, and extends this technique to yield a novel algorithm for
concurrent execution of so-called ``smart contracts'' (specialized programs
which manipulate the state of blockchain ledgers).

Title: Beyond Alice and Bob: Improved Inapproximability for Maximum Independent
  Set in CONGEST
Authors: Yuval Efron, Ofer Grossman, and Seri Khoury
Categories: cs.DC cs.DS
\\
  By far the most fruitful technique for showing lower bounds for the CONGEST
model is reductions to two-party communication complexity. This technique has
yielded nearly tight results for various fundamental problems such as distance
computations, minimum spanning tree, minimum vertex cover, and more.
  In this work, we take this technique a step further, and we introduce a
framework of reductions to $t$-party communication complexity, for every $t\geq
2$. Our framework enables us to show improved hardness results for maximum
independent set. Recently, Bachrach et al.[PODC 2019] used the two-party
framework to show hardness of approximation for maximum independent set. They
show that finding a $(5/6+\epsilon)$-approximation requires $\Omega(n/\log^6
n)$ rounds, and finding a $(7/8+\epsilon)$-approximation requires
$\Omega(n^2/\log^7 n)$ rounds, in the CONGEST model where $n$ in the number of
nodes in the network.
  We improve the results of Bachrach et al. by using reductions to multi-party
communication complexity. Our results:
  (1) Any algorithm that finds a $(1/2+\epsilon)$-approximation for maximum
independent set in the CONGEST model requires $\Omega(n/\log^3 n)$ rounds.
  (2) Any algorithm that finds a $(3/4+\epsilon)$-approximation for maximum
independent set in the CONGEST model requires $\Omega(n^2/\log^3 n)$ rounds.

Title: The Power of Global Knowledge on Self-stabilizing Population Protocols
Authors: Yuichi Sudo, Masahiro Shibata, Junya Nakamura, Yonghwan Kim,

Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 17 pages
\\
  In the population protocol model, many problems cannot be solved in a
self-stabilizing way. However, global knowledge, such as the number of nodes in
a network, sometimes allows us to design a self-stabilizing protocol for such
problems. In this paper, we investigate the effect of global knowledge on the
possibility of self-stabilizing population protocols in arbitrary graphs.
Specifically, we clarify the solvability of the leader election problem, the
ranking problem, the degree recognition problem, and the neighbor recognition
problem by self-stabilizing population protocols with knowledge of the number
of nodes and/or the number of edges in a network.

Title: PigPaxos: Devouring the communication bottlenecks in distributed
  consensus
Authors: Aleksey Charapko, Ailidani Ailijiang, Murat Demirbas
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Paxos family of protocols are employed by many cloud computing services and
distributed databases due to their excellent fault-tolerance properties.
Unfortunately, current Paxos deployments do not scale for more than a dozen
nodes due to the communication bottleneck at the leader. PigPaxos addresses
this problem by decoupling the communication from the decision-making at the
leader. To this end, PigPaxos revises the communication flow in Paxos to
replace direct communication between the leader and followers with a
relay/aggregate based message flow. Although aggregation-based approaches have
been employed in the context of weak-consistency replication protocols,
PigPaxos shows how they can be effectively integrated into the strong
consistency distributed consensus protocols.
  We implement and evaluate PigPaxos, in comparison to Paxos and EPaxos
protocols under various workloads over clusters of size 5 to 25 nodes. We show
that PigPaxos can provide more than 3 folds improved throughput over Paxos and
EPaxos with little latency deterioration. Our experiments also show that the
aggregation has negligible overhead for the latency of PigPaxos as compared to
the latency of Paxos. We conjecture that PigPaxos would be useful for
implementing geo-replicated distributed databases with tens of replicas
distributed over many regions around the globe.

Title: Store-Collect in the Presence of Continuous Churn with Application to
  Snapshots and Lattice Agreement
Authors: Hagit Attiya, Sweta Kumari, Archit Somani, and Jennifer L. Welch
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 23 pages
\\
  We present an algorithm for implementing a store-collect object in an
asynchronous crash-prone message-passing dynamic system, where nodes
continually enter and leave. The algorithm is very simple and efficient,
requiring just one round trip for a store operation and two for a collect. We
then show the versatility of the store-collect object for implementing
churn-tolerant versions of useful data structures, while shielding the user
from the complications of the underlying churn. The store-collect object is not
linearizable and can easily be used to implement several non-linearizable
objects. Yet without much additional effort, it can also be used to implement
atomic snapshot and generalized lattice agreement objects, which are
linearizable. Thus the store-collect sits in a sweet spot combining algorithmic
flexibility and efficiency.

Title: A Scaling Algorithm for Weighted $f$-Factors in General Graphs
Authors: Ran Duan, Haoqing He, Tianyi Zhang
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 35 pages
\\
  We study the maximum weight perfect $f$-factor problem on any general simple
graph $G=(V,E,w)$ with positive integral edge weights $w$, and $n=|V|$,
$m=|E|$. When we have a function $f:V\rightarrow \mathbb{N}_+$ on vertices, a
perfect $f$-factor is a generalized matching so that every vertex $u$ is
matched to $f(u)$ different edges. The previous best algorithms on this problem
have running time $O(m f(V))$ [Gabow 2018] or $\tilde{O}(W(f(V))^{2.373}))$
[Gabow and Sankowski 2013], where $W$ is the maximum edge weight, and
$f(V)=\sum_{u\in V}f(u)$. In this paper, we present a scaling algorithm for
this problem with running time $\tilde{O}(mn^{2/3}\log W)$. Previously this
bound is only known for bipartite graphs [Gabow and Tarjan 1989]. The running
time of our algorithm is independent of $f(V)$, and consequently it first
breaks the $\Omega(mn)$ barrier for large $f(V)$ even for the unweighted
$f$-factor problem in general graphs.

Title: NP-completeness Results for Graph Burning on Geometric Graphs
Authors: Arya Tanmay Gupta, Swapnil Lokhande, Kaushik Mondal
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 17 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Graph burning runs on discrete time steps. The aim of the graph burning
problem is to burn all the vertices in a given graph in the least amount of
time steps. The least number of required time steps is known to be the burning
number of the graph. The spread of social influence, an alarm, or a social
contagion can be modeled using graph burning. The less the burning number, the
quick the spread.
  Computationally, graph burning is hard. It has already been proved that
burning of path forests, spider graphs, and trees with maximum degree three are
NP-Complete. In this work we study graph burning on geometric graphs and show
NP-completeness results on several sub classes. More precisely, we show burning
problem to be NP-complete on interval graph, permutation graph and disk graph.

Title: A Spectral Approach to Network Design
Authors: Lap Chi Lau, Hong Zhou
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: Submitted version to STOC 2020; a new version will be posted the next
  day
\\
  We present a spectral approach to design approximation algorithms for network
design problems. We observe that the underlying mathematical questions are the
spectral rounding problems, which were studied in spectral sparsification and
in discrepancy theory. We extend these results to incorporate additional linear
constraints, and show that they can be used to significantly extend the scope
of network design problems that can be solved. Our algorithm for spectral
rounding is an iterative randomized rounding algorithm based on the regret
minimization framework. In some settings, this provides an alternative spectral
algorithm to achieve constant factor approximation for survivable network
design, and partially answers a question of Bansal about survivable network
design with concentration property. We also show that the spectral rounding
results have many other applications, including weighted experimental design
and additive spectral sparsification.

Title: Capacitive storage in mycelium substrate

Categories: cs.ET
Comments: 16 figures, 14 pages
\\
  The emerging field of living technologies aims to create new functional
hybrid materials in which living systems interface with artificial ones.
Combining research into living technologies with emerging developments in
computing architecture has enabled the generation of organic electronics from
plants and slime mould. Here, we expand on this work by studying capacitive
properties of a substrate colonised by mycelium of grey oyster fungi, Pleurotus
ostreatus. Capacitors play a fundamental role in traditional analogue and
digital electronic systems and have a range of uses including sensing, energy
storage and filter circuits. Mycelium has the potential to be used as an
organic replacement for traditional capacitor technology. Here, were show that
the capacitance of mycelium is in the order of hundreds of pico-Farads. We also
demonstrate that the charge density of the mycelium `dielectric' decays rapidly
with increasing distance from the source probes. This is important as it
indicates that small cells of mycelium could be used as a charge carrier or
storage medium, when employed as part of an array with reasonable density.

Categories: cs.ET
Comments: 15 figures, 8 pages
\\
  The rapidly developing research field of organic analogue sensors aims to
replace traditional semiconductors with naturally occurring materials.
Photosensors, or photodetectors, change their electrical properties in response
to the light levels they are exposed to. Organic photosensors can be
functionalised to respond to specific wavelengths, from ultra-violet to red
light. Performing cyclic voltammetry on fungal mycelium and fruiting bodies
under different lighting conditions shows no appreciable response to changes in
lighting condition. However, functionalising the specimen using PEDOT:PSS
yields in a photosensor that produces large, instantaneous current spikes when
the light conditions change. Future works would look at interfacing this
organic photosensor with an appropriate digital back-end for interpreting and
processing the response.

Title: Real-time Image Smoothing via Iterative Least Squares
Authors: Wei Liu, Pingping Zhang, Xiaolin Huang, Jie Yang, Chuanhua Shen and
  Ian Reid
Categories: cs.GR
Comments: 24 pages, accepted by ACM Transactions on Graphics
\\
  Edge-preserving image smoothing is a fundamental procedure for many computer
vision and graphic applications. There is a tradeoff between the smoothing
quality and the processing speed: the high smoothing quality usually requires a
high computational cost which leads to the low processing speed. In this paper,
we propose a new global optimization based method, named iterative least
squares (ILS), for efficient edge-preserving image smoothing. Our approach can
produce high-quality results but at a much lower computational cost.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the propose method can produce
results with little visible artifacts. Moreover, the computation of ILS can be
highly parallel, which can be easily accelerated through either multi-thread
computing or the GPU hardware. With the acceleration of a GTX 1080 GPU, it is
able to process images of 1080p resolution ($1920\times1080$) at the rate of
20fps for color images and 47fps for gray images. In addition, the ILS is
flexible and can be modified to handle more applications that require different
smoothing properties. Experimental results of several applications show the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The code is available at

Title: Exploiting an Adversary's Intentions in Graphical Coordination Games
Authors: Brandon C. Collins, Philip N. Brown
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: ACC2020, 6 pages
\\
  How does information regarding an adversary's intentions affect optimal
system design? This paper addresses this question in the context of graphical
coordination games where an adversary can indirectly influence the behavior of
agents by modifying their payoffs. We study a situation in which a system
operator must select a graph topology in anticipation of the action of an
unknown adversary. The designer can limit her worst-case losses by playing a
security strategy, effectively planning for an adversary which intends maximum
harm. However, fine-grained information regarding the adversary's intention may
help the system operator to fine-tune the defenses and obtain better system
performance. In a simple model of adversarial behavior, this paper asks how
much a system operator can gain by fine-tuning a defense for known adversarial
intent. We find that if the adversary is weak, a security strategy is
approximately optimal for any adversary type; however, for moderately-strong
adversaries, security strategies are far from optimal.

Title: Efficient Two-Sided Markets with Limited Information
Authors: Paul D\"utting, Federico Fusco, Philip Lazos, Stefano Leonardi,
  Rebecca Reiffenh\"auser
Categories: cs.GT cs.DS
\\
  Many important practical markets inherently involve the interaction of
strategic buyers with strategic sellers. A fundamental impossibility result for
such two-sided markets due to Myerson and Satterthwaite establishes that even
in the simplest such market, that of bilateral trade, it is impossible to
design a mechanism that is individually rational, truthful, (weakly) budget
balanced, and efficient. Even worse, it is known that the "second best"
mechanism$-$the mechanism that maximizes social welfare subject to the other
constraints$-$has to be carefully tailored to the Bayesian priors and is
extremely complex.
  In light of this impossibility result it is very natural to seek "simple"
mechanisms that are approximately optimal, and indeed a very active line of
recent work has established a broad spectrum of constant-factor approximation
guarantees, which apply to settings well beyond those for which (implicit)
characterizations of the optimal (second best) mechanism are known.
  In this work, we go one step further and show that for many fundamental
two-sided markets$-$e.g., bilateral trade, double auctions, and combinatorial
double auctions$-$it is possible to design near-optimal mechanisms with
provable, constant-factor approximation guarantees with just a single sample
from the priors! In fact, most of our results in addition to requiring less
information also improve upon the best known approximation guarantees for the
respective setting.

Title: Online Assortment with Limited Inventories and Set-Dependent Revenues
Authors: S. Rasoul Etesami
Categories: cs.GT math.OC
\\
  We consider an online assortment problem with $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$
sellers, each holding exactly one item $i\in[n]$ of initial inventory $c_i\in
\mathbb{Z}_+$, and a sequence of homogeneous buyers arriving over a finite time
horizon $t=1,2,\ldots,m$. There is an online platform whose goal is to offer a
subset $S_t\subseteq [n]$ of sellers to the arriving buyer at time $t$ to
maximize the expected revenue derived over the entire horizon while respecting
the inventory constraints. Given an assortment $S_t$ at time $t$, it is assumed
that the buyer will select an item from $S_t$ based on the well-known
multinomial logit model, a well-justified choice model from the economic
literature. In particular, in this model, the revenue obtained from selling an
item $i$ at a given time $t$ critically depends on the assortment $S_t$ offered
at that time and is given by the Nash equilibrium of a Bertrand game played
among the sellers in $S_t$. This imposes a strong dependence/externality
between the offered assortments, items revenues, and inventory levels. Despite
these challenges, we devise the first constant factor competitive algorithm for
the online platform. This answers a question in a paper by Zheng and Srikant
2019, that considered the static version of this problem with only one buyer
and no inventory constraints.

\\
  Coronaviruses are a famous family of viruses that causes illness in human or
animals. The new type of corona virus COVID-19 disease was firstly discovered
in Wuhan-China. However, recently, the virus has been widely spread in most of
the world countries and is reported as a pandemic. Further, nowadays, all the
world countries are striving to control the coronavirus disease COVID-19. There
are many mechanisms to detect the coronavirus disease COVID-19 including
clinical analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed
COVID-19 patient manifests as fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly,
several techniques can be used to detect the initial results of the virus such
as medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost and it
takes time to install them and use. Therefore, in this paper, a new framework
is proposed to detect coronavirus disease COVID-19 using onboard smartphone
sensors. The proposal provides a low-cost solution, since most of the
radiologists have already held smartphones for different daily-purposes. People
can use the framework on their smartphones for the virus detection purpose.
Nowadays, smartphones are powerful with existing computation-rich processors,
memory space, and large number of sensors including cameras, microphone,
temperature sensor, inertial sensors, proximity, colour-sensor,
humidity-sensor, and wireless chipsets/sensors. The designed Artificial
Intelligence (AI) enabled framework reads the smartphone sensors signal
measurements to predict the grade of severity of the pneumonia as well as
predicting the result of the disease.

combining the sensing powers of wearable physiological (Electrodermal Activity,
Photoplethysmography) and physical (Accelerometer, Object) sensors in
conjunction with ambient sensors. We design appropriate signal processing and
machine learning techniques, and develop an automatic cognitive health
assessment system in a natural older adults living environment. We validate our
approaches using two datasets: (i) a naturalistic sensor data streams related
to Activities of Daily Living and mental arousal of 22 older adults recruited
in a retirement community center, individually living in their own apartments
using a customized inexpensive IoT system (IRB #HP-00064387) and (ii) a
publicly available dataset for emotion detection. The performance of
AutoCogniSys attests max. 93\% of accuracy in assessing cognitive health of
older adults.

  2020 (ECIR '20), 2020
\\
  The volume of news content has increased significantly in recent years and
systems to process and deliver this information in an automated fashion at
scale are becoming increasingly prevalent. One critical component that is
required in such systems is a method to automatically determine how notable a
certain news story is, in order to prioritize these stories during delivery.
One way to do so is to compare each story in a stream of news stories to a
notable event. In other words, the problem of detecting notable news can be
defined as a ranking task; given a trusted source of notable events and a
stream of candidate news stories, we aim to answer the question: "Which of the
candidate news stories is most similar to the notable one?". We employ
different combinations of features and learning to rank (LTR) models and gather
relevance labels using crowdsourcing. In our approach, we use structured
representations of candidate news stories (triples) and we link them to
corresponding entities. Our evaluation shows that the features in our proposed
method outperform standard ranking methods, and that the trained model
generalizes well to unseen news stories.

Title: Overview of the TREC 2019 deep learning track
Authors: Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, Daniel Campos, Ellen M.

Categories: cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  The Deep Learning Track is a new track for TREC 2019, with the goal of
studying ad hoc ranking in a large data regime. It is the first track with
large human-labeled training sets, introducing two sets corresponding to two
tasks, each with rigorous TREC-style blind evaluation and reusable test sets.
The document retrieval task has a corpus of 3.2 million documents with 367
thousand training queries, for which we generate a reusable test set of 43
queries. The passage retrieval task has a corpus of 8.8 million passages with
503 thousand training queries, for which we generate a reusable test set of 43
queries. This year 15 groups submitted a total of 75 runs, using various
combinations of deep learning, transfer learning and traditional IR ranking
methods. Deep learning runs significantly outperformed traditional IR runs.
Possible explanations for this result are that we introduced large training

Title: Resource Allocation for IRS-assisted Full-Duplex Cognitive Radio Systems
Authors: Dongfang Xu, Xianghao Yu, Yan Sun, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Robert
  Schober
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 30 pages, 8 figures, submitted for potential publication
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio systems. In
particular, a secondary network employs an FD base station (BS) for serving
multiple half-duplex downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users simultaneously. An IRS
is deployed to enhance the performance of the secondary network while helping
to mitigate the interference caused to the primary users (PUs). The DL transmit
beamforming vectors and the UL receive beamforming vectors at the FD BS, the
transmit power of the UL users, and the phase shift matrix at the IRS are
jointly optimized for maximization of the total sum rate of the secondary
system. The design task is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem
taking into account the imperfect knowledge of the PUs' channel state
information (CSI) and their maximum interference tolerance. Since the maximum
interference tolerance constraint is intractable, we apply a safe approximation
to transform it into a convex constraint. To efficiently handle the resulting
approximated optimization problem, which is still non-convex, we develop an
iterative block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm. This algorithm
exploits semidefinite relaxation, a penalty method, and successive convex
approximation and is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
approximated optimization problem. Our simulation results do not only reveal
that the proposed scheme yields a substantially higher system sum rate for the
secondary system than several baseline schemes, but also confirm its robustness
against CSI uncertainty. Besides, our results illustrate the tremendous
potential of IRS for managing the various types of interference arising in FD
cognitive radio networks.

Title: Cooperative Object Detection and Parameter Estimation Using Visible
  Light Communications
Authors: Hamid Hosseinianfar, Maite Brandt-Pearce
Categories: cs.IT cs.CV math.IT
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Visible light communication (VLC) systems are promising candidates for future
indoor access and peer-to-peer networks. The performance of these systems,
however, is vulnerable to the line of sight (LOS) link blockage due to objects
inside the room. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic object detection
method that takes advantage of the blockage status of the LOS links between the
user devices and transceivers on the ceiling to locate those objects. The
target objects are modeled as cylinders with random radii. The location and
size of an object can be estimated by using a quadratic programming approach.
Simulation results show that the root-mean-squared error can be less than $1$
cm and $8$ cm for estimating the center and the radius of the object,
respectively.

Title: Binary LCD Codes and Self-orthogonal Codes via Simplicial Complexes
Authors: Yansheng Wu, Yoonjin Lee
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 4 pages. To appear in IEEE Communications Letters
\\
  Due to some practical applications, linear complementary dual (LCD) codes and
self-orthogonal codes have attracted wide attention in recent years. In this
paper, we use simplicial complexes for construction of an infinite family of
binary LCD codes and two infinite families of binary self-orthogonal codes.
Moreover, we explicitly determine the weight distributions of these codes. We
obtain binary LCD codes which have minimum weights two or three, and we also
find some self-orthogonal codes meeting the Griesmer bound. As examples, we
also present some (almost) {\it optimal} binary self-orthogonal codes and LCD
{\it distance optimal} codes.

Title: Linear Regression without Correspondences via Concave Minimization
Authors: Liangzu Peng and Manolis C. Tsakiris
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
\\
  Linear regression without correspondences concerns the recovery of a signal
in the linear regression setting, where the correspondences between the
observations and the linear functionals are unknown. The associated maximum
likelihood function is NP-hard to compute when the signal has dimension larger
than one. To optimize this objective function we reformulate it as a concave
minimization problem, which we solve via branch-and-bound. This is supported by
a computable search space to branch, an effective lower bounding scheme via
convex envelope minimization and a refined upper bound, all naturally arising
from the concave minimization reformulation. The resulting algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for fully shuffled data and remains
tractable for up to $8$-dimensional signals, an untouched regime in prior work.

Title: Neighborhood-based Pooling for Population-level Label Distribution
  Learning
Authors: Tharindu Cyril Weerasooriya, Tong Liu, Christopher M. Homan
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Journal-ref: Proceedings of the 24th European Conference on Artificial
  Intelligence 2020
\\
  Supervised machine learning often requires human-annotated data. While
annotator disagreement is typically interpreted as evidence of noise,
population-level label distribution learning (PLDL) treats the collection of
annotations for each data item as a sample of the opinions of a population of
human annotators, among whom disagreement may be proper and expected, even with
no noise present. From this perspective, a typical training set may contain a
large number of very small-sized samples, one for each data item, none of
which, by itself, is large enough to be considered representative of the
underlying population's beliefs about that item. We propose an algorithmic
framework and new statistical tests for PLDL that account for sampling size. We
apply them to previously proposed methods for sharing labels across similar
data items. We also propose new approaches for label sharing, which we call
neighborhood-based pooling.

Title: ActiLabel: A Combinatorial Transfer Learning Framework for Activity
  Recognition
Authors: Parastoo Alinia, Iman Mirzadeh, and Hassan Ghasemzadeh
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Sensor-based human activity recognition has become a critical component of
many emerging applications ranging from behavioral medicine to gaming. However,
an unprecedented increase in the diversity of sensor devices in the
Internet-of-Things era has limited the adoption of activity recognition models
for use across different domains. We propose ActiLabel a combinatorial
framework that learns structural similarities among the events in an arbitrary
domain and those of a different domain. The structural similarities are
captured through a graph model, referred to as the it dependency graph, which
abstracts details of activity patterns in low-level signal and feature space.
The activity labels are then autonomously learned by finding an optimal tiered
mapping between the dependency graphs. Extensive experiments based on three
public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ActiLabel over state-of-the-art
transfer learning and deep learning methods.

Title: Improving Performance in Reinforcement Learning by Breaking
  Generalization in Neural Networks
Authors: Sina Ghiassian, Banafsheh Rafiee, Yat Long Lo, Adam White
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE
Comments: 10 pages; Accepted to AAMAS 2020
\\
  Reinforcement learning systems require good representations to work well. For
decades practical success in reinforcement learning was limited to small
domains. Deep reinforcement learning systems, on the other hand, are scalable,
not dependent on domain specific prior knowledge and have been successfully
used to play Atari, in 3D navigation from pixels, and to control high degree of
freedom robots. Unfortunately, the performance of deep reinforcement learning
systems is sensitive to hyper-parameter settings and architecture choices. Even
well tuned systems exhibit significant instability both within a trial and
across experiment replications. In practice, significant expertise and trial
and error are usually required to achieve good performance. One potential
source of the problem is known as catastrophic interference: when later
training decreases performance by overriding previous learning. Interestingly,
the powerful generalization that makes Neural Networks (NN) so effective in
batch supervised learning might explain the challenges when applying them in
reinforcement learning tasks. In this paper, we explore how online NN training
and interference interact in reinforcement learning. We find that simply
re-mapping the input observations to a high-dimensional space improves learning
speed and parameter sensitivity. We also show this preprocessing reduces
interference in prediction tasks. More practically, we provide a simple
approach to NN training that is easy to implement, and requires little
additional computation. We demonstrate that our approach improves performance
in both prediction and control with an extensive batch of experiments in
classic control domains.

Title: Explaining Memorization and Generalization: A Large-Scale Study with
  Coherent Gradients
Authors: Piotr Zielinski, Shankar Krishnan, Satrajit Chatterjee
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Coherent Gradients is a recently proposed hypothesis to explain why
over-parameterized neural networks trained with gradient descent generalize
well even though they have sufficient capacity to memorize the training set.
Inspired by random forests, Coherent Gradients proposes that (Stochastic)
Gradient Descent (SGD) finds common patterns amongst examples (if such common
patterns exist) since descent directions that are common to many examples add
up in the overall gradient, and thus the biggest changes to the network
parameters are those that simultaneously help many examples. The original
Coherent Gradients paper validated the theory through causal intervention
experiments on shallow, fully connected networks on MNIST. In this work, we
perform similar intervention experiments on more complex architectures (such as
VGG, Inception and ResNet) on more complex datasets (such as CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet). Our results are in good agreement with the small scale study in the
original paper, thus providing the first validation of coherent gradients in
more practically relevant settings. We also confirm in these settings that
suppressing incoherent updates by natural modifications to SGD can
significantly reduce overfitting--lending credence to the hypothesis that
memorization occurs when few examples are responsible for most of the gradient
used in the update. Furthermore, we use the coherent gradients theory to
explore a new characterization of why some examples are learned earlier than
other examples, i.e., "easy" and "hard" examples.

Title: Learnergy: Energy-based Machine Learners
Authors: Mateus Roder, Gustavo Henrique de Rosa, Jo\~ao Paulo Papa
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Throughout the last years, machine learning techniques have been broadly
encouraged in the context of deep learning architectures. An interesting
algorithm denoted as Restricted Boltzmann Machine relies on energy- and
probabilistic-based nature to tackle with the most diverse applications, such
as classification, reconstruction, and generation of images and signals.
Nevertheless, one can see they are not adequately renowned when compared to
other well-known deep learning techniques, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks.
Such behavior promotes the lack of researches and implementations around the
literature, coping with the challenge of sufficiently comprehending these
energy-based systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Python-inspired
framework in the context of energy-based architectures, denoted as Learnergy.
Essentially, Learnergy is built upon PyTorch for providing a more friendly
environment and a faster prototyping workspace, as well as, possibility the
usage of CUDA computations, speeding up their computational time.

Title: A Numerical Transform of Random Forest Regressors corrects
  Systematically-Biased Predictions
Authors: Shipra Malhotra and John Karanicolas
Categories: cs.LG q-bio.QM stat.ML
\\
  Over the past decade, random forest models have become widely used as a
robust method for high-dimensional data regression tasks. In part, the
popularity of these models arises from the fact that they require little
hyperparameter tuning and are not very susceptible to overfitting. Random
forest regression models are comprised of an ensemble of decision trees that
independently predict the value of a (continuous) dependent variable;
predictions from each of the trees are ultimately averaged to yield an overall
predicted value from the forest. Using a suite of representative real-world
datasets, we find a systematic bias in predictions from random forest models.
We find that this bias is recapitulated in simple synthetic datasets,
regardless of whether or not they include irreducible error (noise) in the
data, but that models employing boosting do not exhibit this bias. Here we
demonstrate the basis for this problem, and we use the training data to define
a numerical transformation that fully corrects it. Application of this
transformation yields improved predictions in every one of the real-world and
synthetic datasets evaluated in our study.

Title: Spectral Graph Attention Network

Categories: cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML
\\
  Variants of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning have
been proposed recently and achieved fruitful results in various fields. Among
them, graph attention networks (GATs) first employ a self-attention strategy to
learn attention weights for each edge in the spatial domain. However, learning
the attentions over edges only pays attention to the local information of
graphs and greatly increases the number of parameters. In this paper, we first
introduce attentions in the spectral domain of graphs. Accordingly, we present
Spectral Graph Attention Network (SpGAT) that learn representations for
different frequency components regarding weighted filters and graph wavelets
bases. In this way, SpGAT can better capture global patterns of graphs in an
efficient manner with much fewer learned parameters than that of GAT. We
thoroughly evaluate the performance of SpGAT in the semi-supervised node
classification task and verified the effectiveness of the learned attentions in
the spectral domain.

Title: Energy-Based Processes for Exchangeable Data
Authors: Mengjiao Yang, Bo Dai, Hanjun Dai, Dale Schuurmans
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Recently there has been growing interest in modeling sets with
exchangeability such as point clouds. A shortcoming of current approaches is
that they restrict the cardinality of the sets considered or can only express
limited forms of distribution over unobserved data. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Energy-Based Processes (EBPs), which extend energy
based models to exchangeable data while allowing neural network
parameterizations of the energy function. A key advantage of these models is
the ability to express more flexible distributions over sets without
restricting their cardinality. We develop an efficient training procedure for
EBPs that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks such
as point cloud generation, classification, denoising, and image completion.

Title: Multi-action Offline Policy Learning with Bayesian Optimization

Categories: cs.LG econ.EM math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
Comments: Under review
\\
  We study an offline multi-action policy learning algorithm based on doubly
robust estimators from causal inference settings, using argmax linear policy
function classes. For general policy classes, we establish the connection of
the regret bound with a generalization of the VC dimension in higher dimensions
and specialize this to prove optimal regret bounds for the argmax linear
function class. We also study various optimization approaches to solving the
non-smooth non-convex problem associated with the argmax linear class,
including convex relaxation, softmax relaxation, and Bayesian optimization. We
find that Bayesian optimization with the Gradient-based Adaptive Stochastic
Search (GASS) algorithm consistently outperforms convex relaxation in terms of
policy value, and is much faster compared to softmax relaxation. Finally, we
apply the algorithms to simulated and warfarin dataset. On the warfarin dataset
the offline algorithm trained using only a subset of features achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Title: A Unified View of Label Shift Estimation
Authors: Saurabh Garg, Yifan Wu, Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Zachary C. Lipton
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Pre-print
\\
  Label shift describes the setting where although the label distribution might
change between the source and target domains, the class-conditional
probabilities (of data given a label) do not. There are two dominant approaches
for estimating the label marginal. BBSE, a moment-matching approach based on
confusion matrices, is provably consistent and provides interpretable error
bounds. However, a maximum likelihood estimation approach, which we call MLLS,
dominates empirically. In this paper, we present a unified view of the two
methods and the first theoretical characterization of the likelihood-based
estimator. Our contributions include (i) conditions for consistency of MLLS,
which include calibration of the classifier and a confusion matrix
invertibility condition that BBSE also requires; (ii) a unified view of the
methods, casting the confusion matrix as roughly equivalent to MLLS for a
particular choice of calibration method; and (iii) a decomposition of MLLS's
finite-sample error into terms reflecting the impacts of miscalibration and
estimation error. Our analysis attributes BBSE's statistical inefficiency to a
loss of information due to coarse calibration. We support our findings with
experiments on both synthetic data and the MNIST and CIFAR10 image recognition
datasets.

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 21 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Network quantization has rapidly become one of the most widely used methods
to compress and accelerate deep neural networks. Recent efforts propose to
quantize weights and activations from different layers with different precision
to improve the overall performance. However, it is challenging to find the
optimal bitwidth (i.e., precision) for weights and activations of each layer
efficiently. Meanwhile, it is yet unclear how to perform convolution for
weights and activations of different precision efficiently on generic hardware
platforms. To resolve these two issues, in this paper, we first propose an
Efficient Bitwidth Search (EBS) algorithm, which reuses the meta weights for
different quantization bitwidth and thus the strength for each candidate
precision can be optimized directly w.r.t the objective without superfluous
copies, reducing both the memory and computational cost significantly. Second,
we propose a binary decomposition algorithm that converts weights and
activations of different precision into binary matrices to make the mixed
precision convolution efficient and practical. Experiment results on CIFAR10
and ImageNet datasets demonstrate our mixed precision QNN outperforms the
handcrafted uniform bitwidth counterparts and other mixed precision techniques.

Comments: 16 pages, 4 figures, accepted to DASFAA2020
\\
  Partial multi-label learning (PML) models the scenario where each training
instance is annotated with a set of candidate labels, and only some of the
labels are relevant. The PML problem is practical in real-world scenarios, as
it is difficult and even impossible to obtain precisely labeled samples.
Several PML solutions have been proposed to combat with the prone misled by the
irrelevant labels concealed in the candidate labels, but they generally focus
on the smoothness assumption in feature space or low-rank assumption in label
space, while ignore the negative information between features and labels.
Specifically, if two instances have largely overlapped candidate labels,
irrespective of their feature similarity, their ground-truth labels should be
similar; while if they are dissimilar in the feature and candidate label space,
their ground-truth labels should be dissimilar with each other. To achieve a
credible predictor on PML data, we propose a novel approach called PML-LFC
(Partial Multi-label Learning with Label and Feature Collaboration). PML-LFC
estimates the confidence values of relevant labels for each instance using the
similarity from both the label and feature spaces, and trains the desired
predictor with the estimated confidence values. PML-LFC achieves the predictor
and the latent label matrix in a reciprocal reinforce manner by a unified
model, and develops an alternative optimization procedure to optimize them.
Extensive empirical study on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrates the superiority of PML-LFC.

Title: A comprehensive study on the prediction reliability of graph neural
  networks for virtual screening
Authors: Soojung Yang, Kyung Hoon Lee, and Seongok Ryu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Prediction models based on deep neural networks are increasingly gaining
attention for fast and accurate virtual screening systems. For decision makings
in virtual screening, researchers find it useful to interpret an output of
classification system as probability, since such interpretation allows them to
filter out more desirable compounds. However, probabilistic interpretation
cannot be correct for models that hold over-parameterization problems or
inappropriate regularizations, leading to unreliable prediction and decision
making. In this regard, we concern the reliability of neural prediction models
on molecular properties, especially when models are trained with sparse data
points and imbalanced distributions. This work aims to propose guidelines for
training reliable models, we thus provide methodological details and ablation
studies on the following train principles. We investigate the effects of model
architectures, regularization methods, and loss functions on the prediction
performance and reliability of classification results. Moreover, we evaluate
prediction reliability of models on virtual screening scenario. Our result
highlights that correct choice of regularization and inference methods is
evidently important to achieve high success rate, especially in data imbalanced
situation. All experiments were performed under a single unified model
implementation to alleviate external randomness in model training and to enable
precise comparison of results.

Comments: Accepted at ECAI2020
\\
  Verification of deep neural networks has witnessed a recent surge of
interest, fueled by success stories in diverse domains and by abreast concerns
about safety and security in envisaged applications. Complexity and sheer size
of such networks are challenging for automated formal verification techniques
which, on the other hand, could ease the adoption of deep networks in safety-
and security-critical contexts.
  In this paper we focus on enabling state-of-the-art verification tools to
deal with neural networks of some practical interest. We propose a new training
pipeline based on network pruning with the goal of striking a balance between
maintaining accuracy and robustness while making the resulting networks
amenable to formal analysis. The results of our experiments with a portfolio of
pruning algorithms and verification tools show that our approach is successful
for the kind of networks we consider and for some combinations of pruning and
verification techniques, thus bringing deep neural networks closer to the reach
of formally-grounded methods.

  For semi-supervised learning on graphs, we study how initial kernels in a
supervised learning regime can be augmented with additional information from
known priors or from unsupervised learning outputs. These augmented kernels are
constructed in a simple update scheme based on the Schur-Hadamard product of
the kernel with additional feature kernels. As generators of the positive
definite kernels we will focus on graph basis functions (GBF) that allow to
include geometric information of the graph via the graph Fourier transform.
Using a regularized least squares (RLS) approach for machine learning, we will
test the derived augmented kernels for the classification of data on graphs.

  Representativeness-Diversity Maximization (iRDM)
Authors: Ziang Liu and Hanbin Luo and Weili Fang and Jiajing Liu and Dongrui Wu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Active learning (AL) selects the most beneficial unlabeled samples to label,
and hence a better machine learning model can be trained from the same number
of labeled samples. Most existing active learning for regression (ALR)
approaches are supervised, which means the sampling process must use some label
information, or an existing regression model. This paper considers completely
unsupervised ALR, i.e., how to select the samples to label without knowing any
true label information. We propose a novel unsupervised ALR approach, iterative
representativeness-diversity maximization (iRDM), to optimally balance the
representativeness and the diversity of the selected samples. Experiments on 12
datasets from various domains demonstrated its effectiveness. Our iRDM can be
applied to both linear regression and kernel regression, and it even
significantly outperforms supervised ALR when the number of labeled samples is
small.

  We describe nonparametric deconvolution models (NDMs), a family of Bayesian
nonparametric models for collections of data in which each observation is the
average over the features from heterogeneous particles. For example, these
types of data are found in elections, where we observe precinct-level vote
tallies (observations) of individual citizens' votes (particles) across each of
the candidates or ballot measures (features), where each voter is part of a
specific voter cohort or demographic (factor). Like the hierarchical Dirichlet
process, NDMs rely on two tiers of Dirichlet processes to explain the data with
an unknown number of latent factors; each observation is modeled as a weighted
average of these latent factors. Unlike existing models, NDMs recover how
factor distributions vary locally for each observation. This uniquely allows
NDMs both to deconvolve each observation into its constituent factors, and also
to describe how the factor distributions specific to each observation vary
across observations and deviate from the corresponding global factors. We
present variational inference techniques for this family of models and study
its performance on simulated data and voting data from California. We show that
including local factors improves estimates of global factors and provides a
novel scaffold for exploring data.

\\
  The era of "data deluge" has sparked renewed interest in graph-based learning
methods and their widespread applications ranging from sociology and biology to
transportation and communications. In this context of graph-aware methods, the
present paper introduces a tensor-graph convolutional network (TGCN) for
scalable semi-supervised learning (SSL) from data associated with a collection
of graphs, that are represented by a tensor. Key aspects of the novel TGCN
architecture are the dynamic adaptation to different relations in the tensor
graph via learnable weights, and the consideration of graph-based regularizers
to promote smoothness and alleviate over-parameterization. The ultimate goal is
to design a powerful learning architecture able to: discover complex and highly
nonlinear data associations, combine (and select) multiple types of relations,
scale gracefully with the graph size, and remain robust to perturbations on the
graph edges. The proposed architecture is relevant not only in applications
where the nodes are naturally involved in different relations (e.g., a
multi-relational graph capturing family, friendship and work relations in a
social network), but also in robust learning setups where the graph entails a
certain level of uncertainty, and the different tensor slabs correspond to
different versions (realizations) of the nominal graph. Numerical tests
showcase that the proposed architecture achieves markedly improved performance
relative to standard GCNs, copes with state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, and
leads to remarkable SSL performance over protein-to-protein interaction
networks.

Title: Characterizing and Avoiding Problematic Global Optima of Variational
  Autoencoders
Authors: Yaniv Yacoby, Weiwei Pan, Finale Doshi-Velez
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted at the Proceedings of The 2nd Symposium on Advances in
  Approximate Bayesian Inference 2019
Journal-ref: PMLR 118:1-17, 2020
\\
  Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs) are deep generative latent variable models
consisting of two components: a generative model that captures a data
distribution p(x) by transforming a distribution p(z) over latent space, and an
inference model that infers likely latent codes for each data point (Kingma and
Welling, 2013). Recent work shows that traditional training methods tend to
yield solutions that violate modeling desiderata: (1) the learned generative
model captures the observed data distribution but does so while ignoring the
latent codes, resulting in codes that do not represent the data (e.g. van den
Oord et al. (2017); Kim et al. (2018)); (2) the aggregate of the learned latent
codes does not match the prior p(z). This mismatch means that the learned
generative model will be unable to generate realistic data with samples from
p(z)(e.g. Makhzani et al. (2015); Tomczak and Welling (2017)). In this paper,
we demonstrate that both issues stem from the fact that the global optima of
the VAE training objective often correspond to undesirable solutions. Our
analysis builds on two observations: (1) the generative model is unidentifiable
- there exist many generative models that explain the data equally well, each
with different (and potentially unwanted) properties and (2) bias in the VAE
objective - the VAE objective may prefer generative models that explain the
data poorly but have posteriors that are easy to approximate. We present a
novel inference method, LiBI, mitigating the problems identified in our
analysis. On synthetic datasets, we show that LiBI can learn generative models
that capture the data distribution and inference models that better satisfy
modeling assumptions when traditional methods struggle to do so.

Title: Unified Multi-Domain Learning and Data Imputation using Adversarial
  Autoencoder
Authors: Andre Mendes, Julian Togelius, Leandro dos Santos Coelho
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  We present a novel framework that can combine multi-domain learning (MDL),
data imputation (DI) and multi-task learning (MTL) to improve performance for
classification and regression tasks in different domains. The core of our
method is an adversarial autoencoder that can: (1) learn to produce
domain-invariant embeddings to reduce the difference between domains; (2) learn
the data distribution for each domain and correctly perform data imputation on
missing data. For MDL, we use the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure to
align the domain distributions. For DI, we use an adversarial approach where a
generator fill in information for missing data and a discriminator tries to
distinguish between real and imputed values. Finally, using the universal
feature representation in the embeddings, we train a classifier using MTL that
given input from any domain, can predict labels for all domains. We demonstrate
the superior performance of our approach compared to other state-of-art methods
in three distinct settings, DG-DI in image recognition with unstructured data,
MTL-DI in grade estimation with structured data and MDMTL-DI in a selection
process using mixed data.

\\
  The wide spread use of positioning and photographing devices gives rise to a
deluge of traffic trajectory data (e.g., vehicle passage records and taxi
trajectory data), with each record having at least three attributes: object ID,
location ID, and time-stamp. In this paper, we propose a novel mobility pattern
embedding model called MPE to shed the light on people's mobility patterns in
traffic trajectory data from multiple aspects, including sequential, personal,
and temporal factors. MPE has two salient features: (1) it is capable of
casting various types of information (object, location and time) to an
integrated low-dimensional latent space; (2) it considers the effect of
``phantom transitions'' arising from road networks in traffic trajectory data.
This embedding model opens the door to a wide range of applications such as
next location prediction and visualization. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets show that MPE is effective and outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods significantly in a variety of tasks.

  In this paper, a new steganographic method is presented that provides minimum

rounding error and optimizes that in a way to reduce distortion in the stego

Title: Reinforcement Learning Driven Adaptive VR Streaming with Optical Flow
  Based QoE
Authors: Wei Quan, Yuxuan Pan, Bin Xiang, Lin Zhang
Categories: cs.MM
\\
  With the merit of containing full panoramic content in one camera, Virtual
Reality (VR) and 360-degree videos have attracted more and more attention in
the field of industrial cloud manufacturing and training. Industrial Internet
of Things (IoT), where many VR terminals needed to be online at the same time,
can hardly guarantee VR's bandwidth requirement. However, by making use of
users' quality of experience (QoE) awareness factors, including the relative
moving speed and depth difference between the viewpoint and other content,
bandwidth consumption can be reduced. In this paper, we propose OFB-VR (Optical
Flow Based VR), an interactive method of VR streaming that can make use of VR
users' QoE awareness to ease the bandwidth pressure. The Just-Noticeable
Difference through Optical Flow Estimation (JND-OFE) is explored to quantify
users' awareness of quality distortion in 360-degree videos. Accordingly, a
novel 360-degree videos QoE metric based on PSNR and JND-OFE (PSNR-OF) is
proposed. With the help of PSNR-OF, OFB-VR proposes a versatile-size tiling
scheme to lessen the tiling overhead. A Reinforcement Learning(RL) method is
implemented to make use of historical data to perform Adaptive BitRate(ABR).
For evaluation, we take two prior VR streaming schemes, Pano and Plato, as
baselines. Vast evaluations show that our system can increase the mean PSNR-OF
score by 9.5-15.8% while maintaining the same rebuffer ratio compared with Pano
and Plato in a fluctuate LTE bandwidth dataset. Evaluation results show that
OFB-VR is a promising prototype for actual interactive industrial VR. A
prototype of OFB-VR can be found in https://github.com/buptexplorers/OFB-VR.

  This work introduces Pressio, an open-source project aimed at enabling
leading-edge projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) for large-scale
nonlinear dynamical systems in science and engineering. Pressio provides
model-reduction methods that can reduce both the number of spatial and temporal
degrees of freedom for any dynamical system expressible as a system of
parameterized ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage this simple,
expressive mathematical framework as a pivotal design choice to enable a
minimal application programming interface (API) that is natural to dynamical
systems. The core component of Pressio is a C++11 header-only library that
leverages generic programming to support applications with arbitrary data types
and arbitrarily complex programming models. This is complemented with Python
bindings to expose these C++ functionalities to Python users with negligible
overhead and no user-required binding code. We discuss the distinguishing
characteristics of Pressio relative to existing model-reduction libraries,
outline its key design features, describe how the user interacts with it, and
present two test cases---including one with over 20 million degrees of
freedom---that highlight the performance results of Pressio and illustrate the
breath of problems that can be addressed with it.

  The efficient condition assessment of engineered systems requires the
coupling of high fidelity models with data extracted from the state of the
system `as-is'. In enabling this task, this paper implements a parametric Model
Order Reduction (pMOR) scheme for nonlinear structural dynamics, and the
particular case of material nonlinearity. A physics-based parametric
representation is developed, incorporating dependencies on system properties
and/or excitation characteristics. The pMOR formulation relies on use of a
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition applied to a series of snapshots of the
nonlinear dynamic response. A new approach to manifold interpolation is
proposed, with interpolation taking place on the reduced coefficient matrix
mapping local bases to a global one. We demonstrate the performance of this
approach firstly on the simple example of a shear-frame structure, and secondly
on the more complex 3D numerical case study of an earthquake-excited wind
turbine tower. Parametric dependence pertains to structural properties, as well
as the temporal and spectral characteristics of the applied excitation. The
developed parametric Reduced Order Model (pROM) can be exploited for a number
of tasks including monitoring and diagnostics, control of vibrating structures,
and residual life estimation of critical components.

  The Blasius flow is the idealized flow of a viscous fluid past an
infinitesimally thick, semi-infinite flat plate. The definition of a
non-iterative transformation method for the celebrated Blasius problem is due
to T{\"o}pfer and dates more than a century ago. Here we define a non-iterative
transformation method for Blasius equation with a moving wall, a slip flow
condition or a surface gasification. The defined method allows us to deal with
classes of problems in boundary layer theory that, depending on a parameter,
admit multiple or no solutions. This approach is particularly convenient when
the main interest is on the behaviour of the considered models with respect to
the involved parameter. The obtained numerical results are found to be in good
agreement with those available in literature.

approach in the case of variance based methods provided the surrogate model
results from the original one through the thermodynamic limit. We also provide
illustrative numerical examples in context of a Michaelis--Menten system and a

  Legged locomotion is a challenging task in the field of robotics but a rather
simple one in nature. This motivates the use of biological methodologies as
solutions to this problem. Central pattern generators are neural networks that
are thought to be responsible for locomotion in humans and some animal species.
As for robotics, many attempts were made to reproduce such systems and use them
for a similar goal. One interesting design model is based on spiking neural
networks. This model is the main focus of this work, as its contribution is not
limited to engineering but also applicable to neuroscience. This paper
introduces a new general framework for building central pattern generators that
are task-independent, biologically plausible, and rely on learning methods. The
abilities and properties of the presented approach are not only evaluated in
simulation but also in a robotic experiment. The results are very promising as
the used robot was able to perform stable walking at different speeds and to
change speed within the same gait cycle.

Title: iNALU: Improved Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit
Authors: Daniel Schl\"or, Markus Ring, Andreas Hotho
Categories: cs.NE
Comments: 18 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Neural networks have to capture mathematical relationships in order to learn
various tasks. They approximate these relations implicitly and therefore often
do not generalize well. The recently proposed Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit
(NALU) is a novel neural architecture which is able to explicitly represent the
mathematical relationships by the units of the network to learn operations such
as summation, subtraction or multiplication. Although NALUs have been shown to
perform well on various downstream tasks, an in-depth analysis reveals
practical shortcomings by design, such as the inability to multiply or divide
negative input values or training stability issues for deeper networks. We
address these issues and propose an improved model architecture. We evaluate
our model empirically in various settings from learning basic arithmetic
operations to more complex functions. Our experiments indicate that our model
solves stability issues and outperforms the original NALU model in means of
arithmetic precision and convergence.

Title: Research on a New Convolutional Neural Network Model Combined with
  Random Edges Adding
Authors: Xuanyu Shu, Jin Zhang, Sen Tian, Sheng chen and Lingyu Chen
Categories: cs.NE
Comments: ICPCSEE 2020
\\
  It is always a hot and difficult point to improve the accuracy of
convolutional neural network model and speed up its convergence. Based on the
idea of small world network, a random edge adding algorithm is proposed to
improve the performance of convolutional neural network model. This algorithm
takes the convolutional neural network model as a benchmark, and randomizes
backwards and cross-layer connections with probability p to form a new
convolutional neural network model. The proposed idea can optimize the cross
layer connectivity by changing the topological structure of convolutional
neural network, and provide a new idea for the improvement of the model. The
simulation results based on Fashion-MINST and cifar10 data set show that the
model recognition accuracy and training convergence speed are greatly improved
by random edge adding reconstructed models with aprobability p = 0.1.

Title: System to Identify and Elide Superfluous JavaScript Code for Faster
  Webpage Loads
Authors: Utkarsh Goel, Moritz Steiner
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Many websites import large JavaScript (JS) libraries to customize and enhance
user experiences. Our data shows that many JS libraries are only partially
utilized during a page load, and therefore, contain superfluous code that is
never executed. Many top-ranked websites contain up to hundreds of kilobytes of
compressed superfluous code and a JS resource on a median page contains 31%
superfluous code. Superfluous JS code inflates the page weight, and thereby,
the time to download, parse, and compile a JS resource. It is therefore
important to monitor the usage and optimize the payload of JS resources to
improve Web performance. However, given that the webpage design and
functionality could depend on a user's preferences or device, among many other
factors, actively loading webpages in controlled environments cannot cover all
possible conditions in which webpage content and functionality changes. In this
paper, we show that passive measurement techniques, such as real user
monitoring systems (RUM), that monitor the performance of real user page loads
under different conditions can be leveraged to identify superfluous code. Using
a custom man-in-the-middle proxy (similar to a content delivery network's proxy
server), we designed a systematic approach for website developers that relies
on pages loaded by real users to passively identify superfluous code on JS
resources. We then elide any superfluous code from JS resources before
subsequent page load requests. Our data shows that eliding superfluous JS code
improves the median page load time by 5% and by at least 10% for pages in the
long tail. Through results presented in this paper, we motivate for the need
for rigorous monitoring of the usage of JS resources under different real world
conditions, with the goal to improve Web performance.

Title: Time-Weighted Coverage of Integrated Aerial and Ground Networks for
  Post-Disaster Communications
Authors: Xiaoli Xu, Yong Zeng
Categories: cs.NI cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we propose a new three dimensional (3D) networking
architecture with integrated aerial and ground base stations (BSs) for swift
post-disaster communication recovery. By exploiting their respective advantages
in terms of response time, coverage area, and operational duration, the
proposed network is highly heterogeneous, consisting of sustained ground BSs,
ground-vehicle mounted BSs, dropping-off BSs and flying BSs. To reflect the
importance of swift communication recovery and the dynamics of coverage area in
post-disaster scenarios, we propose a new performance metric called
``time-weighted coverage}", which is an integration of the achieved
communication coverage area multiplied with a weighting function over time. By
choosing different weighting functions, the network deployment can be designed
to achieve tradeoffs between the ``swift communication recovery" and ``stable
communication coverage". Simulation results show that the proposed integrated
aerial and ground network has high implementation flexibility and it can
significantly enhance the communication coverage compared with the conventional
approaches.

Title: Intelligent Resource Slicing for eMBB and URLLC Coexistence in 5G and
  Beyond: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Approach
Authors: Madyan Alsenwi, Nguyen H. Tran, Mehdi Bennis, Shashi Raj Pandey,
  Anupam Kumar Bairagi, and Choong Seon Hong
Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
Comments: This work was submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Wireless
  Communications
\\
  In this paper, we study the resource slicing problem in a dynamic
multiplexing scenario of two distinct 5G services, namely Ultra-Reliable Low
Latency Communications (URLLC) and enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB). While eMBB
services focus on high data rates, URLLC is very strict in terms of latency and
reliability. In view of this, the resource slicing problem is formulated as an
optimization problem that aims at maximizing the eMBB data rate subject to a
URLLC reliability constraint, while considering the variance of the eMBB data
rate to reduce the impact of immediately scheduled URLLC traffic on the eMBB
reliability. To solve the formulated problem, an optimization-aided Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework is proposed, including: 1) eMBB
resource allocation phase, and 2) URLLC scheduling phase. In the first phase,
the optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems and then each
subproblem is transformed into a convex form to obtain an approximate resource
allocation solution. In the second phase, a DRL-based algorithm is proposed to
intelligently distribute the incoming URLLC traffic among eMBB users.
Simulation results show that our proposed approach can satisfy the stringent
URLLC reliability while keeping the eMBB reliability higher than 90%.

new players such as Industry Verticals, e.g. automotive, smart factories,
e-health, etc. Given the large number of potential new business players, dubbed
as network tenants, novel solutions are required to accommodate their needs in
a cost-efficient and secure manner. In this paper, we propose NSBchain, a novel
network slicing brokering (NSB) solution, which leverages on the widely adopted
Blockchain technology to address the new business models needs beyond
traditional network sharing agreements. NSBchain defines a new entity, the
Intermediate Broker (IB), which enables Infrastructure Providers (InPs) to
allocate network resources to IBs through smart contracts and IBs to assign and
re-distribute their resources among tenants in a secure, automated and scalable
manner. We conducted an extensive performance evaluation by means of an
open-source blockchain platform that proves the feasibility of our proposed
framework considering a large number of tenants and two different consensus
algorithms.

Title: Toward a Wearable RFID System for Real-Time Activity Recognition Using
  Radio Patterns
Authors: Liang Wang, Tao Gu, Xianping Tao, Jian Lu
Categories: cs.OH eess.SP
\\
  Elderly care is one of the many applications supported by real-time activity
recognition systems. Traditional approaches use cameras, body sensor networks,
or radio patterns from various sources for activity recognition. However, these
approaches are limited due to ease-of-use, coverage, or privacy preserving
issues. In this paper, we present a novel wearable Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) system aims at providing an easy-to-use solution with
high detection coverage. Our system uses passive tags which are
maintenance-free and can be embedded into the clothes to reduce the wearing and
maintenance efforts. A small RFID reader is also worn on the user's body to
extend the detection coverage as the user moves. We exploit RFID radio patterns
and extract both spatial and temporal features to characterize various
activities. We also address the issues of false negative of tag readings and
tag/antenna calibration, and design a fast online recognition system. Antenna
and tag selection is done automatically to explore the minimum number of
devices required to achieve target accuracy. We develop a prototype system
which consists of a wearable RFID system and a smartphone to demonstrate the
working principles, and conduct experimental studies with four subjects over
two weeks. The results show that our system achieves a high recognition
accuracy of 93.6 percent with a latency of 5 seconds. Additionally, we show
that the system only requires two antennas and four tagged body parts to
achieve a high recognition accuracy of 85 percent.

Title: The NDE 4.0: Key Challenges, Use Cases, and Adaption
Authors: Johannes Vrana, Ripudaman Singh
Categories: cs.OH
\\
  Historians split recent times into three industrial revolutions:
mechanization (steam power), technical (electric power and mass production),
and digital (computing and microelectronics). The world of NDE has a parallel:
tools to sharpen human senses, wave application to view inside the components,
and digital processing and automation. As the industry goes through the fourth
revolution powered by interconnections and enhanced digitalization, NDE is also
on a new horizon: NDE 4.0 with information transparency, technical assistance,
autonomous, and decentralized decisions. Technologies such as IIoT, AR, AI, 5G,
and blockchains are opening up new inspection and safety assurance
possibilities in every industrial sector. To establish a proper foundation for
technical research on this emerging subject, it is important to first research
the perception of stakeholders, misconceptions around NDE, the value
proposition of NDE 4.0, the challenges and opportunities, and even outline a
process to pursue it. This paper presents a critical view of current thinking
and major use cases for NDE 4.0 - both Industry 4.0 for NDE and NDE 4.0 for
Industry; all leading up to a safer, cheaper, faster, and reliable inspection
eco-system. It also dwells upon challenges such as skills relevance, adoption,
and leadership in the cyber-physical world.

Title: Towards High Performance, Portability, and Productivity: Lightweight
  Augmented Neural Networks for Performance Prediction

\\
  Writing high-performance code requires significant expertise of the
programming language, compiler optimizations, and hardware knowledge. This
often leads to poor productivity and portability and is inconvenient for a
non-programmer domain-specialist such as a Physicist. More desirable is a
high-level language where the domain-specialist simply specifies the workload
in terms of high-level operations (e.g., matrix-multiply(A, B)) and the
compiler identifies the best implementation fully utilizing the heterogeneous
platform. For creating a compiler that supports productivity, portability, and
performance simultaneously, it is crucial to predict performance of various
available implementations (variants) of the dominant operations (kernels)
contained in the workload on various hardware to decide (a) which variant
should be chosen for each kernel in the workload, and (b) on which hardware
resource the variant should run. To enable the performance prediction, we
propose lightweight augmented neural networks for arbitrary combinations of
kernel-variant-hardware. A key innovation is utilizing mathematical complexity
of the kernels as a feature to achieve higher accuracy. These models are
compact to reduce training time and fast inference during compile-time and
run-time. Using models with less than 75 parameters, and only 250 training data
instances, we are able to obtain a low MAPE of ~13% significantly outperforming
traditional feed-forward neural networks on 40 kernel-variant-hardware
combinations. We further demonstrate that our variant selection approach can be
used in Halide implementations to obtain up to 1.5x speedup over Halide's
autoscheduler.

Title: Towards Transparent Robotic Planning via Contrastive Explanations
Authors: Shenghui Chen, Kayla Boggess and Lu Feng
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Providing explanations of chosen robotic actions can help to increase the
transparency of robotic planning and improve users' trust. Social sciences
suggest that the best explanations are contrastive, explaining not just why one
action is taken, but why one action is taken instead of another. We formalize
the notion of contrastive explanations for robotic planning policies based on
Markov decision processes, drawing on insights from the social sciences. We
present methods for the automated generation of contrastive explanations with
three key factors: selectiveness, constrictiveness, and responsibility. The
results of a user study with 100 participants on the Amazon Mechanical Turk
platform show that our generated contrastive explanations can help to increase
users' understanding and trust of robotic planning policies while reducing
users' cognitive burden.

Title: Catch the Ball: Accurate High-Speed Motions for Mobile Manipulators via
  Inverse Dynamics Learning
Authors: Ke Dong, Karime Pereida, Florian Shkurti, Angela P. Schoellig
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
Comments: Paper manuscript submitted to IROS 2020
\\
  Mobile manipulators consist of a mobile platform equipped with one or more
robot arms and are of interest for a wide array of challenging tasks because of
their extended workspace and dexterity. Typically, mobile manipulators are
deployed in slow-motion collaborative robot scenarios. In this paper, we
consider scenarios where accurate high-speed motions are required. We introduce
a framework for this regime of tasks including two main components: (i) a
bi-level motion optimization algorithm for real-time trajectory generation,
which relies on Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Quadratic
Programming (QP), respectively; and (ii) a learning-based controller optimized
for precise tracking of high-speed motions via a learned inverse dynamics
model. We evaluate our framework with a mobile manipulator platform through
numerous high-speed ball catching experiments, where we show a success rate of
85.33%. To the best of our knowledge, this success rate exceeds the reported
performance of existing related systems and sets a new state of the art.

Title: Data-driven Characterization of Human Interaction for Model-based
  Control of Powered Prostheses
Authors: Rachel Gehlhar, Yuxiao Chen, and Aaron D. Ames
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages 8 figures
\\
  This paper proposes a data-driven method for powered prosthesis control that
achieves stable walking without the need for additional sensors on the human.
The key idea is to extract the nominal gait and the human interaction
information from motion capture data, and reconstruct the walking behavior with
a dynamic model of the human-prosthesis system. The walking behavior of a human
wearing a powered prosthesis is obtained through motion capture, which yields
the limb and joint trajectories. Then a nominal trajectory is obtained by
solving a gait optimization problem designed to reconstruct the walking
behavior observed by motion capture. Moreover, the interaction force profiles
between the human and the prosthesis are recovered by simulating the model
following the recorded gaits, which are then used to construct a force tube
that covers all the interaction force profiles. Finally, a robust Control
Lyapunov Function (CLF) Quadratic Programming (QP) controller is designed to
guarantee the convergence to the nominal trajectory under all possible
interaction forces within the tube. Simulation results show this controller's
improved tracking performance with a perturbed force profile compared to other
control methods with less model information.

  Fixed-wing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft pose a unique
control challenge that stems from complex aerodynamic interactions between
wings and rotors. Thus, accurate estimation of external forces is indispensable
for achieving high performance flight. In this paper, we present a composite
adaptive nonlinear tracking controller for a fixed-wing VTOL. The method
employs online adaptation of linear force models, and generates accurate
estimation for wing and rotor forces in real-time based on information from a
three-dimensional airflow sensor. The controller is implemented on a
custom-built fixed-wing VTOL, which shows improved velocity tracking and force
prediction during the transition stage from hover to forward flight, compared
to baseline flight controllers.

Title: CinemAirSim: A Camera-Realistic Robotics Simulator for Cinematographic
  Purposes
Authors: Pablo Pueyo, Eric Cristofalo, Eduardo Montijano, and Mac Schwager
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's) are becoming increasingly popular
in the film and entertainment industries in part because of their
maneuverability and the dynamic shots and perspectives they enable. While there
exists methods for controlling the position and orientation of the drones for
visibility, other artistic elements of the filming process, such as focal blur
and light control, remain unexplored in the robotics community. The lack of
cinemetographic robotics solutions is partly due to the cost associated with
the cameras and devices used in the filming industry, but also because
state-of-the-art photo-realistic robotics simulators only utilize a full
in-focus pinhole camera model which does incorporate these desired artistic
attributes. To overcome this, the main contribution of this work is to endow
the well-known drone simulator, AirSim, with a cinematic camera as well as
extended its API to control all of its parameters in real time, including
various filming lenses and common cinematographic properties. In this paper, we
detail the implementation of our AirSim modification, CinemAirSim, present
examples that illustrate the potential of the new tool, and highlight the new
research opportunities that the use of cinematic cameras can bring to research
in robotics and control. https://github.com/ppueyor/CinematicAirSim

Title: An Experimental Evaluation of Robustness and Precision for Long-term
  LiDAR-based Localization in Highly Changing Environments
Authors: Salvador Dominguez, Ga\"etan Garcia, Vincent Fr\'emont and Arnaud
  Hamon
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  One of the hardest challenges to face in the development of a non GPS-based
localization system for autonomous vehicles is the changes of the environment.
LiDAR-based systems typically try to match the last measurements obtained with
a previously recorded map of the area. If the existing map is not updated along
time, there is a good chance that the measures will not match the environment
well enough, causing the vehicle to lose track of its location. In this paper,
we present and analyze experimental results regarding the robustness and
precision of a map-matching based localization system over a certain period of
time in the following three cases: (1) without any update of the initial map,
(2) updating the map as the vehicle moves and (3) with map updates that take
into account surrounding structures labeled as "fixed" which are treated
differently. The environment of the tests is a busy parking area, which ensures
drastic changes from one day to the next. The precision is obtained by
comparing the positions computed using the map with the ones provided by a
Real-Time Kinematic GPS system. The experimental results reveal a positioning
error of about 6cm which remains stable even after 23 days when using fixed
structures on the working area.

Title: Longitudinal Dynamics Model Identification of an Electric Car Based on
  Real Response Approximation
Authors: Salvador Dominguez, Ga\"etan Garcia, Arnaud Hamon and Vincent
  Fr\'emont
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Obtaining a realistic and accurate model of the longitudinal dynamics is key
for a good speed control of a self-driving car. It is also useful to simulate
the longitudinal behavior of the vehicle with high fidelity. In this paper, a
straightforward and generic method for obtaining the friction, braking and
propulsion forces as a function of speed, throttle input and brake input is
proposed. Experimental data is recorded during tests over the full speed range
to estimate the forces, to which the corresponding curves are adjusted. A
simple and direct balance of forces in the direction tangent to the ground is
used to obtain an estimation of the real forces involved. Then a model composed
of approximate spline curves that fit the results is proposed. Using splines to
model the dynamic response has the advantage of being quick and accurate,
avoiding the complexity of parameter identification and tuning of non-linear
responses embedding the internal functionalities of the car, like ABS or
regenerative brake. This methodology has been applied to LS2N's electric
Renault Zoe but can be applied to any other electric car. As shown in the
experimental section, a comparison between the estimated acceleration of the
car using the model and the real one over a wide range of speeds along a trip
of about $10km/h$ reveals only $0.35m/s^2$ of error standard deviation in a
range of $\pm{2}m/s^2$ which is very encouraging.

Title: Robust Task and Motion Planning for Long-Horizon Architectural
  Construction Planning
Authors: Valentin N. Hartmann, Ozgur S. Oguz, Danny Driess, Marc Toussaint,

Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Integrating robotic systems in architectural and construction processes is of
core interest to increase the efficiency of the building industry. Automated
planning for such systems enables design analysis tools and facilitates faster
design iteration cycles for designers and engineers. However, generic
task-and-motion planning (TAMP) for long-horizon construction processes is
beyond the capabilities of current approaches. In this paper, we develop a
multi-agent TAMP framework for long horizon problems such as constructing a
full-scale building. To this end we extend the Logic-Geometric Programming
framework by sampling-based motion planning,a limited horizon approach, and a
task-specific structural stability optimization that allow an effective
decomposition of the task. We show that our framework is capable of
constructing a large pavilion built from several hundred geometrically unique
building elements from start to end autonomously.

Title: Fast Certification of Collision Probability Bounds with Uncertain Convex
  Obstacles

  Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Submitted to RSS 2020
\\
  To operate reactively in uncertain environments, robots need to be able to
quickly estimate the risk that they will collide with their environment. This
ability is important for both planning (to ensure that plans maintain
acceptable levels of safety) and execution (to provide real-time warnings when
risk exceeds some threshold). Existing methods for estimating this risk are
often limited to models with simplified geometry (e.g. point robots); others
handle complex geometry but are too slow for many applications. In this paper,
we present two algorithms for quickly computing upper bounds on the risk of
collision between a robot and uncertain obstacles by searching for certificate
regions that capture collision probability mass while avoiding the robot. These
algorithms come with strong theoretical guarantees that the true risk does not
exceed the estimated value, support arbitrary geometry via convex
decomposition, and provide fast query times ($<200\mu$s) in representative
scenarios. We characterize the performance of these algorithms in environments
of varying complexity, demonstrating at least an order of magnitude speedup
over existing techniques.

Authors: Charles Dawson (1), Ashkan Jasour (1), Andreas Hofmann (1), Brian
  Williams (1) ((1) Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Submitted to IROS 2020
\\
  Real-world environments are inherently uncertain, and to operate safely in
these environments robots must be able to plan around this uncertainty. In the
context of motion planning, we desire systems that can maintain an acceptable
level of safety as the robot moves, even when the exact locations of nearby
obstacles are not known. In this paper, we solve this chance-constrained motion
planning problem using a sequential convex optimization framework. To constrain
the risk of collision incurred by planned movements, we employ geometric
objects called $\epsilon$-shadows to compute upper bounds on the risk of
collision between the robot and uncertain obstacles. We use these
$\epsilon$-shadow-based estimates as constraints in a nonlinear trajectory
optimization problem, which we then solve by iteratively linearizing the
non-convex risk constraints. This sequential optimization approach quickly
finds trajectories that accomplish the desired motion while maintaining a
user-specified limit on collision risk. Our method can be applied to robots and
environments with arbitrary convex geometry; even in complex environments, it
runs in less than a second and provides provable guarantees on the safety of
planned trajectories, enabling fast, reactive, and safe robot motion in
realistic environments.

\\
  Speaker counting is the task of estimating the number of people that are
simultaneously speaking in an audio recording. For several audio processing
tasks such as speaker diarization, separation, localization and tracking,
knowing the number of speakers at each timestep is a prerequisite, or at least
it can be a strong advantage, in addition to enabling a low latency processing.
For that purpose, we address the speaker counting problem with a multichannel
convolutional recurrent neural network which produces an estimation at a
short-term frame resolution. We trained the network to predict up to 5
concurrent speakers in a multichannel mixture, with simulated data including
many different conditions in terms of source and microphone positions,
reverberation, and noise. The network can predict the number of speakers with
good accuracy at frame resolution.

Title: Lazy Product Discovery in Huge Configuration Spaces

Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Highly-configurable software systems can have thousands of interdependent
configuration options across different subsystems. In the resulting
configuration space, discovering a valid product configuration for some
selected options can be complex and error prone. The configuration space can be
organized using a feature model, fragmented into smaller interdependent feature
models reflecting the configuration options of each subsystem.
  We propose a method for lazy product discovery in large fragmented feature
models with interdependent features. We formalize the method and prove its
soundness and completeness. The evaluation explores an industrial-size
configuration space. The results show that lazy product discovery has
significant performance benefits compared to standard product discovery, which
in contrast to our method requires all fragments to be composed to analyze the
feature model. Furthermore, the method succeeds when more efficient,
heuristics-based engines fail to find a valid configuration.

\\
  The widespread use of positioning devices (e.g., GPS) has given rise to a
vast body of human movement data, often in the form of trajectories.
Understanding human mobility patterns could benefit many location-based
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model called TraLFM
via latent factor modeling to mine human mobility patterns underlying traffic
trajectories. TraLFM is based on three key observations: (1) human mobility
patterns are reflected by the sequences of locations in the trajectories; (2)
human mobility patterns vary with people; and (3) human mobility patterns tend
to be cyclical and change over time. Thus, TraLFM models the joint action of
sequential, personal and temporal factors in a unified way, and brings a new
perspective to many applications such as latent factor analysis and next
location prediction. We perform thorough empirical studies on two real
datasets, and the experimental results confirm that TraLFM outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods significantly in these applications.

  Abstract--- This paper introduces two novel nonlinear stochastic attitude
estimators developed on the Special Orthogonal Group \mathbb{SO}\left(3\right)
with the tracking error of the normalized Euclidean distance meeting predefined
transient and steady-state characteristics. The tracking error is confined to
initially start within a predetermined large set such that the transient
performance is guaranteed to obey dynamically reducing boundaries and decrease
smoothly and asymptotically to the origin in probability from almost any
initial condition. The proposed estimators produce accurate attitude estimates
with remarkable convergence properties using measurements obtained from
low-cost inertial measurement units. The estimators proposed in continuous form
are complemented by their discrete versions for the implementation purposes.
The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the
proposed estimators against uncertain measurements and large initialization
error, whether in continuous or discrete form. Keywods: Attitude estimates,

  Abstract--- Two novel robust nonlinear stochastic full pose (i.e, attitude
and position) estimators on the Special Euclidean Group SE(3) are proposed
using the available uncertain measurements. The resulting estimators utilize
the basic structure of the deterministic pose estimators adopting it to the
stochastic sense. The proposed estimators for six degrees of freedom (DOF) pose
estimations consider the group velocity vectors to be contaminated with
constant bias and Gaussian random noise, unlike nonlinear deterministic pose
estimators which disregard the noise component in the estimator derivations.
The proposed estimators ensure that the closed loop error signals are
semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in mean square. The efficiency and
robustness of the proposed estimators are demonstrated by the numerical results
which test the estimators against high levels of noise and bias associated with
the group velocity and body-frame measurements and large initialization error.

Title: Unifying Theorems for Subspace Identification and Dynamic Mode
  Decomposition
Authors: Sungho Shin, Qiugang Lu, Victor M. Zavala
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC stat.ML
\\
  This paper presents unifying results for subspace identification (SID) and
dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for autonomous dynamical systems. We observe
that SID seeks to solve an optimization problem to estimate an extended
observability matrix and a state sequence that minimizes the prediction error
for the state-space model. Moreover, we observe that DMD seeks to solve a
rank-constrained matrix regression problem that minimizes the prediction error
of an extended autoregressive model. We prove that existence conditions for
perfect (error-free) state-space and low-rank extended autoregressive models
are equivalent and that the SID and DMD optimization problems are equivalent.
We exploit these results to propose a SID-DMD algorithm that delivers a
provably optimal model and that is easy to implement. We demonstrate our
developments using a case study that aims to build dynamical models directly
from video data.

Title: Implications of Stahl's Theorems to Holomorphic Embedding Pt. 2:
  Numerical Convergence
Authors: Abhinav Dronamraju, Songyan Li, Qirui Li, Yuting Li, Daniel Tylavsky,

\\
  What has become known as Stahl's Theorem in power-engineering circles has
been used to justify a convergence guarantee of the Holomorphic Embedding
Method (HEM) as it applies to the power-flow problem. In this, the second part
of a two-part paper, we examine implications to numerical convergence of HEM
and the numerical properties of a Pad\'e approximant algorithm. We show that
even if the convergence domain is identical to the function's domain, numerical
convergence of the sequence of Pad\'e approximants computed with finite
precision is not guaranteed. We also show that the study of convergence
properties of the Pad\'e approximant is the study of the location of
branch-points of the function, which dictate branch-cut topology and capacity
and, therefore, convergence rate. We show how poorly chosen embeddings can
prevent numerical convergence.

Title: Sparse Identification for Non-linear Dynamics applied to
  hysteresis-controlled systems
Authors: Arne Fey, Gregor Thiele, J\"org Kr\"uger
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Hysteresis-controlled devices are widely used in industrial applications. For
example, cooling devices usually contain a two-point controller, resulting in a
nonlinear hybrid system with two discrete states. Behavior models of dynamic
systems are essential for optimizing such industrial supply technology.
However, conventional system identification approaches cannot handle
hysteresis-controlled devices. Thus, a new identification method called Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is extended to handle hybrid
systems. In this new method (SINDyHyrid), tailored basis functions in form of
relay hysterons are added to the library which is used by SINDy. Experiments
with a hysteresis controlled water basin show that this approach correctly
identifies state transitions of hybrid systems and also succeeds in modeling
the dynamics of the discrete system states. A novel proximity hysteron gains
the robustness of this method. The impacts of the sampling rate and the signal
noise ration of the measurement data are examined accordingly.

Title: A Framework for Distributed and Compositional Stability Analysis of
  Power Grids
Authors: Stefanos Baros, Andrey Bernstein and Nikos Hatziargyriou
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Operating modern power grids with stability guarantees is admittedly
imperative. Classic stability methods are not well-suited for these dynamic
systems as they involve centralized gathering of information and computation of
the system's eigenvalues, processes which are oftentimes not privacy-preserving
and computationally burdensome. System operators (SOs) would nowadays have to
be able to quickly and efficiently assess small-signal stability as the power
grid operating conditions change more dynamically while also respect the
privacy of the distributed energy resources (DERs). Motivated by all these, in
this paper we introduce a framework that comprises a computationally efficient,
privacy-preserving, distributed and compositional stability assessment method.
Our proposed method first calls for representative agents at various buses to
exchange information with their neighbors and design their local controls in
order to meet some local stability conditions. Following that, the agents are
required to notify the SO whether their local conditions are satisfied or not.
In case the agents cannot verify their local conditions they can augment their
local controls using a global control input. The SO can then warrant stability
of the interconnected power grid by assembling the local stability guarantees,
established by the agents, in a compositional manner. We analytically derive
the local stability conditions and prove that when they are collectively
satisfied stability of the interconnected system ensues. We illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DSA method via a numerical example centered
around a three-bus power grid.

Title: Implications of Stahl's Theorems to Holomorphic Embedding Pt. 1:
  Theoretical Convergence
Authors: Songyan Li, Daniel Tylavsky, Di Shi, Zhiwei Wang
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  What has become known as Stahl's Theorem in power engineering circles has
been used to justify a convergence guarantee of the Holormorphic Embedding
Method (HEM) as it applies to the power flow (PF) problem. In this two-part
paper, we examine in more detail the implications of Stahl's theorems to both
theoretcial and numerical convergence for a wider range of problems to which
these theorems are now being applied. In Pt. 1, we introduce the theorem using
the necessary mathematical parlance and then translate the language to show its
implications to convergence of nonlinear problems in general and the PF problem
specifically. We show that among other possibilities the existence of the
Chebotarev points, which are embedding specific, are a possible theoretical
impediment to convergence. Numerical impediments to convergences are discussed
in the companion paper.

Title: Software Design and Development of Attitude Determination and Control
  Subsystem for SSS-1P
Authors: Amir Hossein Alikhah Mishamandani
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Report-no: 10006LS1725241
\\
  The Attitude Determination and Control System is one of the critical boards
of any satellite, specially the micro-satellites. The ADCS is the bridge
linking sensors data to actuators by several computationally complex algorithms
such as Extended Kalman Filter, Detumbling and Tumbling controller and so on.
In this thesis, I will focus on the implementation of each of the required
algorithms and then make a whole integrated package. This thesis focuses on
developing the first version of the on-board computer software for ADCS of
SSS-1P and required preliminary tests to assure the minimum performance of the
provided package with Software-In-the-Loop and Processor-In-the-Loop tests. In
this thesis, I will introduce the fundamental dynamic and kinematic non-linear
equations. The linearization for a specific prerational condition and the
assumptions to achieve the linearization will be introduced. The model will be
linearized for a specific operating condition for the design and development of
the controllers. The disturbances including atmospheric drag, solar radiation
and so on are also introduced with regarding to the operating Altitude (500 ~
600 km). The brief introduction of different magnetic field models and their
differences will be introduced as well. In addition, the SGP4 predictive model
to estimate the position and the velocity of the satellite discussed. In
addition, the thesis describes the software development phase, some additional
algorithms that I implemented but they are not a part of mathematical models,
such as system manager, time manager and so on with pseudo code. The
architecture of the software is also described in this section. Finally, the
numerical simulations are analysed and the simple compression between tests
results from PIL, SIL, and MATLAB simulation are presented. This section will
presents the validation and the trustworthy of the final package.

Title: Sparse Resource Allocation for Control of Spreading Processes via Convex
  Optimization
Authors: Vera L. J. Somers and Ian R. Manchester
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.DS math.OC
Comments: 6 pages, conference submission
\\
  In this letter we propose a method for sparse allocation of resources to
control spreading processes -- such as epidemics and wildfires -- using convex
optimization, in particular exponential cone programming. Sparsity of
allocation has advantages in situations where resources cannot easily be
distributed over a large area. In addition, we introduce a model of risk to
optimize the product of the likelihood and the future impact of an outbreak. We
demonstrate with a simplified wildfire example that our method can provide more
targeted resource allocation compared to previous approaches based on geometric
programming.

Title: Nonlinear system identification with regularized Tensor Network
  B-splines
Authors: Ridvan Karagoz, Kim Batselier
Categories: eess.SY cs.LG cs.NA cs.SY math.NA
\\
  This article introduces the Tensor Network B-spline model for the regularized
identification of nonlinear systems using a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous
(NARX) approach. Tensor network theory is used to alleviate the curse of
dimensionality of multivariate B-splines by representing the high-dimensional
weight tensor as a low-rank approximation. An iterative algorithm based on the
alternating linear scheme is developed to directly estimate the low-rank tensor
network approximation, removing the need to ever explicitly construct the
exponentially large weight tensor. This reduces the computational and storage
complexity significantly, allowing the identification of NARX systems with a
large number of inputs and lags. The proposed algorithm is numerically stable,
robust to noise, guaranteed to monotonically converge, and allows the
straightforward incorporation of regularization. The TNBS-NARX model is
validated through the identification of the cascaded watertank benchmark
nonlinear system, on which it achieves state-of-the-art performance while
identifying a 16-dimensional B-spline surface in 4 seconds on a standard
desktop computer. An open-source MATLAB implementation is available on GitHub.

Title: Scalable Traffic Models for Scheduling of Linear Periodic
  Event-Triggered Controllers
Authors: Gabriel de Albuquerque Gleizer and Manuel Mazo Jr
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Accepted at the 21st IFAC World Congress (IFAC 2020)
\\
  This paper addresses the problem of modeling and scheduling the transmissions
generated by multiple event-triggered control (ETC) loops sharing a network. We
present a method to build a symbolic traffic model of periodic ETC (PETC),
which by construction provides an exact simulation of such traffic. The model
is made in such a way as to avoid the combinatorial explosion that is typical
of symbolic models in many applications. It is augmented with early triggering
actions that can be used by a scheduler to mitigate communication conflicts.
The complete networked control system is then modeled as a network of timed
game automata, for which existing tools can generate a strategy that avoids
communication conflicts, while keeping early triggers to a minimum. By
construction, our proposed symbolic model is a quotient model of the PETC. It
is relatively fast to build, and it generates few to no spurious transitions.
We finally demonstrate modeling and scheduling for a numerical example.

Title: $N-1$ Reliability Makes It Difficult for False Data Injection Attacks to
  Cause Physical Consequences
Authors: Zhigang Chu, Jiazi Zhang, Oliver Kosut, Lalitha Sankar
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with
  arXiv:1903.07781
\\
  This paper demonstrates that false data injection (FDI) attacks are extremely
limited in their ability to cause physical consequences on $N-1$ reliable power
systems operating with real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) and security
constrained economic dispatch (SCED). Prior work has shown that FDI attacks can
be designed via an attacker-defender bi-level linear program (ADBLP) to cause
physical overflows after re-dispatch using DCOPF. In this paper, it is shown
that attacks designed using DCOPF fail to cause overflows on $N-1$ reliable
systems because the system response modeled is inaccurate. An ADBLP that
accurately models the system response is proposed to find the worst-case
physical consequences, thereby modeling a strong attacker with system level
knowledge. Simulation results on the synthetic Texas system with 2000 buses
show that even with the new enhanced attacks, for systems operated
conservatively due to $N-1$ constraints, the designed attacks only lead to
post-contingency overflows. Moreover, the attacker must control a large portion
of measurements and physically create a contingency in the system to cause
consequences. Therefore, it is conceivable but requires an extremely
sophisticated attacker to cause physical consequences on $N-1$ reliable power
systems operated with RTCA and SCED.

  We present a new approach to automated scenario-based testing of the safety
of autonomous vehicles, especially those using advanced artificial
intelligence-based components, spanning both simulation-based evaluation as
well as testing in the real world. Our approach is based on formal methods,
combining formal specification of scenarios and safety properties, algorithmic
test case generation using formal simulation, test case selection for track
testing, executing test cases on the track, and analyzing the resulting data.
Experiments with a real autonomous vehicle at an industrial testing ground
support our hypotheses that (i) formal simulation can be effective at
identifying test cases to run on the track, and (ii) the gap between simulated
and real worlds can be systematically evaluated and bridged.

Title: Control Barrier Function based Quadratic Programs Introduce Undesirable
  Asymptotically Stable Equilibria
Authors: Matheus F. Reis, A. Pedro Aguiar and Paulo Tabuada
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the 59th Conference on Decision and
  Control
\\
  Control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs) have
been used to develop provably safe controllers by means of quadratic programs
(QPs), guaranteeing safety in the form of trajectory invariance with respect to
a given set. In this manuscript, we show that this framework can introduce
equilibrium points (particularly at the boundary of the unsafe set) other than
the minimum of the Lyapunov function into the closed-loop system. We derive
explicit conditions under which these undesired equilibria (which can even
appear in the simple case of linear systems with just one convex unsafe set)
are asymptotically stable. To address this issue, we propose an extension to
the QP-based controller unifying CLFs and CBFs that explicitly avoids
undesirable equilibria on the boundary of the safe set. The solution is
illustrated in the design of a collision-free controller.

Title: High-Accuracy and Low-Latency Speech Recognition with Two-Head
  Contextual Layer Trajectory LSTM Model
Authors: Jinyu Li, Rui Zhao, Eric Sun, Jeremy H. M. Wong, Amit Das, Zhong Meng,

Categories: eess.AS cs.CL cs.SD
Comments: Accepted by ICASSP 2020
\\
  While the community keeps promoting end-to-end models over conventional
hybrid models, which usually are long short-term memory (LSTM) models trained
with a cross entropy criterion followed by a sequence discriminative training
criterion, we argue that such conventional hybrid models can still be
significantly improved. In this paper, we detail our recent efforts to improve
conventional hybrid LSTM acoustic models for high-accuracy and low-latency
automatic speech recognition. To achieve high accuracy, we use a contextual
layer trajectory LSTM (cltLSTM), which decouples the temporal modeling and
target classification tasks, and incorporates future context frames to get more
information for accurate acoustic modeling. We further improve the training
strategy with sequence-level teacher-student learning. To obtain low latency,
we design a two-head cltLSTM, in which one head has zero latency and the other
head has a small latency, compared to an LSTM. When trained with Microsoft's 65
thousand hours of anonymized training data and evaluated with test sets with
1.8 million words, the proposed two-head cltLSTM model with the proposed
training strategy yields a 28.2\% relative WER reduction over the conventional
LSTM acoustic model, with a similar perceived latency.

\\
  This paper proposes and evaluates the hybrid autoregressive transducer (HAT)
model, a time-synchronous encoderdecoder model that preserves the modularity of
conventional automatic speech recognition systems. The HAT model provides a way
to measure the quality of the internal language model that can be used to
decide whether inference with an external language model is beneficial or not.
This article also presents a finite context version of the HAT model that
addresses the exposure bias problem and significantly simplifies the overall
training and inference. We evaluate our proposed model on a large-scale voice
search task. Our experiments show significant improvements in WER compared to
the state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: Comment on "Quantum key agreement protocol"
Authors: Nayana Das and Ritajit Majumdar
Categories: quant-ph cs.CR
Comments: 5 pages, single column
\\
  The first two party Quantum Key Agreement (QKA) protocol, based on quantum
teleportation, was proposed by Zhou et al. (Electronics Letters 40.18 (2004):
1149-1150). In this protocol, to obtain the key bit string, one of the parties
use a device to obtain inner product of two quantum states, one being unknown,
and the other one performs Bell measurement. However, in this article, we show
that it is not possible to obtain a device that would output the inner product
of two qubits even when only one of the qubit is unknown. This is so because
existence of such device would imply perfectly distinguishing among four
different states in a two-dimensional vector space. This is not permissible in
quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we argue that existence of such a device would
also imply violation of the ``No Signalling Theorem" as well. Finally, we also
comment that this protocol is not a valid key agreement protocol at all.

Title: Deep generative models in DataSHIELD
Authors: Stefan Lenz, Harald Binder
Categories: stat.ML cs.CR cs.LG
Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures
\\
  The best way to calculate statistics from medical data is to use the data of
individual patients. In some settings, this data is difficult to obtain due to
privacy restrictions. In Germany, for example, it is not possible to pool
routine data from different hospitals for research purposes without the consent
of the patients. The DataSHIELD software provides an infrastructure and a set
of statistical methods for joint analyses of distributed data. The contained
algorithms are reformulated to work with aggregated data from the participating
sites instead of the individual data. If a desired algorithm is not implemented
in DataSHIELD or cannot be reformulated in such a way, using artificial data is
an alternative. We present a methodology together with a software
implementation that builds on DataSHIELD to create artificial data that
preserve complex patterns from distributed individual patient data. Such data
sets of artificial patients, which are not linked to real patients, can then be
used for joint analyses. We use deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) as generative
models for capturing the distribution of data. For the implementation, we
employ the package "BoltzmannMachines" from the Julia programming language and
wrap it for use with DataSHIELD, which is based on R. As an exemplary
application, we conduct a distributed analysis with DBMs on a synthetic data
set, which simulates genetic variant data. Patterns from the original data can
be recovered in the artificial data using hierarchical clustering of the
virtual patients, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach. Our
implementation adds to DataSHIELD the ability to generate artificial data that
can be used for various analyses, e. g. for pattern recognition with deep
learning. This also demonstrates more generally how DataSHIELD can be flexibly
extended with advanced algorithms from languages other than R.

Title: Fully reversible neural networks for large-scale surface and sub-surface
  characterization via remote sensing
Authors: Bas Peters, Eldad Haber, Keegan Lensink
Categories: physics.geo-ph cs.CV eess.IV
MSC-class: 68T45
ACM-class: I.4.6
\\
  The large spatial/frequency scale of hyperspectral and airborne magnetic and
gravitational data causes memory issues when using convolutional neural
networks for (sub-) surface characterization. Recently developed fully
reversible networks can mostly avoid memory limitations by virtue of having a
low and fixed memory requirement for storing network states, as opposed to the
typical linear memory growth with depth. Fully reversible networks enable the
training of deep neural networks that take in entire data volumes, and create
semantic segmentations in one go. This approach avoids the need to work in
small patches or map a data patch to the class of just the central pixel. The
cross-entropy loss function requires small modifications to work in conjunction
with a fully reversible network and learn from sparsely sampled labels without
ever seeing fully labeled ground truth. We show examples from land-use change
detection from hyperspectral time-lapse data, and regional aquifer mapping from
airborne geophysical and geological data.

Title: Synthesis of Brain Tumor MR Images for Learning Data Augmentation
Authors: Sunho Kim, Byungjai Kim, HyunWook Park
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Medical image analysis using deep neural networks has been actively studied.
Deep neural networks are trained by learning data. For accurate training of
deep neural networks, the learning data should be sufficient, of good quality,
and should have a generalized property. However, in medical images, it is
difficult to acquire sufficient patient data because of the difficulty of
patient recruitment, the burden of annotation of lesions by experts, and the
invasion of patients' privacy. In comparison, the medical images of healthy
volunteers can be easily acquired. Using healthy brain images, the proposed
method synthesizes multi-contrast magnetic resonance images of brain tumors.
Because tumors have complex features, the proposed method simplifies them into
concentric circles that are easily controllable. Then it converts the
concentric circles into various realistic shapes of tumors through deep neural
networks. Because numerous healthy brain images are easily available, our
method can synthesize a huge number of the brain tumor images with various
concentric circles. We performed qualitative and quantitative analysis to
assess the usefulness of augmented data from the proposed method. Intuitive and
interesting experimental results are available online at

\\
  Cytology is the branch of pathology which deals with the microscopic
examination of cells for diagnosis of carcinoma or inflammatory conditions.
Automation in cytology started in the early 1950s with the aim to reduce manual
efforts in diagnosis of cancer. The inflush of intelligent technological units
with high computational power and improved specimen collection techniques
helped to achieve its technological heights. In the present survey, we focus on
such image processing techniques which put steps forward towards the automation
of cytology. We take a short tour to 17 types of cytology and explore various
segmentation and/or classification techniques which evolved during last three
decades boosting the concept of automation in cytology. It is observed, that
most of the works are aligned towards three types of cytology: Cervical, Breast
and Lung, which are discussed elaborately in this paper. The user-end systems
developed during that period are summarized to comprehend the overall growth in
the respective domains. To be precise, we discuss the diversity of the
state-of-the-art methodologies, their challenges to provide prolific and
competent future research directions inbringing the cytology-based commercial
systems into the mainstream.

  Tactile sensing or fabric hand plays a critical role in an individual's
decision to buy a certain fabric from the range of available fabrics for a
desired application. Therefore, textile and clothing manufacturers have long
been in search of an objective method for assessing fabric hand, which can then
be used to engineer fabrics with a desired hand. Recognizing textures and
materials in real-world images has played an important role in object
recognition and scene understanding. In this paper, we explore how to
computationally characterize apparent or latent properties (e.g., surface
smoothness) of materials, i.e., computational material surface
characterization, which moves a step further beyond material recognition. We
formulate the problem as a very fine-grained texture classification problem,
and study how deep learning-based texture representation techniques can help
tackle the task. We introduce a new, large-scale challenging microscopic
material surface dataset (CoMMonS), geared towards an automated fabric quality
assessment mechanism in an intelligent manufacturing system. We then conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods for
texture classification using CoMMonS. Additionally, we propose a multi-level
texture encoding and representation network (MuLTER), which simultaneously
leverages low- and high-level features to maintain both texture details and
spatial information in the texture representation. Our results show that, in
comparison with the state-of-the-art deep texture descriptors, MuLTER yields
higher accuracy not only on our CoMMonS dataset for material characterization,
but also on established datasets such as MINC-2500 and GTOS-mobile for material
recognition.

  The availability of large-scale datasets has helped unleash the true
potential of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, for the
single-image denoising problem, capturing a real dataset is an unacceptably
expensive and cumbersome procedure. Consequently, image denoising algorithms
are mostly developed and evaluated on synthetic data that is usually generated
with a widespread assumption of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). While the
CNNs achieve impressive results on these synthetic datasets, they do not
perform well when applied on real camera images, as reported in recent
benchmark datasets. This is mainly because the AWGN is not adequate for
modeling the real camera noise which is signal-dependent and heavily
transformed by the camera imaging pipeline. In this paper, we present a
framework that models camera imaging pipeline in forward and reverse
directions. It allows us to produce any number of realistic image pairs for
denoising both in RAW and sRGB spaces. By training a new image denoising
network on realistic synthetic data, we achieve the state-of-the-art
performance on real camera benchmark datasets. The parameters in our model are
~5 times lesser than the previous best method for RAW denoising. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the proposed framework generalizes beyond image denoising
problem e.g., for color matching in stereoscopic cinema. The source code and
pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/swz30/CycleISP.

Title: A novel Deep Structure U-Net for Sea-Land Segmentation in Remote Sensing
  Images

\\
  Sea-land segmentation is an important process for many key applications in
remote sensing. Proper operative sea-land segmentation for remote sensing
images remains a challenging issue due to complex and diverse transition
between sea and lands. Although several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
have been developed for sea-land segmentation, the performance of these CNNs is
far from the expected target. This paper presents a novel deep neural network
structure for pixel-wise sea-land segmentation, a Residual Dense U-Net
(RDU-Net), in complex and high-density remote sensing images. RDU-Net is a
combination of both down-sampling and up-sampling paths to achieve satisfactory
results. In each down- and up-sampling path, in addition to the convolution
layers, several densely connected residual network blocks are proposed to
systematically aggregate multi-scale contextual information. Each dense network
block contains multilevel convolution layers, short-range connections and an
identity mapping connection which facilitates features re-use in the network
and makes full use of the hierarchical features from the original images. These
proposed blocks have a certain number of connections that are designed with
shorter distance backpropagation between the layers and can significantly
improve segmentation results whilst minimizing computational costs. We have
performed extensive experiments on two real datasets Google Earth and ISPRS and
compare the proposed RDUNet against several variations of Dense Networks. The
experimental results show that RDUNet outperforms the other state-of-the-art
approaches on the sea-land segmentation tasks.

Title: DistNet: Deep Tracking by displacement regression: application to
  bacteria growing in the Mother Machine

\\
  The mother machine is a popular microfluidic device that allows long-term
time-lapse imaging of thousands of cells in parallel by microscopy. It has
become a valuable tool for single-cell level quantitative analysis and
characterization of many cellular processes such as gene expression and
regulation, mutagenesis or response to antibiotics. The automated and
quantitative analysis of the massive amount of data generated by such
experiments is now the limiting step. In particular the segmentation and
tracking of bacteria cells imaged in phase-contrast microscopy---with error
rates compatible with high-throughput data---is a challenging problem.
  In this work, we describe a novel formulation of the multi-object tracking
problem, in which tracking is performed by a regression of the bacteria's
displacement, allowing simultaneous tracking of multiple bacteria, despite
their growth and division over time. Our method performs jointly segmentation
and tracking, leveraging sequential information to increase segmentation
accuracy.
  We introduce a Deep Neural Network architecture taking advantage of a
self-attention mechanism which yields less than 0.005% tracking error rate and
less than 0.03% segmentation error rate. We demonstrate superior performance
and speed compared to state-of-the-art methods.
  While this method is particularly well suited for mother machine microscopy
data, its general joint tracking and segmentation formulation could be applied
to many other problems with different geometries.

  We propose a virtual staining methodology based on Generative Adversarial
Networks to map histopathology images of breast cancer tissue from H&E stain to
PHH3 and vice versa. We use the resulting synthetic images to build
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for automatic detection of mitotic figures,
a strong prognostic biomarker used in routine breast cancer diagnosis and
grading. We propose several scenarios, in which CNN trained with synthetically
generated histopathology images perform on par with or even better than the
same baseline model trained with real images. We discuss the potential of this
application to scale the number of training samples without the need for manual

Title: SAR Tomography at the Limit: Building Height Reconstruction Using Only
  3-5 TanDEM-X Bistatic Interferograms
Authors: Yilei Shi, Richard Bamler, Yuanyuan Wang, Xiao Xiang Zhu
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Multi-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques
are effective approaches for retrieving the 3-D information of urban areas. In
order to obtain a plausible reconstruction, it is necessary to use more than
twenty interferograms. Hence, these methods are commonly not appropriate for
large-scale 3-D urban mapping using TanDEM-X data where only a few acquisitions
are available in average for each city. This work proposes a new SAR
tomographic processing framework to work with those extremely small stacks,
which integrates the non-local filtering into SAR tomography inversion. The
applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated using a TanDEM-X multi-baseline
stack with 5 bistatic interferograms over the whole city of Munich, Germany.
Systematic comparison of our result with TanDEM-X raw digital elevation models
(DEM) and airborne LiDAR data shows that the relative height accuracy of two
third buildings is within two meters, which outperforms the TanDEM-X raw DEM.
The promising performance of the proposed algorithm paved the first step
towards high quality large-scale 3-D urban mapping.

\\
  Fair inference in supervised learning is an important and active area of
research, yielding a range of useful methods to assess and account for fairness
criteria when predicting ground truth targets. As shown in recent work,
however, when target labels are error-prone, potential prediction unfairness
can arise from measurement error. In this paper, we show that, when an
error-prone proxy target is used, existing methods to assess and calibrate
fairness criteria do not extend to the true target variable of interest. To
remedy this problem, we suggest a framework resulting from the combination of
two existing literatures: fair ML methods, such as those found in the
counterfactual fairness literature on the one hand, and, on the other,
measurement models found in the statistical literature. We discuss these
approaches and their connection resulting in our framework. In a healthcare
decision problem, we find that using a latent variable model to account for
measurement error removes the unfairness detected previously.

  As data mining research and applications continue to expand in to a variety
of fields such as medicine, finance, security, etc., the need for talented and
diverse individuals is clearly felt. This is particularly the case as Big Data
initiatives have taken off in the federal, private and academic sectors,
providing a wealth of opportunities, nationally and internationally. The
Broadening Participation in Data Mining (BPDM) workshop was created more than 7
years ago with the goal of fostering mentorship, guidance, and connections for
minority and underrepresented groups in the data science and machine learning
community, while also enriching technical aptitude and exposure for a group of
talented students. To date it has impacted the lives of more than 330
underrepresented trainees in data science. We provide a venue to connect
talented students with innovative researchers in industry, academia,
professional societies, and government. Our mission is to facilitate
meaningful, lasting relationships between BPDM participants to ultimately
increase diversity in data mining. This most recent workshop took place at
Howard University in Washington, DC in February 2019. Here we report on the
mentoring strategies that we undertook at the 2019 BPDM and how those were

Title: Traffic Signal Optimization on a Square Lattice using the D-Wave Quantum

Categories: math.OC cs.ET quant-ph
Comments: This paper has not yet undergone peer review, the findings are
  provisional and the conclusions may change
\\
  The spread of intelligent transportation systems in urban cities has caused
heavy computational loads, requiring a novel architecture for managing
large-scale traffic. In this study, we develop a method for globally
controlling traffic signals arranged on a square lattice by means of a quantum
annealing machine, namely the D-Wave quantum annealer. We first formulate a
signal optimization problem that minimizes the imbalance of traffic flows in
two orthogonal directions. Then we reformulate this problem as an Ising
Hamiltonian, which is fully compatible with quantum annealers. The new control
method is compared with a conventional local control method for a large
50-by-50 city, and the results exhibit the superiority of our global control
method in suppressing traffic imbalance over wide parameter ranges.
Furthermore, the solutions to the global control method obtained with the
quantum annealing machine are better than those obtained with conventional
simulated annealing. In addition, we prove analytically that the local and the
global control methods converge at the limit where cars have equal
probabilities for turning and going straight. These results are verified with
numerical experiments.

Title: Sequential and Incremental Precoder Design for Joint Transmission
  Network MIMO Systems with Imperfect Backhaul
Authors: Ming Ding, Jun Zou, Zeng Yang, Hanwen Luo, and Wen Chen
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: TVT
\\
  In this paper, we propose a sequential and incremental precoder design for
downlink joint transmission (JT) network MIMO systems with imperfect backhaul
links. The objective of our design is to minimize the maximum of the sub-stream
mean square errors (MSE), which dominates the average bit error rate (BER)
performance of the system. In the proposed scheme,we first optimize the
precoder at the serving base station (BS), and then sequentially optimize the
precoders of non-serving BSs in the JT set according to the descending order of
their probabilities of participating in JT. The BS-wise sequential optimization
process can improve the system performance when some BSs have to temporarily
quit the JT operations because of poor instant backhaul conditions. Besides,
the precoder of an additional BS is derived in an incremental way, i.e., the
sequentially optimized precoders of previous BSs are fixed, thus the additional
precoder plays an incremental part in the multi-BS JT operations. An iterative
algorithm is designed to jointly optimize the sub-stream precoder and
sub-stream power allocation for each additional BS in the proposed sequential
and incremental optimization scheme. Simulations show that, under the practical
backhaul link conditions, our scheme significantly outperforms the autonomous
global precoding (AGP) scheme in terms of BER performance.

Title: Leakage-Based Robust Beamforming for Multi-Antenna Broadcast System with
  Per-Antenna Power Constraints and Quantized CDI
Authors: Ming Ding, Meng Zhang, Hanwen Luo, and Wen Chen
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the robust beamforming schemes for a multi-user
multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system with per-antenna power
constraints and quantized channel direction information (CDI) feedback. Our
design objective is to maximize the expectation of the weighted sum-rate
performance by means of controlling the interference leakage and properly
allocating the power among user equipments (UEs).First, we prove the optimality
of the non-robust zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming scheme in the sense of
generating the minimum amount of average inter-UE interference under quantized
CDI. Then we derive closed-form expressions of the cumulative density function
(CDF) of the interference leakage power for the non-robust ZF beamforming
scheme, based on which we adjust the leakage thresholds and propose two robust
beamforming schemes under per-antenna power constraints with an iterative
process to update the per-UE power allocations using the geometric programming
(GP). Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed robust
beamforming schemes compared with the existing schemes in terms of the average
weighted sum-rate performance.

adding each additional antenna pair. Based on this result, we iteratively
select the antenna-pairs at the relay nodes to minimize the MSE. Simulation
results show that our algorithm greatly outperforms the existing schemes.

Title: Simultaneous Navigation and Radio Mapping for Cellular-Connected UAV
  with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yong Zeng, Xiaoli Xu, Shi Jin, Rui Zhang
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
\\
  Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising technology to
unlock the full potential of UAVs in the future. However, how to achieve
ubiquitous three-dimensional (3D) communication coverage for the UAVs in the
sky is a new challenge. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by a new
coverage-aware navigation approach, which exploits the UAV's controllable
mobility to design its navigation/trajectory to avoid the cellular BSs'
coverage holes while accomplishing their missions. We formulate an UAV
trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of its mission
completion time and expected communication outage duration, and propose a new
solution approach based on the technique of deep reinforcement learning (DRL).
To further improve the performance, we propose a new framework called
simultaneous navigation and radio mapping (SNARM), where the UAV's signal
measurement is used not only for training the deep Q network (DQN) directly,
but also to create a radio map that is able to predict the outage probabilities
at all locations in the area of interest. This thus enables the generation of
simulated UAV trajectories and predicting their expected returns, which are
then used to further train the DQN via Dyna technique, thus greatly improving
the learning efficiency.

Title: Context-dependent self-exciting point processes: models, methods, and
  risk bounds in high dimensions
Authors: Lili Zheng, Garvesh Raskutti, Rebecca Willett, Benjamin Mark
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.AP stat.ME
\\
  High-dimensional autoregressive point processes model how current events
trigger or inhibit future events, such as activity by one member of a social
network can affect the future activity of his or her neighbors. While past work
has focused on estimating the underlying network structure based solely on the
times at which events occur on each node of the network, this paper examines
the more nuanced problem of estimating context-dependent networks that reflect
how features associated with an event (such as the content of a social media
post) modulate the strength of influences among nodes. Specifically, we
leverage ideas from compositional time series and regularization methods in
machine learning to conduct network estimation for high-dimensional marked
point processes. Two models and corresponding estimators are considered in
detail: an autoregressive multinomial model suited to categorical marks and a
logistic-normal model suited to marks with mixed membership in different
categories. Importantly, the logistic-normal model leads to a convex negative
log-likelihood objective and captures dependence across categories. We provide
theoretical guarantees for both estimators, which we validate by simulations
and a synthetic data-generating model. We further validate our methods through
two real data examples and demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of both
approaches.

Title: u-net CNN based fourier ptychography

Categories: eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Fourier ptychography is a recently explored imaging method for overcoming the
diffraction limit of conventional cameras with applications in microscopy and
yielding high-resolution images. In order to splice together low-resolution
images taken under different illumination angles of coherent light source, an
iterative phase retrieval algorithm is adopted. However, the reconstruction
procedure is slow and needs a good many of overlap in the Fourier domain for
the continuous recorded low-resolution images and is also worse under system
aberrations such as noise or random update sequence. In this paper, we propose
a new retrieval algorithm that is based on convolutional neural networks. Once
well trained, our model can perform high-quality reconstruction rapidly by
using the graphics processing unit. The experiments demonstrate that our model
achieves better reconstruction results and is more robust under system
aberrations.

  Singlet fission has emerged as one of the most exciting phenomena known to
improve the efficiencies of different types of solar cells and has found uses
in diverse optoelectronic applications. The range of available singlet fission
molecules is, however, limited as to undergo singlet fission, molecules have to
satisfy certain energy conditions. Recent advances in material search using
inverse design has enabled the prediction of materials for a wide range of
applications and has emerged as one of the most efficient methods in the
discovery of suitable materials. It is particularly helpful in manipulating
large datasets, uncovering hidden information from the molecular dataset and
generating new structures. However, we seldom encounter large datasets in
structure prediction problems in material science. In our work, we put forward
inverse design of possible singlet fission molecules using a transfer learning
based approach where we make use of a much larger ChEMBL dataset of
structurally similar molecules to transfer the learned characteristics to the
singlet fission dataset.

Title: ASR Error Correction and Domain Adaptation Using Machine Translation

\\
  Off-the-shelf pre-trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are an
increasingly viable service for companies of any size building speech-based
products. While these ASR systems are trained on large amounts of data, domain
mismatch is still an issue for many such parties that want to use this service
as-is leading to not so optimal results for their task. We propose a simple
technique to perform domain adaptation for ASR error correction via machine
translation. The machine translation model is a strong candidate to learn a
mapping from out-of-domain ASR errors to in-domain terms in the corresponding
reference files. We use two off-the-shelf ASR systems in this work: Google ASR
(commercial) and the ASPIRE model (open-source). We observe 7% absolute
improvement in word error rate and 4 point absolute improvement in BLEU score
in Google ASR output via our proposed method. We also evaluate ASR error
correction via a downstream task of Speaker Diarization that captures speaker
style, syntax, structure and semantic improvements we obtain via ASR
correction.

Title: Audio inpainting with generative adversarial network
Authors: P. P. Ebner and A. Eltelt
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML
\\
  We study the ability of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to
generate missing audio content which is, in context, (statistically similar) to
the sound and the neighboring borders. We deal with the challenge of audio
inpainting long range gaps (500 ms) using WGAN models. We improved the quality
of the inpainting part using a new proposed WGAN architecture that uses a
short-range and a long-range neighboring borders compared to the classical WGAN
model. The performance was compared with two different audio instruments (piano
and guitar) and on virtuoso pianists together with a string orchestra. The
objective difference grading (ODG) was used to evaluate the performance of both
architectures. The proposed model outperforms the classical WGAN model and
improves the reconstruction of high-frequency content. Further, we got better
results for instruments where the frequency spectrum is mainly in the lower
range where small noises are less annoying for human ear and the inpainting
part is more perceptible. Finally, we could show that better test results for
audio dataset were reached where a particular instrument is accompanist by
other instruments if we train the network only on this particular instrument
neglecting the other instruments.

Title: The Implicit Regularization of Stochastic Gradient Flow for Least
  Squares
Authors: Alnur Ali, Edgar Dobriban, and Ryan J. Tibshirani
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.OC
\\
  We study the implicit regularization of mini-batch stochastic gradient
descent, when applied to the fundamental problem of least squares regression.
We leverage a continuous-time stochastic differential equation having the same
moments as stochastic gradient descent, which we call stochastic gradient flow.
We give a bound on the excess risk of stochastic gradient flow at time $t$,
over ridge regression with tuning parameter $\lambda = 1/t$. The bound may be
computed from explicit constants (e.g., the mini-batch size, step size, number
of iterations), revealing precisely how these quantities drive the excess risk.
Numerical examples show the bound can be small, indicating a tight relationship
between the two estimators. We give a similar result relating the coefficients
of stochastic gradient flow and ridge. These results hold under no conditions
on the data matrix $X$, and across the entire optimization path (not just at
convergence).

Title: Deep Attention Fusion Feature for Speech Separation with End-to-End
  Post-filter Method
Authors: Cunhang Fan and Jianhua Tao and Bin Liu and Jiangyan Yi and Zhengqi
  Wen and Xuefei Liu
Categories: eess.AS cs.MM cs.SD
Comments: ACCEPTED by IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language
  Processing (TASLP)
\\
  In this paper, we propose an end-to-end post-filter method with deep
attention fusion features for monaural speaker-independent speech separation.
At first, a time-frequency domain speech separation method is applied as the
pre-separation stage. The aim of pre-separation stage is to separate the
mixture preliminarily. Although this stage can separate the mixture, it still
contains the residual interference. In order to enhance the pre-separated
speech and improve the separation performance further, the end-to-end
post-filter (E2EPF) with deep attention fusion features is proposed. The E2EPF
can make full use of the prior knowledge of the pre-separated speech, which
contributes to speech separation. It is a fully convolutional speech separation
network and uses the waveform as the input features. Firstly, the 1-D
convolutional layer is utilized to extract the deep representation features for
the mixture and pre-separated signals in the time domain. Secondly, to pay more
attention to the outputs of the pre-separation stage, an attention module is
applied to acquire deep attention fusion features, which are extracted by
computing the similarity between the mixture and the pre-separated speech.
These deep attention fusion features are conducive to reduce the interference
and enhance the pre-separated speech. Finally, these features are sent to the
post-filter to estimate each target signals. Experimental results on the
WSJ0-2mix dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art speech separation method. Compared with the pre-separation
method, our proposed method can acquire 64.1%, 60.2%, 25.6% and 7.5% relative
improvements in scale-invariant source-to-noise ratio (SI-SNR), the
signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), the perceptual evaluation of speech quality
(PESQ) and the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) measures,
respectively.

Title: End-to-end Recurrent Denoising Autoencoder Embeddings for Speaker
  Identification
Authors: Esther Rituerto-Gonz\'alez and Carmen Pel\'aez-Moreno
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: 4 pages + 1 of references. To be submitted on Monday March 16th to

\\
  Speech 'in-the-wild' is a handicap for speaker recognition systems due to the
variability induced by real-life conditions, such as environmental noise and
emotions in the speaker. Taking advantage of representation learning, on this
paper we aim to design a recurrent denoising autoencoder architecture that
extracts robust low-dimensional representations --speaker embeddings-- from
noisy spectrograms to perform speaker identification. The end-to-end proposed
architecture uses a feedback loop to encode information regarding to the
speaker into a spectrogram denoising autoencoder. We make use of data
augmentation techniques to corrupt clean speech with additive real-life
environmental noise and utilize a database with real stressed speech. The
proposed architecture benefits from the time sequences and frequency patterns
present in the spectrograms that inherently represent the speaker,
outperforming other architectures compared by using state-of-the-art speaker
embeddings.

Title: Safer End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Conditional Imitation Learning

Authors: Renhao Wang, Adam Scibior, Frank Wood
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG cs.MA
Comments: Coding implementation of NDID and CANDID was discrepant with paper
  description, and degenerated to a branched architecture equivalent to the
  Codevilla et al. model. However, a corrected implementation fails to
  sufficiently disentangle representations and obey commands. Driving results
  in Tables I and III were irreproducible
