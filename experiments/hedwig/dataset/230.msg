Title: A Model-Based, Decision-Theoretic Perspective on Automated Cyber
  Response
Authors: Lashon B. Booker and Scott A. Musman
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table; Presented at the AAAI-20 Workshop on
  Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)
\\
  Cyber-attacks can occur at machine speeds that are far too fast for
human-in-the-loop (or sometimes on-the-loop) decision making to be a viable
option. Although human inputs are still important, a defensive Artificial
Intelligence (AI) system must have considerable autonomy in these
circumstances. When the AI system is model-based, its behavior responses can be
aligned with risk-aware cost/benefit tradeoffs that are defined by
user-supplied preferences that capture the key aspects of how human operators
understand the system, the adversary and the mission. This paper describes an
approach to automated cyber response that is designed along these lines. We
combine a simulation of the system to be defended with an anytime online
planner to solve cyber defense problems characterized as partially observable
Markov decision problems (POMDPs).

Title: A Road Map to Strong Intelligence
Authors: Philip Paquette
Categories: cs.AI cs.CY cs.LG
\\
  I wrote this paper because technology can really improve people's lives. With
it, we can live longer in a healthy body, save time through increased
efficiency and automation, and make better decisions. To get to the next level,
we need to start looking at intelligence from a much broader perspective, and
promote international interdisciplinary collaborations. Section 1 of this paper
delves into sociology and social psychology to explain that the mechanisms
underlying intelligence are inherently social. Section 2 proposes a method to
classify intelligence, and describes the differences between weak and strong
intelligence. Section 3 examines the Chinese Room argument from a different
perspective. It demonstrates that a Turing-complete machine cannot have strong
intelligence, and considers the modifications necessary for a computer to be
intelligent and have understanding. Section 4 argues that the existential risk
caused by the technological explosion of a single agent should not be of
serious concern. Section 5 looks at the AI control problem and argues that it
is impossible to build a super-intelligent machine that will do what it
creators want. By using insights from biology, it also proposes a solution to
the control problem. Section 6 discusses some of the implications of strong
intelligence. Section 7 lists the main challenges with deep learning, and
asserts that radical changes will be required to reach strong intelligence.
Section 8 examines a neuroscience framework that could help explain how a
cortical column works. Section 9 lays out the broad strokes of a road map
towards strong intelligence. Finally, section 10 analyzes the impacts and the
challenges of greater intelligence.

Title: Language as a Cognitive Tool to Imagine Goals in Curiosity-Driven
  Exploration
Authors: C\'edric Colas, Tristan Karch, Nicolas Lair, Jean-Michel Dussoux,

\\
  Autonomous reinforcement learning agents must be intrinsically motivated to
explore their environment, discover potential goals, represent them and learn
how to achieve them. As children do the same, they benefit from exposure to
language, using it to formulate goals and imagine new ones as they learn their
meaning. In our proposed learning architecture (IMAGINE), the agent freely
explores its environment and turns natural language descriptions of interesting
interactions from a social partner into potential goals. IMAGINE learns to
represent goals by jointly learning a language model and a goal-conditioned
reward function. Just like humans, our agent uses language compositionality to
generate new goals by composing known ones. Leveraging modular model
architectures based on Deep Sets and gated-attention mechanisms, IMAGINE
autonomously builds a repertoire of behaviors and shows good zero-shot
generalization properties for various types of generalization. When imagining
its own goals, the agent leverages zero-shot generalization of the reward
function to further train on imagined goals and refine its behavior. We present
experiments in a simulated domain where the agent interacts with procedurally
generated scenes containing objects of various types and colors, discovers
goals, imagines others and learns to achieve them.

Title: On The Reasons Behind Decisions
Authors: Adnan Darwiche and Auguste Hirth
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: To appear in the proceedings of European Conference on Artificial
  Intelligence (ECAI), Spain, 2020
\\
  Recent work has shown that some common machine learning classifiers can be
compiled into Boolean circuits that have the same input-output behavior. We
present a theory for unveiling the reasons behind the decisions made by Boolean
classifiers and study some of its theoretical and practical implications. We
define notions such as sufficient, necessary and complete reasons behind
decisions, in addition to classifier and decision bias. We show how these
notions can be used to evaluate counterfactual statements such as "a decision
will stick even if ... because ... ." We present efficient algorithms for
computing these notions, which are based on new advances on tractable Boolean
circuits, and illustrate them using a case study.

Title: An Advance on Variable Elimination with Applications to Tensor-Based
  Computation
Authors: Adnan Darwiche
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: To Appear in Proceedings of the European Conference on Artificial
  Intelligence (ECAI), Spain, 2020
\\
  We present new results on the classical algorithm of variable elimination,
which underlies many algorithms including for probabilistic inference. The
results relate to exploiting functional dependencies, allowing one to perform
inference and learning efficiently on models that have very large treewidth.
The highlight of the advance is that it works with standard (dense) factors,
without the need for sparse factors or techniques based on knowledge
compilation that are commonly utilized. This is significant as it permits a
direct implementation of the improved variable elimination algorithm using
tensors and their operations, leading to extremely efficient implementations
especially when learning model parameters. Moreover, the proposed technique
does not require knowledge of the specific functional dependencies, only that
they exist, so can be used when learning these dependencies. We illustrate the
efficacy of our proposed algorithm by compiling Bayesian network queries into
tensor graphs and then learning their parameters from labeled data using a
standard tool for tensor computation.

Title: Clustering as an Evaluation Protocol for Knowledge Embedding
  Representation of Categorised Multi-relational Data in the Clinical Domain
Authors: Jianyu Liu and Hegler Tissot
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML
\\
  Learning knowledge representation is an increasingly important technology
applicable in many domain-specific machine learning problems. We discuss the
effectiveness of traditional Link Prediction or Knowledge Graph Completion
evaluation protocol when embedding knowledge representation for categorised
multi-relational data in the clinical domain. Link prediction uses to split the
data into training and evaluation subsets, leading to loss of information along
training and harming the knowledge representation model accuracy. We propose a
Clustering Evaluation Protocol as a replacement alternative to the
traditionally used evaluation tasks. We used embedding models trained by a
knowledge embedding approach which has been evaluated with clinical datasets.
Experimental results with Pearson and Spearman correlations show strong
evidence that the novel proposed evaluation protocol is pottentially able to
replace link prediction.

Title: Geometric rank of tensors and subrank of matrix multiplication
Authors: Swastik Kopparty, Guy Moshkovitz, Jeroen Zuiddam
Categories: cs.CC math.AG math.CO
MSC-class: 68Q17, 15A69
\\
  Motivated by problems in algebraic complexity theory (e.g., matrix
multiplication) and extremal combinatorics (e.g., the cap set problem and the
sunflower problem), we introduce the geometric rank as a new tool in the study
of tensors and hypergraphs. We prove that the geometric rank is an upper bound
on the subrank of tensors and the independence number of hypergraphs. We prove
that the geometric rank is smaller than the slice rank of Tao, and relate
geometric rank to the analytic rank of Gowers and Wolf in an asymptotic
fashion. As a first application, we use geometric rank to prove a tight upper
bound on the (border) subrank of the matrix multiplication tensors, matching
Strassen's well-known lower bound from 1987.

Title: On the impressive performance of randomly weighted encoders in
  summarization tasks
Authors: Jonathan Pilault, Jaehong Park, Christopher Pal
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to ACL 2019 SRW. First two authors contributed equally
\\
  In this work, we investigate the performance of untrained randomly
initialized encoders in a general class of sequence to sequence models and
compare their performance with that of fully-trained encoders on the task of
abstractive summarization. We hypothesize that random projections of an input
text have enough representational power to encode the hierarchical structure of
sentences and semantics of documents. Using a trained decoder to produce
abstractive text summaries, we empirically demonstrate that architectures with
untrained randomly initialized encoders perform competitively with respect to
the equivalent architectures with fully-trained encoders. We further find that
the capacity of the encoder not only improves overall model generalization but
also closes the performance gap between untrained randomly initialized and
full-trained encoders. To our knowledge, it is the first time that general
sequence to sequence models with attention are assessed for trained and
randomly projected representations on abstractive summarization.

  Playing text-based games requires skill in processing natural language and in
planning. Although a key goal for agents solving this task is to generalize
across multiple games, most previous work has either focused on solving a
single game or has tackled generalization with rule-based heuristics. In this
work, we investigate how structured information in the form of a knowledge
graph (KG) can facilitate effective planning and generalization. We introduce a
novel transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model that constructs a "belief"
KG from raw text observations of the environment, dynamically updating this
belief graph at every game step as it receives new observations. To train this
model to build useful graph representations, we introduce and analyze a set of
graph-related pre-training tasks. We demonstrate empirically that KG-based
representations from our model help agents to converge faster to better
policies for multiple text-based games, and further, enable stronger zero-shot
performance on unseen games. Experiments on unseen games show that our best
agent outperforms text-based baselines by 21.6%.

Title: Refinement of Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings
Authors: Magdalena Biesialska and Marta R. Costa-juss\`a
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at the 24th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence
  (ECAI 2020)
\\
  Cross-lingual word embeddings aim to bridge the gap between high-resource and
low-resource languages by allowing to learn multilingual word representations
even without using any direct bilingual signal. The lion's share of the methods
are projection-based approaches that map pre-trained embeddings into a shared
latent space. These methods are mostly based on the orthogonal transformation,
which assumes language vector spaces to be isomorphic. However, this criterion
does not necessarily hold, especially for morphologically-rich languages. In
this paper, we propose a self-supervised method to refine the alignment of
unsupervised bilingual word embeddings. The proposed model moves vectors of
words and their corresponding translations closer to each other as well as
enforces length- and center-invariance, thus allowing to better align
cross-lingual embeddings. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, as in most cases it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in a bilingual lexicon induction task.

Title: Is Aligning Embedding Spaces a Challenging Task? An Analysis of the
  Existing Methods
Authors: Russa Biswas, Mehwish Alam, and Harald Sack
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Representation Learning of words and Knowledge Graphs (KG) into low
dimensional vector spaces along with its applications to many real-world
scenarios have recently gained momentum. In order to make use of multiple KG
embeddings for knowledge-driven applications such as question answering, named
entity disambiguation, knowledge graph completion, etc., alignment of different
KG embedding spaces is necessary. In addition to multilinguality and
domain-specific information, different KGs pose the problem of structural
differences making the alignment of the KG embeddings more challenging. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis and comparison of the state-of-the-art
alignment methods between two embedding spaces representing entity-entity and
entity-word. This paper also aims at assessing the capability and short-comings
of the existing alignment methods on the pretext of different applications.

Journal-ref: WACAI 2020
\\
  The task of predicting dialog acts (DA) based on conversational dialog is a
key component in the development of conversational agents. Accurately
predicting DAs requires a precise modeling of both the conversation and the
global tag dependencies. We leverage seq2seq approaches widely adopted in
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to improve the modelling of tag sequentiality.
Seq2seq models are known to learn complex global dependencies while currently
proposed approaches using linear conditional random fields (CRF) only model
local tag dependencies. In this work, we introduce a seq2seq model tailored for
DA classification using: a hierarchical encoder, a novel guided attention
mechanism and beam search applied to both training and inference. Compared to
the state of the art our model does not require handcrafted features and is
trained end-to-end. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves an unmatched
accuracy score of 85% on SwDA, and state-of-the-art accuracy score of 91.6% on
MRDA.

Title: Differential Privacy for Eye Tracking with Temporal Correlations
Authors: Efe Bozkir and Onur G\"unl\"u, Wolfgang Fuhl, Rafael F. Schaefer, and
  Enkelejda Kasneci
Categories: cs.CR cs.HC cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Head mounted displays bring eye tracking into daily use and this raises
privacy concerns for users. Privacy-preservation techniques such as
differential privacy mechanisms are recently applied to the eye tracking data
obtained from such displays; however, standard differential privacy mechanisms
are vulnerable to temporal correlations in the eye movement features. In this
work, a transform coding based differential privacy mechanism is proposed for
the first time in the eye tracking literature to further adapt it to statistics
of eye movement feature data by comparing various low-complexity methods.
Fourier Perturbation Algorithm, which is a differential privacy mechanism, is
extended and a scaling mistake in its proof is corrected. Significant
reductions in correlations in addition to query sensitivities are illustrated,
which provide the best utility-privacy trade-off in the literature for the eye
tracking dataset used. The differentially private eye movement data are
evaluated also for classification accuracies for gender and document-type
predictions to show that higher privacy is obtained without a reduction in the
classification accuracies by using proposed methods.

\\
  Enterprises are increasingly concerned about adversaries that slowly and
deliberately exploit resources over the course of months or even years. A key
step in this kill chain is network reconnaissance, which has historically been
active (e.g., network scans) and therefore detectable. However, new networking
technology increases the possibility of passive network reconnaissance, which
will be largely undetectable by defenders. In this paper, we propose Snaz, a
technique that uses deceptively crafted honey traffic to confound the knowledge
gained through passive network reconnaissance. We present a two-player
non-zero-sum Stackelberg game model that characterizes how a defender should
deploy honey traffic in the presence of an adversary who is aware of Snaz. In
doing so, we demonstrate the existence of optimal defender strategies that will
either dissuade an adversary from acting on the existence of real
vulnerabilities observed within network traffic, or reveal the adversary's
presence when it attempts to unknowingly attack an intrusion detection node.

  Federated learning enables training a global machine learning model from data
distributed across multiple sites, without having to move the data. This is
particularly relevant in healthcare applications, where data is rife with
personal, highly-sensitive information, and data analysis methods must provably
comply with regulatory guidelines. Although federated learning prevents sharing
raw data, it is still possible to launch privacy attacks on the model
parameters that are exposed during the training process, or on the generated
machine learning model. In this paper, we propose the first syntactic approach
for offering privacy in the context of federated learning. Unlike the
state-of-the-art differential privacy-based frameworks, our approach aims to
maximize utility or model performance, while supporting a defensible level of
privacy, as demanded by GDPR and HIPAA. We perform a comprehensive empirical
evaluation on two important problems in the healthcare domain, using real-world
electronic health data of 1 million patients. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving high model performance, while
offering the desired level of privacy. Through comparative studies, we also
show that, for varying datasets, experimental setups, and privacy budgets, our
approach offers higher model performance than differential privacy-based
techniques in federated learning.

Title: Random Bit Generator Mechanism Based on Elliptic Curves and Secure Hash
  Function
Authors: O. Reyad, M. E. Karar, K. Hamed
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 6 pages, 8 figures, conference
\\
  Pseudorandom bit generators (PRBG) can be designed to take the advantage of
some hard number theoretic problems such as the discrete logarithm problem
(DLP). Such type of generators will have good randomness and unpredictability
properties as it is so difficult to find an easy solution to the regarding
mathematical dilemma. Hash functions in turn play a remarkable role in many
cryptographic tasks to achieve various security strengths. In this paper, a
pseudorandom bit generator mechanism that is based mainly on the elliptic curve
discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) and hash derivation function is proposed.
The cryptographic hash functions are used in consuming applications that
require various security strengths. In a good hash function, finding whatever
the input that can be mapped to any pre-specified output is considered
computationally infeasible. The obtained pseudorandom bits are tested with NIST
statistical tests and it also could fulfill the up-to-date standards. Moreover,
a $256 \times 256$ grayscale images are encrypted with the obtained
pseudorandom bits following by necessary analysis of the cipher images for
security prove.

Title: Are Gabor Kernels Optimal for Iris Recognition?
Authors: Aidan Boyd, Adam Czajka, Kevin Bowyer
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To appear at IJCB 2020
\\
  Gabor kernels are widely accepted as dominant filters for iris recognition.
In this work we investigate, given the current interest in neural networks, if
Gabor kernels are the only family of functions performing best in iris
recognition, or if better filters can be learned directly from iris data. We
use (on purpose) a single-layer convolutional neural network as it mimics an
iris code-based algorithm. We learn two sets of data-driven kernels; one
starting from randomly initialized weights and the other from open-source set
of Gabor kernels. Through experimentation, we show that the network does not
converge on Gabor kernels, instead converging on a mix of edge detectors, blob
detectors and simple waves. In our experiments carried out with three
subject-disjoint datasets we found that the performance of these learned
kernels is comparable to the open-source Gabor kernels. These lead us to two
conclusions: (a) a family of functions offering optimal performance in iris
recognition is wider than Gabor kernels, and (b) we probably hit the maximum
performance for an iris coding algorithm that uses a single convolutional
layer, yet with multiple filters. Released with this work is a framework to
learn data-driven kernels that can be easily transplanted into open-source iris
recognition software (for instance, OSIRIS -- Open Source IRIS).

Title: BlockGAN: Learning 3D Object-aware Scene Representations from Unlabelled
  Images
Authors: Thu Nguyen-Phuoc, Christian Richardt, Long Mai, Yong-Liang Yang, Niloy
  Mitra
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: For project page, see https://www.monkeyoverflow.com/#/blockgan/
\\
  We present BlockGAN, an image generative model that learns object-aware 3D
scene representations directly from unlabelled 2D images. Current work on scene
representation learning either ignores scene background or treats the whole
scene as one object. Meanwhile, work that considers scene compositionality
treats scene objects only as image patches or 2D layers with alpha maps.
Inspired by the computer graphics pipeline, we design BlockGAN to learn to
first generate 3D features of background and foreground objects, then combine
them into 3D features for the wholes cene, and finally render them into
realistic images. This allows BlockGAN to reason over occlusion and interaction
between objects' appearance, such as shadow and lighting, and provides control
over each object's 3D pose and identity, while maintaining image realism.
BlockGAN is trained end-to-end, using only unlabelled single images, without
the need for 3D geometry, pose labels, object masks, or multiple views of the
same scene. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features to represent
objects allows BlockGAN to learn disentangled representations both in terms of
objects (foreground and background) and their properties (pose and identity).

Title: Complete Endomorphisms in Computer Vision
Authors: Javier Finat, Francisco Delgado-del-Hoyo
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: 22 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Correspondences between k-tuples of points are key in multiple view geometry
and motion analysis. Regular transformations are posed by homographies between
two projective planes that serves as structural models for images. Such
transformations can not include degenerate situations. Fundamental or essential
matrices expand homographies with structural information by using degenerate
bilinear maps. The projectivization of the endomorphisms of a three-dimensional
vector space includes all of them. Hence, they are able to explain a wider
range of eventually degenerate transformations between arbitrary pairs of
views. To include these degenerate situations, this paper introduces a
completion of bilinear maps between spaces given by an equivariant
compactification of regular transformations. This completion is extensible to
the varieties of fundamental and essential matrices, where most methods based
on regular transformations fail. The construction of complete endomorphisms
manages degenerate projection maps using a simultaneous action on source and
target spaces. In such way, this mathematical construction provides a robust
framework to relate corresponding views in multiple view geometry.

Title: Audio-video Emotion Recognition in the Wild using Deep Hybrid Networks
Authors: Xin Guo and Luisa F. Polan\'ia and Kenneth E. Barner
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper presents an audiovisual-based emotion recognition hybrid network.
While most of the previous work focuses either on using deep models or
hand-engineered features extracted from images, we explore multiple deep models
built on both images and audio signals. Specifically, in addition to
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neutral networks (RNN)
trained on facial images, the hybrid network also contains one SVM classifier
trained on holistic acoustic feature vectors, one long short-term memory
network (LSTM) trained on short-term feature sequences extracted from segmented
audio clips, and one Inception(v2)-LSTM network trained on image-like maps,
which are built based on short-term acoustic feature sequences. Experimental
results show that the proposed hybrid network outperforms the baseline method
by a large margin.

  Brain age prediction based on children's brain MRI is an important biomarker
for brain health and brain development analysis. In this paper, we consider the
3D brain MRI volume as a sequence of 2D images and propose a new framework
using the recurrent neural network for brain age estimation. The proposed
method is named as 2D-ResNet18+Long short-term memory (LSTM), which consists of
four parts: 2D ResNet18 for feature extraction on 2D images, a pooling layer
for feature reduction over the sequences, an LSTM layer, and a final regression
layer. We apply the proposed method on a public multisite NIH-PD dataset and
evaluate generalization on a second multisite dataset, which shows that the
proposed 2D-ResNet18+LSTM method provides better results than traditional 3D
based neural network for brain age estimation.

Title: Unsupervised Pre-trained, Texture Aware And Lightweight Model for Deep
  Learning-Based Iris Recognition Under Limited Annotated Data
Authors: Manashi Chakraborty, Mayukh Roy, Prabir Kumar Biswas, Pabitra Mitra
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Under review at ICIP2020
\\
  In this paper, we present a texture aware lightweight deep learning framework
for iris recognition. Our contributions are primarily three fold. Firstly, to
address the dearth of labelled iris data, we propose a reconstruction loss
guided unsupervised pre-training stage followed by supervised refinement. This
drives the network weights to focus on discriminative iris texture patterns.
Next, we propose several texture aware improvisations inside a Convolution
Neural Net to better leverage iris textures. Finally, we show that our
systematic training and architectural choices enable us to design an efficient
framework with upto 100X fewer parameters than contemporary deep learning
baselines yet achieve better recognition performance for within and cross
dataset evaluations.

Title: Adapted Center and Scale Prediction: More Stable and More Accurate
Authors: Wenhao Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 13 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Pedestrian detection benefits from deep learning technology and gains rapid
development in recent years. Most of detectors follow general object detection
frame, i.e. default boxes and two-stage process. Recently, anchor-free and
one-stage detectors have been introduced into this area. However, their
accuracies are unsatisfactory. Therefore, in order to enjoy the simplicity of
anchor-free detectors and the accuracy of two-stage ones simultaneously, we
propose some adaptations based on a detector, Center and Scale Prediction(CSP).
The main contributions of our paper are: (1) We improve the robustness of CSP
and make it easier to train. (2) We achieve the second best performance on the
CityPersons benchmark, which shows an anchor-free and one-stage detector can
still have high accuracy. (3) We explore some extra capabilities of recently
proposed normalization method, Switchable Normalization.

Title: Face Phylogeny Tree Using Basis Functions
Authors: Sudipta Banerjee and Arun Ross
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Photometric transformations, such as brightness and contrast adjustment, can
be applied to a face image repeatedly creating a set of near-duplicate images.
These near-duplicates may be visually indiscernible. Identifying the original
image from a set of near-duplicates, and deducing the relationship between
them, is important in the context of digital image forensics. This is commonly
done by generating an image phylogeny tree -- a hierarchical structure
depicting the relationships between a set of near-duplicate images. In this
work, we utilize three different families of basis functions to model pairwise
relationships between near-duplicate images. The basis functions used in this
work are orthogonal polynomials, wavelet basis functions and radial basis
functions. We perform extensive experiments to assess the performance of the
proposed method across three different modalities, namely, face, fingerprint
and iris images; across different image phylogeny tree configurations; and
across different types of photometric transformations. We also utilized the
same basis functions to model geometric transformations and deep-learning based
transformations. We also perform extensive analysis of each basis function with
respect to their ability to model arbitrary transformations and to distinguish
between the original and the transformed images. Finally, we utilize the
concept of approximate von Neumann graph entropy to explain the success and
failure cases of the proposed IPT reconstruction algorithm. Experiments
indicate that the proposed algorithm generalizes well across different
scenarios thereby suggesting the merits of using basis functions to model the
relationship between photometrically and geometrically modified images.

Title: Leveraging Photogrammetric Mesh Models for Aerial-Ground Feature Point
  Matching Toward Integrated 3D Reconstruction
Authors: Qing Zhu, Zhendong Wang, Han Hu, Linfu Xie, Xuming Ge, Yeting Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Integration of aerial and ground images has been proved as an efficient
approach to enhance the surface reconstruction in urban environments. However,
as the first step, the feature point matching between aerial and ground images
is remarkably difficult, due to the large differences in viewpoint and
illumination conditions. Previous studies based on geometry-aware image
rectification have alleviated this problem, but the performance and convenience
of this strategy is limited by several flaws, e.g. quadratic image pairs,
segregated extraction of descriptors and occlusions. To address these problems,
we propose a novel approach: leveraging photogrammetric mesh models for
aerial-ground image matching. The methods of this proposed approach have linear
time complexity with regard to the number of images, can explicitly handle low
overlap using multi-view images and can be directly injected into off-the-shelf
structure-from-motion (SfM) and multi-view stereo (MVS) solutions. First,
aerial and ground images are reconstructed separately and initially
co-registered through weak georeferencing data. Second, aerial models are
rendered to the initial ground views, in which the color, depth and normal
images are obtained. Then, the synthesized color images and the corresponding
ground images are matched by comparing the descriptors, filtered by local
geometrical information, and then propagated to the aerial views using depth
images and patch-based matching. Experimental evaluations using various
datasets confirm the superior performance of the proposed methods in
aerial-ground image matching. In addition, incorporation of the existing SfM
and MVS solutions into these methods enables more complete and accurate models
to be directly obtained.

Title: Robust Iris Presentation Attack Detection Fusing 2D and 3D Information
Authors: Zhaoyuan Fang, Adam Czajka, Kevin W. Bowyer
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Diversity and unpredictability of artifacts potentially presented to an iris
sensor calls for presentation attack detection methods that are agnostic to
specificity of presentation attack instruments. This paper proposes a method
that combines two-dimensional and three-dimensional properties of the observed
iris to address the problem of spoof detection in case when some properties of
artifacts are unknown. The 2D (textural) iris features are extracted by a
state-of-the-art method employing Binary Statistical Image Features (BSIF) and
an ensemble of classifiers is used to deliver 2D modality-related decision. The
3D (shape) iris features are reconstructed by a photometric stereo method from
only two images captured under near-infrared illumination placed at two
different angles, as in many current commercial iris recognition sensors. The
map of normal vectors is used to assess the convexity of the observed iris
surface. The combination of these two approaches has been applied to detect
whether a subject is wearing a textured contact lens to disguise their
identity. Extensive experiments with NDCLD'15 dataset, and a newly collected
NDIris3D dataset show that the proposed method is highly robust under various
open-set testing scenarios, and that it outperforms all available open-source
iris PAD methods tested in identical scenarios. The source code and the newly
prepared benchmark are made available along with this paper.

Title: Unsupervised Enhancement of Soft-biometric Privacy with Negative Face
  Recognition
Authors: Philipp Terh\"orst, Marco Huber, Naser Damer, Florian Kirchbuchner,
  Arjan Kuijper
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Currently under review
\\
  Current research on soft-biometrics showed that privacy-sensitive information
can be deduced from biometric templates of an individual. Since for many
applications, these templates are expected to be used for recognition purposes
only, this raises major privacy issues. Previous works focused on supervised
privacy-enhancing solutions that require privacy-sensitive information about
individuals and limit their application to the suppression of single and
pre-defined attributes. Consequently, they do not take into account attributes
that are not considered in the training. In this work, we present Negative Face
Recognition (NFR), a novel face recognition approach that enhances the
soft-biometric privacy on the template-level by representing face templates in
a complementary (negative) domain. While ordinary templates characterize facial
properties of an individual, negative templates describe facial properties that
does not exist for this individual. This suppresses privacy-sensitive
information from stored templates. Experiments are conducted on two publicly
available datasets captured under controlled and uncontrolled scenarios on
three privacy-sensitive attributes. The experiments demonstrate that our
proposed approach reaches higher suppression rates than previous work, while
maintaining higher recognition performances as well. Unlike previous works, our
approach does not require privacy-sensitive labels and offers a more
comprehensive privacy-protection not limited to pre-defined attributes.

\\
  Designing video prediction models that account for the inherent uncertainty
of the future is challenging. Most works in the literature are based on
stochastic image-autoregressive recurrent networks, which raises several
performance and applicability issues. An alternative is to use fully latent
temporal models which untie frame synthesis and temporal dynamics. However, no
such model for stochastic video prediction has been proposed in the literature
yet, due to design and training difficulties. In this paper, we overcome these
difficulties by introducing a novel stochastic temporal model whose dynamics
are governed in a latent space by a residual update rule. This first-order
scheme is motivated by discretization schemes of differential equations. It
naturally models video dynamics as it allows our simpler, more interpretable,
latent model to outperform prior state-of-the-art methods on challenging
datasets.

\\
  Person re-identification (re-ID) aims at matching images of the same person
across camera views. Due to varying distances between cameras and persons of
interest, resolution mismatch can be expected, which would degrade re-ID
performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose a
novel generative adversarial network to address cross-resolution person re-ID,
allowing query images with varying resolutions. By advancing adversarial
learning techniques, our proposed model learns resolution-invariant image
representations while being able to recover the missing details in
low-resolution input images. The resulting features can be jointly applied for
improving re-ID performance due to preserving resolution invariance and
recovering re-ID oriented discriminative details. Extensive experimental
results on five standard person re-ID benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of
our method and the superiority over the state-of-the-art approaches, especially
when the input resolutions are not seen during training. Furthermore, the
experimental results on two vehicle re-ID benchmarks also confirm the
generalization of our model on cross-resolution visual tasks. The extensions of
semi-supervised settings further support the use of our proposed approach to
real-world scenarios and applications.

Title: Learning to Inpaint by Progressively Growing the Mask Regions
Authors: Mohamed Abbas Hedjazi, Yakup Genc
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICCV Workshop on Should we preregister experiments in computer
  vision?, Seoul, South Korea, 2019
\\
  Image inpainting is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision.
Recently, generative-based image inpainting methods have been shown to produce
visually plausible images. However, they still have difficulties to generate
the correct structures and colors as the masked region grows large. This
drawback is due to the training stability issue of the generative models. This
work introduces a new curriculum-style training approach in the context of
image inpainting. The proposed method increases the masked region size
progressively in training time, during test time the user gives variable size
and multiple holes at arbitrary locations. Incorporating such an approach in
GANs may stabilize the training and provides better color consistencies and
captures object continuities. We validate our approach on the MSCOCO and CelebA
datasets. We report qualitative and quantitative comparisons of our training
approach in different models.

  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in a few decades, have outperformed the
existing state of the art methods in classification context. However, in the
way they were formalised, CNNs are bound to operate on euclidean spaces.
Indeed, convolution is a signal operation that are defined on euclidean spaces.
This has restricted deep learning main use to euclidean-defined data such as
sound or image. And yet, numerous computer application fields (among which
network analysis, computational social science, chemo-informatics or computer
graphics) induce non-euclideanly defined data such as graphs, networks or
manifolds. In this paper we propose a new convolution neural network
architecture, defined directly into graph space. Convolution and pooling
operators are defined in graph domain. We show its usability in a
back-propagation context. Experimental results show that our model performance
is at state of the art level on simple tasks. It shows robustness with respect
to graph domain changes and improvement with respect to other euclidean and
non-euclidean convolutional architectures.

  In this paper, we propose an approach for Facial Expressions Recognition
(FER) based on a deep multi-facial patches aggregation network. Deep features
are learned from facial patches using deep sub-networks and aggregated within
one deep architecture for expression classification . Several problems may
affect the performance of deep-learning based FER approaches, in particular,
the small size of existing FER datasets which might not be sufficient to train
large deep learning networks. Moreover, it is extremely time-consuming to
collect and annotate a large number of facial images. To account for this, we
propose two data augmentation techniques for facial expression generation to
expand FER labeled training datasets. We evaluate the proposed framework on
three FER datasets. Results show that the proposed approach achieves
state-of-art FER deep learning approaches performance when the model is trained
and tested on images from the same dataset. Moreover, the proposed data
augmentation techniques improve the expression recognition rate, and thus can
be a solution for training deep learning FER models using small datasets. The
accuracy degrades significantly when testing for dataset bias.

  Owing to refraction, absorption, and scattering of light by suspended
particles in water, raw underwater images suffer from low contrast, blurred
details, and color distortion. These characteristics can significantly
interfere with the visibility of underwater images and the result of visual
tasks, such as segmentation and tracking. To address this problem, we propose a
new robust adversarial learning framework via physics model based feedback
control and domain adaptation mechanism for enhancing underwater images to get
realistic results. A new method for simulating underwater-like training dataset
from RGB-D data by underwater image formation model is proposed. Upon the
synthetic dataset, a novel enhancement framework, which introduces a domain
adaptive mechanism as well as a physics model constraint feedback control, is
trained to enhance the underwater scenes. Final enhanced results on synthetic
and real underwater images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method,
which outperforms nondeep and deep learning methods in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Furthermore, we perform an ablation study to show the
contributions of each component we proposed.

show that the trained network is capable to detect most roots successfully and
even finds roots that were missed by human annotators. Our experiments show
that the segmentation performance can be further improved with modifications of

\\
  In the pharmaceutical industry the screening of opaque vaccines containing
suspensions is currently a manual task carried out by trained human visual
inspectors. We show that deep learning can be used to effectively automate this
process. A moving contrast is required to distinguish anomalies from other
particles, reflections and dust resting on a vial's surface. We train
3D-ConvNets to predict the likelihood of 20-frame video samples containing
anomalies. Our unaugmented dataset consists of hand-labelled samples, recorded
using vials provided by the HAL Allergy Group, a pharmaceutical company. We
trained ten randomly initialized 3D-ConvNets to provide a benchmark, observing
mean AUROC scores of 0.94 and 0.93 for positive samples (containing anomalies)
and negative (anomaly-free) samples, respectively. Using Frame-Completion
Generative Adversarial Networks we: (i) introduce an algorithm for computing
saliency maps, which we use to verify that the 3D-ConvNets are indeed
identifying anomalies; (ii) propose a novel self-training approach using the
saliency maps to determine if multiple networks agree on the location of
anomalies. Our self-training approach allows us to augment our data set by
labelling 217,888 additional samples. 3D-ConvNets trained with our augmented
dataset improve on the results we get when we train only on the unaugmented
dataset.

concatenated to form global representations which are then used to train a
linear SVM to perform the action classification using full context of the

convolutional network to learn spatial (appearance) and temporal (motion)
representations. It utilizes an encoder-decoder model to extract the most
salient features from the learned video representations. Lastly, it uses a
sigmoid regression network with bidirectional long short-term memory cells to
predict the probability of a frame being a summary frame. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves comparable or
significantly better results than the state-of-the-art video summarisation
methods.

Title: Fine-Grained Instance-Level Sketch-Based Video Retrieval
Authors: Peng Xu, Kun Liu, Tao Xiang, Timothy M. Hospedales, Zhanyu Ma, Jun

Categories: cs.CV cs.MM
\\
  Existing sketch-analysis work studies sketches depicting static objects or
scenes. In this work, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval problem of
fine-grained instance-level sketch-based video retrieval (FG-SBVR), where a
sketch sequence is used as a query to retrieve a specific target video
instance. Compared with sketch-based still image retrieval, and coarse-grained
category-level video retrieval, this is more challenging as both visual
appearance and motion need to be simultaneously matched at a fine-grained
level. We contribute the first FG-SBVR dataset with rich annotations. We then
introduce a novel multi-stream multi-modality deep network to perform FG-SBVR
under both strong and weakly supervised settings. The key component of the
network is a relation module, designed to prevent model over-fitting given
scarce training data. We show that this model significantly outperforms a
number of existing state-of-the-art models designed for video analysis.

Title: Snel: SQL Native Execution for LLVM
Authors: Marcelo Mottalli, Gustavo Ajzenman, Carlos Sarraute
Categories: cs.CY cs.DB
Comments: 33 pages
\\
  Snel is a relational database engine featuring Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
of queries and columnar data representation. Snel is designed for fast on-line
analytics by leveraging the LLVM compiler infrastructure. It also has custom
special methods like resolving histograms as extensions to the SQL language.
"Snel" means "SQL Native Execution for LLVM".
  Unlike traditional database engines, it does not provide a client-server
interface. Instead, it exposes its interface as an extension to SQLite, for a
simple interactive usage from command line and for embedding in applications.
Since Snel tables are read-only, it does not provide features like transactions
or updates. This allows queries to be very fast since they don't have the
overhead of table locking or ensuring consistency.
  At its core, Snel is simply a dynamic library that can be used by client
applications. It has an SQLite extension for seamless integration with a
traditional SQL environment and simple interactive usage from command line.

Title: Facilitating SQL Query Composition and Analysis
Authors: Zainab Zolaktaf, Mostafa Milani, Rachel Pottinger
Categories: cs.DB
Comments: Full version of the ACM SIGMOD 2020 paper
\\
  Formulating efficient SQL queries requires several cycles of tuning and
execution, particularly for inexperienced users. We examine methods that can
accelerate and improve this interaction by providing insights about SQL queries
prior to execution. We achieve this by predicting properties such as the query
answer size, its run-time, and error class. Unlike existing approaches, our
approach does not rely on any statistics from the database instance or query
execution plans. This is particularly important in settings with limited access
to the database instance. Our approach is based on using data-driven machine
learning techniques that rely on large query workloads to model SQL queries and
their properties. We evaluate the utility of neural network models and
traditional machine learning models. We use two real-world query workloads: the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the SQLShare query workload. Empirical
results show that the neural network models are more accurate in predicting the
query error class, achieving a higher F-measure on classes with fewer samples
as well as performing better on other problems such as run-time and answer size
prediction. These results are encouraging and confirm that SQL query workloads
and data-driven machine learning methods can be leveraged to facilitate query
composition and analysis.

Title: Star Pattern Fragments: Accessing Knowledge Graphs through Star Patterns
Authors: Christian Aebeloe, Ilkcan Keles, Gabriela Montoya, Katja Hose
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  The Semantic Web offers access to a vast Web of interlinked information
accessible via SPARQL endpoints. Such endpoints offer a well-defined interface
to retrieve results for complex SPARQL queries. The computational load for
processing such queries, however, lies entirely with the server hosting the
SPARQL endpoint, which can easily become overloaded and in the worst case not
only become slow in responding but even crash so that the data becomes
temporarily unavailable. Recently proposed interfaces, such as Triple Pattern
Fragments, have therefore shifted the query processing load from the server to
the client. For queries involving triple patterns with low selectivity, this
can easily result in high network traffic and slow execution times. In this
paper, we therefore present a novel interface, Star Pattern Fragments (SPF),
which decomposes SPARQL queries into star-shaped subqueries and can combine a
lower network load with a higher query throughput and a comparatively low
server load. Our experimental results show that our approach does not only
significantly reduce network traffic but is also at least an order of magnitude
faster in comparison to the state-of-the-art interfaces under high query
processing load.

Title: Crowdsourced Collective Entity Resolution with Relational Match
  Propagation
Authors: Jiacheng Huang and Wei Hu and Zhifeng Bao and Yuzhong Qu
Categories: cs.DB cs.CL
Comments: Accepted by the 36th IEEE International Conference on Data
  Engineering (ICDE 2020)
\\
  Knowledge bases (KBs) store rich yet heterogeneous entities and facts. Entity
resolution (ER) aims to identify entities in KBs which refer to the same
real-world object. Recent studies have shown significant benefits of involving
humans in the loop of ER. They often resolve entities with pairwise similarity
measures over attribute values and resort to the crowds to label uncertain
ones. However, existing methods still suffer from high labor costs and
insufficient labeling to some extent. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach called crowdsourced collective ER, which leverages the relationships
between entities to infer matches jointly rather than independently.
Specifically, it iteratively asks human workers to label picked entity pairs
and propagates the labeling information to their neighbors in distance. During
this process, we address the problems of candidate entity pruning,
probabilistic propagation, optimal question selection and error-tolerant truth
inference. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared
with state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves superior accuracy with
much less labeling.

Title: Graph4Code: A Machine Interpretable Knowledge Graph for Code
Authors: Kavitha Srinivas, Ibrahim Abdelaziz, Julian Dolby, James P. McCusker
Categories: cs.DB cs.AI
\\
  Knowledge graphs have proven to be extremely useful in powering diverse
applications in semantic search, natural language understanding, and even image
classification. Graph4Code attempts to build well structured knowledge graphs
about program code to similarly revolutionize diverse applications such as code
search, code understanding, refactoring, bug detection, and code automation. We
build such a graph by applying a set of generic code analysis techniques to
Python code on the web. Since use of popular Python modules is ubiquitous in
code, calls to functions in Python modules serve as key nodes of the knowledge
graph. The edges in the graph are based on 1) function usage in the wild (e.g.,
which other function tends to call this one, or which function tends to precede
this one, as gleaned from program analysis), 2) documentation about the
function (e.g., code documentation, usage documentation, or forum discussions
such as StackOverflow), and 3) program specific features such as class
hierarchies. We use the Whyis knowledge graph management framework to make the
graph easily extensible. We apply these techniques to 1.3M Python files drawn
from GitHub, and associated documentation on the web for over 400 popular
libraries, as well as StackOverflow posts about the same set of libraries. This
knowledge graph will be made available soon to the larger community for use.

Title: Methods and Experiences for Developing Abstractions for Data-intensive,
  Scientific Applications
Authors: Andre Luckow and Shantenu Jha
Categories: cs.DC cs.SE
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Developing software for scientific applications that require the integration
of diverse types of computing, instruments and data present challenges that are
distinct from commercial software, due to scale, heterogeneity, and the need to
integrate various programming and computational models with evolving and
heterogeneous infrastructure. Pervasive and effective abstractions are thus
critical. The process of developing abstractions for scientific applications
and infrastructures is not well understood. While theory-based approaches are
suited for well-defined, closed environments, they have severe limitations for
designing abstractions for complex, real-world systems. The design science
research (DSR) method provides the basis for designing effective systems that
can handle real-world complexities. DSR consists of two complementary phases:
design and evaluation. This paper applies the DSR method to the development of
abstractions for scientific applications. Specifically, we address the critical
problem of distributed resource management on heterogeneous infrastructure, a
challenge that currently limits many scientific applications. We use the
pilot-abstraction, a widely used resource management abstraction for
high-performance, high throughput, big data, and streaming applications, as a
case study. We evaluate the activities of the process and extensively evaluate
the artifacts using different methods, including conceptual modeling,
performance characterizations, and modeling. We demonstrate the applicability
of the DSR method for holistically handling the complexity of parallel and
distributed computing environments addressing important application, system,
and infrastructure challenges of scientific applications. Finally, we capture
our experiences and formulate different lessons learned.

Title: Faasm: Lightweight Isolation for Efficient Stateful Serverless Computing
Authors: Simon Shillaker, Peter Pietzuch
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Serverless computing is an excellent fit for big data processing because it
can scale quickly and cheaply to thousands of parallel functions. Existing
serverless platforms, however, isolate functions in ephemeral, stateless
containers. This means that functions cannot efficiently share memory, forcing
users to serialise data repeatedly when composing functions. We observe that
container-based isolation is ill-suited for serverless big data processing.
Instead it requires a lightweight isolation approach that allows for efficient
state sharing.
  We introduce Faaslets, a new isolation abstraction for serverless big data
computing. Faaslets isolate the memory of executed functions using
software-fault isolation (SFI), as provided by WebAssembly, while allowing
memory regions to be shared between functions in the same address space.
Faaslets can thus avoid expensive data movement when functions are co-located
on the same machine. Our runtime for Faaslets, Faasm, isolates other resources,
e.g. CPU and network, using standard Linux cgroups, and provides a low-level
POSIX host interface for networking, file system access and dynamic loading. To
reduce initialisation times, Faasm restores Faaslets from already-initialised
snapshots. We compare Faasm to a standard container-based platform and show
that, when training a machine learning model, it achieves a 2x speed-up with
10x less memory; for serving machine learning inference, Faasm doubles the
throughput and reduces tail latency by 90%.

Title: Fast Implementation of Morphological Filtering Using ARM NEON Extension

\\
  In this paper we consider speedup potential of morphological image filtering
on ARM processors. Morphological operations are widely used in image analysis
and recognition and their speedup in some cases can significantly reduce
overall execution time of recognition. More specifically, we propose fast
implementation of erosion and dilation using ARM SIMD extension NEON. These
operations with the rectangular structuring element are separable. They were
implemented using the advantages of separability as sequential horizontal and
vertical passes. Each pass was implemented using van Herk/Gil-Werman algorithm
for large windows and low-constant linear complexity algorithm for small
windows. Final implementation was improved with SIMD and used a combination of
these methods. We also considered fast transpose implementation of 8x8 and
16x16 matrices using ARM NEON to get additional computational gain for
morphological operations. Experiments showed 3 times efficiency increase for
final implementation of erosion and dilation compared to van Herk/Gil-Werman
algorithm without SIMD, 5.7 times speedup for 8x8 matrix transpose and 12 times
speedup for 16x16 matrix transpose compared to transpose without SIMD.

  According to the World Health Organization, the number of mental disorder
patients, especially depression patients, has grown rapidly and become a
leading contributor to the global burden of disease. However, the present
common practice of depression diagnosis is based on interviews and clinical
scales carried out by doctors, which is not only labor-consuming but also
time-consuming. One important reason is due to the lack of physiological
indicators for mental disorders. With the rising of tools such as data mining
and artificial intelligence, using physiological data to explore new possible
physiological indicators of mental disorder and creating new applications for
mental disorder diagnosis has become a new research hot topic. However, good
quality physiological data for mental disorder patients are hard to acquire. We
present a multi-model open dataset for mental-disorder analysis. The dataset
includes EEG and audio data from clinically depressed patients and matching
normal controls. All our patients were carefully diagnosed and selected by
professional psychiatrists in hospitals. The EEG dataset includes not only data
collected using traditional 128-electrodes mounted elastic cap, but also a
novel wearable 3-electrode EEG collector for pervasive applications. The
128-electrodes EEG signals of 53 subjects were recorded as both in resting
state and under stimulation; the 3-electrode EEG signals of 55 subjects were
recorded in resting state; the audio data of 52 subjects were recorded during
interviewing, reading, and picture description. We encourage other researchers
in the field to use it for testing their methods of mental-disorder analysis.

Title: Total tessellation cover and quantum walk

MSC-class: 05C

\\
  We propose the total staggered quantum walk model and the total tessellation
cover of a graph. This model uses the concept of total tessellation cover to
describe the motion of the walker who is allowed to hop both to vertices and
edges of the graph, in contrast with previous models in which the walker hops
either to vertices or edges. We establish bounds on $T_t(G)$, which is the
smallest number of tessellations required in a total tessellation cover of $G$.
We highlight two of these lower bounds $T_t(G) \geq \omega(G)$ and $T_t(G)\geq
is(G)+1$, where $\omega(G)$ is the size of a maximum clique and $is(G)$ is the
number of edges of a maximum induced star subgraph. Using these bounds, we
define the good total tessellable graphs with either $T_t(G)=\omega(G)$ or
$T_t(G)=is(G)+1$. The $k$-total tessellability problem aims to decide whether a
given graph $G$ has $T_t(G) \leq k$. We show that $k$-total tessellability is
in $\mathcal{P}$ for good total tessellable graphs. We establish the
$\mathcal{NP}$-completeness of the following problems when restricted to the
following classes: ($is(G)+1$)-total tessellability for graphs with $\omega(G)
= 2$; $\omega(G)$-total tessellability for graphs $G$ with $is(G)+1 = 3$;
$k$-total tessellability for graphs $G$ with $\max\{\omega(G), is(G)+1\}$ far
from $k$; and $4$-total tessellability for graphs $G$ with $\omega(G) = is(G)+1
= 4$. As a consequence, we establish hardness results for bipartite graphs,
line graphs of triangle-free graphs, universal graphs, planar graphs, and
$(2,1)$-chordal graphs.

Title: A general kernelization technique for domination and independence
  problems in sparse classes
Authors: Carl Einarson and Felix Reidl
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We unify and extend previous kernelization techniques in sparse classes [5,
16] by defining a structure we call water lilies and show how it can be used in
bounded expansion classes to construct linear bikernels for $(r, c)$-DOMINATING
SET, $(r, c)$-SCATTERED SET, TOTAL $r$-DOMINATION, r-Roman Domination, and a
problem we call $(r, [{\lambda}, {\mu}])$-DOMINATION (implying a bikernel for
r-PERFECT CODE). At the cost of slightly changing the output graph class these
bikernels can be turned into into kernels. Finally, we demonstrate how these
constructions can be combined to create 'multikernels', meaning graphs who
represent kernels for multiple problems at once. Concretely, we show that
$r$-DOMINATING SET, TOTAL $r$-DOMINATION, and $r$-ROMAN DOMINATION admit a
multikernel; as well as $r$-DOMINATING SET and $2r$-INDEPENDENT SET for
multiple values of $r$ at once.

  Binary relations are commonly used in Computer Science for modeling data. In
addition to classical representations using matrices or lists, some compressed
data structures have recently been proposed to represent binary relations in
compact space, such as the $k^2$-tree and the Binary Relation Wavelet Tree
(BRWT). Knowing their storage needs, supported operations and time performance
is key for enabling an appropriate choice of data representation given a domain
or application, its data distribution and typical operations that are computed
over the data.
  In this work, we present an empirical comparison among several compressed
representations for binary relations. We analyze their space usage and the
speed of their operations using different (synthetic and real) data
distributions. We include both neighborhood and set operations, also proposing
algorithms for set operations for the BRWT, which were not presented before in
the literature. We conclude that there is not a clear choice that outperforms
the rest, but we give some recommendations of usage of each compact
representation depending on the data distribution and types of operations
performed over the data. We also include a scalability study of the data
representations.

Title: A polynomial lower bound on adaptive complexity of submodular
  maximization
Authors: Wenzheng Li, Paul Liu, Jan Vondrak
Categories: cs.DS cs.DC
\\
  In large-data applications, it is desirable to design algorithms with a high
degree of parallelization. In the context of submodular optimization, adaptive
complexity has become a widely-used measure of an algorithm's "sequentiality".
Algorithms in the adaptive model proceed in rounds, and can issue polynomially
many queries to a function $f$ in each round. The queries in each round must be
independent, produced by a computation that depends only on query results
obtained in previous rounds.
  In this work, we examine two fundamental variants of submodular maximization
in the adaptive complexity model: cardinality-constrained monotone
maximization, and unconstrained non-monotone maximization. Our main result is
that an $r$-round algorithm for cardinality-constrained monotone maximization
cannot achieve a factor better than $1 - 1/e - \Omega(\min \{ \frac{1}{r},
\frac{\log^2 n}{r^3} \})$, for any $r < n^c$ (where $c>0$ is some constant).
This is the first result showing that the number of rounds must blow up
polynomially large as we approach the optimal factor of $1-1/e$.
  For the unconstrained non-monotone maximization problem, we show a positive
result: For every instance, and every $\delta>0$, either we obtain a
$(1/2-\delta)$-approximation in $1$ round, or a
$(1/2+\Omega(\delta^2))$-approximation in $O(1/\delta^2)$ rounds. In particular
(in contrast to the cardinality-constrained case), there cannot be an instance
where (i) it is impossible to achieve a factor better than $1/2$ regardless of
the number of rounds, and (ii) it takes $r$ rounds to achieve a factor of
$1/2-O(1/r)$.

Title: A symmetric alternating minimization algorithm for total variation
  minimization
Authors: Yuan Lei and Jiaxin Xie
Categories: cs.DS math.OC
\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel symmetric alternating minimization
algorithm to solve a broad class of total variation (TV) regularization
problems. Unlike the usual $z^k\to x^k$ Gauss-Seidel cycle, the proposed
algorithm performs the special $\overline{x}^{k}\to z^k\to x^k$ cycle. The main
idea for our setting is the recent symmetric Gauss-Seidel (sGS) technique which
is developed for solving the multi-block convex composite problem. This idea
also enables us to build the equivalence between the proposed method and the
well-known accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method. The faster convergence
rate of the proposed algorithm can be directly obtained from the APG framework
and numerical results including image denoising, image deblurring, and analysis
sparse recovery problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm.

Title: Localized Flow-Based Clustering in Hypergraphs
Authors: Nate Veldt and Austin R. Benson and Jon Kleinberg
Categories: cs.DS cs.DM cs.LG cs.SI
\\
  Local graph clustering algorithms are designed to efficiently detect small
clusters of nodes that are biased to a localized region of a large graph.
Although many techniques have been developed for local clustering in graphs,
very few algorithms have been designed to detect local clusters in hypergraphs,
which better model complex systems involving multiway relationships between
data objects. In this paper we present a framework for local clustering in
hypergraphs based on minimum cuts and maximum flows. Our approach extends
previous research on flow-based local graph clustering, but has been
generalized in a number of key ways. First of all, we demonstrate how to
incorporate recent results on generalized hypergraph $s$-$t$ cut problems. This
allows us to accommodate a wide range of different hypergraph cut functions,
which can assign different penalties based on how each hyperedge is split
across different clusters. Furthermore, our algorithm comes with a number of
attractive theoretical properties in terms of recovering nodes sets with low
hypergraph conductance and hypergraph normalized cut scores. Finally, and most
importantly, our method is strongly-local, meaning that its runtime depends
only on the size of an input set. In practice this allows our method to quickly
find localized clusters without exploring an entire input hypergraph. We
demonstrate the power of our method in local cluster detection experiments on
an Amazon product hypergraph and a Stack Overflow question hypergraph. Although
both datasets involve millions of nodes, millions of edges, and a large average
hyperedge size, we are able to detect local clusters in a matter of a few
seconds or a few minutes, depending on the size of the cluster.

Title: Parameterized Objectives and Algorithms for Clustering Bipartite Graphs
  and Hypergraphs
Authors: Nate Veldt and Anthony Wirth and David F. Gleich
Categories: cs.DS cs.DM cs.LG cs.SI
\\
  Graph clustering objective functions with tunable resolution parameters make
it possible to detect different types of clustering structure in the same
graph. These objectives also provide a unifying view of other non-parametric
objectives, which often can be captured as special cases. Previous research has
largely focused on parametric objectives for standard graphs, in which all
nodes are of the same type, and edges model pairwise relationships. In our
work, we introduced parameterized objective functions and approximation
algorithms specifically for clustering bipartite graphs and hypergraphs, based
on correlation clustering. This enables us to develop principled approaches for
clustering datasets with different node types (bipartite graphs) or multiway
relationships (hypergraphs). Our hypergraph objective is related to
higher-order notions of modularity and normalized cut, and is amenable to
approximation algorithms via hypergraph expansion techniques. Our bipartite
objective generalizes standard bipartite correlation clustering, and in a
certain parameter regime is equivalent to bicluster deletion, i.e., removing a
minimum number of edges to separate a bipartite graph into disjoint bicliques.
The problem in general is NP-hard, but we show that in a certain parameter
regime it is equivalent to a bipartite matching problem, meaning that it is
polynomial time solvable in this regime. For other regimes, we provide
approximation guarantees based on LP-rounding. Our results include the first
constant factor approximation algorithm for bicluster deletion. We illustrate
the flexibility of our framework in several experiments. This includes
clustering a food web and an email network based on higher-order motif
structure, detecting clusters of retail products in product review hypergraph,
and evaluating our algorithms across a range of parameter settings on several
real world bipartite graphs.

Title: Privately Learning Markov Random Fields
Authors: Huanyu Zhang, Gautam Kamath, Janardhan Kulkarni, Zhiwei Steven Wu
Categories: cs.DS cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We consider the problem of learning Markov Random Fields (including the
prototypical example, the Ising model) under the constraint of differential
privacy. Our learning goals include both structure learning, where we try to
estimate the underlying graph structure of the model, as well as the harder
goal of parameter learning, in which we additionally estimate the parameter on
each edge. We provide algorithms and lower bounds for both problems under a
variety of privacy constraints -- namely pure, concentrated, and approximate
differential privacy. While non-privately, both learning goals enjoy roughly
the same complexity, we show that this is not the case under differential
privacy. In particular, only structure learning under approximate differential
privacy maintains the non-private logarithmic dependence on the dimensionality
of the data, while a change in either the learning goal or the privacy notion
would necessitate a polynomial dependence. As a result, we show that the
privacy constraint imposes a strong separation between these two learning
problems in the high-dimensional data regime.

Title: Private Mean Estimation of Heavy-Tailed Distributions
Authors: Gautam Kamath, Vikrant Singhal, Jonathan Ullman
Categories: cs.DS cs.CR cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML
\\
  We give new upper and lower bounds on the minimax sample complexity of
differentially private mean estimation of distributions with bounded $k$-th
moments. Roughly speaking, in the univariate case, we show that $n =
\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\alpha^2} +
\frac{1}{\alpha^{\frac{k}{k-1}}\varepsilon}\right)$ samples are necessary and
sufficient to estimate the mean to $\alpha$-accuracy under
$\varepsilon$-differential privacy, or any of its common relaxations. This
result demonstrates a qualitatively different behavior compared to estimation
absent privacy constraints, for which the sample complexity is identical for
all $k \geq 2$. We also give algorithms for the multivariate setting whose
sample complexity is a factor of $O(d)$ larger than the univariate case.

Title: Locally Private Hypothesis Selection
Authors: Sivakanth Gopi, Gautam Kamath, Janardhan Kulkarni, Aleksandar Nikolov,
  Zhiwei Steven Wu, Huanyu Zhang
Categories: cs.DS cs.CR cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML
\\
  We initiate the study of hypothesis selection under local differential
privacy. Given samples from an unknown probability distribution $p$ and a set
of $k$ probability distributions $\mathcal{Q}$, we aim to output, under the
constraints of $\varepsilon$-local differential privacy, a distribution from
$\mathcal{Q}$ whose total variation distance to $p$ is comparable to the best
such distribution. This is a generalization of the classic problem of $k$-wise
simple hypothesis testing, which corresponds to when $p \in \mathcal{Q}$, and
we wish to identify $p$. Absent privacy constraints, this problem requires
$O(\log k)$ samples from $p$, and it was recently shown that the same
complexity is achievable under (central) differential privacy. However, the
naive approach to this problem under local differential privacy would require
$\tilde O(k^2)$ samples.
  We first show that the constraint of local differential privacy incurs an
exponential increase in cost: any algorithm for this problem requires at least
$\Omega(k)$ samples. Second, for the special case of $k$-wise simple hypothesis
testing, we provide a non-interactive algorithm which nearly matches this
bound, requiring $\tilde O(k)$ samples. Finally, we provide sequentially
interactive algorithms for the general case, requiring $\tilde O(k)$ samples
and only $O(\log \log k)$ rounds of interactivity. Our algorithms are achieved
through a reduction to maximum selection with adversarial comparators, a
problem of independent interest for which we initiate study in the parallel
setting. For this problem, we provide a family of algorithms for each number of
allowed rounds of interaction $t$, as well as lower bounds showing that they
are near-optimal for every $t$. Notably, our algorithms result in exponential
improvements on the round complexity of previous methods.

Title: Heavy Tails Make Happy Buyers

Categories: cs.GT econ.TH stat.AP
\\
  In a second-price auction with i.i.d. (independent identically distributed)
bidder valuations, adding bidders increases expected buyer surplus if the
distribution of valuations has a sufficiently heavy right tail. While this does
not imply that a bidder in an auction should prefer for more bidders to join
the auction, it does imply that a bidder should prefer it in exchange for the
bidder being allowed to participate in more auctions. Also, for a heavy-tailed
valuation distribution, marginal expected seller revenue per added bidder
remains strong even when there are already many bidders.

Title: Green Security Game with Community Engagement
Authors: Taoan Huang, Weiran Shen, David Zeng, Tianyu Gu, Rohit Singh, Fei Fang
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  While game-theoretic models and algorithms have been developed to combat
illegal activities, such as poaching and over-fishing, in green security
domains, none of the existing work considers the crucial aspect of community
engagement: community members are recruited by law enforcement as informants
and can provide valuable tips, e.g., the location of ongoing illegal
activities, to assist patrols. We fill this gap and (i) introduce a novel
two-stage security game model for community engagement, with a bipartite graph
representing the informant-attacker social network and a level-$\kappa$
response model for attackers inspired by cognitive hierarchy; (ii) provide
complexity results and exact, approximate, and heuristic algorithms for
selecting informants and allocating patrollers against level-$\kappa$
($\kappa<\infty$) attackers; (iii) provide a novel algorithm to find the
optimal defender strategy against level-$\infty$ attackers, which converts the
problem of optimizing a parameterized fixed-point to a bi-level optimization
problem, where the inner level is just a linear program, and the outer level
has only a linear number of variables and a single linear constraint. We also
evaluate the algorithms through extensive experiments.

Title: The Complexity of Determining the Necessary and Possible Top-k Winners
  in Partial Voting Profiles
Authors: Aviram Imber, Benny Kimelfeld
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  When voter preferences are known in an incomplete (partial) manner, winner
determination is commonly treated as the identification of the necessary and
possible winners; these are the candidates who win in all completions or at
least one completion, respectively, of the partial voting profile. In the case
of a positional scoring rule, the winners are the candidates who receive the
maximal total score from the voters. Yet, the outcome of an election might go
beyond the absolute winners to the top-$k$ winners, as in the case of committee
selection, primaries of political parties, and ranking in recruiting. We
investigate the computational complexity of determining the necessary and
possible top-$k$ winners over partial voting profiles. Our results apply to
general classes of positional scoring rules and focus on the cases where $k$ is
given as part of the input and where $k$ is fixed.

Title: Ranking an Assortment of Products via Sequential Submodular Optimization
Authors: Arash Asadpour, Rad Niazadeh, Amin Saberi and Ali Shameli
Categories: cs.GT cs.DM cs.DS math.OC
\\
  We study an optimization problem capturing a core operational question for
online retailing platforms. Given models for the users' preferences over
products as well as the number of items they are willing to observe before
clicking on one or abandoning the search, what is the best way to rank the
relevant products in response to a search query?
  In order to capture both popularity and diversity effects, we model the
probability that a user clicks on an element from a subset of products as a
monotone submodular function of this set. We also assume that the patience
level of the users, or the number of items they are willing to observe before
clicking on one or abandoning the search, is a given random variable. Under
those assumptions, the objective functions capturing user engagement or
platform revenue can be written as a new family of submodular optimization
problems over a sequence of elements.
  We call this family of natural optimization problems sequential submodular
optimization. By building on and extending the literature on submodular
maximization subject to matroid constraints, we derive a (1-1/e) optimal
approximation algorithm for maximizing user engagement and a bi-criteria
approximation algorithm for maximizing revenue subject to a lower bound on user
engagement.

  The rising availability of digital traces provides a fertile ground for new
solutions to both, new and old problems in cities. Even though a massive data
set analyzed with Data Science methods may provide a powerful solution to a

adoption blockers such as lack of interpretability and transparency. In this
context, this paper proposes a preliminary methodology toward bridging two
disciplines, Data Science and Transportation, to solve urban problems with
methods that are suitable for adoption. The methodology is defined by four
steps where people from both disciplines go from algorithm and model definition
to the building of a potentially adoptable solution. As case study, we describe
how this methodology was applied to define a model to infer commuting trips
with mode of transportation from mobile phone data.

Title: Seeker or Avoider? User Modeling for Inspiration Deployment in
  Large-Scale Ideation
Authors: Maximilian Mackeprang, Kim Kern, Thomas Hadler, and Claudia
  M\"uller-Birn
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  People react differently to inspirations shown to them during brainstorming.
Existing research on large-scale ideation systems has investigated this
phenomenon through aspects of timing, inspiration similarity and inspiration
integration. However, these approaches do not address people's individual
preferences. In the research presented, we aim to address this lack with
regards to inspirations. In a first step, we conducted a co-located
brainstorming study with 15 participants, which allowed us to differentiate two
types of ideators: Inspiration seekers and inspiration avoiders. These insights
informed the study design of the second step, where we propose a user model for
classifying people depending on their ideator types, which was translated into
a rule-based and a random forest-based classifier. We evaluated the validity of
our user model by conducting an online experiment with 380 participants. The
results confirmed our proposed ideator types, showing that, while seekers
benefit from the availability of inspiration, avoiders were influenced
negatively. The random forest classifier enabled us to differentiate people
with a 73 \% accuracy after only three minutes of ideation. These insights show
that the proposed ideator types are a promising user model for large-scale
ideation. In future work, this distinction may help to design more personalized
large-scale ideation systems that recommend inspirations adaptively.

Title: Designing Fair AI for Managing Employees in Organizations: A Review,

Comments: 66 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Organizations are rapidly deploying artificial intelligence (AI) systems to
manage their workers. However, AI has been found at times to be unfair to
workers. Unfairness toward workers has been associated with decreased worker
effort and increased worker turnover. To avoid such problems, AI systems must
be designed to support fairness and redress instances of unfairness. Despite
the attention related to AI unfairness, there has not been a theoretical and
systematic approach to developing a design agenda. This paper addresses the
issue in three ways. First, we introduce the organizational justice theory,
three different fairness types (distributive, procedural, interactional), and
the frameworks for redressing instances of unfairness (retributive justice,
restorative justice). Second, we review the design literature that specifically
focuses on issues of AI fairness in organizations. Third, we propose a design
agenda for AI fairness in organizations that applies each of the fairness types
to organizational scenarios. Then, the paper concludes with implications for
future research.

  Despite the approaching commercialization of robo-taxis, various anxiety
factors concerning the safety of autonomous vehicles are expected to form a
large barrier against consumers' use of robo-taxi services. The purpose of this
study is to derive the various internal and external factors that contribute to

(HMI) concept to resolve such factors, by testing robo-taxi services on real,
complex urban roads. In addition, a remote system for safely testing a
robo-taxi in complex downtown areas was constructed, by adopting the Wizard of
Oz (WOZ) methodology. From the results of our tests - conducted upon 28
subjects in the central area of Seoul - 19 major anxiety factors arising from
autonomous driving were identified, and seven HMI functions to resolve such
factors were designed. The functions were evaluated and their anxiety reduction
effects verified. In addition, the various design insights required to increase
the reliability of robo-taxis were provided through quantitative and
qualitative analysis of the user experience surveys and interviews.

\\
  Recommender systems are embracing conversational technologies to obtain user
preferences dynamically, and to overcome inherent limitations of their static
models. A successful Conversational Recommender System (CRS) requires proper
handling of interactions between conversation and recommendation. We argue that
three fundamental problems need to be solved: 1) what questions to ask
regarding item attributes, 2) when to recommend items, and 3) how to adapt to
the users' online feedback. To the best of our knowledge, there lacks a unified
framework that addresses these problems.
  In this work, we fill this missing interaction framework gap by proposing a
new CRS framework named Estimation-Action-Reflection, or EAR, which consists of
three stages to better converse with users. (1) Estimation, which builds
predictive models to estimate user preference on both items and item
attributes; (2) Action, which learns a dialogue policy to determine whether to
ask attributes or recommend items, based on Estimation stage and conversation
history; and (3) Reflection, which updates the recommender model when a user
rejects the recommendations made by the Action stage. We present two
conversation scenarios on binary and enumerated questions, and conduct
extensive experiments on two datasets from Yelp and LastFM, for each scenario,
respectively. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art method CRM [32], corresponding to fewer conversation turns and
a higher level of recommendation hits.

\\
  In this paper, the problem of associating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) to virtual reality (VR) users is studied for a wireless VR network. In
particular, this problem is considered within a cellular network that employs
terahertz (THz) operated RISs acting as base stations. To provide a seamless VR
experience, high data rates and reliable low latency need to be continuously
guaranteed. To address these challenges, a novel risk-based framework based on
the entropic value-at-risk is proposed for rate optimization and reliability
performance. Furthermore, a Lyapunov optimization technique is used to
reformulate the problem as a linear weighted function, while ensuring that
higher order statistics of the queue length are maintained under a threshold.
To address this problem, given the stochastic nature of the channel, a
policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed. Since the state
space is extremely large, the policy is learned through a deep-RL algorithm. In
particular, a recurrent neural network (RNN) RL framework is proposed to
capture the dynamic channel behavior and improve the speed of conventional RL
policy-search algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the maximal queue
length resulting from the proposed approach is only within 1% of the optimal
solution. The results show a high accuracy and fast convergence for the RNN
with a validation accuracy of 91.92%.

\\
  This paper considers wireless uplink information and downlink power transfer
in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. The single-antenna
user equipments (UEs) utilize the energy harvested in the downlink to transmit
uplink pilot and information signals to the multiple-antenna access points
(APs). We consider Rician fading and maximum ratio processing based on either
linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) or least-squares (LS) channel
estimation. We derive the average harvested energy by using a practical
non-linear energy harvesting circuit model for both coherent and non-coherent
transmission schemes. Furthermore, the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) is
derived for all the considered methods and the max-min fairness problem is cast
where the optimization variables are the AP and UE power control coefficients
together with the large-scale fading decoding vectors. The objective is to
maximize the minimum SE of the UEs' under APs' and UEs' transmission power
constraints. A novel alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed
convergence and improvement at each step is proposed to solve the
highly-coupled non-convex problem.

  Vehicular communications (VCs) protocols offer useful contributions in the
context of accident prevention thanks to the transmission of alert messages.
This is even truer at road intersections since these areas exhibit higher
collision risks and accidents rate. On the other hand, non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) has been show to be a suitable candidate for five generation (5G)
of wireless systems. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the performance of
VCs protocol at road intersections, named adaptive cooperative NOMA (ACN)
protocol. The transmission occurs between a source and two destinations. The
transmission is subject to interference originated from vehicles located on the
roads. The positions of the interfering vehicles follow a Poison point process
(PPP). First, we calculate the outage probability related to ACN protocol, and
closed form expressions are obtained. Then we compare it with other existing
protocols in the literature. We show that ACN protocol offers a significant
improvement over the existing protocols in terms of outage probability,
especially at the intersection. We show that the performance of ACN protocol
increases compared to other existing protocols for high data rates. The
theoretical results are verified with Monte-Carlo simulations.

Title: Uncertainty Principle for Communication Compression in Distributed and
  Federated Learning and the Search for an Optimal Compressor
Authors: Mher Safaryan and Egor Shulgin and Peter Richt\'arik

\\
  In order to mitigate the high communication cost in distributed and federated
learning, various vector compression schemes, such as quantization,
sparsification and dithering, have become very popular. In designing a
compression method, one aims to communicate as few bits as possible, which
minimizes the cost per communication round, while at the same time attempting
to impart as little distortion (variance) to the communicated messages as
possible, which minimizes the adverse effect of the compression on the overall
number of communication rounds. However, intuitively, these two goals are
fundamentally in conflict: the more compression we allow, the more distorted
the messages become. We formalize this intuition and prove an {\em uncertainty
principle} for randomized compression operators, thus quantifying this
limitation mathematically, and {\em effectively providing lower bounds on what
might be achievable with communication compression}. Motivated by these
developments, we call for the search for the optimal compression operator. In
an attempt to take a first step in this direction, we construct a new unbiased
compression method inspired by the Kashin representation of vectors, which we
call {\em Kashin compression (KC)}. In contrast to all previously proposed
compression mechanisms, we prove that KC enjoys a {\em dimension independent}
variance bound with an explicit formula even in the regime when only a few bits
need to be communicate per each vector entry. We show how KC can be provably
and efficiently combined with several existing optimization algorithms, in all
cases leading to communication complexity improvements on previous state of the
art.

\\
  Though data augmentation has become a standard component of deep neural
network training, the underlying mechanism behind the effectiveness of these
techniques remains poorly understood. In practice, augmentation policies are
often chosen using heuristics of either distribution shift or augmentation
diversity. Inspired by these, we seek to quantify how data augmentation
improves model generalization. To this end, we introduce interpretable and
easy-to-compute measures: Affinity and Diversity. We find that augmentation
performance is predicted not by either of these alone but by jointly optimizing
the two.

  Dynamical systems can be modelled by partial differential equations and
numerical computations are used everywhere in science and engineering. In this
work, we investigate the performance of recurrent and convolutional deep neural
network architectures to predict the surface waves. The system is governed by
the Saint-Venant equations. We improve on the long-term prediction over
previous methods while keeping the inference time at a fraction of numerical
simulations. We also show that convolutional networks perform at least as well
as recurrent networks in this task. Finally, we assess the generalisation
capability of each network by extrapolating in longer time-frames and in

\\
  Chest radiographs are among the most frequently acquired images in radiology
and are often the subject of computer vision research. However, most of the
models used to classify chest radiographs are derived from openly available
deep neural networks, trained on large image-datasets. These datasets routinely
differ from chest radiographs in that they are mostly color images and contain
several possible image classes, while radiographs are greyscale images and
often only contain fewer image classes. Therefore, very deep neural networks,
which can represent more complex relationships in image-features, might not be
required for the comparatively simpler task of classifying grayscale chest
radiographs. We compared fifteen different architectures of artificial neural
networks regarding training-time and performance on the openly available
CheXpert dataset to identify the most suitable models for deep learning tasks
on chest radiographs. We could show, that smaller networks such as ResNet-34,
AlexNet or VGG-16 have the potential to classify chest radiographs as precisely
as deeper neural networks such as DenseNet-201 or ResNet-151, while being less
computationally demanding.

\\
  The multiplicative weights method is an algorithm for the problem of
prediction with expert advice. It achieves the minimax regret asymptotically if
the number of experts is large, and the time horizon is known in advance.
Optimal algorithms are also known if there are exactly two or three experts,
and the time horizon is known in advance.
  In the anytime setting, where the time horizon is not known in advance,
algorithms can be obtained by the doubling trick, but they are not optimal, let
alone practical. No minimax optimal algorithm was previously known in the
anytime setting, regardless of the number of experts.
  We design the first minimax optimal algorithm for minimizing regret in the
anytime setting. We consider the case of two experts, and prove that the
optimal regret is $\gamma \sqrt{t} / 2$ at all time steps $t$, where $\gamma$
is a natural constant that arose 35 years ago in studying fundamental
properties of Brownian motion. The algorithm is designed by considering a
continuous analogue, which is solved using ideas from stochastic calculus.

Title: SummerTime: Variable-length Time SeriesSummarization with Applications
  to PhysicalActivity Analysis
Authors: Kevin M. Amaral, Zihan Li, Wei Ding, Scott Crouter, Ping Chen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables
\\
  \textit{SummerTime} seeks to summarize globally time series signals and
provides a fixed-length, robust summarization of the variable-length time
series. Many classical machine learning methods for classification and
regression depend on data instances with a fixed number of features. As a
result, those methods cannot be directly applied to variable-length time series
data. One common approach is to perform classification over a sliding window on
the data and aggregate the decisions made at local sections of the time series
in some way, through majority voting for classification or averaging for
regression. The downside to this approach is that minority local information is
lost in the voting process and averaging assumes that each time series
measurement is equal in significance. Also, since time series can be of varying
length, the quality of votes and averages could vary greatly in cases where
there is a close voting tie or bimodal distribution of regression domain.
Summarization conducted by the \textit{SummerTime} method will be a
fixed-length feature vector which can be used in-place of the time series
dataset for use with classical machine learning methods. We use Gaussian
Mixture models (GMM) over small same-length disjoint windows in the time series
to group local data into clusters. The time series' rate of membership for each
cluster will be a feature in the summarization. The model is naturally capable
of converging to an appropriate cluster count. We compare our results to
state-of-the-art studies in physical activity classification and show
high-quality improvement by classifying with only the summarization. Finally,
we show that regression using the summarization can augment energy expenditure
estimation, producing more robust and precise results.

Title: Second Order Optimization Made Practical
Authors: Rohan Anil, Vineet Gupta, Tomer Koren, Kevin Regan and Yoram Singer
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
Comments: 18 pages, 15 figures
\\
  Optimization in machine learning, both theoretical and applied, is presently
dominated by first-order gradient methods such as stochastic gradient descent.
Second-order optimization methods that involve second-order derivatives and/or
second-order statistics of the data have become far less prevalent despite
strong theoretical properties, due to their prohibitive computation, memory and
communication costs.
  In an attempt to bridge this gap between theoretical and practical
optimization, we present a proof-of-concept distributed system implementation
of a second-order preconditioned method (specifically, a variant of full-matrix
Adagrad), that along with a few yet critical algorithmic and numerical
improvements, provides significant practical gains in convergence on
state-of-the-art deep models and gives rise to actual wall-time improvements in
practice compared to conventional first-order methods. Our design effectively
utilizes the prevalent heterogeneous hardware architecture for training deep
models which consists of a multicore CPU coupled with multiple accelerator
units. We demonstrate superior performance on very large learning problems in
machine translation where our distributed implementation runs considerably
faster than existing gradient-based methods.

Title: MaxUp: A Simple Way to Improve Generalization of Neural Network Training
Authors: Chengyue Gong, Tongzheng Ren, Mao Ye, Qiang Liu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose \emph{MaxUp}, an embarrassingly simple, highly effective technique
for improving the generalization performance of machine learning models,
especially deep neural networks. The idea is to generate a set of augmented
data with some random perturbations or transforms and minimize the maximum, or
worst case loss over the augmented data. By doing so, we implicitly introduce a
smoothness or robustness regularization against the random perturbations, and
hence improve the generation performance. For example, in the case of Gaussian
perturbation,
  \emph{MaxUp} is asymptotically equivalent to using the gradient norm of the
loss as a penalty to encourage smoothness. We test \emph{MaxUp} on a range of
tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and adversarial
certification, on which \emph{MaxUp} consistently outperforms the existing best
baseline methods, without introducing substantial computational overhead. In
particular, we improve ImageNet classification from the state-of-the-art top-1
accuracy $85.5\%$ without extra data to $85.8\%$. Code will be released soon.

\\
  Recent deep neural networks based techniques, especially those equipped with
the ability of self-adaptation in the system level such as deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), are shown to possess many advantages of optimizing robot
learning systems (e.g., autonomous navigation and continuous robot arm
control.) However, the learning-based systems and the associated models may be
threatened by the risks of intentionally adaptive (e.g., noisy sensor
confusion) and adversarial perturbations from real-world scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce timing-based adversarial strategies against a DRL-based
navigation system by jamming in physical noise patterns on the selected time
frames. To study the vulnerability of learning-based navigation systems, we
propose two adversarial agent models: one refers to online learning; another
one is based on evolutionary learning. Besides, three open-source robot
learning and navigation control environments are employed to study the
vulnerability under adversarial timing attacks. Our experimental results show
that the adversarial timing attacks can lead to a significant performance drop,
and also suggest the necessity of enhancing the robustness of robot learning
systems.

Title: oIRL: Robust Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Temporally
  Extended Actions

  Gavin McCracken, Doina Precup
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Explicit engineering of reward functions for given environments has been a
major hindrance to reinforcement learning methods. While Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) is a solution to recover reward functions from demonstrations
only, these learned rewards are generally heavily \textit{entangled} with the
dynamics of the environment and therefore not portable or \emph{robust} to
changing environments. Modern adversarial methods have yielded some success in
reducing reward entanglement in the IRL setting. In this work, we leverage one
such method, Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL), to propose an
algorithm that learns hierarchical disentangled rewards with a policy over
options. We show that this method has the ability to learn \emph{generalizable}
policies and reward functions in complex transfer learning tasks, while
yielding results in continuous control benchmarks that are comparable to those
of the state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Post-training Quantization with Multiple Points: Mixed Precision without
  Mixed Precision
Authors: Xingchao Liu, Mao Ye, Dengyong Zhou, Qiang Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  We consider the post-training quantization problem, which discretizes the
weights of pre-trained deep neural networks without re-training the model. We
propose multipoint quantization, a quantization method that approximates a
full-precision weight vector using a linear combination of multiple vectors of
low-bit numbers; this is in contrast to typical quantization methods that
approximate each weight using a single low precision number. Computationally,
we construct the multipoint quantization with an efficient greedy selection
procedure, and adaptively decides the number of low precision points on each
quantized weight vector based on the error of its output. This allows us to
achieve higher precision levels for important weights that greatly influence
the outputs, yielding an 'effect of mixed precision' but without physical mixed
precision implementations (which requires specialized hardware accelerators).
Empirically, our method can be implemented by common operands, bringing almost
no memory and computation overhead. We show that our method outperforms a range
of state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet classification and it can be
generalized to more challenging tasks like PASCAL VOC object detection.

Title: Incremental Sampling Without Replacement for Sequence Models
Authors: Kensen Shi, David Bieber, Charles Sutton
Categories: cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML
\\
  Sampling is a fundamental technique, and sampling without replacement is
often desirable when duplicate samples are not beneficial. Within machine
learning, sampling is useful for generating diverse outputs from a trained
model. We present an elegant procedure for sampling without replacement from a
broad class of randomized programs, including generative neural models that
construct outputs sequentially. Our procedure is efficient even for
exponentially-large output spaces. Unlike prior work, our approach is
incremental, i.e., samples can be drawn one at a time, allowing for increased
flexibility. We also present a new estimator for computing expectations from
samples drawn without replacement. We show that incremental sampling without
replacement is applicable to many domains, e.g., program synthesis and
combinatorial optimization.

Title: Stein Self-Repulsive Dynamics: Benefits From Past Samples
Authors: Mao Ye, Tongzheng Ren, Qiang Liu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose a new Stein self-repulsive dynamics for obtaining diversified
samples from intractable un-normalized distributions. Our idea is to introduce
Stein variational gradient as a repulsive force to push the samples of Langevin
dynamics away from the past trajectories. This simple idea allows us to
significantly decrease the auto-correlation in Langevin dynamics and hence
increase the effective sample size. Importantly, as we establish in our
theoretical analysis, the asymptotic stationary distribution remains correct
even with the addition of the repulsive force, thanks to the special properties
of the Stein variational gradient. We perform extensive empirical studies of
our new algorithm, showing that our method yields much higher sample efficiency
and better uncertainty estimation than vanilla Langevin dynamics.

Title: Improved guarantees and a multiple-descent curve for the Column Subset
  Selection Problem and the Nystr\"om method
Authors: Micha{\l} Derezi\'nski, Rajiv Khanna and Michael W. Mahoney
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The Column Subset Selection Problem (CSSP) and the Nystr\"om method are among
the leading tools for constructing small low-rank approximations of large
datasets in machine learning and scientific computing. A fundamental question
in this area is: how well can a data subset of size k compete with the best
rank k approximation? We develop techniques which exploit spectral properties
of the data matrix to obtain improved approximation guarantees which go beyond
the standard worst-case analysis. Our approach leads to significantly better
bounds for datasets with known rates of singular value decay, e.g., polynomial
or exponential decay. Our analysis also reveals an intriguing phenomenon: the
approximation factor as a function of k may exhibit multiple peaks and valleys,
which we call a multiple-descent curve. A lower bound we establish shows that
this behavior is not an artifact of our analysis, but rather it is an inherent
property of the CSSP and Nystr\"om tasks. Finally, using the example of a
radial basis function (RBF) kernel, we show that both our improved bounds and
the multiple-descent curve can be observed on real datasets simply by varying
the RBF parameter.

Title: Accelerating Reinforcement Learning with a
  Directional-Gaussian-Smoothing Evolution Strategy
Authors: Jiaxing Zhang, Hoang Tran, Guannan Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Evolution strategy (ES) has been shown great promise in many challenging
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, rivaling other state-of-the-art deep RL
methods. Yet, there are two limitations in the current ES practice that may
hinder its otherwise further capabilities. First, most current methods rely on
Monte Carlo type gradient estimators to suggest search direction, where the
policy parameter is, in general, randomly sampled. Due to the low accuracy of
such estimators, the RL training may suffer from slow convergence and require
more iterations to reach optimal solution. Secondly, the landscape of reward
functions can be deceptive and contains many local maxima, causing ES
algorithms to prematurely converge and be unable to explore other parts of the
parameter space with potentially greater rewards. In this work, we employ a
Directional Gaussian Smoothing Evolutionary Strategy (DGS-ES) to accelerate RL
training, which is well-suited to address these two challenges with its ability
to i) provide gradient estimates with high accuracy, and ii) find nonlocal
search direction which lays stress on large-scale variation of the reward
function and disregards local fluctuation. Through several benchmark RL tasks
demonstrated herein, we show that DGS-ES is highly scalable, possesses superior
wall-clock time, and achieves competitive reward scores to other popular policy
gradient and ES approaches.

Title: Safe Imitation Learning via Fast Bayesian Reward Inference from
  Preferences
Authors: Daniel S. Brown, Russell Coleman, Ravi Srinivasan, Scott Niekum
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Bayesian reward learning from demonstrations enables rigorous safety and
uncertainty analysis when performing imitation learning. However, Bayesian
reward learning methods are typically computationally intractable for complex
control problems. We propose a highly efficient Bayesian reward learning
algorithm that scales to high-dimensional imitation learning problems by first
pre-training a low-dimensional feature encoding via self-supervised tasks and
then leveraging preferences over demonstrations to perform fast Bayesian
inference. We evaluate our proposed approach on the task of learning to play
Atari games from demonstrations, without access to the game score. For Atari
games our approach enables us to generate 100,000 samples from the posterior
over reward functions in only 5 minutes using a personal laptop. Furthermore,
our proposed approach achieves comparable or better imitation learning
performance than state-of-the-art methods that only find a point estimate of
the reward function. Finally, we show that our approach enables efficient
high-confidence policy performance bounds. We show that these high-confidence
performance bounds can be used to rank the performance and risk of a variety of
evaluation policies, despite not having samples of the reward function. We also
show evidence that high-confidence performance bounds can be used to detect
reward hacking in complex imitation learning problems.

Title: GANs May Have No Nash Equilibria
Authors: Farzan Farnia, Asuman Ozdaglar
Categories: cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML
\\
  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) represent a zero-sum game between two
machine players, a generator and a discriminator, designed to learn the
distribution of data. While GANs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
several benchmark learning tasks, GAN minimax optimization still poses great
theoretical and empirical challenges. GANs trained using first-order
optimization methods commonly fail to converge to a stable solution where the
players cannot improve their objective, i.e., the Nash equilibrium of the
underlying game. Such issues raise the question of the existence of Nash
equilibrium solutions in the GAN zero-sum game. In this work, we show through
several theoretical and numerical results that indeed GAN zero-sum games may
not have any local Nash equilibria. To characterize an equilibrium notion
applicable to GANs, we consider the equilibrium of a new zero-sum game with an
objective function given by a proximal operator applied to the original
objective, a solution we call the proximal equilibrium. Unlike the Nash
equilibrium, the proximal equilibrium captures the sequential nature of GANs,
in which the generator moves first followed by the discriminator. We prove that
the optimal generative model in Wasserstein GAN problems provides a proximal
equilibrium. Inspired by these results, we propose a new approach, which we
call proximal training, for solving GAN problems. We discuss several numerical
experiments demonstrating the existence of proximal equilibrium solutions in
GAN minimax problems.

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  If NAS methods are solutions, what is the problem? Most existing NAS methods
require two-stage parameter optimization. However, performance of the same
architecture in the two stages correlates poorly. In this work, we propose a
new problem definition for NAS, task-specific end-to-end, based on this
observation. We argue that given a computer vision task for which a NAS method
is expected, this definition can reduce the vaguely-defined NAS evaluation to
i) accuracy of this task and ii) the total computation consumed to finally
obtain a model with satisfying accuracy. Seeing that most existing methods do
not solve this problem directly, we propose DSNAS, an efficient differentiable
NAS framework that simultaneously optimizes architecture and parameters with a
low-biased Monte Carlo estimate. Child networks derived from DSNAS can be
deployed directly without parameter retraining. Comparing with two-stage
methods, DSNAS successfully discovers networks with comparable accuracy (74.4%)
on ImageNet in 420 GPU hours, reducing the total time by more than 34%.

  Higher-order Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are effective for long-term
forecasting since such architectures can model higher-order correlations and
long-term dynamics more effectively. However, higher-order models are expensive
and require exponentially more parameters and operations compared with their
first-order counterparts. This problem is particularly pronounced in
multidimensional data such as videos. To address this issue, we propose
Convolutional Tensor-Train Decomposition (CTTD), a novel tensor decomposition
with convolutional operations. With CTTD, we construct Convolutional
Tensor-Train LSTM (Conv-TT-LSTM) to capture higher-order space-time
correlations in videos. We demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the
conventional (first-order) Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) as well as the
state-of-the-art ConvLSTM-based approaches in pixel-level video prediction
tasks on Moving-MNIST and KTH action datasets, but with much fewer parameters.

Title: Disentangling Controllable Object through Video Prediction Improves
  Visual Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yuanyi Zhong, Alexander Schwing, Jian Peng
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: Accepted to ICASSP 2020
\\
  In many vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) problems, the agent controls
a movable object in its visual field, e.g., the player's avatar in video games
and the robotic arm in visual grasping and manipulation. Leveraging
action-conditioned video prediction, we propose an end-to-end learning
framework to disentangle the controllable object from the observation signal.
The disentangled representation is shown to be useful for RL as additional
observation channels to the agent. Experiments on a set of Atari games with the
popular Double DQN algorithm demonstrate improved sample efficiency and game
performance (from 222.8% to 261.4% measured in normalized game scores, with
prediction bonus reward).

  We study few-shot acoustic event detection (AED) in this paper. Few-shot
learning enables detection of new events with very limited labeled data.
Compared to other research areas like computer vision, few-shot learning for
audio recognition has been under-studied. We formulate few-shot AED problem and
explore different ways of utilizing traditional supervised methods for this
setting as well as a variety of meta-learning approaches, which are
conventionally used to solve few-shot classification problem. Compared to
supervised baselines, meta-learning models achieve superior performance, thus
showing its effectiveness on generalization to new audio events. Our analysis
including impact of initialization and domain discrepancy further validate the
advantage of meta-learning approaches in few-shot AED.

Title: Leveraging Cross Feedback of User and Item Embeddings for Variational
  Autoencoder based Collaborative Filtering
Authors: Yuan Jin, He Zhao, Ming Liu, Lan Du, Yunfeng Li, Ruohua Xu, Longxiang
  Gao
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Matrix factorization (MF) has been widely applied to collaborative filtering
in recommendation systems. Its Bayesian variants can derive posterior
distributions of user and item embeddings, and are more robust to sparse
ratings. However, the Bayesian methods are restricted by their update rules for
the posterior parameters due to the conjugacy of the priors and the likelihood.
Neural networks can potentially address this issue by capturing complex
mappings between the posterior parameters and the data. In this paper, we
propose a variational auto-encoder based Bayesian MF framework. It leverages
not only the data but also the information from the embeddings to approximate
their joint posterior distribution. The approximation is an iterative procedure
with cross feedback of user and item embeddings to the others' encoders. More
specifically, user embeddings sampled in the previous iteration, alongside
their ratings, are fed back into the item-side encoders to compute the
posterior parameters for the item embeddings in the current iteration, and vice
versa. The decoder network then reconstructs the data using the MF with the
currently re-sampled user and item embeddings. We show the effectiveness of our
framework in terms of reconstruction errors across five real-world datasets. We
also perform ablation studies to illustrate the importance of the cross
feedback component of our framework in lowering the reconstruction errors and
accelerating the convergence.

Title: Bidirectional Generative Modeling Using Adversarial Gradient Estimation
Authors: Xinwei Shen, Tong Zhang, Kani Chen
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  This paper considers the general $f$-divergence formulation of bidirectional
generative modeling, which includes VAE and BiGAN as special cases. We present
a new optimization method for this formulation, where the gradient is computed
using an adversarially learned discriminator. In our framework, we show that
different divergences induce similar algorithms in terms of gradient
evaluation, except with different scaling. Therefore this paper gives a general
recipe for a class of principled $f$-divergence based generative modeling
methods. Theoretical justifications and extensive empirical studies are
provided to demonstrate the advantage of our approach over existing methods.

Title: Residual Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Mengya Gao, Yujun Shen, Quanquan Li, Chen Change Loy
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Knowledge distillation (KD) is one of the most potent ways for model
compression. The key idea is to transfer the knowledge from a deep teacher
model (T) to a shallower student (S). However, existing methods suffer from
performance degradation due to the substantial gap between the learning
capacities of S and T. To remedy this problem, this work proposes Residual
Knowledge Distillation (RKD), which further distills the knowledge by
introducing an assistant (A). Specifically, S is trained to mimic the feature
maps of T, and A aids this process by learning the residual error between them.
In this way, S and A complement with each other to get better knowledge from T.
Furthermore, we devise an effective method to derive S and A from a given model
without increasing the total computational cost. Extensive experiments show
that our approach achieves appealing results on popular classification
datasets, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Black-Box Certification with Randomized Smoothing: A Functional
  Optimization Based Framework
Authors: Dinghuai Zhang, Mao Ye, Chengyue Gong, Zhanxing Zhu, Qiang Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Randomized classifiers have been shown to provide a promising approach for
achieving certified robustness against adversarial attacks in deep learning.
However, most existing methods only leverage Gaussian smoothing noise and only
work for $\ell_2$ perturbation. We propose a general framework of adversarial
certification with non-Gaussian noise and for more general types of attacks,
from a unified functional optimization perspective. Our new framework allows us
to identify a key trade-off between accuracy and robustness via designing
smoothing distributions, helping to design new families of non-Gaussian
smoothing distributions that work more efficiently for different $\ell_p$
settings, including $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ attacks. Our proposed
methods achieve better certification results than previous works and provide a
new perspective on randomized smoothing certification.

Title: Double Explore-then-Commit: Asymptotic Optimality and Beyond
Authors: Tianyuan Jin and Pan Xu and Xiaokui Xiao and Quanquan Gu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 26 pages
\\
  We study the two-armed bandit problem with subGaussian rewards. The
explore-then-commit (ETC) strategy, which consists of an exploration phase
followed by an exploitation phase, is one of the most widely used algorithms in
a variety of online decision applications. Nevertheless, it has been shown in
Garivier et al. (2016) that ETC is suboptimal in the asymptotic sense as the
horizon grows, and thus, is worse than fully sequential strategies such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). In this paper, we argue that a variant of ETC
algorithm can actually achieve the asymptotically optimal regret bounds for
multi-armed bandit problems as UCB-type algorithms do. Specifically, we propose
a double explore-then-commit (DETC) algorithm that has two exploration and
exploitation phases. We prove that DETC achieves the asymptotically optimal
regret bound as the time horizon goes to infinity. To our knowledge, DETC is
the first non-fully-sequential algorithm that achieves such asymptotic
optimality. In addition, we extend DETC to batched bandit problems, where (i)
the exploration process is split into a small number of batches and (ii) the
round complexity is of central interest. We prove that a batched version of
DETC can achieve the asymptotic optimality with only constant round complexity.
This is the first batched bandit algorithm that can attain asymptotic
optimality in terms of both regret and round complexity.

Title: An Investigation of Interpretability Techniques for Deep Learning in
  Predictive Process Analytics
Authors: Catarina Moreira and Renuka Sindhgatta and Chun Ouyang and Peter Bruza
  and Andreas Wichert
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This paper explores interpretability techniques for two of the most
successful learning algorithms in medical decision-making literature: deep
neural networks and random forests. We applied these algorithms in a real-world
medical dataset containing information about patients with cancer, where we
learn models that try to predict the type of cancer of the patient, given their
set of medical activity records.
  We explored different algorithms based on neural network architectures using
long short term deep neural networks, and random forests. Since there is a
growing need to provide decision-makers understandings about the logic of
predictions of black boxes, we also explored different techniques that provide
interpretations for these classifiers. In one of the techniques, we intercepted
some hidden layers of these neural networks and used autoencoders in order to
learn what is the representation of the input in the hidden layers. In another,
we investigated an interpretable model locally around the random forest's
prediction.
  Results show learning an interpretable model locally around the model's
prediction leads to a higher understanding of why the algorithm is making some
decision. Use of local and linear model helps identify the features used in
prediction of a specific instance or data point. We see certain distinct
features used for predictions that provide useful insights about the type of
cancer, along with features that do not generalize well. In addition, the
structured deep learning approach using autoencoders provided meaningful
prediction insights, which resulted in the identification of nonlinear clusters
correspondent to the patients' different types of cancer.

Title: Exploiting the Full Capacity of Deep Neural Networks while Avoiding
  Overfitting by Targeted Sparsity Regularization

Comments: 10 pages, 9 figures

\\
  Overfitting is one of the most common problems when training deep neural
networks on comparatively small datasets. Here, we demonstrate that neural
network activation sparsity is a reliable indicator for overfitting which we
utilize to propose novel targeted sparsity visualization and regularization
strategies. Based on these strategies we are able to understand and counteract
overfitting caused by activation sparsity and filter correlation in a targeted
layer-by-layer manner. Our results demonstrate that targeted sparsity
regularization can efficiently be used to regularize well-known datasets and
architectures with a significant increase in image classification performance
while outperforming both dropout and batch normalization. Ultimately, our study
reveals novel insights into the contradicting concepts of activation sparsity
and network capacity by demonstrating that targeted sparsity regularization
enables salient and discriminative feature learning while exploiting the full
capacity of deep models without suffering from overfitting, even when trained
excessively.

Title: Efficient Learning of Model Weights via Changing Features During
  Training
Authors: Marcell Beregi-Kov\'acs, \'Agnes Baran and Andr\'as Hajdu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we propose a machine learning model, which dynamically changes
the features during training. Our main motivation is to update the model in a
small content during the training process with replacing less descriptive
features to new ones from a large pool. The main benefit is coming from the
fact that opposite to the common practice we do not start training a new model
from the scratch, but can keep the already learned weights. This procedure
allows the scan of a large feature pool which together with keeping the
complexity of the model leads to an increase of the model accuracy within the
same training time. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated in several
classic machine learning scenarios including linear regression and neural
network-based training. As a specific analysis towards signal processing, we
have successfully tested our approach on the database MNIST for digit
classification considering single pixel and pixel-pairs intensities as possible
features.

  Motivated by applications to distributed optimization and machine learning,

the mean of the input vectors, while minimizing communication.
  In this paper, we provide the first tight bounds for this problem, in terms
of the trade-off between the amount of communication between nodes and the
variance of the node estimates relative to the true value of the mean.

\\
  A recent line of work studies overparametrized neural networks in the "kernel
regime," i.e. when the network behaves during training as a kernelized linear
predictor, and thus training with gradient descent has the effect of finding
the minimum RKHS norm solution. This stands in contrast to other studies which
demonstrate how gradient descent on overparametrized multilayer networks can
induce rich implicit biases that are not RKHS norms. Building on an observation
by Chizat and Bach, we show how the scale of the initialization controls the
transition between the "kernel" (aka lazy) and "rich" (aka active) regimes and
affects generalization properties in multilayer homogeneous models. We also
highlight an interesting role for the width of a model in the case that the
predictor is not identically zero at initialization. We provide a complete and
detailed analysis for a family of simple depth-$D$ models that already exhibit
an interesting and meaningful transition between the kernel and rich regimes,
and we also demonstrate this transition empirically for more complex matrix
factorization models and multilayer non-linear networks.

Title: Transformer Hawkes Process
Authors: Simiao Zuo, Haoming Jiang, Zichong Li, Tuo Zhao, Hongyuan Zha
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Modern data acquisition routinely produce massive amounts of event sequence
data in various domains, such as social media, healthcare, and financial
markets. These data often exhibit complicated short-term and long-term temporal
dependencies. However, most of the existing recurrent neural network-based
point process models fail to capture such dependencies, and yield unreliable
prediction performance. To address this issue, we propose a Transformer Hawkes
Process (THP) model, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture
long-term dependencies and meanwhile enjoys computational efficiency. Numerical
experiments on various datasets show that THP outperforms existing models in
terms of both likelihood and event prediction accuracy by a notable margin.
Moreover, THP is quite general and can incorporate additional structural
knowledge. We provide a concrete example, where THP achieves improved
prediction performance for learning multiple point processes when incorporating
their relational information.

\\
  The minimization of the loss function is of paramount importance in deep
neural networks. On the other hand, many popular optimization algorithms have
been shown to correspond to some evolution equation of gradient flow type.
Inspired by the numerical schemes used for general evolution equations we
introduce a second order stochastic Runge Kutta method and show that it yields
a consistent procedure for the minimization of the loss function. In addition
it can be coupled, in an adaptive framework, with a Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) to adjust automatically the learning rate of the SGD, without the need of
any additional information on the Hessian of the loss functional. The adaptive
SGD, called SGD-G2, is successfully tested on standard datasets.

Title: Robust Optimization for Fairness with Noisy Protected Groups
Authors: Serena Wang, Wenshuo Guo, Harikrishna Narasimhan, Andrew Cotter, Maya

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Many existing fairness criteria for machine learning involve equalizing or
achieving some metric across \textit{protected groups} such as race or gender
groups. However, practitioners trying to audit or enforce such group-based
criteria can easily face the problem of noisy or biased protected group
information. We study this important practical problem in two ways. First, we
study the consequences of na{\"i}vely only relying on noisy protected groups:
we provide an upper bound on the fairness violations on the true groups $G$
when the fairness criteria are satisfied on noisy groups $\hat{G}$. Second, we
introduce two new approaches using robust optimization that, unlike the
na{\"i}ve approach of only relying on $\hat{G}$, are guaranteed to satisfy
fairness criteria on the true protected groups $G$ while minimizing a training
objective. We provide theoretical guarantees that one such approach converges
to an optimal feasible solution. Using two case studies, we empirically show
that the robust approaches achieve better true group fairness guarantees than
the na{\"i}ve approach.

  We present a novel adversarial detection and correction method for machine
learning classifiers.The detector consists of an autoencoder trained with a
custom loss function based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
classifier predictions on the original and reconstructed instances.The method
is unsupervised, easy to train and does not require any knowledge about the
underlying attack. The detector almost completely neutralises powerful attacks
like Carlini-Wagner or SLIDE on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and remains very
effective on CIFAR-10 when the attack is granted full access to the
classification model but not the defence. We show that our method is still able
to detect the adversarial examples in the case of a white-box attack where the
attacker has full knowledge of both the model and the defence and investigate
the robustness of the attack. The method is very flexible and can also be used
to detect common data corruptions and perturbations which negatively impact the
model performance. We illustrate this capability on the CIFAR-10-C dataset.

  Big Data is a massive volume of both structured and unstructured data that is
too large and it also difficult to process using traditional techniques.
Clustering algorithms have developed as a powerful learning tool that can
exactly analyze the volume of data that produced by modern applications.
Clustering in data mining is the grouping of a particular set of objects based
on their characteristics. The main aim of clustering is to classified data into
clusters such that objects are grouped in the same clusters when they are
corresponding according to similarities and features mainly. Till now, K-MEANS
is the best utilized calculation connected in a wide scope of zones to
recognize gatherings where cluster separations are a lot than between gathering
separations. Our developed algorithm works with K-MEANS for high quality
clustering during clustering from big data. Our proposed algorithm EG K-MEANS :
Extended Generation K-MEANS solves mainly three issues of K-MEANS: unhealthy
initialization, dynamic centroid selection and empty clustering. It ensures the
best way of preventing unhealthy initialization, dynamic centroid selection and
empty clustering problems for getting high quality clustering.

Title: It's Not What Machines Can Learn, It's What We Cannot Teach
Authors: Gal Yehuda, Moshe Gabel, Assaf Schuster
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  Can deep neural networks learn to solve any task, and in particular problems
of high complexity? This question attracts a lot of interest, with recent works
tackling computationally hard tasks such as the traveling salesman problem and
satisfiability. In this work we offer a different perspective on this question.
Given the common assumption that $\textit{NP} \neq \textit{coNP}$ we prove that
any polynomial-time sample generator for an $\textit{NP}$-hard problem samples,
in fact, from an easier sub-problem. We empirically explore a case study,
Conjunctive Query Containment, and show how common data generation techniques
generate biased datasets that lead practitioners to over-estimate model
accuracy. Our results suggest that machine learning approaches that require
training on a dense uniform sampling from the target distribution cannot be
used to solve computationally hard problems, the reason being the difficulty of
generating sufficiently large and unbiased training sets.

Categories: cs.LG cs.CL stat.ML
\\
  Transformers are feedforward networks that can process input tokens in
parallel. While this parallelization makes them computationally efficient, it
restricts the model from fully exploiting the sequential nature of the input -
the representation at a given layer can only access representations from lower
layers, rather than the higher level representations already built in previous
time steps. In this work, we propose the Feedback Transformer architecture that
exposes all previous representations to all future representations, meaning the
lowest representation of the current timestep is formed from the highest-level
abstract representation of the past. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks
in language modeling, neural machine translation, summarization, and
reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can improve
over Transformer baselines.

  Here we present a general framework for learning simulation, and provide a
single model implementation that yields state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging physical domains, involving fluids, rigid solids, and
deformable materials interacting with one another. Our framework---which we
term "Graph Network-based Simulators" (GNS)---represents the state of a
physical system with particles, expressed as nodes in a graph, and computes
dynamics via learned message-passing. Our results show that our model can
generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during
training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least
an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to
hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants
of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and
mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with

Title: Robustness from Simple Classifiers
Authors: Sharon Qian, Dimitris Kalimeris, Gal Kaplun, Yaron Singer
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Despite the vast success of Deep Neural Networks in numerous application
domains, it has been shown that such models are not robust i.e., they are
vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations of the input. While extensive
work has been done on why such perturbations occur or how to successfully
defend against them, we still do not have a complete understanding of
robustness. In this work, we investigate the connection between robustness and
simplicity. We find that simpler classifiers, formed by reducing the number of
output classes, are less susceptible to adversarial perturbations.
Consequently, we demonstrate that decomposing a complex multiclass model into
an aggregation of binary models enhances robustness. This behavior is
consistent across different datasets and model architectures and can be
combined with known defense techniques such as adversarial training. Moreover,
we provide further evidence of a disconnect between standard and robust
learning regimes. In particular, we show that elaborate label information can
help standard accuracy but harm robustness.

Title: Few-Shot Learning via Learning the Representation, Provably
Authors: Simon S. Du, Wei Hu, Sham M. Kakade, Jason D. Lee, Qi Lei
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  This paper studies few-shot learning via representation learning, where one
uses $T$ source tasks with $n_1$ data per task to learn a representation in
order to reduce the sample complexity of a target task for which there is only
$n_2 (\ll n_1)$ data. Specifically, we focus on the setting where there exists
a good \emph{common representation} between source and target, and our goal is
to understand how much of a sample size reduction is possible. First, we study
the setting where this common representation is low-dimensional and provide a
fast rate of $O\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}\left(\Phi\right)}{n_1T} +
\frac{k}{n_2}\right)$; here, $\Phi$ is the representation function class,
$\mathcal{C}\left(\Phi\right)$ is its complexity measure, and $k$ is the
dimension of the representation. When specialized to linear representation
functions, this rate becomes $O\left(\frac{dk}{n_1T} + \frac{k}{n_2}\right)$
where $d (\gg k)$ is the ambient input dimension, which is a substantial
improvement over the rate without using representation learning, i.e. over the
rate of $O\left(\frac{d}{n_2}\right)$. Second, we consider the setting where
the common representation may be high-dimensional but is capacity-constrained
(say in norm); here, we again demonstrate the advantage of representation
learning in both high-dimensional linear regression and neural network
learning. Our results demonstrate representation learning can fully utilize all
$n_1T$ samples from source tasks.

Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Miscalibration -- a mismatch between a model's confidence and its correctness
-- of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) makes their predictions hard to rely on.
Ideally, we want networks to be accurate, calibrated and confident. We show
that, as opposed to the standard cross-entropy loss, focal loss (Lin et al.,
2017) allows us to learn models that are already very well calibrated. When
combined with temperature scaling, whilst preserving accuracy, it yields
state-of-the-art calibrated models. We provide a thorough analysis of the
factors causing miscalibration, and use the insights we glean from this to
justify the empirically excellent performance of focal loss. To facilitate the
use of focal loss in practice, we also provide a principled approach to
automatically select the hyperparameter involved in the loss function. We
perform extensive experiments on a variety of computer vision and NLP datasets,
and with a wide variety of network architectures, and show that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and calibration in almost all cases.

Title: An end-to-end approach for the verification problem: learning the right
  distance
Authors: Joao Monteiro, Isabela Albuquerque, Jahangir Alam, R Devon Hjelm,
  Tiago Falk
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this contribution, we augment the metric learning setting by introducing a
parametric pseudo-distance, trained jointly with the encoder. Several
interpretations are thus drawn for the learned distance-like model's output. We
first show it approximates a likelihood ratio which can be used for hypothesis
tests, and that it further induces a large divergence across the joint
distributions of pairs of examples from the same and from different classes.
Evaluation is performed under the verification setting consisting of
determining whether sets of examples belong to the same class, even if such
classes are novel and were never presented to the model during training.
Empirical evaluation shows such method defines an end-to-end approach for the
verification problem, able to attain better performance than simple scorers
such as those based on cosine similarity and further outperforming widely used
downstream classifiers. We further observe training is much simplified under
the proposed approach compared to metric learning with actual distances,
requiring no complex scheme to harvest pairs of examples.

Title: Learning Fairness-aware Relational Structures
Authors: Yue Zhang, Arti Ramesh
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Accepted for publication in ECAI 2020
\\
  The development of fair machine learning models that effectively avert bias
and discrimination is an important problem that has garnered attention in
recent years. The necessity of encoding complex relational dependencies among
the features and variables for competent predictions require the development of
fair, yet expressive relational models. In this work, we introduce Fair-A3SL, a
fairness-aware structure learning algorithm for learning relational structures,
which incorporates fairness measures while learning relational graphical model
structures. Our approach is versatile in being able to encode a wide range of
fairness metrics such as statistical parity difference, overestimation,
equalized odds, and equal opportunity, including recently proposed relational
fairness measures. While existing approaches employ the fairness measures on
pre-determined model structures post prediction, Fair-A3SL directly learns the
structure while optimizing for the fairness measures and hence is able to
remove any structural bias in the model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our learned model structures when compared with the state-of-the-art fairness
models quantitatively and qualitatively on datasets representing three
different modeling scenarios: i) a relational dataset, ii) a recidivism
prediction dataset widely used in studying discrimination, and iii) a
recommender systems dataset. Our results show that Fair-A3SL can learn fair,
yet interpretable and expressive structures capable of making accurate
predictions.

Title: Simulation Of Reaction Systems By The Strictly Minimal Ones
Authors: Wen Chean Teh and Adrian Atanasiu
Categories: cs.LO

MSC-class: 68Q05, 92C40
\\
  Reaction systems, introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Rozenberg, are elementary
computational models based on biochemical reactions transpiring within the
living cells. Numerous studies focus on mathematical aspects of minimal
reaction systems due to their simplicity and rich generative power. In 2014
Manzoni, Pocas, and Porreca showed that every reaction system can be simulated
by some minimal reaction system over an extended background set. Motivated by
their work, we introduce the concepts of strictly minimal and hybrid reaction
systems. Using our new concepts, the result of Manzoni et al. is revisited and
strengthened. We also show that extension of the background set by polynomially
bounded many elements is not sufficient to guarantee the aforementioned
simulation. Finally, an analogous result for strong simulation is obtained.

\\
  This paper introduces Isabelle/Spartan, an implementation of intensional
dependent type theory with cumulative universes as an object logic in the
Isabelle proof assistant. In contrast to other systems supporting dependent
type theory, Isabelle is based on simple type theory -- yet I show how its
existing logical framework infrastructure is able to handle automation tasks
that are typically implemented on the source code level of dependently-typed
systems. I also go some way in integrating the propositions-as-types paradigm
with the declarative Isar proof language. Isabelle/Spartan supports book HoTT
and the univalence axiom, and its capabilities are demonstrated by the
formalization of foundational results from the Homotopy Type Theory book.

  The decreased size and cost of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned
Ground Vehicles (UGVs) has enabled the use of swarms of unmanned autonomous
vehicles to accomplish a variety of tasks. By utilizing swarming behaviors, it
is possible to efficiently accomplish coordinated tasks while minimizing
per-drone computational requirements. Some drones rely on decentralized
protocols that exhibit emergent behavior across the swarm. While fully
decentralized algorithms remove obvious attack vectors their susceptibility to
external influence is less understood. This work investigates the influences
that can compromise the functionality of an autonomous swarm leading to
hazardous situations and cascading vulnerabilities. When a swarm is tasked with
missions involving the safety or health of humans, external influences could
have serious consequences. The adversarial swarm in this work utilizes an
attack vector embedded within the decentralized movement algorithm of a
previously defined autonomous swarm designed to create a perimeter sentry
swarm. Various simulations confirm the adversarial swarm's ability to capture
significant portions (6-23%) of the perimeter.

Title: A table of short-period Tausworthe generators for Markov chain
  quasi-Monte Carlo
Authors: Shin Harase
Categories: math.NA cs.NA stat.CO
MSC-class: 65C10, 11K45
\\
  We consider the problem of estimating expectations by using Markov chain
Monte Carlo methods and improving the accuracy by replacing IID uniform random
points with quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) points. Recently, it has been shown that
Markov chain QMC remains consistent when the driving sequences are completely
uniformly distributed (CUD). However, the definition of CUD sequences is not
constructive, so an implementation method using short-period Tausworthe
generators (i.e., linear feedback shift register generators over the
two-element field) that approximate CUD sequences has been proposed. In this
paper, we conduct an exhaustive search of short-period Tausworthe generators
for Markov chain QMC in terms of the $t$-value, which is a criterion of
uniformity widely used in the study of QMC methods. We provide a parameter
table of Tausworthe generators and show the effectiveness in a numerical
example using Gibbs sampling.

Title: On the backward Euler method for a generalized Ait-Sahalia-type rate

Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This article aims to reveal the mean-square convergence rate of the backward
Euler method (BEM) for a generalized Ait-Sahaliz interest rate model with
Poisson jumps. The main difficulty in the analysis is caused by the
non-globally Lipschitz drift and diffusion coefficients of the model. We show
that the BEM preserves positivity of the original problem. Furthermore, we
successfully recover the mean-square convergence rate of order one-half for the
BEM. The theoretical findings are accompanied by several numerical examples.

Title: A micro-macro Markov chain Monte Carlo method for molecular dynamics
  using reaction coordinate proposals I: direct reconstruction
Authors: Hannes Vandecasteele and Giovanni Samaey

Comments: 27 pages, 10 figures
MSC-class: 65C05, 65C35, 65C40, 60J22
ACM-class: G.3; J.2
\\
  We introduce a new micro-macro Markov chain Monte Carlo method (mM-MCMC) to
sample invariant distributions of molecular dynamics systems that exhibit a
time-scale separation between the microscopic (fast) dynamics, and the
macroscopic (slow) dynamics of some low-dimensional set of reaction
coordinates. The algorithm enhances exploration of the state space in the
presence of metastability by allowing larger proposal moves at the macroscopic
level, on which a conditional accept-reject procedure is applied. Only when the
macroscopic proposal is accepted, the full microscopic state is reconstructed
from the newly sampled reaction coordinate value and is subjected to a second
accept/reject procedure. The computational gain stems from the fact that most
proposals are rejected at the macroscopic level, at low computational cost,
while microscopic states, once reconstructed, are almost always accepted. We
analytically show convergence and discuss the rate of convergence of the
proposed algorithm, and numerically illustrate its efficiency on a number of
standard molecular test cases. We also investigate the effect of the choice of
different numerical parameters on the efficiency of the resulting mM-MCMC
method.

  We introduce a family of various finite volume discretization schemes for the

on the edges. This family particularly includes the well-established
Scharfetter--Gummel discretization as well as the recently developed
square-root approximation (SQRA) scheme. We motivate this family of
discretizations both from the numerical and the modeling point of view and
provide a uniform consistency and error analysis. Our main results state that
the convergence order primarily depends on the quality of the mesh and in
second place on the quality of the weights. We show by numerical experiments
that for small gradients the choice of the optimal representative of the
discretization family is highly non-trivial while for large gradients the
Scharfetter--Gummel scheme stands out compared to the others.

Title: Recursive, parameter-free, explicitly defined interpolation nodes for
  simplices
Authors: Tobin Isaac
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  A rule for constructing interpolation nodes for $n$th degree polynomials on
the simplex is presented. These nodes are simple to define recursively from
families of 1D node sets, such as the Lobatto-Gauss-Legendre (LGL) nodes. The
resulting nodes have attractive properties: they are fully symmetric, they
match the 1D family used in construction on the edges of the simplex, and the
nodes constructed for the $(d-1)$-simplex are the boundary traces of the nodes
constructed for the $d$-simplex. When compared using the Lebesgue constant to
other explicit rules for defining interpolation nodes, the nodes recursively
constructed from LGL nodes are nearly as good as the "warp & blend" nodes of
Warburton in 2D (which, though defined differently, are very similar), and in
3D are better than other known explicit rules by increasing margins for $n >
6$. By that same measure, these recursively defined nodes are not as good as
implicitly defined nodes found by optimizing the Lebesgue constant or related
functions, but such optimal node sets have yet to be computed for the
tetrahedron. A reference python implementation has been distributed as the
`recursivenodes` package, but the simplicity of the recursive construction
makes them easy to implement.

Title: Real-Time Optimal Guidance and Control for Interplanetary Transfers
  Using Deep Networks
Authors: Dario Izzo and Ekin \"Ozt\"urk
Categories: cs.NE cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  We consider the Earth-Venus mass-optimal interplanetary transfer of a
low-thrust spacecraft and show how the optimal guidance can be represented by
deep networks in a large portion of the state space and to a high degree of
accuracy. Imitation (supervised) learning of optimal examples is used as a
network training paradigm. The resulting models are suitable for an on-board,
real-time, implementation of the optimal guidance and control system of the
spacecraft and are called G&CNETs. A new general methodology called Backward
Generation of Optimal Examples is introduced and shown to be able to
efficiently create all the optimal state action pairs necessary to train
G&CNETs without solving optimal control problems. With respect to previous
works, we are able to produce datasets containing a few orders of magnitude
more optimal trajectories and obtain network performances compatible with real
missions requirements. Several schemes able to train representations of either
the optimal policy (thrust profile) or the value function (optimal mass) are
proposed and tested. We find that both policy learning and value function
learning successfully and accurately learn the optimal thrust and that a
spacecraft employing the learned thrust is able to reach the target conditions
orbit spending only 2 permil more propellant than in the corresponding
mathematically optimal transfer. Moreover, the optimal propellant mass can be
predicted (in case of value function learning) within an error well within 1%.
All G&CNETs produced are tested during simulations of interplanetary transfers
with respect to their ability to reach the target conditions optimally starting
from nominal and off-nominal conditions.

  Accurate short-term wind speed forecasting is essential for large-scale
integration of wind power generation. However, the seasonal and stochastic
characteristics of wind speed make forecasting a challenging task. This study
uses a new hybrid evolutionary approach that uses a popular evolutionary search
algorithm, CMA-ES, to tune the hyper-parameters of two Long short-term
memory(LSTM) ANN models for wind prediction. The proposed hybrid approach is
trained on data gathered from an offshore wind turbine installed in a Swedish
wind farm located in the Baltic Sea. Two forecasting horizons including
ten-minutes ahead (absolute short term) and one-hour ahead (short term) are
considered in our experiments. Our experimental results indicate that the new
approach is superior to five other applied machine learning models, i.e.,
polynomial neural network (PNN), feed-forward neural network (FNN), nonlinear
autoregressive neural network (NAR) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS), as measured by five performance criteria.

\\
  Emerging applications -- cloud computing, the internet of things, and
augmented/virtual reality -- need responsive, available, secure, ubiquitous,
and scalable datacenter networks. Network management currently uses simple,
per-packet, data-plane heuristics (e.g., ECMP and sketches) under an
intelligent, millisecond-latency control plane that runs data-driven
performance and security policies. However, to meet users' quality-of-service
expectations in a modern data center, networks must operate intelligently at
line rate. In this paper, we present Taurus, an intelligent data plane capable
of machine-learning inference at line rate. Taurus adds custom hardware based
on a map-reduce abstraction to programmable network devices, such as switches
and NICs; this new hardware uses pipelined and SIMD parallelism for fast
inference. Our evaluation of a Taurus-enabled switch ASIC -- supporting several
real-world benchmarks -- shows that Taurus operates three orders of magnitude
faster than a server-based control plane, while increasing area by 24% and
latency, on average, by 178 ns. On the long road to self-driving networks,
Taurus is the equivalent of adaptive cruise control: deterministic rules steer
flows, while machine learning tunes performance and heightens security.

Title: D-DNS: Towards Re-Decentralizing the DNS
Authors: Austin Hounsel, Kevin Borgolte, Paul Schmitt, Nick Feamster
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Nearly all Internet services rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve
human-readable names to IP addresses. However, the content of DNS queries and
responses can reveal private information, from the websites that a user visits
to the types of devices on a network. Industry and researchers have responded
in recent years to the inherent privacy risks of DNS information, focusing on
tunneling DNS traffic over encrypted transport and application protocols. One
such mechanism, DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) places DNS functionality directly in the
web browser itself to direct DNS queries to a trusted recursive resolver
(resolver) over encrypted HTTPS connections. The DoH architecture solves
privacy risks (e.g., eavesdropping) but introduces new concerns, including
those associated with the centralization of DNS queries to the operator of a
single recursive resolver that is selected by the browser vendor. It also
introduces potential performance problems: if a client's resolver is not
proximal to the content delivery network that ultimately serves the content,
the CDN may fail to optimally localize the client. In this paper, we revisit
the trend towards centralized DNS and explore re-decentralizing the critical
Internet protocol, such that clients might leverage multiple DNS resolvers when
resolving domain names and retrieving content. We propose and evaluate several
candidate decentralized architectures, laying the groundwork for future
research to explore decentralized, encrypted DNS architectures that strike a
balance between privacy and performance.

Title: Multicast eMBB and Bursty URLLC Service Multiplexing in a CoMP-Enabled
  RAN
Authors: Peng Yang, Xing Xi, Yaru Fu, Tony Q. S. Quek, Xianbin Cao, Dapeng Wu
Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
\\
  This paper is concerned with slicing a radio access network (RAN) for
simultaneously serving two typical 5G and beyond use cases, i.e., enhanced
mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable and low latency communications
(URLLC). Although many researches have been conducted to tackle this issue, few
of them have considered the impact of bursty URLLC. The bursty characteristic
of URLLC traffic may significantly increase the difficulty of RAN slicing on
the aspect of ensuring a ultra-low packet blocking probability. To reduce the
packet blocking probability, we re-visit the structure of physical resource
blocks (PRBs) orchestrated for bursty URLLC traffic in the time-frequency plane
based on our theoretical results. Meanwhile, we formulate the problem of
slicing a RAN enabling coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmissions for
multicast eMBB and bursty URLLC service multiplexing as a multi-timescale
optimization problem. The goal of this problem is to maximize multicast eMBB
and bursty URLLC slice utilities, subject to physical resource constraints. To
mitigate this thorny multi-timescale problem, we transform it into multiple
single timescale problems by exploring the fundamental principle of a sample
average approximation (SAA) technique. Next, an iterative algorithm with
provable performance guarantees is developed to obtain solutions to these
single timescale problems and aggregate the obtained solutions into those of
the multi-timescale problem. We also design a prototype for the CoMP-enabled
RAN slicing system incorporating with multicast eMBB and bursty URLLC traffic
and compare the proposed iterative algorithm with the state-of-the-art
algorithm to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

  The next generation of wireless networks will feature a more flexible radio
access design, integrating multiple new technological solutions (e.g., massive
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), millimeter waves) to satisfy different
verticals and use cases. The performance evaluation of these networks will
require more complex models to represent the interactions of different
components of the networks accurately. For example, channel models, which are
of paramount importance to precisely characterize the behavior of such systems,
need to account for multi-antenna systems and new frequency bands. This paper
presents the ns-3 implementation of a spatial channel model for the 0.5-100 GHz
spectrum, following the 3GPP Technical Report 38.901. The code, designed to be
flexible and easily extensible, is integrated in ns-3's antenna, propagation
and spectrum models, and offers the support for the investigation of future
wireless systems in ns-3.

\\
  Reduction to the satisfiablility problem for constrained Horn clauses (CHCs)
is a widely studied approach to automated program verification. The current
CHC-based methods for pointer-manipulating programs, however, are not very
scalable. This paper proposes a novel translation of pointer-manipulating Rust
programs into CHCs, which clears away pointers and heaps by leveraging
ownership. We formalize the translation for a simplified core of Rust and prove
its correctness. We have implemented a prototype verifier for a subset of Rust
and confirmed the effectiveness of our method.

Title: Learning to Represent Programs with Property Signatures
Authors: Augustus Odena, Charles Sutton
Categories: cs.PL cs.LG
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  We introduce the notion of property signatures, a representation for programs
and program specifications meant for consumption by machine learning
algorithms. Given a function with input type $\tau_{in}$ and output type
$\tau_{out}$, a property is a function of type: $(\tau_{in}, \tau_{out})
\rightarrow \texttt{Bool}$ that (informally) describes some simple property of
the function under consideration. For instance, if $\tau_{in}$ and $\tau_{out}$
are both lists of the same type, one property might ask `is the input list the
same length as the output list?'. If we have a list of such properties, we can
evaluate them all for our function to get a list of outputs that we will call
the property signature. Crucially, we can `guess' the property signature for a
function given only a set of input/output pairs meant to specify that function.
We discuss several potential applications of property signatures and show
experimentally that they can be used to improve over a baseline synthesizer so
that it emits twice as many programs in less than one-tenth of the time.

Title: Symbolic Execution Game Semantics
Authors: Yu-Yang Lin, Nikos Tzevelekos
Categories: cs.PL
Comments: 41 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We present a framework for symbolically executing and model checking
higher-order programs with external (open) methods. We focus on the
client-library paradigm and in particular we aim to check libraries with
respect to any definable client. We combine traditional symbolic execution
techniques with operational game semantics to build a symbolic execution
semantics that captures arbitrary external behaviour. We prove the symbolic
semantics to be sound and complete. This yields a bounded technique by imposing
bounds on the depth of recursion and callbacks. We provide an implementation of
our technique in the K framework and showcase its performance on a custom
benchmark based on higher-order coding errors such as reentrancy bugs.

Title: Contact-less manipulation of millimeter-scale objects via ultrasonic
  levitation
Authors: Jared Nakahara, Boling Yang and Joshua R. Smith
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 8 pages, 8 figures, submitted to the 8th IEEE RAS/EMBS International
  Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics
\\
  Although general purpose robotic manipulators are becoming more capable at
manipulating various objects, their ability to manipulate millimeter-scale
objects are usually very limited. On the other hand, ultrasonic levitation
devices have been shown to levitate a large range of small objects, from
polystyrene balls to living organisms. By controlling the acoustic force
fields, ultrasonic levitation devices can compensate for robot manipulator
positioning uncertainty and control the grasping force exerted on the target
object. The material agnostic nature of acoustic levitation devices and their
ability to dexterously manipulate millimeter-scale objects make them appealing
as a grasping mode for general purpose robots. In this work, we present an
ultrasonic, contact-less manipulation device that can be attached to or picked
up by any general purpose robotic arm, enabling millimeter-scale manipulation
with little to no modification to the robot itself. This device is capable of
performing the very first phase-controlled picking action on acoustically
reflective surfaces. With the manipulator placed around the target object, the
manipulator can grasp objects smaller in size than the robot's positioning
uncertainty, trap the object to resist air currents during robot movement, and
dexterously hold a small and fragile object, like a flower bud. Due to the
contact-less nature of the ultrasound-based gripper, a camera positioned to
look into the cylinder can inspect the object without occlusion, facilitating
accurate visual feature extraction.

Title: The Surprising Effectiveness of Linear Models for Visual Foresight in
  Object Pile Manipulation
Authors: H.J. Terry Suh and Russ Tedrake
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Submitted to Workshop on Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR)
  2020
\\
  In this paper, we tackle the problem of pushing piles of small objects into a
desired target set using visual feedback. Unlike conventional single-object
manipulation pipelines, which estimate the state of the system parametrized by
pose, the underlying physical state of this system is difficult to observe from
images. Thus, we take the approach of reasoning directly in the space of
images, and acquire the dynamics of visual measurements in order to synthesize
a visual-feedback policy. We present a simple controller using an image-space
Lyapunov function, and evaluate the closed-loop performance using three
different class of models for image prediction: deep-learning-based models for
image-to-image translation, an object-centric model obtained from treating each
pixel as a particle, and a switched-linear system where an action-dependent
linear map is used. Through results in simulation and experiment, we show that
for this task, a linear model works surprisingly well -- achieving better
prediction error, downstream task performance, and generalization to new
environments than the deep models we trained on the same amount of data. We
believe these results provide an interesting example in the spectrum of models
that are most useful for vision-based feedback in manipulation, considering
both the quality of visual prediction, as well as compatibility with rigorous
methods for control design and analysis.

Title: Learning Precise 3D Manipulation from Multiple Uncalibrated Cameras
Authors: Iretiayo Akinola, Jacob Varley and Dmitry Kalashnikov
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA
  2020)
\\
  In this work, we present an effective multi-view approach to closed-loop
end-to-end learning of precise manipulation tasks that are 3D in nature. Our
method learns to accomplish these tasks using multiple statically placed but
uncalibrated RGB camera views without building an explicit 3D representation
such as a pointcloud or voxel grid. This multi-camera approach achieves
superior task performance on difficult stacking and insertion tasks compared to
single-view baselines. Single view robotic agents struggle from occlusion and
challenges in estimating relative poses between points of interest. While full
3D scene representations (voxels or pointclouds) are obtainable from registered
output of multiple depth sensors, several challenges complicate operating off
such explicit 3D representations. These challenges include imperfect camera
calibration, poor depth maps due to object properties such as reflective
surfaces, and slower inference speeds over 3D representations compared to 2D
images. Our use of static but uncalibrated cameras does not require
camera-robot or camera-camera calibration making the proposed approach easy to
setup and our use of \textit{sensor dropout} during training makes it resilient
to the loss of camera-views after deployment.

  3D semantic segmentation is one of the key tasks for autonomous driving
system. Recently, deep learning models for 3D semantic segmentation task have
been widely researched, but they usually require large amounts of training
data. However, the present datasets for 3D semantic segmentation are lack of
point-wise annotation, diversiform scenes and dynamic objects.
  In this paper, we propose the SemanticPOSS dataset, which contains 2988
various and complicated LiDAR scans with large quantity of dynamic instances.
The data is collected in Peking University and uses the same data format as
SemanticKITTI. In addition, we evaluate several typical 3D semantic
segmentation models on our SemanticPOSS dataset. Experimental results show that
SemanticPOSS can help to improve the prediction accuracy of dynamic objects as
people, car in some degree. SemanticPOSS will be published at

  The compliant nature of soft wearable robots makes them ideal for complex
multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) joints, but also introduce additional
structural nonlinearities. Intuitive control of these wearable robots requires
robust sensing to overcome the inherent nonlinearities. This paper presents a
joint kinematics estimator for a bio-inspired multi-DoF shoulder exosuit
capable of compensating the encountered nonlinearities. To overcome the
nonlinearities and hysteresis inherent to the soft and compliant nature of the
suit, we developed a deep learning-based method to map the sensor data to the
joint space. The experimental results show that the new learning-based
framework outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while
achieving 12ms inference time using only a GPU-based edge-computing device. The
effectiveness of our combined exosuit and learning framework is demonstrated
through real-time teleoperation with a simulated NAO humanoid robot.

\\
  This study has developed a fault-tolerant controller that is able to recover
a quadrotor from arbitrary initial orientations and angular velocities, despite
the complete failure of a rotor. This cascaded control method includes a
position/altitude controller, an almost-global convergence attitude controller,
and a control allocation method based on quadratic programming. As a major
novelty, a constraint of undesirable angular velocity is derived and fused into
the control allocator, which significantly improves the recovery performance.
For validation, we have conducted a set of Monte-Carlo simulation to test the
reliability of the proposed method of recovering the quadrotor from arbitrary
initial attitude/rate conditions. In addition, real-life flight tests have been
performed. The results demonstrate that the post-failure quadrotor can recover
after being casually tossed into the air.

Comments: Paper accepted for 45th International Conference on Acoustics,

\\
  Whether literally or suggestively, the concept of soundscape is alluded in
both modern and ancient music. In this study, we examine whether we can analyze
and compare Western and Chinese classical music based on soundscape models. We
addressed this question through a comparative study. Specifically, corpora of
Western classical music excerpts (WCMED) and Chinese classical music excerpts
(CCMED) were curated and annotated with emotional valence and arousal through a
crowdsourcing experiment. We used a sound event detection (SED) and soundscape
emotion recognition (SER) models with transfer learning to predict the
perceived emotion of WCMED and CCMED. The results show that both SER and SED
models could be used to analyze Chinese and Western classical music. The fact
that SER and SED work better on Chinese classical music emotion recognition
provides evidence that certain similarities exist between Chinese classical
music and soundscape recordings, which permits transferability between machine
learning models.

Title: How to Evaluate Solutions in Pareto-based Search-Based Software
  Engineering? A Critical Review and Methodological Guidance
Authors: Tao Chen and Miqing Li and Xin Yao
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
Comments: submitted, 7 figures and 5 tables
\\
  With modern requirements, there is an increasing tendancy of considering
multiple objectives/criteria simultaneously in many Software Engineering (SE)
scenarios. Such a multi-objective optimization scenario comes with an important
issue --- how to evaluate the outcome of optimization algorithms, which
typically is a set of incomparable solutions (i.e., being Pareto non-dominated
to each other). This issue can be challenging for the SE community,
particularly for practitioners of Search-Based SE (SBSE). On one hand,
multiobjective optimization may still be relatively new to SE/SBSE researchers,
who may not be able to identify right evaluation methods for their problems. On
the other hand, simply following the evaluation methods for general
multiobjective optimisation problems may not be appropriate for specific SE
problems, especially when the problem nature or decision maker's preferences
are explicitly/implicitly available. This has been well echoed in the
literature by various inappropriate/inadequate selection and
inaccurate/misleading uses of evaluation methods. In this paper, we carry out a
critical review of quality evaluation for multiobjective optimization in SBSE.
We survey 717 papers published between 2009 and 2019 from 36 venues in 7
repositories, and select 97 prominent studies, through which we identify five
important but overlooked issues in the area. We then conduct an in-depth
analysis of quality evaluation indicators and general situations in SBSE,
which, together with the identified issues, enables us to provide a
methodological guidance to selecting and using evaluation methods in different
SBSE scenarios.

  Organizations use diverse types of security solutions to prevent
cyberattacks. Multiple vendors provide security solutions developed using
heterogeneous technologies and paradigms. Hence, it is a challenging rather
impossible to easily make security solutions to work an integrated fashion.
Security orchestration aims at smoothly integrating multivendor security tools
that can effectively and efficiently interoperate to support security staff of
a Security Operation Centre (SOC). Given the increasing role and importance of
security orchestration, there has been an increasing amount of literature on
different aspects of security orchestration solutions. However, there has been
no effort to systematically review and analyze the reported solutions. We
report a Multivocal Literature Review that has systematically selected and
reviewed both academic and grey (blogs, web pages, white papers) literature on
different aspects of security orchestration published from January 2007 until
July 2017. The review has enabled us to provide a working definition of
security orchestration and classify the main functionalities of security
orchestration into three main areas: unification, orchestration, and
automation. We have also identified the core components of a security
orchestration platform and categorized the drivers of security orchestration
based on technical and socio-technical aspects. We also provide a taxonomy of
security orchestration based on the execution environment, automation strategy,
deployment type, mode of task and resource type. This review has helped us to
reveal several areas of further research and development in security
orchestration.

Title: Fast Evaluation of Link Prediction by Random Sampling of Unobserved
  Links
Authors: Jingwei Wang, Yunlong Ma, Zeyu Chen, Xuheng Wang, Yuan Yun, Weiming
  Shen, and Min Liu
Categories: cs.SI physics.soc-ph
\\
  The evaluation of a link prediction algorithm requires to estimate the
possibility of the existence of all unobserved links in a network. However, the
number of unobserved links grows exponentially with the increase of the number
of nodes, which limits link prediction in large networks. In this paper, we
propose a new evaluation scheme for link prediction algorithms, i.e., link
prediction with random sampling. We use this method to evaluate the performance
of twelve link predictors on ten real-world networks of different contexts and
scales. The results show that the performance ranking of these algorithms is
not affected by randomly sampling a very small part from unobserved links for
experiments, whether using AUC or the precision metric. Moreover, this sampling
method can reduce the computational complexity for the evaluation of link
prediction algorithms from O(n^2) to O(n) in large networks. Our findings show
that the proposed scheme is a fast and effective evaluation method.

Title: Curating Social Media Data
Authors: Kushal Vaghani
Categories: cs.SI cs.CV
Comments: Masters by Research Thesis
\\
  Social media platforms have empowered the democratization of the pulse of
people in the modern era. Due to its immense popularity and high usage, data
published on social media sites (e.g., Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr) is a rich
ocean of information. Therefore data-driven analytics of social imprints has
become a vital asset for organisations and governments to further improve their
products and services. However, due to the dynamic and noisy nature of social
media data, performing accurate analysis on raw data is a challenging task. A
key requirement is to curate the raw data before fed into analytics pipelines.
This curation process transforms the raw data into contextualized data and
knowledge. We propose a data curation pipeline, namely CrowdCorrect, to enable
analysts cleansing and curating social data and preparing it for reliable
analytics. Our pipeline provides an automatic feature extraction from a corpus
of social media data using existing in-house tools. Further, we offer a
dual-correction mechanism using both automated and crowd-sourced approaches.
The implementation of this pipeline also includes a set of tools for
automatically creating micro-tasks to facilitate the contribution of crowd
users in curating the raw data. For the purposes of this research, we use
Twitter as our motivational social media data platform due to its popularity.

decision process (MDP), where the goal is to reach a target state that
minimizes a given cost function. First, we consider ARES, an approximation
algorithm for generating optimal plans (action sequences) that take an initial
state of an MDP to a state whose cost is below a specified (convergence)
threshold. ARES uses Particle Swarm Optimization, with adaptive sizing for both
the receding horizon and the particle swarm. Inspired by Importance Splitting,
the length of the horizon and the number of particles are chosen such that at
least one particle reaches a next-level state. ARES can alternatively be viewed
as a model-predictive control (MPC) algorithm that utilizes an adaptive
receding horizon, aka Adaptive MPC (AMPC). We next present Distributed AMPC
(DAMPC), a distributed version of AMPC that works with local neighborhoods. We
introduce adaptive neighborhood resizing, whereby the neighborhood size is
determined by the cost-based Lyapunov function evaluated over a global system
state. Our experiments show that DAMPC can perform almost as well as
centralized AMPC, while using only local information and a form of distributed
consensus in each time step. Finally, inspired by security attacks on
cyber-physical systems, we introduce controller-attacker games (CAG), where two
players, a controller and an attacker, have antagonistic objectives. We
formulate a special case of CAG called V-formation games, where the attacker's
goal is to prevent the controller from attaining V-formation. We demonstrate
how adaptation in the design of the controller helps in overcoming certain
attacks.

Title: Towards Critical Clearing Time Sensitivity for DAE Systems with
  Singularity
Authors: Chetan Mishra, Chen Wang, Xin Xu, Virgilio A. Centeno
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: To be presented in IEEE PES General Meeting 2020 in Montreal
\\
  Standard power system models are parameter dependent differential-algebraic
equation (DAE) type. Following a transient event, voltage collapse can occur as
a bifurcation of the transient load flow solutions which is marked by the
system trajectory reaching a singular surface in state space where the voltage
causality is lost. If a fault is expected to cause voltage collapse, preventive
control decisions such as changes in AVR settings need to be taken in order to
get enhance the system stability. In this regard, the knowledge of sensitivity
of critical clearing time (CCT) to controllable system parameters can be of
great help. The quasi-stability boundary of DAE systems is more complicated
than ODE systems where in addition to unstable equilibrium points (UEP) and
periodic orbits, singularity plays an important role making the problem
challenging. The stability boundary is then made up of a number of dynamically
distinct components. In the present work, we derive the expression for CCT
sensitivity for the phenomenon where the critical fault-on trajectory
intersects the singular surface itself which is one such component forming the
stability boundary. The results are illustrated for a small test system in
order to gain visual insights.

Title: H-AP Deployment for Joint Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in
  Smart Cities

\\
  With the wireless communication being more various in the future, it's
becoming challenging to prolong the lifetime of many battery powered devices,
since frequently replacing their batteries is a cumbersome job. An hybrid
access point (H-AP) is capable of simultaneously operating wireless information
transfer (WIT) and wireless energy transfer (WET) by exploiting the radio
frequency (RF) signals. By jointly considering both the mobility of the user
and the popularity of the sites, we focus on the design of the H-AP's
deployment scheme. Specifically, a mobility model of the grid based city
streets is exploited for characterising the users' movements. Based on this
mobility model, the impact of the deployment site's popularity on the WIT and
WET efficiencies is firstly analysed. Then, an H-AP deployment scheme for
striking a balance between the WIT and the WET efficiencies is proposed, which
is regarded as the B-deployment scheme. The simulation results demonstrate that
the B-deployment scheme is more flexible for satisfying diverse requirement of
the WIT and WET efficiencies.

Title: Multi-Agent Learning in Double-side Auctions forPeer-to-peer Energy
  Trading
Authors: Zibo Zhao, Andrew L. Liu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar panels, are
growing rapidly and are reshaping power systems. To promote DERs,
feed-in-tariff (FIT) is usually adopted by utilities to pay DER owners certain
fixed rates for supplying energy to the grid. An alternative to FIT is a market
based approach; i.e., consumers and DER owners trade energy in an auction-based
peer-to-peer (P2P) market, and the rates are determined by a market clearing
process. However, the complexities in sucha market and agents' bounded
rationality may invalidate many well-established theories on auction design and
hinder market development. To address this issue, we propose an automated
bidding framework in a repeated auction based on multi-armed bandit learning,
which aims to minimize each bidder's cumulative regret. Numerical results
indicate convergence of such a multi-agent learning game to a steady-state. For
comparison purpose, we apply the framework to three different auction designs
to realize a P2P market.

Title: Hybrid Symbolic-Numeric Library for Power System Modeling and Analysis
Authors: Hantao Cui, Fangxing Li, Kevin Tomsovic
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  With the recent booming of open-source packages for scientific computing,
power system simulation is being revisited to reduce the programming efforts
for modeling and analysis. Existing open-source tools require manual efforts to
develop code for numerical equations and sparse Jacobians. Such work would
become repeated, tedious and error-prone when a researcher needs to implement
complex models with a large number of equations. This paper proposes a
two-layer hybrid library consisted of a symbolic layer for descriptive modeling
and a numeric layer for vector-based numerical computation. The open-source
library allows to implement differential-algebraic equation (DAE)-based models
with descriptive equation strings, which will be transparently generated into
robust and fast numerical simulation code and high-quality documentation. Thus,
complex models and systems can be easily prototyped and simulated. These two
layers are decoupled so that the symbolic layer is case-independent, and
existing numerical programs can be reused. Implementation details in indexing,
equation evaluation, and Jacobian evaluation are discussed. Case studies
present a) implementation of turbine governor model TGOV1, b) the power flow
calculation for MATPOWER test systems, c) the validation against commercial
software using Kundur's two-area system with GENROU, EXDC2 and TGOV1 models,
and d) the full eigenvalue analysis for Kundur's system.

Title: Approximating Gromov-Hausdorff Distance in Euclidean Space
Authors: Sushovan Majhi, Jeffrey Vitter, and Carola Wenk
Categories: math.MG cs.CG
\\
  The Gromov-Hausdorff distance $(d_{GH})$ proves to be a useful distance
measure between shapes. In order to approximate $d_{GH}$ for compact subsets
$X,Y\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, we look into its relationship with $d_{H,iso}$, the
infimum Hausdorff distance under Euclidean isometries. As already known for
dimension $d\geq 2$, the $d_{H,iso}$ cannot be bounded above by a constant
factor times $d_{GH}$. For $d=1$, however, we prove that
$d_{H,iso}\leq\frac{5}{4}d_{GH}$. We also show that the bound is tight. In
effect, this gives rise to an $O(n\log{n})$-time algorithm to approximate
$d_{GH}$ with an approximation factor of $\left(1+\frac{1}{4}\right)$.

Title: An Easy-to-implement Construction for $(k,n)$-threshold Progressive
  Visual Secret Sharing Schemes
Authors: Hong-Bin Chen, Hsiang-Chun Hsu and Justie Su-Tzu Juan
Categories: math.CO cs.CR
Comments: 16 pages
\\
  Visual cryptography encrypts the secret image into $n$ shares (transparency)
so that only stacking a qualified number of shares can recover the secret image
by the human visual system while no information can be revealed without a large
enough number of shares. This paper investigates the $(k,n)$-threshold Visual
Secret Sharing (VSS) model, where one can decrypt the original image by
stacking at least $k$ shares and get nothing with less than $k$ shares. There
are two main approaches in the literature: codebook-based schemes and
random-grid-based schemes; the former is the case of this paper. In general,
given any positive integers $k$ and $n$, it is not easy to design a valid
scheme for the $(k,n)$-threshold VSS model. In this paper, we propose a simple
strategy to construct an efficient scheme for the $(k,n)$-threshold VSS model
for any positive integers $2\leq k\leq n$. The crucial idea is to establish a
seemingly unrelated connection between the $(k,n)$-threshold VSS scheme and a
mathematical structure -- the generalized Pascal's triangle. This paper
improves and extends previous results in four aspects: Our construction offers
a unified viewpoint and covers several known results;
  The resulting scheme has a progressive-viewing property that means the more
shares being stacked together the clearer the secret image would be revealed.
  The proposed scheme can be constructed explicitly and efficiently based on
the generalized Pascal's triangle without a computer. Performance of the
proposed scheme is comparable with known results.

Title: Quantum secret sharing using GHZ state qubit positioning and selective
  qubits strategy for secret reconstruction
Authors: Farhan Musanna, Sanjeev Kumar
Categories: quant-ph cs.CR cs.IT math.IT
\\
  The work presents a novel quantum secret sharing strategy based on GHZ
product state sharing between three parties. The dealer, based on the classical
information to be shared, toggles his qubit and shares the product state. The
other parties make their Bell measurements and collude to reconstruct the
secret. Unlike the other protocols, this protocol does not involve the entire
initial state reconstruction, rather uses selective qubits to discard the
redundant qubits at the time of reconstruction to decrypt the secret. The
protocol also allows for security against malicious attacks by an adversary
without affecting the integrity of the secret. The security of the protocol
lies in the fact that each party's correct announcement of their measurement is
required for reconstruction, failing which the reconstruction process is
jeopardized, thereby ascertaining the $(3,3)$ scheme which can further be
extended for a $(n,n)$ scheme.

Title: Learning Intermediate Features of Object Affordances with a
  Convolutional Neural Network

DOI: 10.32470/CCN.2018.1134-0
\\
  Our ability to interact with the world around us relies on being able to
infer what actions objects afford -- often referred to as affordances. The
neural mechanisms of object-action associations are realized in the visuomotor
pathway where information about both visual properties and actions is
integrated into common representations. However, explicating these mechanisms
is particularly challenging in the case of affordances because there is hardly
any one-to-one mapping between visual features and inferred actions. To better
understand the nature of affordances, we trained a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN) to recognize affordances from images and to learn the underlying
features or the dimensionality of affordances. Such features form an underlying
compositional structure for the general representation of affordances which can
then be tested against human neural data. We view this representational
analysis as the first step towards a more formal account of how humans perceive
and interact with the environment.

  We present a hybrid method that performs the complete parcellation of the
cerebral cortex of an individual, based on the connectivity information of the
white matter fibers from a whole-brain tractography dataset. The method
consists of five steps, first intra-subject clustering is performed on the
brain tractography. The fibers that make up each cluster are then intersected
with the cortical mesh and then filtered to discard outliers. In addition, the
method resolves the overlapping between the different intersection regions
(sub-parcels) throughout the cortex efficiently. Finally, a post-processing is
done to achieve more uniform sub-parcels. The output is the complete labeling
of cortical mesh vertices, representing the different cortex sub-parcels, with
strong connections to other sub-parcels. We evaluated our method with measures
of brain connectivity such as functional segregation (clustering coefficient),
functional integration (characteristic path length) and small-world. Results in
five subjects from ARCHI database show a good individual cortical parcellation
for each one, composed of about 200 subparcels per hemisphere and complying
with these connectivity measures.

Title: Greedy Policy Search: A Simple Baseline for Learnable Test-Time
  Augmentation

Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Test-time data augmentation---averaging the predictions of a machine learning
model across multiple augmented samples of data---is a widely used technique
that improves the predictive performance. While many advanced learnable data
augmentation techniques have emerged in recent years, they are focused on the
training phase. Such techniques are not necessarily optimal for test-time
augmentation and can be outperformed by a policy consisting of simple crops and
flips. The primary goal of this paper is to demonstrate that test-time
augmentation policies can be successfully learned too. We~introduce
\emph{greedy policy search} (GPS), a simple but high-performing method for
learning a policy of test-time augmentation. We demonstrate that augmentation
policies learned with GPS achieve superior predictive performance on image
classification problems, provide better in-domain uncertainty estimation, and
improve the robustness to domain shift.

Title: Detection and Classification of Astronomical Targets with Deep Neural

Comments: Submitted to AAS journal. The complete code can be downloaded from

  ordinary sky survey telescopes can also be processed with this code, however
  more annotated images are required to train the neural network
\\
  Wide field small aperture telescopes are widely used in optical transient
observations. Detection and classification of astronomical targets are
important steps during data post-processing stage. In this paper, we propose an
astronomical targets detection and classification framework based on deep
neural networks for images obtained by wide field small aperture telescopes.
Our framework adopts the concept of the Faster R-CNN and we further propose to
use a modified Resnet-50 as backbone network and a Feature Pyramid Network
architecture in our framework. To improve the effectiveness of our framework
and reduce requirements of large training set, we propose to use simulated
images to train our framework at first and then modify weights of our framework
with only a small amount of training data through transfer-learning. We have
tested our framework with simulated and real observation data. Comparing with
the traditional source detection and classification framework, our framework
has better detection ability, particularly for dim astronomical targets. To
unleash the transient detection ability of wide field small aperture
telescopes, we further propose to install our framework in embedded devices to
achieve real-time astronomical targets detection abilities.

Title: Asynchronous parallel adaptive stochastic gradient methods
Authors: Yangyang Xu, Colin Sutcher-Shepard, Yibo Xu, Jie Chen
Categories: math.OC cs.DC cs.NA math.NA
\\
  Stochastic gradient methods (SGMs) are the predominant approaches to train
deep learning models. The adaptive versions (e.g., Adam and AMSGrad) have been
extensively used in practice, partly because they achieve faster convergence
than the non-adaptive versions while incurring little overhead. On the other
hand, asynchronous (async) parallel computing has exhibited much better
speed-up over its synchronous (sync) counterpart. However, async-parallel
implementation has only been demonstrated to the non-adaptive SGMs. The
difficulty for adaptive SGMs originates from the second moment term that makes
the convergence analysis challenging with async updates. In this paper, we
propose an async-parallel adaptive SGM based on AMSGrad. We show that the
proposed method inherits the convergence guarantee of AMSGrad for both convex
and non-convex problems, if the staleness (also called delay) caused by
asynchrony is bounded. Our convergence rate results indicate a nearly linear
parallelization speed-up if $\tau=o(K^{\frac{1}{4}})$, where $\tau$ is the
staleness and $K$ is the number of iterations. The proposed method is tested on
both convex and non-convex machine learning problems, and the numerical results
demonstrate its clear advantages over the sync counterpart.

Title: Constant Depth Bucket Brigade Quantum RAM Circuits Without Introducing
  Ancillae
Authors: Alexandru Paler, Oumarou Oumarou, Robert Basmadjian
Categories: quant-ph cs.ET
Comments: comments are welcome
\\
  Bucket brigade quantum RAM (QRAM) circuits were proposed for their
advantageous addressing of the memory. Another quality of these circuits is
that queries, once the addresses are determined, can be parallelised.
State-of-the-art error-corrected formulation of these circuits, however, had to
be decomposed into the Clifford+T gate set, and the initial parallelism was
lost in the process. By using advantageous Toffoli gate decompositions, and
without introducing any additional ancilla qubits, we construct bucket brigade
QRAM circuits with a constant depth. This depth is reduced from
$\mathcal{O}(2^q)$ to $\mathcal{O}(q)$ in the worst case when the QRAM is
queried for any of its $2^q$ memory cells being used. Incidentally, the
presented construction has a T-count more than half smaller, compared to the
existing Clifford+T formulations. The construction shows that, if quantum
hardware would not be a scarce resource, exponential query speed ups are
possible compared to state-of-the art quantum read-only memory (QROM) designs.

\\
  Realistic recordings of soundscapes often have multiple sound events
co-occurring, such as car horns, engine and human voices. Sound event retrieval
is a type of content-based search aiming at finding audio samples, similar to
an audio query based on their acoustic or semantic content. State of the art
sound event retrieval models have focused on single-label audio recordings,
with only one sound event occurring, rather than on multi-label audio
recordings (i.e., multiple sound events occur in one recording). To address
this latter problem, we propose different Deep Learning architectures with a
Siamese-structure and a Pairwise Presence Matrix. The networks are trained and
evaluated using the SONYC-UST dataset containing both single- and multi-label
soundscape recordings. The performance results show the effectiveness of our
proposed model.

Title: Distributionally Robust Bayesian Optimization

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at AISTATS 2020
\\
  Robustness to distributional shift is one of the key challenges of
contemporary machine learning. Attaining such robustness is the goal of
distributionally robust optimization, which seeks a solution to an optimization
problem that is worst-case robust under a specified distributional shift of an
uncontrolled covariate. In this paper, we study such a problem when the
distributional shift is measured via the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). For
the setting of zeroth-order, noisy optimization, we present a novel
distributionally robust Bayesian optimization algorithm (DRBO). Our algorithm
provably obtains sub-linear robust regret in various settings that differ in
how the uncertain covariate is observed. We demonstrate the robust performance
of our method on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Title: Neural Bayes: A Generic Parameterization Method for Unsupervised
  Representation Learning
Authors: Devansh Arpit, Huan Wang, Caiming Xiong, Richard Socher, Yoshua Bengio
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We introduce a parameterization method called Neural Bayes which allows
computing statistical quantities that are in general difficult to compute and
opens avenues for formulating new objectives for unsupervised representation
learning. Specifically, given an observed random variable $\mathbf{x}$ and a
latent discrete variable $z$, we can express $p(\mathbf{x}|z)$,
$p(z|\mathbf{x})$ and $p(z)$ in closed form in terms of a sufficiently
expressive function (Eg. neural network) using our parameterization without
restricting the class of these distributions. To demonstrate its usefulness, we
develop two independent use cases for this parameterization:
  1. Mutual Information Maximization (MIM): MIM has become a popular means for
self-supervised representation learning. Neural Bayes allows us to compute
mutual information between observed random variables $\mathbf{x}$ and latent
discrete random variables $z$ in closed form. We use this for learning image
representations and show its usefulness on downstream classification tasks.
  2. Disjoint Manifold Labeling: Neural Bayes allows us to formulate an
objective which can optimally label samples from disjoint manifolds present in
the support of a continuous distribution. This can be seen as a specific form
of clustering where each disjoint manifold in the support is a separate
cluster. We design clustering tasks that obey this formulation and empirically
show that the model optimally labels the disjoint manifolds. Our code is
available at \url{https://github.com/salesforce/NeuralBayes}

reaction pathways is an important task for scientific discovery that takes
decades and requires lots of expert knowledge. This work presents a neural
network approach for discovering unknown reaction pathways from concentration
time series data. The neural network denoted as Chemical Reaction Neural
Network (CRNN), is designed to be equivalent to chemical reaction networks by
following the fundamental physics laws of the Law of Mass Action and Arrhenius
Law. The CRNN is physically interpretable, and its weights correspond to the
reaction pathways and rate constants of the chemical reaction network. Then,
inferencing the reaction pathways and the rate constants are accomplished by
training the equivalent CRNN via stochastic gradient descent. The approach
precludes the need for expert knowledge in proposing candidate reactions, such
that the inference is autonomous and applicable to new systems for which there
is no existing empirical knowledge to propose reaction pathways. The physical
interpretability also makes the CRNN not only capable of fitting the data for a
given system but also developing knowledge of unknown pathways that could be
generalized to similar chemical systems. Finally, the approach is applied to
several chemical systems in chemical engineering and biochemistry to
demonstrate its robustness and generality.

Title: GenDICE: Generalized Offline Estimation of Stationary Values
Authors: Ruiyi Zhang, Bo Dai, Lihong Li, Dale Schuurmans
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  An important problem that arises in reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo
methods is estimating quantities defined by the stationary distribution of a
Markov chain. In many real-world applications, access to the underlying
transition operator is limited to a fixed set of data that has already been
collected, without additional interaction with the environment being available.
We show that consistent estimation remains possible in this challenging
scenario, and that effective estimation can still be achieved in important
applications. Our approach is based on estimating a ratio that corrects for the
discrepancy between the stationary and empirical distributions, derived from
fundamental properties of the stationary distribution, and exploiting
constraint reformulations based on variational divergence minimization. The
resulting algorithm, GenDICE, is straightforward and effective. We prove its
consistency under general conditions, provide an error analysis, and
demonstrate strong empirical performance on benchmark problems, including
off-line PageRank and off-policy policy evaluation.

Title: Development of accurate human head models for personalized
  electromagnetic dosimetry using deep learning
Authors: Essam A. Rashed and Jose Gomez-Tames and Akimasa Hirata
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML
Journal-ref: NeuroImage 202, pp. 116132, 2019
DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116132
\\
  The development of personalized human head models from medical images has
become an important topic in the electromagnetic dosimetry field, including the
optimization of electrostimulation, safety assessments, etc. Human head models
are commonly generated via the segmentation of magnetic resonance images into
different anatomical tissues. This process is time consuming and requires
special experience for segmenting a relatively large number of tissues. Thus,
it is challenging to accurately compute the electric field in different
specific brain regions. Recently, deep learning has been applied for the
segmentation of the human brain. However, most studies have focused on the
segmentation of brain tissue only and little attention has been paid to other
tissues, which are considerably important for electromagnetic dosimetry.
  In this study, we propose a new architecture for a convolutional neural
network, named ForkNet, to perform the segmentation of whole human head
structures, which is essential for evaluating the electrical field distribution
in the brain. The proposed network can be used to generate personalized head
models and applied for the evaluation of the electric field in the brain during
transcranial magnetic stimulation. Our computational results indicate that the
head models generated using the proposed network exhibit strong matching with
those created via manual segmentation in an intra-scanner segmentation task.

Title: Inverted-File k-Means Clustering: Performance Analysis
Authors: Kazuo Aoyama, Kazumi Saito, and Tetsuo Ikeda
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 15 pages, 20 figures
\\
  This paper presents an inverted-file k-means clustering algorithm (IVF)
suitable for a large-scale sparse data set with potentially numerous classes.
Given such a data set, IVF efficiently works at high-speed and with low memory
consumption, which keeps the same solution as a standard Lloyd's algorithm. The
high performance arises from two distinct data representations. One is a sparse
expression for both the object and mean feature vectors. The other is an
inverted-file data structure for a set of the mean feature vectors. To confirm
the effect of these representations, we design three algorithms using distinct
data structures and expressions for comparison. We experimentally demonstrate
that IVF achieves better performance than the designed algorithms when they are
applied to large-scale real document data sets in a modern computer system
equipped with superscalar out-of-order processors and a deep hierarchical
memory system. We also introduce a simple yet practical clock-cycle per
instruction (CPI) model for speed-performance analysis. Analytical results
reveal that IVF suppresses three performance degradation factors: the numbers
of cache misses, branch mispredictions, and the completed instructions.

Title: Using Deep Learning to Improve Ensemble Smoother: Applications to
  Subsurface Characterization
Authors: Jiangjiang Zhang, Qiang Zheng, Laosheng Wu, Lingzao Zeng
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
\\
  Ensemble smoother (ES) has been widely used in various research fields to
reduce the uncertainty of the system-of-interest. However, the commonly-adopted
ES method that employs the Kalman formula, that is, ES$_\text{(K)}$, does not
perform well when the probability distributions involved are non-Gaussian. To
address this issue, we suggest to use deep learning (DL) to derive an
alternative update scheme for ES in complex data assimilation applications.
Here we show that the DL-based ES method, that is, ES$_\text{(DL)}$, is more
general and flexible. In this new update scheme, a high volume of training data
are generated from a relatively small-sized ensemble of model parameters and
simulation outputs, and possible non-Gaussian features can be preserved in the
training data and captured by an adequate DL model. This new variant of ES is
tested in two subsurface characterization problems with or without Gaussian
assumptions. Results indicate that ES$_\text{(DL)}$ can produce similar (in the
Gaussian case) or even better (in the non-Gaussian case) results compared to
those from ES$_\text{(K)}$. The success of ES$_\text{(DL)}$ comes from the
power of DL in extracting complex (including non-Gaussian) features and
learning nonlinear relationships from massive amounts of training data.
Although in this work we only apply the ES$_\text{(DL)}$ method in parameter
estimation problems, the proposed idea can be conveniently extended to analysis
of model structural uncertainty and state estimation in real-time forecasting
studies.

Title: Deep Sigma Point Processes
Authors: Martin Jankowiak, Geoff Pleiss, Jacob R. Gardner
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 14 pages, 10 figures
\\
  We introduce Deep Sigma Point Processes, a class of parametric models
inspired by the compositional structure of Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs). Deep
Sigma Point Processes (DSPPs) retain many of the attractive features of
(variational) DGPs, including mini-batch training and predictive uncertainty
that is controlled by kernel basis functions. Importantly, since DSPPs admit a
simple maximum likelihood inference procedure, the resulting predictive
distributions are not degraded by any posterior approximations. In an extensive
empirical comparison on univariate and multivariate regression tasks we find
that the resulting predictive distributions are significantly better calibrated
than those obtained with other probabilistic methods for scalable regression,
including variational DGPs--often by as much as a nat per datapoint.

Authors: Feng Liu, Wenkai Xu, Jie Lu, Guangquan Zhang, Arthur Gretton, D. J.

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME
\\
  We propose a class of kernel-based two-sample tests, which aim to determine
whether two sets of samples are drawn from the same distribution. Our tests are
constructed from kernels parameterized by deep neural nets, trained to maximize
test power. These tests adapt to variations in distribution smoothness and
shape over space, and are especially suited to high dimensions and complex
data. By contrast, the simpler kernels used in prior kernel testing work are
spatially homogeneous, and adaptive only in lengthscale. We explain how this
scheme includes popular classifier-based two-sample tests as a special case,
but improves on them in general. We provide the first proof of consistency for
the proposed adaptation method, which applies both to kernels on deep features
and to simpler radial basis kernels or multiple kernel learning. In
experiments, we establish the superior performance of our deep kernels in
hypothesis testing on benchmark and real-world data. The code of our
deep-kernel-based two sample tests is available at

Title: Computing Valid p-value for Optimal Changepoint by Selective Inference
  using Dynamic Programming
Authors: Vo Nguyen Le Duy, Hiroki Toda, Ryota Sugiyama, Ichiro Takeuchi
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME
\\
  There is a vast body of literature related to methods for detecting
changepoints (CP). However, less attention has been paid to assessing the
statistical reliability of the detected CPs. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method to perform statistical inference on the significance of the CPs,
estimated by a Dynamic Programming (DP)-based optimal CP detection algorithm.
Based on the selective inference (SI) framework, we propose an exact
(non-asymptotic) approach to compute valid p-values for testing the
significance of the CPs. Although it is well-known that SI has low statistical
power because of over-conditioning, we address this disadvantage by introducing
parametric programming techniques. Then, we propose an efficient method to
conduct SI with the minimum amount of conditioning, leading to high statistical
power. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
through which we offer evidence that our proposed method is more powerful than
existing methods, has decent performance in terms of computational efficiency,
and provides good results in many practical applications.

Title: PIANO: A Fast Parallel Iterative Algorithm for Multinomial and Sparse
  Multinomial Logistic Regression
Authors: R. Jyothi and P. Babu
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.OC
\\
  Multinomial Logistic Regression is a well-studied tool for classification and
has been widely used in fields like image processing, computer vision and,
bioinformatics, to name a few. Under a supervised classification scenario, a
Multinomial Logistic Regression model learns a weight vector to differentiate
between any two classes by optimizing over the likelihood objective. With the
advent of big data, the inundation of data has resulted in large dimensional
weight vector and has also given rise to a huge number of classes, which makes
the classical methods applicable for model estimation not computationally
viable. To handle this issue, we here propose a parallel iterative algorithm:
Parallel Iterative Algorithm for MultiNomial LOgistic Regression (PIANO) which
is based on the Majorization Minimization procedure, and can parallely update
each element of the weight vectors. Further, we also show that PIANO can be
easily extended to solve the Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression problem -
an extensively studied problem because of its attractive feature selection
property. In particular, we work out the extension of PIANO to solve the Sparse
Multinomial Logistic Regression problem with l1 and l0 regularizations. We also
prove that PIANO converges to a stationary point of the Multinomial and the
Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression problems. Simulations were conducted to
compare PIANO with the existing methods, and it was found that the proposed
algorithm performs better than the existing methods in terms of speed of
convergence.

Title: Learning Optimal Classification Trees: Strong Max-Flow Formulations
Authors: Sina Aghaei, Andres Gomez, Phebe Vayanos
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.OC
\\
  We consider the problem of learning optimal binary classification trees.
Literature on the topic has burgeoned in recent years, motivated both by the
empirical suboptimality of heuristic approaches and the tremendous improvements
in mixed-integer programming (MIP) technology. Yet, existing approaches from
the literature do not leverage the power of MIP to its full extent. Indeed,
they rely on weak formulations, resulting in slow convergence and large
optimality gaps. To fill this gap in the literature, we propose a flow-based
MIP formulation for optimal binary classification trees that has a stronger
linear programming relaxation. Our formulation presents an attractive
decomposable structure. We exploit this structure and max-flow/min-cut duality
to derive a Benders' decomposition method, which scales to larger instances. We
conduct extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark datasets on
which we show that our proposed approaches are 50 times faster than
state-of-the art MIP-based techniques and improve out of sample performance up
to 13.8%.

Title: Adaptive Covariate Acquisition for Minimizing Total Cost of
  Classification
Authors: Daniel Andrade and Yuzuru Okajima
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.AP
\\
  In some applications, acquiring covariates comes at a cost which is not
negligible. For example in the medical domain, in order to classify whether a
patient has diabetes or not, measuring glucose tolerance can be expensive.
Assuming that the cost of each covariate, and the cost of misclassification can
be specified by the user, our goal is to minimize the (expected) total cost of
classification, i.e. the cost of misclassification plus the cost of the
acquired covariates. We formalize this optimization goal using the
(conditional) Bayes risk and describe the optimal solution using a recursive
procedure. Since the procedure is computationally infeasible, we consequently
introduce two assumptions: (1) the optimal classifier can be represented by a
generalized additive model, (2) the optimal sets of covariates are limited to a
sequence of sets of increasing size. We show that under these two assumptions,
a computationally efficient solution exists. Furthermore, on several medical
datasets, we show that the proposed method achieves in most situations the
lowest total costs when compared to various previous methods. Finally, we
weaken the requirement on the user to specify all misclassification costs by
allowing the user to specify the minimally acceptable recall (target recall).
Our experiments confirm that the proposed method achieves the target recall
while minimizing the false discovery rate and the covariate acquisition costs
better than previous methods.

Title: Sparse principal component regression via singular value decomposition
  approach
Authors: Shuichi Kawano
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME
Comments: 30 pages
\\
  Principal component regression (PCR) is a two-stage procedure: the first
stage performs principal component analysis (PCA) and the second stage
constructs a regression model whose explanatory variables are replaced by
principal components obtained by the first stage. Since PCA is performed by
using only explanatory variables, the principal components have no information
about the response variable. To address the problem, we propose a one-stage
procedure for PCR in terms of singular value decomposition approach. Our
approach is based upon two loss functions, a regression loss and a PCA loss,
with sparse regularization. The proposed method enables us to obtain principal
component loadings that possess information about both explanatory variables
and a response variable. An estimation algorithm is developed by using
alternating direction method of multipliers. We conduct numerical studies to
show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  Decision trees are popular Classification and Regression tools and, when
small-sized, easy to interpret. Traditionally, a greedy approach has been used
to build the trees, yielding a very fast training process; however, controlling
sparsity (a proxy for interpretability) is challenging. In recent studies,
optimal decision trees, where all decisions are optimized simultaneously, have
shown a better learning performance, especially when oblique cuts are
implemented. In this paper, we propose a continuous optimization approach to
build sparse optimal classification trees, based on oblique cuts, with the aim
of using fewer predictor variables in the cuts as well as along the whole tree.
Both types of sparsity, namely local and global, are modeled by means of
regularizations with polyhedral norms. The computational experience reported
supports the usefulness of our methodology. In all our data sets, local and
global sparsity can be improved without harming classification accuracy. Unlike
greedy approaches, our ability to easily trade in some of our classification
accuracy for a gain in global sparsity is shown.

Title: Kernel Conditional Moment Test via Maximum Moment Restriction
Authors: Krikamol Muandet, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Jonas K\"ubler
Categories: math.ST cs.LG econ.EM stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  We propose a new family of specification tests called kernel conditional
moment (KCM) tests. Our tests are built on conditional moment embeddings
(CMME)---a novel representation of conditional moment restrictions in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). After transforming the conditional
moment restrictions into a continuum of unconditional counterparts, the test
statistic is defined as the maximum moment restriction within the unit ball of
the RKHS. We show that the CMME fully characterizes the original conditional
moment restrictions, leading to consistency in both hypothesis testing and
parameter estimation. The proposed test also has an analytic expression that is
easy to compute as well as closed-form asymptotic distributions. Our empirical
studies show that the KCM test has a promising finite-sample performance
compared to existing tests.

  In this paper, we propose to enhance learned image compression systems with a
richer probability model for the latent variables. Previous works model the
latents with a Gaussian or a Laplace distribution. Inspired by binary
arithmetic coding , we propose to signal the latents with three binary values
and one integer, with different probability models. A relaxation method is
designed to perform gradient-based training. The richer probability model
results in a better entropy coding leading to lower rate. Experiments under the
Challenge on Learned Image Compression (CLIC) test conditions demonstrate that
this method achieves 18% rate saving compared to Gaussian or Laplace models.

low-compute neural speech enhancement models. We also explore the effects of

\\
  Likelihood-free (a.k.a. simulation-based) inference problems are inverse
problems with expensive, or intractable, forward models. ODE inverse problems
are commonly treated as likelihood-free, as their forward map has to be
numerically approximated by an ODE solver. This, however, is not a fundamental
constraint but just a lack of functionality in classic ODE solvers, which do
not return a likelihood but a point estimate. To address this shortcoming, we
employ Gaussian ODE filtering (a probabilistic numerical method for ODEs) to
construct a local Gaussian approximation to the likelihood. This approximation
yields tractable estimators for the gradient and Hessian of the
(log-)likelihood. Insertion of these estimators into existing gradient-based
optimization and sampling methods engenders new solvers for ODE inverse
problems. We demonstrate that these methods outperform standard likelihood-free
approaches on three benchmark-systems.

Title: Efficiently sampling functions from Gaussian process posteriors
Authors: James T. Wilson and Viacheslav Borovitskiy and Alexander Terenin and
  Peter Mostowsky and Marc Peter Deisenroth
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO
\\
  Gaussian processes are the gold standard for many real-world modeling
problems, especially in cases where a model's success hinges upon its ability
to faithfully represent predictive uncertainty. These problems typically exist
as parts of larger frameworks, where quantities of interest are ultimately
defined by integrating over posterior distributions. However, these algorithms'
inner workings rarely allow for closed-form integration, giving rise to a need
for Monte Carlo methods. Despite substantial progress in scaling up Gaussian
processes to large training sets, methods for accurately generating draws from
their posterior distributions still scale cubically in the number of test
locations. We identify a decomposition of Gaussian processes that naturally
lends itself to scalable sampling by enabling us to efficiently generate
functions that accurately represent their posteriors. Building off of this
factorization, we propose decoupled sampling, an easy-to-use and
general-purpose approach for fast posterior sampling. Decoupled sampling works
as a drop-in strategy that seamlessly pairs with sparse approximations to
Gaussian processes to afford scalability both during training and at test time.
In a series of experiments designed to test competing sampling schemes'
statistical behaviors and practical ramifications, we empirically show that
functions drawn using decoupled sampling faithfully represent Gaussian process
posteriors at a fraction of the usual cost.

  We found that the real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) detection of viral RNA from sputum or nasopharyngeal swab has a
relatively low positive rate in the early stage to determine COVID-19 (named by
the World Health Organization). The manifestations of computed tomography (CT)
imaging of COVID-19 had their own characteristics, which are different from
other types of viral pneumonia, such as Influenza-A viral pneumonia. Therefore,
clinical doctors call for another early diagnostic criteria for this new type
of pneumonia as soon as possible.This study aimed to establish an early
screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral
pneumonia and healthy cases with pulmonary CT images using deep learning
techniques. The candidate infection regions were first segmented out using a
3-dimensional deep learning model from pulmonary CT image set. These separated
images were then categorized into COVID-19, Influenza-A viral pneumonia and
irrelevant to infection groups, together with the corresponding confidence
scores using a location-attention classification model. Finally the infection
type and total confidence score of this CT case were calculated with Noisy-or
Bayesian function.The experiments result of benchmark dataset showed that the
overall accuracy was 86.7 % from the perspective of CT cases as a whole.The
deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early
screening of COVID-19 patients and demonstrated to be a promising supplementary
diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors.

\\
  We study generalised linear regression and classification for a synthetically
generated dataset encompassing different problems of interest, such as learning
with random features, neural networks in the lazy training regime, and the
hidden manifold model. We consider the high-dimensional regime and using the
replica method from statistical physics, we provide a closed-form expression
for the asymptotic generalisation performance in these problems, valid in both
the under- and over-parametrised regimes and for a broad choice of generalised
linear model loss functions. In particular, we show how to obtain analytically
the so-called double descent behaviour for logistic regression with a peak at
the interpolation threshold, we illustrate the superiority of orthogonal
against random Gaussian projections in learning with random features, and
discuss the role played by correlations in the data generated by the hidden
manifold model. Beyond the interest in these particular problems, the
theoretical formalism introduced in this manuscript provides a path to further
extensions to more complex tasks.

Title: A Multiclass Classification Approach to Label Ranking
Authors: Stephan Cl\'emen\c{c}on, Robin Vogel
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures
\\
  In multiclass classification, the goal is to learn how to predict a random
label $Y$, valued in $\mathcal{Y}=\{1,\; \ldots,\; K \}$ with $K\geq 3$, based
upon observing a r.v. $X$, taking its values in $\mathbb{R}^q$ with $q\geq 1$
say, by means of a classification rule $g:\mathbb{R}^q\to \mathcal{Y}$ with
minimum probability of error $\mathbb{P}\{Y\neq g(X) \}$. However, in a wide
variety of situations, the task targeted may be more ambitious, consisting in
sorting all the possible label values $y$ that may be assigned to $X$ by
decreasing order of the posterior probability $\eta_y(X)=\mathbb{P}\{Y=y \mid X
\}$. This article is devoted to the analysis of this statistical learning
problem, halfway between multiclass classification and posterior probability
estimation (regression) and referred to as label ranking here. We highlight the
fact that it can be viewed as a specific variant of ranking median regression
(RMR), where, rather than observing a random permutation $\Sigma$ assigned to
the input vector $X$ and drawn from a Bradley-Terry-Luce-Plackett model with
conditional preference vector $(\eta_1(X),\; \ldots,\; \eta_K(X))$, the sole
information available for training a label ranking rule is the label $Y$ ranked
on top, namely $\Sigma^{-1}(1)$. Inspired by recent results in RMR, we prove
that under appropriate noise conditions, the One-Versus-One (OVO) approach to
multiclassification yields, as a by-product, an optimal ranking of the labels
with overwhelming probability. Beyond theoretical guarantees, the relevance of
the approach to label ranking promoted in this article is supported by
experimental results.

\\
  We discuss the application of Neural Spline Flows, a neural density
estimation algorithm, to the likelihood-free inference problem of the
measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters in Long Base Line neutrino
experiments. A method adapted to physics parameter inference is developed and
applied to the case of the disappearance muon neutrino analysis at the T2K

Title: Online Batch Decision-Making with High-Dimensional Covariates
Authors: Chi-Hua Wang, Guang Cheng
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We propose and investigate a class of new algorithms for sequential decision
making that interacts with \textit{a batch of users} simultaneously instead of
\textit{a user} at each decision epoch. This type of batch models is motivated
by interactive marketing and clinical trial, where a group of people are
treated simultaneously and the outcomes of the whole group are collected before
the next stage of decision. In such a scenario, our goal is to allocate a batch
of treatments to maximize treatment efficacy based on observed high-dimensional
user covariates. We deliver a solution, named \textit{\texttt{Teamwork LASSO
Bandit} algorithm}, that resolves a batch version of explore-exploit dilemma
via switching between teamwork stage and selfish stage during the whole
decision process. This is made possible based on statistical properties of
LASSO estimate of treatment efficacy that adapts to a sequence of batch
observations. In general, a rate of optimal allocation condition is proposed to
delineate the exploration and exploitation trade-off on the data collection
scheme, which is sufficient for LASSO to identify the optimal treatment for
observed user covariates. An upper bound on expected cumulative regret of the
proposed algorithm is provided.

Title: PBS-calculus: A Graphical Language for Quantum-Controlled Computations
Authors: Alexandre Cl\'ement and Simon Perdrix
Categories: quant-ph cs.LO
\\
  We introduce the PBS-calculus to represent and reason on quantum computations
involving polarising beam splitters (PBS for short). PBS-diagrams can be used
to represent various schemes including quantum-controlled computations, which
are known to have multiple computational and communication advantages over
classically ordered models like quantum circuits. The PBS-calculus is equipped
with an equational theory, which is proved to be sound and complete: two
diagrams are representing the same quantum evolution if and only if one can be
transformed into the other using the rules of the PBS-calculus. Moreover, we
show that the equational theory is minimal. Finally, we show that any
PBS-diagram involving only unitary matrices can be transformed into a diagram
without feedback loop.

Title: Blind Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment with Viewport Oriented
  Graph Convolutional Networks
Authors: Jiahua Xu, Wei Zhou and Zhibo Chen
Categories: eess.IV cs.MM
\\
  Quality assessment of omnidirectional images has become increasingly urgent
due to the rapid growth of virtual reality applications. Different from
traditional 2D images and videos, omnidirectional contents can provide
consumers with freely changeable viewports and a larger field of view covering
the $360^{\circ}\times180^{\circ}$ spherical surface, which makes the objective
quality assessment of omnidirectional images more challenging. In this paper,
motivated by the characteristics of the human vision system (HVS) and the
viewing process of omnidirectional contents, we propose a novel Viewport
oriented Graph Convolution Network (VGCN) for blind omnidirectional image
quality assessment (IQA). Generally, observers tend to give the subjective
rating of a 360-degree image after passing and aggregating different viewports
information when browsing the spherical scenery. Therefore, in order to model
the mutual dependency of viewports in the omnidirectional image, we build a
spatial viewport graph. Specifically, the graph nodes are first defined with
selected viewports with higher probabilities to be seen, which is inspired by
the HVS that human beings are more sensitive to structural information. Then,
these nodes are connected by spatial relations to capture interactions among
them. Finally, reasoning on the proposed graph is performed via graph
convolutional networks. Moreover, we simultaneously obtain global quality using
the entire omnidirectional image without viewport sampling to boost the
performance according to the viewing experience. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art full-reference
and no-reference IQA metrics on two public omnidirectional IQA databases.

Title: Parameter selection in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
  tomography
Authors: Kati Niinim\"aki and Matti Hanhela and Ville Kolehmainen
Categories: eess.IV cs.NA math.NA
\\
  In this work we consider the image reconstruction problem of sparsely sampled
dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DCE-MRI is a
technique for acquiring a series of MR images before, during and after
intravenous contrast agent administration, and it is used to study
microvascular structure and perfusion. To overcome the ill-posedness of the
related spatio-temporal inverse problem, we use regularization. In
regularization one of the main problems is how to determine the regularization
parameter which controls the balance between data fitting term and
regularization term. Most methods for selecting this parameter require the
computation of a large number of estimates even in stationary problems. In
dynamic imaging, the parameter selection is even more time consuming since
separate regularization parameters are needed for the spatial and temporal
regularization functionals. In this work, we study the possibility of using the
S-curve with DCE-MR data. We select the spatial regularization parameter using
the S-curve, leaving the temporal regularization parameter as the only free
parameter in the reconstruction problem. In this work, the temporal
regularization parameter is selected manually by computing reconstructions with
several values of the temporal regularization parameter.

Title: Source Conditions for non-quadratic Tikhonov Regularisation
Authors: Markus Grasmair
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
MSC-class: 47A52, 49N45, 65J20,
\\
  In this paper we consider convex Tikhonov regularisation for the solution of
linear operator equations on Hilbert spaces. We show that standard fractional
source conditions can be employed in order to derive convergence rates in terms
of the Bregman distance, assuming some stronger convexity properties of either
the regularisation term or its convex conjugate. In the special case of
quadratic regularisation, we are able to reproduce the whole range of H\"older
type convergence rates known from classical theory.

\\
  After freezing the first phase of the fifth generation of wireless networks
(5G) standardization, it finally goes live now and the rollout of the
commercial launch (most in fixed 5G broadband services) and migration has been
started. However, some challenges are arising in the deployment, integration of
each technology, and the interoperability in the network of the communication
service providers (CSPs). At the same time, the evolution of 5G is not clear
and many questions arise such as whether 5G has long-term evolution or when 5G
will change to a next-generation one. This paper provides long-term migration
options and paths towards 5G considering many key factors such as the cost,
local/national data traffic, marketing, and the standardization trends in the
radio access network (RAN), the transport network (TN), the core network (CN),
and E2E network. Moreover, we outline some 5G evolution road maps emphasizing
on the technologies, standards, and service time lines. The proposed migration
paths can be the answer to some CSPs concerns about how to do long-term
migration to 5G and beyond.

\\
  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is one of the cornerstone innovations
of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, thanks to the massive bandwidth
available in these frequency bands. To correctly assess the performance of such
systems, however, it is essential to have reliable channel models, based on a
deep understanding of the propagation characteristics of the mmWave signal. In
this respect, ray tracers can provide high accuracy, at the expense of a
significant computational complexity, which limits the scalability of
simulations. To address this issue, in this paper we present possible
simplifications that can reduce the complexity of ray tracing in the mmWave
environment, without significantly affecting the accuracy of the model. We
evaluate the effect of such simplifications on link-level metrics, testing
different configuration parameters and propagation scenarios.

  The design of a wireless communication system that can support multiple users
at high data rates inside an aircraft is a key requirement of aircraft
manufacturers. This paper examines the design of an on-board visible light
communication (VLC) system for transmitting data on board Boeing 747-400
aircraft. The reading light unit of each seat is utilised as an optical
transmitter. A red, yellow, green, and blue (RYGB) laser diode (LD) is used in
each reading light unit for transmitting data. An angle diversity receiver
(ADR), which is an optical receiver that is composed of four branches (in this
work), is evaluated. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and
data rate are determined. Three scenarios have been examined where, in the
first scenario, one device is used, in the second scenario two devices are used
and in the third scenario three devices are used by each passenger. The
proposed system can offer high SINRs that support high data rates for each
passenger by using simple on-off-keying (OOK).

Title: Stabilization of reaction-diffusion PDEs with both time- and
  spatially-varying delayed distributed actuation
Authors: Hugo Lhachemi, Christophe Prieur and Robert Shorten
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: Preprint
\\
  This paper discusses the in-domain feedback stabilization of
reaction-diffusion PDEs with Robin boundary conditions in the presence of an
uncertain time- and spatially-varying delay in the distributed actuation. The
proposed control design strategy consists of a constant-delay predictor
feedback designed based on the known nominal value of the control input delay
and is synthesized on a finite-dimensional truncated model capturing the
unstable modes of the original infinite-dimensional system. By using a small
gain-argument, we show that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially
stable provided that the variations of the delay around its nominal value are
small enough. The proposed proof actually applies to any distributed-parameter
system associated with an unbounded operator that 1) generates a
$C_0$-semigroup on a weighted space of square integrable functions over a
compact interval; and 2) is self-adjoint with compact resolvent.

  This paper presents a simulation and experimental validation of H-bridge
inverter with the implementation of a Newton-Raphson algorithm for selective
harmonics elimination. Contributions are made in interfacing and programming of
Arduino ATmega328P microcontroller and use it to control of single-phase
inverter by selective harmonic elimination technique. Through this work, we
have given a general analytical description of the total harmonic distortion
and present the method of application of the Newton-Raphson algorithm for
selective harmonic elimination. MATLAB Simulink used for simulation and Arduino
IDE software was used to program the Arduino board. The validity of the
simulation model is verified by experimental results, the inverter was realized
and the algorithm control is tested, results of the simulation and realization
are compared, they show the efficiency of the system analysis and demonstrate
the ability of Arduino to control the inverter and to generate complex signals
for the electrical systems control.

Title: Edge crossings in random linear arrangements
Authors: Llu\'is Alemany-Puig and Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho
Categories: cs.DM math.CO physics.soc-ph
Comments: Generalised our theory from one-dimensional layouts to practically
  any type of layout. This helps study the variance of the number of crossings
  in graphs when their vertices are arranged on the surface of a sphere, or on
  the plane. Moreover, we also give closed formulae for this variance on
  particular types of graphs in both linear arrangements and general layouts
