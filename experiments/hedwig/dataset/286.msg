Title: Development of an Expert System for Diabetic Type-2 Diet
Authors: Ibrahim M. Ahmed, Abeer M. Mahmoud
Categories: cs.AI
Journal-ref: International Journal of Computer Applications, 2014, 107(1)
DOI: 10.5120/18714-9932
\\
  A successful intelligent control of patient food for treatment purpose must
combines patient interesting food list and doctors efficient treatment food
list. Actually, many rural communities in Sudan have extremely limited access
to diabetic diet centers. People travel long distances to clinics or medical
facilities, and there is a shortage of medical experts in most of these
facilities. This results in slow service, and patients end up waiting long
hours without receiving any attention. Hence diabetic diet expert systems can
play a significant role in such cases where medical experts are not readily
available. This paper presents the design and implementation of an intelligent
medical expert system for diabetes diet that intended to be used in Sudan. The
development of the proposed expert system went through a number of stages such
problem and need identification, requirements analysis, knowledge acquisition,
formalization, design and implementation. Visual prolog was used for designing
the graphical user interface and the implementation of the system. The proposed
expert system is a promising helpful tool that reduces the workload for
physicians and provides diabetics with simple and valuable assistance.

Title: Magic: the Gathering is as Hard as Arithmetic
Authors: Stella Biderman
Categories: cs.AI cs.CC cs.LO
Comments: pre-print, currently under review
\\
  Magic: the Gathering is a popular and famously complicated card game about
magical combat. Recently, several authors including Chatterjee and Ibsen-Jensen
(2016) and Churchill, Biderman, and Herrick (2019) have investigated the
computational complexity of playing Magic optimally. In this paper we show that
the ``mate-in-$n$'' problem for Magic is $\Delta^0_n$-hard and that optimal
play in two-player Magic is non-arithmetic in general. These results apply to
how real Magic is played, can be achieved using standard-size tournament legal
decks, and do not rely on stochasticity or hidden information. Our paper builds
upon the construction that Churchill, Biderman, and Herrick (2019) used to show
that this problem was at least as hard as the halting problem.

Title: Uncovering the Data-Related Limits of Human Reasoning Research: An
  Analysis based on Recommender Systems
Authors: Nicolas Riesterer, Daniel Brand, Marco Ragni
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Understanding the fundamentals of human reasoning is central to the
development of any system built to closely interact with humans. Cognitive
science pursues the goal of modeling human-like intelligence from a
theory-driven perspective with a strong focus on explainability. Syllogistic
reasoning as one of the core domains of human reasoning research has seen a
surge of computational models being developed over the last years. However,
recent analyses of models' predictive performances revealed a stagnation in
improvement. We believe that most of the problems encountered in cognitive
science are not due to the specific models that have been developed but can be
traced back to the peculiarities of behavioral data instead.
  Therefore, we investigate potential data-related reasons for the problems in
human reasoning research by comparing model performances on human and
artificially generated datasets. In particular, we apply collaborative
filtering recommenders to investigate the adversarial effects of
inconsistencies and noise in data and illustrate the potential for data-driven
methods in a field of research predominantly concerned with gaining high-level
theoretical insight into a domain.
  Our work (i) provides insight into the levels of noise to be expected from
human responses in reasoning data, (ii) uncovers evidence for an upper-bound of
performance that is close to being reached urging for an extension of the
modeling task, and (iii) introduces the tools and presents initial results to
pioneer a new paradigm for investigating and modeling reasoning focusing on
predicting responses for individual human reasoners.

Title: How the Brain might use Division
Authors: Kieran Greer
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  One of the most fundamental questions in Biology or Artificial Intelligence
is how the human brain performs mathematical functions. How does a neural
architecture that may organise itself mostly through statistics, know what to
do? One possibility is to extract the problem to something more abstract. This
becomes clear when thinking about how the brain handles large numbers, for
example to the power of something, when simply summing to an answer is not
feasible. In this paper, the author suggests that the maths question can be
answered more easily if the problem is changed into one of symbol manipulation
and not just number counting. If symbols can be compared and manipulated, maybe
without understanding completely what they are, then the mathematical
operations become relative and some of them might even be rote learned. The
proposed system may also be suggested as an alternative to the traditional
computer binary system. Any of the actual maths still breaks down into binary
operations, while a more symbolic level above that can manipulate the numbers
and reduce the problem size, thus making the binary operations simpler. An
interesting result of looking at this is the possibility of a new fractal
equation resulting from division, that can be used as a measure of good fit and
would help the brain decide how to solve something through self-replacement and
a comparison with this good fit.

  Large ontologies still pose serious challenges to state-of-the-art ontology
alignment systems. In this paper we present an approach that combines a neural
embedding model and logic-based modules to accurately divide an input ontology
matching task into smaller and more tractable matching (sub)tasks. We have
conducted a comprehensive evaluation using the datasets of the Ontology
Alignment Evaluation Initiative. The results are encouraging and suggest that
the proposed method is adequate in practice and can be integrated within the
workflow of systems unable to cope with very large ontologies.

Title: Cycle-Accurate Evaluation of Software-Hardware Co-Design of Decimal
  Computation in RISC-V Ecosystem
Authors: Riaz-ul-haque Mian and Michihiro Shintani and Michiko Inoue
Categories: cs.AR
Comments: IEEE double column format, 6 pages with 5 figures
MSC-class: 68W35
\\
  Software-hardware co-design solutions for decimal computation can provide
several Pareto points to development of embedded systems in terms of hardware
cost and performance. This paper demonstrates how to accurately evaluate such
co-design solutions using RISC-V ecosystem. In a software-hardware co-design
solution, a part of solution requires dedicated hardware. In our evaluation
framework, we develop new decimal oriented instructions supported by an
accelerator. The framework can realize cycle-accurate analysis for performance
as well as hardware overhead for co-design solutions for decimal computation.
The obtained performance result is compared with an estimation with dummy
functions.

Title: A generalized Sylvester-Gallai type theorem for quadratic polynomials
Authors: Shir Peleg and Amir Shpilka
Categories: cs.CC cs.CG
\\
  In this work we prove a version of the Sylvester-Gallai theorem for quadratic
polynomials that takes us one step closer to obtaining a deterministic
polynomial time algorithm for testing zeroness of
$\Sigma^{[3]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[2]}$ circuits. Specifically, we prove that if a
finite set of irreducible quadratic polynomials $\mathcal{Q}$ satisfy that for
every two polynomials $Q_1,Q_2\in \mathcal{Q}$ there is a subset
$\mathcal{K}\subset \mathcal{Q}$, such that $Q_1,Q_2 \notin \mathcal{K}$ and
whenever $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ vanish then also $\prod_{i\in \mathcal{K}} Q_i$
vanishes, then the linear span of the polynomials in $\mathcal{Q}$ has
dimension $O(1)$. This extends the earlier result [Shpilka19] that showed a
similar conclusion when $|\mathcal{K}| = 1$.
  An important technical step in our proof is a theorem classifying all the
possible cases in which a product of quadratic polynomials can vanish when two
other quadratic polynomials vanish. I.e., when the product is in the radical of
the ideal generates by the two quadratics. This step extends a result from
[Shpilka19]that studied the case when one quadratic polynomial is in the
radical of two other quadratics.

Title: On Function Description
Authors: Rade Vuckovac
Categories: cs.CC
Comments: 16 pages, 5 figures
\\
  The main result is that: function descriptions are not made equal, and they
can be categorised in at least two categories using various computational
methods for function evaluation. The result affects Kolmogorov complexity and
Random Oracle Model notions. More precisely, the idea that the size of an
object and the size of the smallest computer program defining that object is a
ratio that represents the object complexity needs additional definitions to
hold its original assertions.

Title: Estimation of lateral track irregularity through Kalman filtering
  techniques
Authors: S. Munoz, J. Ros, J.L.Escalona
Categories: cs.CE eess.SP
Comments: 17 pages and 8 figures
ACM-class: G.1; G.3; J.6
\\
  The aim of this work is to develop a model-based methodology for monitoring
lateral track irregularities based on the use of inertial sensors mounted on an
in-service train. To this end, a gyroscope is used to measure the wheelset yaw
angular velocity and two accelerometers are used to measure lateral
acceleration of the wheelset and the bogie frame. Using a highly simplified
linear bogie model that is able to capture the most relevant dynamic behaviour
allows for the set-up of a very efficient Kalman-based monitoring strategy. The
behaviour of the designed filter is assessed through the use of a detailed
multibody model of an in-service vehicle running on a straight track with
realistic irregularities. The model output is used to generate virtual
measurements that are subsequently used to run the filter and validate the
proposed estimator. In addition, the equivalent parameters of the simplified
model are identified based on these simulations. In order to prove the
robustness of the proposed technique, a systematic parametric analysis has been
performed. The results obtained with the proposed method are promising, showing
high accuracy and robustness for monitoring lateral alignment on straight
tracks, with a very low computational cost.

Title: KryptoOracle: A Real-Time Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Platform Using
  Twitter Sentiments
Authors: Shubhankar Mohapatra, Nauman Ahmed and Paulo Alencar
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG q-fin.ST
Comments: 7 pages, 8 figures, IEEE Big Data 2019
\\
  Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are becoming increasingly popular, having
been widely used as an exchange medium in areas such as financial transaction
and asset transfer verification. However, there has been a lack of solutions
that can support real-time price prediction to cope with high currency
volatility, handle massive heterogeneous data volumes, including social media
sentiments, while supporting fault tolerance and persistence in real time, and
provide real-time adaptation of learning algorithms to cope with new price and
sentiment data. In this paper we introduce KryptoOracle, a novel real-time and
adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments.
The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture
which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault
tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can
respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time;
and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model
adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an
architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform
implementation and experimental evaluation. Overall, the proposed platform can
help accelerate decision-making, uncover new opportunities and provide more
timely insights based on the available and ever-larger financial data volume
and variety.

Title: Aspect Term Extraction using Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning
Authors: Gunjan Ansari, Chandni Saxena, Tanvir Ahmad and M.N.Doja
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Aspect based Sentiment Analysis is a major subarea of sentiment analysis.
Many supervised and unsupervised approaches have been proposed in the past for
detecting and analyzing the sentiment of aspect terms. In this paper, a
graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for aspect term extraction is
proposed. In this approach, every identified token in the review document is
classified as aspect or non-aspect term from a small set of labeled tokens
using label spreading algorithm. The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) for graph
sparsification is employed in the proposed approach to make it more time and
memory efficient. The proposed work is further extended to determine the
polarity of the opinion words associated with the identified aspect terms in
review sentence to generate visual aspect-based summary of review documents.
The experimental study is conducted on benchmark and crawled datasets of
restaurant and laptop domains with varying value of labeled instances. The
results depict that the proposed approach could achieve good result in terms of
Precision, Recall and Accuracy with limited availability of labeled data.

Title: A Dataset Independent Set of Baselines for Relation Prediction in
  Argument Mining
Authors: Oana Cocarascu, Elena Cabrio, Serena Villata, Francesca Toni
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Argument Mining is the research area which aims at extracting argument
components and predicting argumentative relations (i.e.,support and attack)
from text. In particular, numerous approaches have been proposed in the
literature to predict the relations holding between the arguments, and
application-specific annotated resources were built for this purpose. Despite
the fact that these resources have been created to experiment on the same task,
the definition of a single relation prediction method to be successfully
applied to a significant portion of these datasets is an open research problem
in Argument Mining. This means that none of the methods proposed in the
literature can be easily ported from one resource to another. In this paper, we
address this problem by proposing a set of dataset independent strong neural
baselines which obtain homogeneous results on all the datasets proposed in the
literature for the argumentative relation prediction task. Thus, our baselines
can be employed by the Argument Mining community to compare more effectively
how well a method performs on the argumentative relation prediction task.

Title: A Comparative Study of Sequence Classification Models for Privacy Policy
  Coverage Analysis
Authors: Zachary Lindner
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Privacy policies are legal documents that describe how a website will
collect, use, and distribute a user's data. Unfortunately, such documents are
often overly complicated and filled with legal jargon; making it difficult for
users to fully grasp what exactly is being collected and why. Our solution to
this problem is to provide users with a coverage analysis of a given website's
privacy policy using a wide range of classical machine learning and deep
learning techniques. Given a website's privacy policy, the classifier
identifies the associated data practice for each logical segment. These data
practices/labels are taken directly from the OPP-115 corpus. For example, the
data practice "Data Retention" refers to how long a website stores a user's
information. The coverage analysis allows users to determine how many of the
ten possible data practices are covered, along with identifying the sections
that correspond to the data practices of particular interest.

Title: Localized Flood DetectionWith Minimal Labeled Social Media Data Using
  Transfer Learning
Authors: Neha Singh, Nirmalya Roy, Aryya Gangopadhyay
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Social media generates an enormous amount of data on a daily basis but it is
very challenging to effectively utilize the data without annotating or labeling
it according to the target application. We investigate the problem of localized
flood detection using the social sensing model (Twitter) in order to provide an
efficient, reliable and accurate flood text classification model with minimal
labeled data. This study is important since it can immensely help in providing
the flood-related updates and notifications to the city officials for emergency
decision making, rescue operations, and early warnings, etc. We propose to
perform the text classification using the inductive transfer learning method
i.e pre-trained language model ULMFiT and fine-tune it in order to effectively
classify the flood-related feeds in any new location. Finally, we show that
using very little new labeled data in the target domain we can successfully
build an efficient and high performing model for flood detection and analysis
with human-generated facts and observations from Twitter.

Title: Transformer++
Authors: Prakhar Thapak and Prodip Hore
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Recent advancements in attention mechanisms have replaced recurrent neural
networks and its variants for machine translation tasks. Transformer using
attention mechanism solely achieved state-of-the-art results in sequence
modeling. Neural machine translation based on the attention mechanism is
parallelizable and addresses the problem of handling long-range dependencies
among words in sentences more effectively than recurrent neural networks. One
of the key concepts in attention is to learn three matrices, query, key, and
value, where global dependencies among words are learned through linearly
projecting word embeddings through these matrices. Multiple query, key, value
matrices can be learned simultaneously focusing on a different subspace of the
embedded dimension, which is called multi-head in Transformer. We argue that
certain dependencies among words could be learned better through an
intermediate context than directly modeling word-word dependencies. This could
happen due to the nature of certain dependencies or lack of patterns that lend
them difficult to be modeled globally using multi-head self-attention. In this
work, we propose a new way of learning dependencies through a context in
multi-head using convolution. This new form of multi-head attention along with
the traditional form achieves better results than Transformer on the WMT 2014
English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks. We also introduce a
framework to learn POS tagging and NER information during the training of
encoder which further improves results achieving a new state-of-the-art of 32.1
BLEU, better than existing best by 1.4 BLEU, on the WMT 2014 English-to-German
and 44.6 BLEU, better than existing best by 1.1 BLEU, on the WMT 2014
English-to-French translation tasks. We call this Transformer++.

Title: A Computational Investigation on Denominalization
Authors: Zahra Shekarchi, Yang Xu
Categories: cs.CL cs.CY cs.LG
\\
  Language has been a dynamic system and word meanings always have been changed
over times. Every time a novel concept or sense is introduced, we need to
assign it a word to express it. Also, some changes have happened because the
result of a change can be more desirable for humans, or cognitively easier to
be used by humans. Finding the patterns of these changes is interesting and can
reveal some facts about human cognitive evolution. As we have enough resources
for studying this problem, it is a good idea to work on the problem through
computational modeling, and that can make the work easier and possible to be
studied on large scale. In this work, we want to study the nouns which have
been used as verbs after some years of their emergence as nouns and find some
commonalities among these nouns. In other words, we are interested in finding
what potential requirements are essential for this change.

Title: Mask & Focus: Conversation Modelling by Learning Concepts
Authors: Gaurav Pandey, Dinesh Raghu and Sachindra Joshi
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  Sequence to sequence models attempt to capture the correlation between all
the words in the input and output sequences. While this is quite useful for
machine translation where the correlation among the words is indeed quite
strong, it becomes problematic for conversation modelling where the correlation
is often at a much abstract level. In contrast, humans tend to focus on the
essential concepts discussed in the conversation context and generate responses
accordingly. In this paper, we attempt to mimic this response generating
mechanism by learning the essential concepts in the context and response in an
unsupervised manner. The proposed model, referred to as Mask \& Focus maps the
input context to a sequence of concepts which are then used to generate the
response concepts. Together, the context and the response concepts generate the
final response. In order to learn context concepts from the training data
automatically, we \emph{mask} words in the input and observe the effect of
masking on response generation. We train our model to learn those response
concepts that have high mutual information with respect to the context
concepts, thereby guiding the model to \emph{focus} on the context concepts.
Mask \& Focus achieves significant improvement over the existing baselines in
several established metrics for dialogues.

Title: Improving Reliability of Latent Dirichlet Allocation by Assessing Its
  Stability Using Clustering Techniques on Replicated Runs

\\
  For organizing large text corpora topic modeling provides useful tools. A
widely used method is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative
probabilistic model which models single texts in a collection of texts as
mixtures of latent topics. The assignments of words to topics rely on initial
values such that generally the outcome of LDA is not fully reproducible. In
addition, the reassignment via Gibbs Sampling is based on conditional
distributions, leading to different results in replicated runs on the same text
data. This fact is often neglected in everyday practice. We aim to improve the
reliability of LDA results. Therefore, we study the stability of LDA by
comparing assignments from replicated runs. We propose to quantify the
similarity of two generated topics by a modified Jaccard coefficient. Using
such similarities, topics can be clustered. A new pruning algorithm for
hierarchical clustering results based on the idea that two LDA runs create
pairs of similar topics is proposed. This approach leads to the new measure
S-CLOP ({\bf S}imilarity of multiple sets by {\bf C}lustering with {\bf LO}cal
{\bf P}runing) for quantifying the stability of LDA models. We discuss some
characteristics of this measure and illustrate it with an application to real
data consisting of newspaper articles from \textit{USA Today}. Our results show
that the measure S-CLOP is useful for assessing the stability of LDA models or
any other topic modeling procedure that characterize its topics by word
distributions. Based on the newly proposed measure for LDA stability, we
propose a method to increase the reliability and hence to improve the
reproducibility of empirical findings based on topic modeling. This increase in
reliability is obtained by running the LDA several times and taking as
prototype the most representative run, that is the LDA run with highest average
similarity to all other runs.

Title: SAFE: Similarity-Aware Multi-Modal Fake News Detection

  Effective detection of fake news has recently attracted significant
attention. Current studies have made significant contributions to predicting
fake news with less focus on exploiting the relationship (similarity) between
the textual and visual information in news articles. Attaching importance to
such similarity helps identify fake news stories that, for example, attempt to
use irrelevant images to attract readers' attention. In this work, we propose a
$\mathsf{S}$imilarity-$\mathsf{A}$ware $\mathsf{F}$ak$\mathsf{E}$ news
detection method ($\mathsf{SAFE}$) which investigates multi-modal (textual and
visual) information of news articles. First, neural networks are adopted to
separately extract textual and visual features for news representation. We
further investigate the relationship between the extracted features across
modalities. Such representations of news textual and visual information along
with their relationship are jointly learned and used to predict fake news. The
proposed method facilitates recognizing the falsity of news articles based on
their text, images, or their "mismatches." We conduct extensive experiments on
large-scale real-world data, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Title: Understanding the Downstream Instability of Word Embeddings

\\
  Many industrial machine learning (ML) systems require frequent retraining to
keep up-to-date with constantly changing data. This retraining exacerbates a
large challenge facing ML systems today: model training is unstable, i.e.,
small changes in training data can cause significant changes in the model's
predictions. In this paper, we work on developing a deeper understanding of
this instability, with a focus on how a core building block of modern natural
language processing (NLP) pipelines---pre-trained word embeddings---affects the
instability of downstream NLP models. We first empirically reveal a tradeoff
between stability and memory: increasing the embedding memory 2x can reduce the
disagreement in predictions due to small changes in training data by 5% to 37%
(relative). To theoretically explain this tradeoff, we introduce a new measure
of embedding instability---the eigenspace instability measure---which we prove
bounds the disagreement in downstream predictions introduced by the change in
word embeddings. Practically, we show that the eigenspace instability measure
can be a cost-effective way to choose embedding parameters to minimize
instability without training downstream models, outperforming other embedding
distance measures and performing competitively with a nearest neighbor-based
measure. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed stability-memory tradeoffs
extend to other types of embeddings as well, including knowledge graph and
contextual word embeddings.

Title: Adv-BERT: BERT is not robust on misspellings! Generating nature
  adversarial samples on BERT
Authors: Lichao Sun, Kazuma Hashimoto, Wenpeng Yin, Akari Asai, Jia Li, Philip
  Yu, Caiming Xiong
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  There is an increasing amount of literature that claims the brittleness of
deep neural networks in dealing with adversarial examples that are created
maliciously. It is unclear, however, how the models will perform in realistic
scenarios where \textit{natural rather than malicious} adversarial instances
often exist. This work systematically explores the robustness of BERT, the
state-of-the-art Transformer-style model in NLP, in dealing with noisy data,
particularly mistakes in typing the keyboard, that occur inadvertently.
Intensive experiments on sentiment analysis and question answering benchmarks
indicate that: (i) Typos in various words of a sentence do not influence
equally. The typos in informative words make severer damages; (ii) Mistype is
the most damaging factor, compared with inserting, deleting, etc.; (iii) Humans
and machines have different focuses on recognizing adversarial attacks.

  The recent advances in Natural Language Processing have been a boon for
well-represented languages in terms of available curated data and research
resources. One of the challenges for low-resourced languages is clear
guidelines on the collection, curation and preparation of datasets for
different use-cases. In this work, we take on the task of creation of two
datasets that are focused on news headlines (i.e short text) for Setswana and
Sepedi and creation of a news topic classification task. We document our work
and also present baselines for classification. We investigate an approach on
data augmentation, better suited to low resource languages, to improve the
performance of the classifiers

Title: A Financial Service Chatbot based on Deep Bidirectional Transformers
Authors: Shi Yu, Yuxin Chen, Hussain Zaidi
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We develop a chatbot using Deep Bidirectional Transformer models (BERT) to
handle client questions in financial investment customer service. The bot can
recognize 381 intents, and decides when to say "I don't know" and escalates
irrelevant/uncertain questions to human operators. Our main novel contribution
is the discussion about uncertainty measure for BERT, where three different
approaches are systematically compared on real problems. We investigated two
uncertainty metrics, information entropy and variance of dropout sampling in
BERT, followed by mixed-integer programming to optimize decision thresholds.
Another novel contribution is the usage of BERT as a language model in
automatic spelling correction. Inputs with accidental spelling errors can
significantly decrease intent classification performance. The proposed approach
combines probabilities from masked language model and word edit distances to
find the best corrections for misspelled words. The chatbot and the entire
conversational AI system are developed using open-source tools, and deployed
within our company's intranet. The proposed approach can be useful for
industries seeking similar in-house solutions in their specific business
domains. We share all our code and a sample chatbot built on a public dataset
on Github.

  Intelligent assistants like Cortana, Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are
trained to parse information when the conversation is synchronous and short;
however, for email-based conversational agents, the communication is
asynchronous, and often contains information irrelevant to the assistant. This
makes it harder for the system to accurately detect intents, extract entities
relevant to those intents and thereby perform the desired action. We present a
neural model for scoping relevant information for the agent from a large query.
We show that when used as a preprocessing step, the model improves performance
of both intent detection and entity extraction tasks. We demonstrate the
model's impact on Scheduler (Cortana is the persona of the agent, while
Scheduler is the name of the service. We use them interchangeably in the
context of this paper.) - a virtual conversational meeting scheduling assistant
that interacts asynchronously with users through email. The model helps the
entity extraction and intent detection tasks requisite by Scheduler achieve an
average gain of 35% in precision without any drop in recall. Additionally, we
demonstrate that the same approach can be used for component level analysis in
large documents, such as signature block identification.

Title: Unsupervised and Interpretable Domain Adaptation to Rapidly Filter
  Social Web Data for Emergency Services

Comments: 8 pages, 2 Figures, 7 Tables, Source Code Available
\\
  During the onset of a disaster event, filtering relevant information from the
social web data is challenging due to its sparse availability and practical
limitations in labeling datasets of an ongoing crisis. In this paper, we show
that unsupervised domain adaptation through multi-task learning can be a useful
framework to leverage data from past crisis events, as well as exploit
additional web resources for training efficient information filtering models
during an ongoing crisis. We present a novel method to classify relevant tweets
during an ongoing crisis without seeing any new examples, using the publicly
available dataset of TREC incident streams that provides labeled tweets with 4
relevant classes across 10 different crisis events. Additionally, our method
addresses a crucial but missing component from current research in web science
for crisis data filtering models: interpretability. Specifically, we first
identify a standard single-task attention-based neural network architecture and
then construct a customized multi-task architecture for the crisis domain:
Multi-Task Domain Adversarial Attention Network. This model consists of
dedicated attention layers for each task and a domain classifier for gradient
reversal. Evaluation of domain adaptation for crisis events is performed by
choosing a target event as the test set and training on the rest. Our results
show that the multi-task model outperformed its single-task counterpart and
also, training with additional web-resources showed further performance boost.
Furthermore, we show that the attention layer can be used as a guide to explain
the model predictions by showcasing the words in a tweet that are deemed
important in the classification process. Our research aims to pave the way
towards a fully unsupervised and interpretable domain adaptation of
low-resource crisis web data to aid emergency responders quickly and
effectively.

Title: Multi-task Learning with Multi-head Attention for Multi-choice Reading
  Comprehension
Authors: Hui Wan
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Multiple-choice Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is an important and
challenging Natural Language Understanding (NLU) task, in which a machine must
choose the answer to a question from a set of choices, with the question placed
in context of text passages or dialog. In the last a couple of years the NLU
field has been revolutionized with the advent of models based on the
Transformer architecture, which are pretrained on massive amounts of
unsupervised data and then fine-tuned for various supervised learning NLU
tasks. Transformer models have come to dominate a wide variety of leader-boards
in the NLU field; in the area of MRC, the current state-of-the-art model on the
DREAM dataset (see[Sunet al., 2019]) fine tunes Albert, a large pretrained
Transformer-based model, and addition-ally combines it with an extra layer of
multi-head attention between context and question-answer[Zhuet al., 2020].The
purpose of this note is to document a new state-of-the-art result in the DREAM
task, which is accomplished by, additionally, performing multi-task learning on
two MRC multi-choice reading comprehension tasks (RACE and DREAM).

Title: Learning to mirror speaking styles incrementally
Authors: Siyi Liu (1), Ziang Leng (1), Derry Wijaya (1) ((1) Boston University)
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 4 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure
\\
  Mirroring is the behavior in which one person subconsciously imitates the
gesture, speech pattern, or attitude of another. In conversations, mirroring
often signals the speakers enjoyment and engagement in their communication. In
chatbots, methods have been proposed to add personas to the chatbots and to
train them to speak or to shift their dialogue style to that of the personas.
However, they often require a large dataset consisting of dialogues of the
target personalities to train. In this work, we explore a method that can learn
to mirror the speaking styles of a person incrementally. Our method extracts
ngrams that capture a persons speaking styles and uses the ngrams to create
patterns for transforming sentences to the persons speaking styles. Our
experiments show that our method is able to capture patterns of speaking style
that can be used to transform regular sentences into sentences with the target
style.

\\
  Multi-role dialogue understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks
such as question answering, act classification, dialogue summarization etc.
While dialogue corpora are abundantly available, labeled data, for specific
learning tasks, can be highly scarce and expensive. In this work, we
investigate dialogue context representation learning with various types
unsupervised pretraining tasks where the training objectives are given
naturally according to the nature of the utterance and the structure of the
multi-role conversation. Meanwhile, in order to locate essential information
for dialogue summarization/extraction, the pretraining process enables external
knowledge integration. The proposed fine-tuned pretraining mechanism is
comprehensively evaluated via three different dialogue datasets along with a
number of downstream dialogue-mining tasks. Result shows that the proposed
pretraining mechanism significantly contributes to all the downstream tasks
without discrimination to different encoders.

we experimented with two vanilla summarization systems to start the analysis of
the complexity of the GASP task.

Title: Toward Interpretability of Dual-Encoder Models for Dialogue Response
  Suggestions
Authors: Yitong Li, Dianqi Li, Sushant Prakash and Peng Wang
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This work shows how to improve and interpret the commonly used dual encoder
model for response suggestion in dialogue. We present an attentive dual encoder
model that includes an attention mechanism on top of the extracted word-level
features from two encoders, one for context and one for label respectively. To
improve the interpretability in the dual encoder models, we design a novel
regularization loss to minimize the mutual information between unimportant
words and desired labels, in addition to the original attention method, so that
important words are emphasized while unimportant words are de-emphasized. This
can help not only with model interpretability, but can also further improve
model accuracy. We propose an approximation method that uses a neural network
to calculate the mutual information. Furthermore, by adding a residual layer
between raw word embeddings and the final encoded context feature, word-level
interpretability is preserved at the final prediction of the model. We compare
the proposed model with existing methods for the dialogue response task on two
public datasets (Persona and Ubuntu). The experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of better Recall@1 accuracy and
visualized interpretability.

  Confidently making progress on multilingual modeling requires challenging,

The languages of TyDi QA are diverse with regard to their typology---the set of
linguistic features each language expresses---such that we expect models
performing well on this set to generalize across a large number of the world's
languages. We present a quantitative analysis of the data quality and
example-level qualitative linguistic analyses of observed language phenomena
that would not be found in English-only corpora. To provide a realistic
information-seeking task and avoid priming effects, questions are written by
people who want to know the answer, but don't know the answer yet, and the data
is collected directly in each language without the use of translation.

\\
  Human language users easily interpret expressions that describe unfamiliar
situations composed from familiar parts ("greet the pink brontosaurus by the
ferris wheel"). Modern neural networks, by contrast, struggle to interpret
compositions unseen in training. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark,
gSCAN, for evaluating compositional generalization in models of situated
language understanding. We take inspiration from standard models of meaning
composition in formal linguistics. Going beyond an earlier related benchmark
that focused on syntactic aspects of generalization, gSCAN defines a language
grounded in the states of a grid world. This allows us to build novel
generalization tasks that probe the acquisition of linguistically motivated
rules. For example, agents must understand how adjectives such as 'small' are
interpreted relative to the current world state or how adverbs such as
'cautiously' combine with new verbs. We test a strong multi-modal baseline
model and a state-of-the-art compositional method finding that, in most cases,
they fail dramatically when generalization requires systematic compositional
rules.

  Background / introduction. Vector symbolic architectures (VSA) are a viable
approach for the hyperdimensional representation of symbolic data, such as
documents, syntactic structures, or semantic frames. Methods. We present a
rigorous mathematical framework for the representation of phrase structure
trees and parse-trees of context-free grammars (CFG) in Fock space, i.e.
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space as being used in quantum field theory. We
define a novel normal form for CFG by means of term algebras. Using a recently
developed software toolbox, called FockBox, we construct Fock space
representations for the trees built up by a CFG left-corner (LC) parser.
Results. We prove a universal representation theorem for CFG term algebras in
Fock space and illustrate our findings through a low-dimensional principal
component projection of the LC parser states. Conclusions. Our approach could
leverage the development of VSA for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
by means of hyperdimensional deep neural computation. It could be of
significance for the improvement of cognitive user interfaces and other
applications of VSA in machine learning.

Title: Capturing document context inside sentence-level neural machine
  translation models with self-training
Authors: Elman Mansimov, G\'abor Melis, Lei Yu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Neural machine translation (NMT) has arguably achieved human level parity
when trained and evaluated at the sentence-level. Document-level neural machine
translation has received less attention and lags behind its sentence-level
counterpart. The majority of the proposed document-level approaches investigate
ways of conditioning the model on several source or target sentences to capture
document context. These approaches require training a specialized NMT model
from scratch on parallel document-level corpora. We propose an approach that
doesn't require training a specialized model on parallel document-level corpora
and is applied to a trained sentence-level NMT model at decoding time. We
process the document from left to right multiple times and self-train the
sentence-level model on pairs of source sentences and generated translations.
Our approach reinforces the choices made by the model, thus making it more
likely that the same choices will be made in other sentences in the document.
We evaluate our approach on three document-level datasets: NIST
Chinese-English, WMT'19 Chinese-English and OpenSubtitles English-Russian. We
demonstrate that our approach has higher BLEU score and higher human preference
than the baseline. Qualitative analysis of our approach shows that choices made
by model are consistent across the document.

  Organize songs, albums, and artists in groups with shared similarity could be
done with the help of genre labels. In this paper, we present a novel approach
for automatic classifying musical genre in Brazilian music using only the song
lyrics. This kind of classification remains a challenge in the field of Natural
Language Processing. We construct a dataset of 138,368 Brazilian song lyrics
distributed in 14 genres. We apply SVM, Random Forest and a Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) network combined with different word embeddings
techniques to address this classification task. Our experiments show that the
BLSTM method outperforms the other models with an F1-score average of $0.48$.
Some genres like "gospel", "funk-carioca" and "sertanejo", which obtained 0.89,
0.70 and 0.69 of F1-score, respectively, can be defined as the most distinct
and easy to classify in the Brazilian musical genres context.

\\
  The growing deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) systems aims to ease the
daily life of end-users by providing several value-added services. However, IoT
systems may capture and store sensitive, personal data about individuals in the
cloud, thereby jeopardizing user-privacy. Emerging legislation, such as
California's CalOPPA and GDPR in Europe, support strong privacy laws to protect
an individual's data in the cloud. One such law relates to strict enforcement
of data retention policies. This paper proposes a framework, entitled IoT
Expunge that allows sensor data providers to store the data in cloud platforms
that will ensure enforcement of retention policies. Additionally, the cloud
provider produces verifiable proofs of its adherence to the retention policies.
Experimental results on a real-world smart building testbed show that IoT
Expunge imposes minimal overheads to the user to verify the data against data
retention policies.

Title: Securing of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) against security threats using
  human immune system

\\
  UASs form a large part of the fighting ability of the advanced military
forces. In particular, these systems that carry confidential information are
subject to security attacks. Accordingly, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
has been proposed in the proposed design to protect against the security
problems using the human immune system (HIS). The IDSs are used to detect and
respond to attempts to compromise the target system. Since the UASs operate in
the real world, the testing and validation of these systems with a variety of
sensors is confronted with problems. This design is inspired by HIS. In the
mapping, insecure signals are equivalent to an antigen that are detected by
antibody-based training patterns and removed from the operation cycle. Among
the main uses of the proposed design are the quick detection of intrusive
signals and quarantining their activity. Moreover, SUAS-HIS method is evaluated
here via extensive simulations carried out in NS-3 environment. The simulation
results indicate that the UAS network performance metrics are improved in terms
of false positive rate, false negative rate, detection rate, and packet
delivery rate.

Title: Devil is Virtual: Reversing Virtual Inheritance in C++ Binaries
Authors: Rukayat Ayomide Erinfolami and Aravind Prakash
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 16 pages, 5 figure, 8 listings, 9 tables
\\
  Complexities that arise from implementation of object-oriented concepts in
C++ such as virtual dispatch and dynamic type casting have attracted the
attention of attackers and defenders alike. Binary-level defenses are dependent
on full and precise recovery of class inheritance tree of a given program.
While current solutions focus on recovering single and multiple inheritances
from the binary, they are oblivious to virtual inheritance. Conventional wisdom
among binary-level defenses is that virtual inheritance is uncommon and/or
support for single and multiple inheritances provides implicit support for
virtual inheritance. In this paper, we show neither to be true.
  Specifically, (1) we present an efficient technique to detect virtual
inheritance in C++ binaries and show through a study that virtual inheritance
can be found in non-negligible number (more than 10\%) of real-world C++
programs including Mysql and libstdc++. (2) we show that failure to handle
virtual inheritance introduces both false positives and false negatives in the
hierarchy tree. These false positves and negatives either introduce attack
surface when the hierarchy recovered is used to enforce CFI policies, or make
the hierarchy difficult to understand when it is needed for program
understanding (e.g., during decompilation). (3) We present a solution to
recover virtual inheritance from COTS binaries. We recover up to 100\% of
virtual bases and 95.5\% of intermediate bases in the virtual inheritance tree.

\\
  The goal of this paper is to establish the general framework of consensus
equilibria for Mining-Pool Games in Blockchain Ecosystems, and with the
explanation for the stability of in terms of the existence of consensus
equilibria related to mining gap game's behaviors by using one new concept
called consensus games in Blockchain Ecosystems, here, the Blockchain ecosystem
mainly means the economic activities by taking into the account of three types
of different factors which are expenses, reward mechanism and mining power for
the work on blockschain by applying the key consensus called Proof of Work due
to Nakamoto in 2008.
  In order to do so, we first give an outline how the general existence of
consensus equilibria for Mining Pool Games is formulated, and then used to
explain the stable for Gap Games for Bitcoin in the sense by the existence of
consensus equilibria under the framework of Blockchain consensus, we then
establish a general existence result for consensus equilibria of general mining
gap games by using the profit functions for miners as the payoffs in game
theory. As applications, the general existence results for consensus equilibria
of Gap games are established, which not only help us to claim the existence for
the general stability for Gap games under the general framework of Blockchain
ecosystems, but also allow us to illustrate a number of different phenomenon on
the study of mining-pool games with possible impacts due to miners's gap
behaviors with scenarios embedded n Bitcoin economics. Our study on the
explanation for the stability of mining gap game for Blockchain ecosystems
shows that the concept of consensus equilibria may play a important role for
the development of fundamental theory for consensus economics.

Title: Designing False Data Injection attacks penetrating AC-based Bad Data
  Detection System and FDI Dataset generation
Authors: Nam N. Tran, Hemanshu R. Pota, Quang N. Tran, Xuefei Yin, Jiankun Hu
Categories: cs.CR cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures
\\
  The evolution of the traditional power system towards the modern smart grid
has posed many new cybersecurity challenges to this critical infrastructure.
One of the most dangerous cybersecurity threats is the False Data Injection
(FDI) attack, especially when it is capable of completely bypassing the widely
deployed Bad Data Detector of State Estimation and interrupting the normal
operation of the power system. Most of the simulated FDI attacks are designed
using simplified linearized DC model while most industry standard State
Estimation systems are based on the nonlinear AC model. In this paper, a
comprehensive FDI attack scheme is presented based on the nonlinear AC model. A
case study of the nine-bus Western System Coordinated Council (WSCC)'s power
system is provided, using an industry standard package to assess the outcomes
of the proposed design scheme. A public FDI dataset is generated as a test set
for the community to develop and evaluate new detection algorithms, which are
lacking in the field. The FDI's stealthy quality of the dataset is assessed and
proven through a preliminary analysis based on both physical power law and
statistical analysis.

Title: Designing constraint-based False Data Injection attacks for unbalanced
  distribution smart grids
Authors: Nam N. Tran, Hemanshu R. Pota, Quang N. Tran, Jiankun Hu

Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Smart grid is equipped with various kinds of smart devices such as meters,
sensors, and actuators, to name a few, and it can be characterized as the
Internet of Things. The cyber domain of this cyber-physical system also has to
deal with many cyber-threats, including the stealthy False Data Injection (FDI)
attack. This man-in-the-middle data-driven attack is extremely dangerous due to
its ability to disrupt the operation without being detected. The unbalanced
distribution network is a highly probable target for an FDI attack due to its
easy physical access. This paper will investigate an attack design scheme based
on a nonlinear physical-constraint model that is able to produce an FDI attack
with the same theoretical stealthy characteristic. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed design scheme, simulations with the IEEE 13-node
Test Feeder are conducted. The experimental results indicate that the false
positive rate of the bad data detection mechanism is 100\%. This figurative
number opens a serious challenge for operators in maintaining the integrity of
measurement data.

Categories: cs.CR
\\
  This paper analyses the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), an emerging
approach for establishing digital identity, in the context of the Internet of
Things (IoT). We contrast existing approaches for identity on the Internet,
such as cloud-based accounts and digital certificates, with SSI standards such
as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough comparison of these
approaches. The benefits and challenges of using DIDs and VCs to identify and
authenticate IoT devices and their respective users are discussed. In the end,
we establish that SSI, with its owner-centric, privacy-aware and decentrailized
approach, provides a viable and attractive option for secure identification of
IoT devices and users.

Title: Scan Correlation -- Revealing distributed scan campaigns
Authors: Steffen Haas, Florian Wilkens, Mathias Fischer
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: Accepted for publication at DISSECT '20
\\
  Public networks are exposed to port scans from the Internet. Attackers search
for vulnerable services they can exploit. In large scan campaigns, attackers
often utilize different machines to perform distributed scans, which impedes
their detection and might also camouflage the actual goal of the scanning
campaign. In this paper, we present a correlation algorithm to detect scans,
identify potential relations among them, and reassemble them to larger
campaigns. We evaluate our approach on real-world Internet traffic and our
results indicate that it can summarize and characterize standalone and
distributed scan campaigns based on their tools and intention.

Title: The Measure-and-Reprogram Technique 2.0: Multi-Round Fiat-Shamir and
  More
Authors: Jelle Don, Serge Fehr and Christian Majenz
Categories: cs.CR quant-ph
Comments: 22 pages
\\
  We revisit recent works by Don, Fehr, Majenz and Schaffner and by Liu and
Zhandry on the security of the Fiat-Shamir transformation of $\Sigma$-protocols
in the quantum random oracle model (QROM). Two natural questions that arise in
this context are: (1) whether the results extend to the Fiat-Shamir
transformation of multi-round interactive proofs, and (2) whether Don et al.'s
$O(q^2)$ loss in security is optimal.
  Firstly, we answer question (1) in the affirmative. As a byproduct of solving
a technical difficulty in proving this result, we slightly improve the result
of Don et al., equipping it with a cleaner bound and an even simpler proof. We
apply our result to digital signature schemes showing that it can be used to
prove strong security for schemes like MQDSS in the QROM. As another
application we prove QROM-security of a non-interactive OR proof by Liu, Wei
and Wong.
  As for question (2), we show via a Grover-search based attack that Don et
al.'s quadratic security loss for the Fiat-Shamir transformation of
$\Sigma$-protocols is optimal up to a small constant factor. This extends to
our new multi-round result, proving it tight up to a factor that depends on the
number of rounds only, i.e. is constant for any constant-round interactive
proof.

Title: Opportunistic multi-party shuffling for data reporting privacy

\\
  An important feature of data collection frameworks, in which voluntary
participants are involved, is that of privacy. Besides data encryption, which
protects the data from third parties in case the communication channel is
compromised, there are schemes to obfuscate the data and thus provide some
anonymity in the data itself, as well as schemes that 'mix' the data to prevent
tracing the data back to the source by using network identifiers. This mixing
is usually implemented by utilizing special mix networks in the data collection
framework. In this paper we focus on schemes for mixing the data where the
participants do not need to trust the mix network or the data collector with
hiding the source of the data so that we can evaluate the efficacy of peer to
peer mixing strategies in the real world. To achieve this, we present a simple
opportunistic multi-party shuffling scheme to mix the data and effectively
obfuscate the source of the data. We successfully simulate 3 cases with
artificial parameters and then use the real-world Mobile Data Challenge (MDC)
data to simulate an additional 2 scenarios with realistic parameters. Our
results show that such approaches can be effective depending on the time
constraints of the data collection and we conclude with design implications for
the implementation of the proposed data collection scheme in real life
deployments.

Title: ENSEI: Efficient Secure Inference via Frequency-Domain Homomorphic
  Convolution for Privacy-Preserving Visual Recognition
Authors: Song Bian, Tianchen Wang, Masayuki Hiromoto, Yiyu Shi, Takashi Sato
Categories: cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures, in Proceedings of Conference on Computer Vision
  and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2020)
\\
  In this work, we propose ENSEI, a secure inference (SI) framework based on
the frequency-domain secure convolution (FDSC) protocol for the efficient
execution of privacy-preserving visual recognition. Our observation is that,
under the combination of homomorphic encryption and secret sharing, homomorphic
convolution can be obliviously carried out in the frequency domain,
significantly simplifying the related computations. We provide protocol designs
and parameter derivations for number-theoretic transform (NTT) based FDSC. In
the experiment, we thoroughly study the accuracy-efficiency trade-offs between
time- and frequency-domain homomorphic convolution. With ENSEI, compared to the
best known works, we achieve 5--11x online time reduction, up to 33x setup time
reduction, and up to 10x reduction in the overall inference time. A further 33%
of bandwidth reductions can be obtained on binary neural networks with only 1%
of accuracy degradation on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Title: Learning Diverse Fashion Collocation by Neural Graph Filtering
Authors: Xin Liu, Yongbin Sun, Ziwei Liu, and Dahua Lin
Categories: cs.CV cs.IR
\\
  Fashion recommendation systems are highly desired by customers to find
visually-collocated fashion items, such as clothes, shoes, bags, etc. While
existing methods demonstrate promising results, they remain lacking in
flexibility and diversity, e.g. assuming a fixed number of items or favoring
safe but boring recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel fashion
collocation framework, Neural Graph Filtering, that models a flexible set of
fashion items via a graph neural network. Specifically, we consider the visual
embeddings of each garment as a node in the graph, and describe the
inter-garment relationship as the edge between nodes. By applying symmetric
operations on the edge vectors, this framework allows varying numbers of
inputs/outputs and is invariant to their ordering. We further include a style
classifier augmented with focal loss to enable the collocation of significantly
diverse styles, which are inherently imbalanced in the training set. To
facilitate a comprehensive study on diverse fashion collocation, we reorganize
Amazon Fashion dataset with carefully designed evaluation protocols. We
evaluate the proposed approach on three popular benchmarks, the Polyvore
dataset, the Polyvore-D dataset, and our reorganized Amazon Fashion dataset.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods with over 10% improvements on the standard AUC
metric on the established tasks. More importantly, 82.5% of the users prefer
our diverse-style recommendations over other alternatives in a real-world
perception study.

Title: HEMlets PoSh: Learning Part-Centric Heatmap Triplets for 3D Human Pose
  and Shape Estimation
Authors: Kun Zhou, Xiaoguang Han, Nianjuan Jiang, Kui Jia, Jiangbo Lu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 14figures, Externed version of HEMlets Pose [ICCV2019].
  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1910.12032
\\
  Estimating 3D human pose from a single image is a challenging task. This work
attempts to address the uncertainty of lifting the detected 2D joints to the 3D
space by introducing an intermediate state-Part-Centric Heatmap Triplets
(HEMlets), which shortens the gap between the 2D observation and the 3D
interpretation. The HEMlets utilize three joint-heatmaps to represent the
relative depth information of the end-joints for each skeletal body part. In
our approach, a Convolutional Network (ConvNet) is first trained to predict
HEMlets from the input image, followed by a volumetric joint-heatmap
regression. We leverage on the integral operation to extract the joint
locations from the volumetric heatmaps, guaranteeing end-to-end learning.
Despite the simplicity of the network design, the quantitative comparisons show
a significant performance improvement over the best-of-grade methods (e.g.
$20\%$ on Human3.6M). The proposed method naturally supports training with
"in-the-wild" images, where only weakly-annotated relative depth information of
skeletal joints is available. This further improves the generalization ability
of our model, as validated by qualitative comparisons on outdoor images.
Leveraging the strength of the HEMlets pose estimation, we further design and
append a shallow yet effective network module to regress the SMPL parameters of
the body pose and shape. We term the entire HEMlets-based human pose and shape
recovery pipeline HEMlets PoSh. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments on the existing human body recovery benchmarks justify the
state-of-the-art results obtained with our HEMlets PoSh approach.

Title: Tidying Deep Saliency Prediction Architectures
Authors: Navyasri Reddy, Samyak Jain, Pradeep Yarlagadda, Vineet Gandhi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Learning computational models for visual attention (saliency estimation) is
an effort to inch machines/robots closer to human visual cognitive abilities.
Data-driven efforts have dominated the landscape since the introduction of deep
neural network architectures. In deep learning research, the choices in
architecture design are often empirical and frequently lead to more complex
models than necessary. The complexity, in turn, hinders the application
requirements. In this paper, we identify four key components of saliency
models, i.e., input features, multi-level integration, readout architecture,
and loss functions. We review the existing state of the art models on these
four components and propose novel and simpler alternatives. As a result, we
propose two novel end-to-end architectures called SimpleNet and MDNSal, which
are neater, minimal, more interpretable and achieve state of the art
performance on public saliency benchmarks. SimpleNet is an optimized
encoder-decoder architecture and brings notable performance gains on the
SALICON dataset (the largest saliency benchmark). MDNSal is a parametric model
that directly predicts parameters of a GMM distribution and is aimed to bring
more interpretability to the prediction maps. The proposed saliency models can
be inferred at 25fps, making them suitable for real-time applications. Code and
pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/samyak0210/saliency.

\\
  The intelligent perception of endoscopic vision is appealing in many
computer-assisted and robotic surgeries. Achieving good vision-based analysis
with deep learning techniques requires large labeled datasets, but manual data
labeling is expensive and time-consuming in medical problems. When applying a
trained model to a different but relevant dataset, a new labeled dataset may be
required for training to avoid performance degradation. In this work, we
investigate a novel cross-domain strategy to reduce the need for manual data
labeling by proposing an image-to-image translation model called live-cadaver
GAN (LC-GAN) based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). More
specifically, we consider a situation when a labeled cadaveric surgery dataset
is available while the task is instrument segmentation on a live surgery
dataset. We train LC-GAN to learn the mappings between the cadaveric and live
datasets. To achieve instrument segmentation on live images, we can first
translate the live images to fake-cadaveric images with LC-GAN, and then
perform segmentation on the fake-cadaveric images with models trained on the
real cadaveric dataset. With this cross-domain strategy, we fully leverage the
labeled cadaveric dataset for segmentation on live images without the need to
label the live dataset again. Two generators with different architectures are
designed for LC-GAN to make use of the deep feature representation learned from
the cadaveric image based instrument segmentation task. Moreover, we propose
structural similarity loss and segmentation consistency loss to improve the
semantic consistency during translation. The results demonstrate that LC-GAN
achieves better image-to-image translation results, and leads to improved
segmentation performance in the proposed cross-domain segmentation task.

Title: Using an ensemble color space model to tackle adversarial examples
Authors: Shreyank N Gowda, Chun Yuan
Categories: cs.CV cs.CR
\\
  Minute pixel changes in an image drastically change the prediction that the
deep learning model makes. One of the most significant problems that could
arise due to this, for instance, is autonomous driving. Many methods have been
proposed to combat this with varying amounts of success. We propose a 3 step
method for defending such attacks. First, we denoise the image using
statistical methods. Second, we show that adopting multiple color spaces in the
same model can help us to fight these adversarial attacks further as each color
space detects certain features explicit to itself. Finally, the feature maps
generated are enlarged and sent back as an input to obtain even smaller
features. We show that the proposed model does not need to be trained to defend
an particular type of attack and is inherently more robust to black-box,
white-box, and grey-box adversarial attack techniques. In particular, the model
is 56.12 percent more robust than compared models in case of white box attacks
when the models are not subject to adversarial example training.

  We present a complete classification of minimal problems for generic
arrangements of points and lines in space observed partially by three
calibrated perspective cameras when each line is incident to at most one point.
This is a large class of interesting minimal problems that allows missing
observations in images due to occlusions and missed detections. There is an
infinite number of such minimal problems; however, we show that they can be
reduced to 140616 equivalence classes by removing superfluous features and
relabeling the cameras. We also introduce camera-minimal problems, which are
practical for designing minimal solvers, and show how to pick a simplest
camera-minimal problem for each minimal problem. This simplification results in
74575 equivalence classes. Only 76 of these were known; the rest are new. In
order to identify problems that have potential for practical solving of image
matching and 3D reconstruction, we present several smaller natural subfamilies
of camera-minimal problems as well as compute solution counts for all
camera-minimal problems which have less than 300 solutions for generic data.

  We propose a new method for video object segmentation (VOS) that addresses
object pattern learning from unlabeled videos, unlike most existing methods
which rely heavily on extensive annotated data. We introduce a unified
unsupervised/weakly supervised learning framework, called MuG, that
comprehensively captures intrinsic properties of VOS at multiple granularities.
Our approach can help advance understanding of visual patterns in VOS and
significantly reduce annotation burden. With a carefully-designed architecture
and strong representation learning ability, our learned model can be applied to
diverse VOS settings, including object-level zero-shot VOS, instance-level
zero-shot VOS, and one-shot VOS. Experiments demonstrate promising performance
in these settings, as well as the potential of MuG in leveraging unlabeled data
to further improve the segmentation accuracy.

\\
  In this paper, we propose a supervised mixing augmentation method, termed
SuperMix, which exploits the knowledge of a teacher to mix images based on
their salient regions. SuperMix optimizes a mixing objective that considers: i)
forcing the class of input images to appear in the mixed image, ii) preserving
the local structure of images, and iii) reducing the risk of suppressing
important features. To make the mixing suitable for large-scale applications,
we develop an optimization technique, $65\times$ faster than gradient descent
on the same problem. We validate the effectiveness of SuperMix through
extensive evaluations and ablation studies on two tasks of object
classification and knowledge distillation. On the classification task, SuperMix
provides the same performance as the advanced augmentation methods, such as
AutoAugment. On the distillation task, SuperMix sets a new state-of-the-art
with a significantly simplified distillation method. Particularly, in six out
of eight teacher-student setups from the same architectures, the students
trained on the mixed data surpass their teachers with a notable margin.

  Purpose: Develop AI-based automated CT image analysis tools for detection,
quantification, and tracking of Coronavirus; demonstrate they can differentiate
coronavirus patients from non-patients. Materials and Methods: Multiple
international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were
included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning
models, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with
clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to
analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19
thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient
over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study
includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S). Results:
Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT
studies were 0.996 AUC (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) ; on datasets of Chinese control and
infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2%
specificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output
enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and
visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume
display. Our suggested Corona score measures the progression of disease over
time. Conclusion: This initial study, which is currently being expanded to a
larger population, demonstrated that rapidly developed AI-based image analysis
can achieve high accuracy in detection of Coronavirus as well as quantification
and tracking of disease burden.

\\
  For many of the physical phenomena around us, we have developed sophisticated
models explaining their behavior. Nevertheless, measuring physical properties
from visual observations is challenging due to the high number of causally
underlying physical parameters -- including material properties and external
forces. In this paper, we propose to measure latent physical properties for
cloth in the wind without ever having seen a real example before. Our solution
is an iterative refinement procedure with simulation at its core. The algorithm
gradually updates the physical model parameters by running a simulation of the
observed phenomenon and comparing the current simulation to a real-world
observation. The correspondence is measured using an embedding function that
maps physically similar examples to nearby points. We consider a case study of
cloth in the wind, with curling flags as our leading example -- a seemingly
simple phenomena but physically highly involved. Based on the physics of cloth
and its visual manifestation, we propose an instantiation of the embedding
function. For this mapping, modeled as a deep network, we introduce a spectral
layer that decomposes a video volume into its temporal spectral power and
corresponding frequencies. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
compares favorably to prior work on the task of measuring cloth material
properties and external wind force from a real-world video.

  There are thousands of actively spoken languages on Earth, but a single
visual world. Grounding in this visual world has the potential to bridge the
gap between all these languages. Our goal is to use visual grounding to improve
unsupervised word mapping between languages. The key idea is to establish a
common visual representation between two languages by learning embeddings from
unpaired instructional videos narrated in the native language. Given this
shared embedding we demonstrate that (i) we can map words between the
languages, particularly the 'visual' words; (ii) that the shared embedding
provides a good initialization for existing unsupervised text-based word
translation techniques, forming the basis for our proposed hybrid visual-text
mapping algorithm, MUVE; and (iii) our approach achieves superior performance
by addressing the shortcomings of text-based methods -- it is more robust,
handles datasets with less commonality, and is applicable to low-resource
languages. We apply these methods to translate words from English to French,
Korean, and Japanese -- all without any parallel corpora and simply by watching
many videos of people speaking while doing things.

Title: SOS: Selective Objective Switch for Rapid Immunofluorescence Whole Slide
  Image Classification
Authors: Sam Maksoud, Kun Zhao, Peter Hobson, Anthony Jennings, and Brian
  Lovell
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted for publication at CVPR2020
\\
  The difficulty of processing gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) in clinical
microscopy has been a long-standing barrier to implementing computer aided
diagnostic systems. Since modern computing resources are unable to perform
computations at this extremely large scale, current state of the art methods
utilize patch-based processing to preserve the resolution of WSIs. However,
these methods are often resource intensive and make significant compromises on
processing time. In this paper, we demonstrate that conventional patch-based
processing is redundant for certain WSI classification tasks where high
resolution is only required in a minority of cases. This reflects what is
observed in clinical practice; where a pathologist may screen slides using a
low power objective and only switch to a high power in cases where they are
uncertain about their findings. To eliminate these redundancies, we propose a
method for the selective use of high resolution processing based on the
confidence of predictions on downscaled WSIs --- we call this the Selective
Objective Switch (SOS). Our method is validated on a novel dataset of 684
Liver-Kidney-Stomach immunofluorescence WSIs routinely used in the
investigation of autoimmune liver disease. By limiting high resolution
processing to cases which cannot be classified confidently at low resolution,
we maintain the accuracy of patch-level analysis whilst reducing the inference
time by a factor of 7.74.

Title: Learning-Based Human Segmentation and Velocity Estimation Using

  In this paper, we propose an automatic labeled sequential data generation
pipeline for human segmentation and velocity estimation with point clouds.
Considering the impact of deep neural networks, state-of-the-art network
architectures have been proposed for human recognition using point clouds
captured by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). However, one disadvantage is
that legacy datasets may only cover the image domain without providing
important label information and this limitation has disturbed the progress of
research to date. Therefore, we develop an automatic labeled sequential data
generation pipeline, in which we can control any parameter or data generation
environment with pixel-wise and per-frame ground truth segmentation and
pixel-wise velocity information for human recognition. Our approach uses a
precise human model and reproduces a precise motion to generate realistic
artificial data. We present more than 7K video sequences which consist of 32
frames generated by the proposed pipeline. With the proposed sequence
generator, we confirm that human segmentation performance is improved when
using the video domain compared to when using the image domain. We also
evaluate our data by comparing with data generated under different conditions.
In addition, we estimate pedestrian velocity with LiDAR by only utilizing data
generated by the proposed pipeline.

Title: PONAS: Progressive One-shot Neural Architecture Search for Very
  Efficient Deployment
Authors: Sian-Yao Huang and Wei-Ta Chu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We achieve very efficient deep learning model deployment that designs neural
network architectures to fit different hardware constraints. Given a
constraint, most neural architecture search (NAS) methods either sample a set
of sub-networks according to a pre-trained accuracy predictor, or adopt the
evolutionary algorithm to evolve specialized networks from the supernet. Both
approaches are time consuming. Here our key idea for very efficient deployment
is, when searching the architecture space, constructing a table that stores the
validation accuracy of all candidate blocks at all layers. For a stricter
hardware constraint, the architecture of a specialized network can be very
efficiently determined based on this table by picking the best candidate blocks
that yield the least accuracy loss. To accomplish this idea, we propose
Progressive One-shot Neural Architecture Search (PONAS) that combines
advantages of progressive NAS and one-shot methods. In PONAS, we propose a
two-stage training scheme, including the meta training stage and the
fine-tuning stage, to make the search process efficient and stable. During
search, we evaluate candidate blocks in different layers and construct the
accuracy table that is to be used in deployment. Comprehensive experiments
verify that PONAS is extremely flexible, and is able to find architecture of a
specialized network in around 10 seconds. In ImageNet classification, 75.2%
top-1 accuracy can be obtained, which is comparable with the state of the arts.

Title: Uncertainty depth estimation with gated images for 3D reconstruction

\\
  Gated imaging is an emerging sensor technology for self-driving cars that
provides high-contrast images even under adverse weather influence. It has been
shown that this technology can even generate high-fidelity dense depth maps
with accuracy comparable to scanning LiDAR systems. In this work, we extend the
recent Gated2Depth framework with aleatoric uncertainty providing an additional
confidence measure for the depth estimates. This confidence can help to filter
out uncertain estimations in regions without any illumination. Moreover, we
show that training on dense depth maps generated by LiDAR depth completion
algorithms can further improve the performance.

Title: Cars Can't Fly up in the Sky: Improving Urban-Scene Segmentation via
  Height-driven Attention Networks
Authors: Sungha Choi, Joanne T. Kim, Jaegul Choo
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  This paper exploits the intrinsic features of urban-scene images and proposes
a general add-on module, called height-driven attention networks (HANet), for
improving semantic segmentation for urban-scene images. It emphasizes
informative features or classes selectively according to the vertical position
of a pixel. The pixel-wise class distributions are significantly different from
each other among horizontally segmented sections in the urban-scene images.
Likewise, urban-scene images have their own distinct characteristics, but most
semantic segmentation networks do not reflect such unique attributes in the
architecture. The proposed network architecture incorporates the capability
exploiting the attributes to handle the urban scene dataset effectively. We
validate the consistent performance (mIoU) increase of various semantic
segmentation models on two datasets when HANet is adopted. This extensive
quantitative analysis demonstrates that adding our module to existing models is
easy and cost-effective. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance
on the Cityscapes benchmark with a large margin among ResNet101 based
segmentation models. Also, we show that the proposed model is coherent with the
facts observed in the urban scene by visualizing and interpreting the attention
map.

  Anti-spoofing

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 17 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Ethnic bias has proven to negatively affect the performance of face
recognition systems, and it remains an open research problem in face
anti-spoofing. In order to study the ethnic bias for face anti-spoofing, we
introduce the largest up to date CASIA-SURF Cross-ethnicity Face Anti-spoofing
(CeFA) dataset (briefly named CeFA), covering $3$ ethnicities, $3$ modalities,
$1,607$ subjects, and 2D plus 3D attack types. Four protocols are introduced to
measure the affect under varied evaluation conditions, such as cross-ethnicity,
unknown spoofs or both of them. To the best of our knowledge, CeFA is the first
dataset including explicit ethnic labels in current published/released datasets
for face anti-spoofing. Then, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion method as a
strong baseline to alleviate these bias, namely, the static-dynamic fusion
mechanism applied in each modality (i.e., RGB, Depth and infrared image).
Later, a partially shared fusion strategy is proposed to learn complementary
information from multiple modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASIA-SURF,
OULU-NPU, SiW and the CeFA dataset.

Title: Regularized Adaptation for Stable and Efficient Continuous-Level
  Learning
Authors: Hyeongmin Lee, Taeoh Kim, Hanbin Son, Sangwook Baek, Minsu Cheon,
  Sangyoun Lee
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image processing, most of the
studies propose networks that are optimized for a single-level (or a
single-objective); thus, they underperform on other levels and must be
retrained for delivery of optimal performance. Using multiple models to cover
multiple levels involves very high computational costs. To solve these
problems, recent approaches train the networks on two different levels and
propose their own interpolation methods to enable the arbitrary intermediate
levels. However, many of them fail to adapt hard tasks or interpolate smoothly,
or the others still require large memory and computational cost. In this paper,
we propose a novel continuous-level learning framework using a Filter
Transition Network (FTN) which is a non-linear module that easily adapt to new
levels, and is regularized to prevent undesirable side-effects. Additionally,
for stable learning of FTN, we newly propose a method to initialize non-linear
CNNs with identity mappings. Furthermore, FTN is extremely lightweight module
since it is a data-independent module, which means it is not affected by the
spatial resolution of the inputs. Extensive results for various image
processing tasks indicate that the performance of FTN is stable in terms of
adaptation and interpolation, and comparable to that of the other heavy
frameworks.

Title: Video2Commonsense: Generating Commonsense Descriptions to Enrich Video
  Captioning
Authors: Zhiyuan Fang, Tejas Gokhale, Pratyay Banerjee, Chitta Baral, Yezhou
  Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
\\
  Captioning is a crucial and challenging task for video understanding. In
videos that involve active agents such as humans, the agent's actions can bring
about myriad changes in the scene. These changes can be observable, such as
movements, manipulations, and transformations of the objects in the scene --
these are reflected in conventional video captioning. However, unlike images,
actions in videos are also inherently linked to social and commonsense aspects
such as intentions (why the action is taking place), attributes (such as who is
doing the action, on whom, where, using what etc.) and effects (how the world
changes due to the action, the effect of the action on other agents). Thus for
video understanding, such as when captioning videos or when answering question
about videos, one must have an understanding of these commonsense aspects. We
present the first work on generating \textit{commonsense} captions directly
from videos, in order to describe latent aspects such as intentions,
attributes, and effects. We present a new dataset "Video-to-Commonsense (V2C)"
that contains 9k videos of human agents performing various actions, annotated
with 3 types of commonsense descriptions. Additionally we explore the use of
open-ended video-based commonsense question answering (V2C-QA) as a way to
enrich our captions. We finetune our commonsense generation models on the
V2C-QA task where we ask questions about the latent aspects in the video. Both
the generation task and the QA task can be used to enrich video captions.

\\
  Object recognition techniques using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have
achieved great success. However, state-of-the-art object detection methods
still perform poorly on large vocabulary and long-tailed datasets, e.g. LVIS.
In this work, we analyze this problem from a novel perspective: each positive
sample of one category can be seen as a negative sample for other categories,
making the tail categories receive more discouraging gradients. Based on it, we
propose a simple but effective loss, named equalization loss, to tackle the
problem of long-tailed rare categories by simply ignoring those gradients for
rare categories. The equalization loss protects the learning of rare categories
from being at a disadvantage during the network parameter updating. Thus the
model is capable of learning better discriminative features for objects of rare
classes. Without any bells and whistles, our method achieves AP gains of 4.1%
and 4.8% for the rare and common categories on the challenging LVIS benchmark,
compared to the Mask R-CNN baseline. With the utilization of the effective
equalization loss, we finally won the 1st place in the LVIS Challenge 2019.

Title: Improving Convolutional Neural Networks Via Conservative Field
  Regularisation and Integration
Authors: Dominique Beaini, Sofiane Achiche, Maxime Raison
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 11 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Current research in convolutional neural networks (CNN) focuses mainly on
changing the architecture of the networks, optimizing the hyper-parameters and
improving the gradient descent. However, most work use only 3 standard families
of operations inside the CNN, the convolution, the activation function, and the
pooling. In this work, we propose a new family of operations based on the
Green's function of the Laplacian, which allows the network to solve the
Laplacian, to integrate any vector field and to regularize the field by forcing
it to be conservative. Hence, the Green's function (GF) is the first operation
that regularizes the 2D or 3D feature space by forcing it to be conservative
and physically interpretable, instead of regularizing the norm of the weights.
Our results show that such regularization allows the network to learn faster,
to have smoother training curves and to better generalize, without any
additional parameter. The current manuscript presents early results, more work
is required to benchmark the proposed method.

Title: A Fourier Domain Feature Approach for Human Activity Recognition & Fall
  Detection

Journal-ref: 2020 6th International Conference on Signal Processing and
  Communication
\\
  Elder people consequence a variety of problems while living Activities of
Daily Living (ADL) for the reason of age, sense, loneliness and cognitive
changes. These cause the risk to ADL which leads to several falls. Getting real
life fall data is a difficult process and are not available whereas simulated
falls become ubiquitous to evaluate the proposed methodologies. From the
literature review, it is investigated that most of the researchers used raw and
energy features (time domain features) of the signal data as those are most
discriminating. However, in real life situations fall signal may be noisy than
the current simulated data. Hence the result using raw feature may dramatically
changes when using in a real life scenario. This research is using frequency
domain Fourier coefficient features to differentiate various human activities
of daily life. The feature vector constructed using those Fast Fourier
Transform are robust to noise and rotation invariant. Two different supervised
classifiers kNN and SVM are used for evaluating the method. Two standard
publicly available datasets are used for benchmark analysis. In this research,
more discriminating results are obtained applying kNN classifier than the SVM
classifier. Various standard measure including Standard Accuracy (SA), Macro
Average Accuracy (MAA), Sensitivity (SE) and Specificity (SP) has been
accounted. In all cases, the proposed method outperforms energy features
whereas competitive results are shown with raw features. It is also noticed
that the proposed method performs better than the recently risen deep learning
approach in which data augmentation method were not used.

Title: Keyfilter-Aware Real-Time UAV Object Tracking

Comments: 2020 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)
\\
  Correlation filter-based tracking has been widely applied in unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) with high efficiency. However, it has two imperfections, i.e.,
boundary effect and filter corruption. Several methods enlarging the search
area can mitigate boundary effect, yet introducing undesired background
distraction. Existing frame-by-frame context learning strategies for repressing
background distraction nevertheless lower the tracking speed. Inspired by
keyframe-based simultaneous localization and mapping, keyfilter is proposed in
visual tracking for the first time, in order to handle the above issues
efficiently and effectively. Keyfilters generated by periodically selected
keyframes learn the context intermittently and are used to restrain the
learning of filters, so that 1) context awareness can be transmitted to all the
filters via keyfilter restriction, and 2) filter corruption can be repressed.
Compared to the state-of-the-art results, our tracker performs better on two
challenging benchmarks, with enough speed for UAV real-time applications.

Title: Channel Interaction Networks for Fine-Grained Image Categorization
Authors: Yu Gao, Xintong Han, Xun Wang, Weilin Huang, Matthew R. Scott
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  Fine-grained image categorization is challenging due to the subtle
inter-class differences.We posit that exploiting the rich relationships between
channels can help capture such differences since different channels correspond
to different semantics. In this paper, we propose a channel interaction network
(CIN), which models the channel-wise interplay both within an image and across
images. For a single image, a self-channel interaction (SCI) module is proposed
to explore channel-wise correlation within the image. This allows the model to
learn the complementary features from the correlated channels, yielding
stronger fine-grained features. Furthermore, given an image pair, we introduce
a contrastive channel interaction (CCI) module to model the cross-sample
channel interaction with a metric learning framework, allowing the CIN to
distinguish the subtle visual differences between images. Our model can be
trained efficiently in an end-to-end fashion without the need of multi-stage
training and testing. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on three
publicly available benchmarks, where the proposed method consistently

Title: GID-Net: Detecting Human-Object Interaction with Global and Instance
  Dependency
Authors: Dongming Yang, YueXian Zou, Jian Zhang, Ge Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 30 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Since detecting and recognizing individual human or object are not adequate
to understand the visual world, learning how humans interact with surrounding
objects becomes a core technology. However, convolution operations are weak in
depicting visual interactions between the instances since they only build
blocks that process one local neighborhood at a time. To address this problem,
we learn from human perception in observing HOIs to introduce a two-stage
trainable reasoning mechanism, referred to as GID block. GID block breaks
through the local neighborhoods and captures long-range dependency of pixels
both in global-level and instance-level from the scene to help detecting
interactions between instances. Furthermore, we conduct a multi-stream network
called GID-Net, which is a human-object interaction detection framework
consisting of a human branch, an object branch and an interaction branch.
Semantic information in global-level and local-level are efficiently reasoned
and aggregated in each of the branches. We have compared our proposed GID-Net
with existing state-of-the-art methods on two public benchmarks, including
V-COCO and HICO-DET. The results have showed that GID-Net outperforms the
existing best-performing methods on both the above two benchmarks, validating
its efficacy in detecting human-object interactions.

Title: Semi-Local 3D Lane Detection and Uncertainty Estimation
Authors: Netalee Efrat, Max Bluvstein, Noa Garnett, Dan Levi, Shaul Oron, Bat
  El Shlomo
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose a novel camera-based DNN method for 3D lane detection with
uncertainty estimation. Our method is based on a semi-local, BEV, tile
representation that breaks down lanes into simple lane segments. It combines
learning a parametric model for the segments along with a deep feature
embedding that is then used to cluster segment together into full lanes. This
combination allows our method to generalize to complex lane topologies,
curvatures and surface geometries. Additionally, our method is the first to
output a learning based uncertainty estimation for the lane detection task. The
efficacy of our method is demonstrated in extensive experiments achieving
state-of-the-art results for camera-based 3D lane detection, while also showing
our ability to generalize to complex topologies, curvatures and road geometries
as well as to different cameras. We also demonstrate how our uncertainty
estimation aligns with the empirical error statistics indicating that it is
well calibrated and truly reflects the detection noise.

Title: Training-Set Distillation for Real-Time UAV Object Tracking
Authors: Fan Li, Changhong Fu, Fuling Lin, Yiming Li, Peng Lu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
\\
  Correlation filter (CF) has recently exhibited promising performance in
visual object tracking for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Such online learning
method heavily depends on the quality of the training-set, yet complicated
aerial scenarios like occlusion or out of view can reduce its reliability. In
this work, a novel time slot-based distillation approach is proposed to
efficiently and effectively optimize the training-set's quality on the fly. A
cooperative energy minimization function is established to score the historical
samples adaptively. To accelerate the scoring process, frames with high
confident tracking results are employed as the keyframes to divide the tracking
process into multiple time slots. After the establishment of a new slot, the
weighted fusion of the previous samples generates one key-sample, in order to
reduce the number of samples to be scored. Besides, when the current time slot
exceeds the maximum frame number, which can be scored, the sample with the
lowest score will be discarded. Consequently, the training-set can be
efficiently and reliably distilled. Comprehensive tests on two well-known UAV
benchmarks prove the effectiveness of our method with real-time speed on a
single CPU.

Title: Plant Disease Detection from Images
Authors: Anjaneya Teja Sarma Kalvakolanu
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Plant disease detection is a huge problem and often require professional help
to detect the disease. This research focuses on creating a deep learning model
that detects the type of disease that affected the plant from the images of the
leaves of the plants. The deep learning is done with the help of Convolutional
Neural Network by performing transfer learning. The model is created using
transfer learning and is experimented with both resnet 34 and resnet 50 to
demonstrate that discriminative learning gives better results. This method
achieved state of art results for the dataset used. The main goal is to lower
the professional help to detect the plant diseases and make this model
accessible to as many people as possible.

\\
  We study the XAI (explainable AI) on the face recognition task, particularly
the face verification here. Face verification is a crucial task in recent days
and it has been deployed to plenty of applications, such as access control,
surveillance, and automatic personal log-on for mobile devices. With the
increasing amount of data, deep convolutional neural networks can achieve very
high accuracy for the face verification task. Beyond exceptional performances,
deep face verification models need more interpretability so that we can trust
the results they generate. In this paper, we propose a novel similarity metric,
called explainable cosine ($xCos$), that comes with a learnable module that can
be plugged into most of the verification models to provide meaningful
explanations. With the help of $xCos$, we can see which parts of the 2 input
faces are similar, where the model pays its attention to, and how the local
similarities are weighted to form the output $xCos$ score. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method on LFW and various competitive benchmarks,
resulting in not only providing novel and desiring model interpretability for
face verification but also ensuring the accuracy as plugging into existing face
recognition models.

Title: Bi-Directional Attention for Joint Instance and Semantic Segmentation in
  Point Clouds
Authors: Guangnan Wu and Zhiyi Pan and Peng Jiang and Changhe Tu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Instance segmentation in point clouds is one of the most fine-grained ways to
understand the 3D scene. Due to its close relationship to semantic
segmentation, many works approach these two tasks simultaneously and leverage
the benefits of multi-task learning. However, most of them only considered
simple strategies such as element-wise feature fusion, which may not lead to
mutual promotion. In this work, we build a Bi-Directional Attention module on
backbone neural networks for 3D point cloud perception, which uses similarity
matrix measured from features for one task to help aggregate non-local
information for the other task, avoiding the potential feature exclusion and
task conflict. From comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on the S3DIS
dataset and the PartNet dataset, the superiority of our method is verified.
Moreover, the mechanism of how bi-directional attention module helps joint
instance and semantic segmentation is also analyzed.

Authors: Zhiqiang Shen, Zechun Liu, Zhuang Liu, Marios Savvides, and Trevor

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  In supervised learning, smoothing label/prediction distribution in neural
network training has been proven useful in preventing the model from being
over-confident, and is crucial for learning more robust visual representations.
This observation motivates us to explore the way to make predictions flattened
in unsupervised learning. Considering that human annotated labels are not
adopted in unsupervised learning, we introduce a straightforward approach to
perturb input image space in order to soften the output prediction space
indirectly. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we show empirically that with
the simple solution -- image mixture, we can learn more robust visual
representations from the transformed input, and the benefits of representations
learned from this space can be inherited by the linear classification and
downstream tasks.

Title: Predicting the Amount of GDPR Fines
Authors: Jukka Ruohonen and Kalle Hjerppe
Categories: cs.CY
Comments: Submitted
\\
  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was enforced in 2018. After
this enforcement, many fines have already been imposed by national data
protection authorities in the European Union (EU). This paper examines the
individual GDPR articles referenced in the enforcement decisions, as well as
predicts the amount of enforcement fines with available meta-data and text
mining features extracted from the enforcement decision documents. According to
the results, articles related to the general principles, lawfulness, and
information security have been the most frequently referenced ones. Although
the amount of fines imposed vary across the articles referenced, these three
particular articles do not stand out. Furthermore, good predictions are
attainable even with simple machine learning techniques for regression
analysis. Basic meta-data (such as the articles referenced and the country of
origin) yields slightly better performance compared to the text mining
features.

\\
  Nowadays, the agricultural data can be generated through various sources,
such as: Internet of Thing (IoT), sensors, satellites, weather stations,
robots, farm equipment, agricultural laboratories, farmers, government agencies
and agribusinesses. The analysis of this big data enables farmers, companies
and agronomists to extract high business and scientific knowledge, improving
their operational processes and product quality. However, before analysing this
data, different data sources need to be normalised, homogenised and integrated
into a unified data representation. In this paper, we propose an agricultural
data integration method using a constellation schema which is designed to be
flexible enough to incorporate other datasets and big data models. We also
apply some methods to extract knowledge with the view to improve crop yield;
these include finding suitable quantities of soil properties, herbicides and
insecticides for both increasing crop yield and protecting the environment.

Title: Compacting Frequent Star Patterns in RDF Graphs
Authors: Farah Karim and Maria-Esther Vidal and S\"oren Auer
Categories: cs.DB
DOI: 10.1007/s10844-020-00595-9
\\
  Knowledge graphs have become a popular formalism for representing entities
and their properties using a graph data model, e.g., the Resource Description
Framework (RDF). An RDF graph comprises entities of the same type connected to
objects or other entities using labeled edges annotated with properties. RDF
graphs usually contain entities that share the same objects in a certain group
of properties, i.e., they match star patterns composed of these properties and
objects. In case the number of these entities or properties in these star
patterns is large, the size of the RDF graph and query processing are
negatively impacted; we refer these star patterns as frequent star patterns. We
address the problem of identifying frequent star patterns in RDF graphs and
devise the concept of factorized RDF graphs, which denote compact
representations of RDF graphs where the number of frequent star patterns is
minimized. We also develop computational methods to identify frequent star
patterns and generate a factorized RDF graph, where compact RDF molecules
replace frequent star patterns. A compact RDF molecule of a frequent star
pattern denotes an RDF subgraph that instantiates the corresponding star
pattern. Instead of having all the entities matching the original frequent star
pattern, a surrogate entity is added and related to the properties of the
frequent star pattern; it is linked to the entities that originally match the
frequent star pattern. We evaluate the performance of our factorization
techniques on several RDF graph benchmarks and compare with a baseline built on
top of gSpan, a state-of-the-art algorithm to detect frequent patterns. The
outcomes evidence the efficiency of proposed approach and show that our
techniques are able to reduce execution time of the baseline approach in at
least three orders of magnitude reducing the RDF graph size by up to 66.56%.

Title: RealityCheck: Bringing Modularity, Hierarchy, and Abstraction to
  Automated Microarchitectural Memory Consistency Verification
Authors: Yatin A. Manerkar, Daniel Lustig, Margaret Martonosi
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Modern SoCs are heterogeneous parallel systems comprised of components
developed by distinct teams and possibly even different vendors. The memory
consistency model (MCM) of processors in such SoCs specifies the ordering rules
which constrain the values that can be read by load instructions in parallel
programs running on such systems. The implementation of required MCM orderings
can span components which may be designed and implemented by many different
teams. Ideally, each team would be able to specify the orderings enforced by
their components independently and then connect them together when conducting
MCM verification. However, no prior automated approach for formal hardware MCM
verification provided this.
  To bring automated hardware MCM verification in line with the realities of
the design process, we present RealityCheck, a methodology and tool for
automated formal MCM verification of modular microarchitectural ordering
specifications. RealityCheck allows users to specify their designs as a
hierarchy of distinct modules connected to each other rather than a single flat
specification. It can then automatically verify litmus test programs against
these modular specifications. RealityCheck also provides support for
abstraction, which enables scalable verification by breaking up the
verification of the entire design into smaller verification problems. We
present results for verifying litmus tests on 7 different designs using
RealityCheck. These include in-order and out-of-order pipelines, a non-blocking
cache, and a heterogeneous processor. Our case studies cover the TSO and RISC-V
(RVWMO) weak memory models. RealityCheck is capable of verifying 98 RVWMO
litmus tests in under 4 minutes each, and its capability for abstraction
enables up to a 32.1% reduction in litmus test verification time for RVWMO.

Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Energy efficiency has proven to be an important factor dominating the working
period of WSN surveillance systems. Intensive studies have been done to provide
energy efficient power management mechanisms. In this paper, we present PAS, a
Prediction-based Adaptive Sleeping mechanism for environment monitoring sensor
networks to conserve energy. PAS focuses on the diffusion stimulus (DS)
scenario, which is very common and important in the application of environment
monitoring. Different with most of previous works, PAS explores the features of
DS spreading process to obtain higher energy efficiency. In PAS, sensors
determine their sleeping schedules based on the observed emergency of DS
spreading. While sensors near the DS boundary stay awake to accurately capture
the possible stimulus arrival, the far away sensors turn into sleeping mode to
conserve energy. Simulation experiment shows that PAS largely reduces the
energy cost without decreasing system performance

Title: A Hierarchical Semantic Overlay for P2P Search
Authors: Tao Gu, Hung Keng Pung, Daqing Zhang
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  In this paper, we propose a hierarchical semantic overlay network for
searching heterogeneous data over wide-area networks. In this system, data are
represented as RDF triples based on ontologies. Peers that have the same
semantics are organized into a semantic cluster, and the semantic clusters are
self-organized into a one-dimensional ring space to form the toplevel semantic
overlay network. Each semantic cluster has its low-level overlay network which
can be built using an unstructured overlay or a DHT-based overlay. A search is
first forwarded to the appropriate semantic cluster, and then routed to the
specific peers that hold the relevant data using a parallel flooding algorithm
or a DHT-based routing algorithm. By combining the advantages of both
unstructured and structured overlay networks, we are able to achieve a better
tradeoff in terms of search efficiency, search cost and overlay maintenance
cost.

Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:0906.3925 by other authors
\\
  Computing becomes increasingly mobile and pervasive today; these changes
imply that applications and services must be aware of and adapt to their
changing contexts in highly dynamic environments. Today, building context-aware
systems is a complex task due to lack of an appropriate infrastructure support
in intelligent environments. A context-aware infrastructure requires an
appropriate context model to represent, manipulate and access context
information. In this paper, we propose a formal context model based on ontology
using OWL to address issues including semantic context representation, context
reasoning and knowledge sharing, context classification, context dependency and
quality of context. The main benefit of this model is the ability to reason
about various contexts. Based on our context model, we also present a
Service-Oriented Context-Aware Middleware (SOCAM) architecture for building of
context-aware services.

Title: Scaling Hyperledger Fabric Using Pipelined Execution and Sparse Peers
Authors: Parth Thakkar, Senthil Nathan
Categories: cs.DC cs.DB cs.PF
\\
  Many proofs of concept blockchain applications built using Hyperledger
Fabric, a permissioned blockchain platform, have recently been transformed into
production. However, the performance provided by Hyperledger Fabric is of
significant concern for enterprises due to steady growth in network usage.
Hence, in this paper, we study the performance achieved in a Fabric network
using vertical scaling (i.e., by adding more vCPUs) and horizontal scaling
(i.e., by adding more nodes) techniques. We observe that network scales very
poorly with both of these techniques. With vertical scaling, due to serial
execution of validation & commit phases of transactions, the allocated vCPUs
are underutilized. With horizontal scaling, due to redundant work between
nodes, allocated resources are wasted though it is utilized. Further, we
identify these techniques to be unsuited for dynamically scaling a network
quickly to mitigate an overload situation, and hence, it results in a 30% drop
in the performance. To increase the CPU utilization and hence the performance,
we re-architect Fabric to enable pipelined execution of validation & commit
phases by introducing dirty state management using a trie data structure.
Additionally, we facilitated the validation phase to validate transactions in
parallel by introducing a waiting-transactions dependency graph. To avoid
redundant work performed between nodes and to quickly scale up a network, we
propose a new type of peer node called sparse peer, which selective commits
transactions. Overall, we improved the throughput by 3x and reduced the time
taken to scale up a network by 96%.

Title: Geostatistical Modeling and Prediction Using Mixed-Precision Tile
  Cholesky Factorization
Authors: Sameh Abdulah, Hatem Ltaief, Ying Sun, Marc G. Genton, and David E.
  Keyes
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Geostatistics represents one of the most challenging classes of scientific
applications due to the desire to incorporate an ever increasing number of
geospatial locations to accurately model and predict environmental phenomena.
For example, the evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood function, which
constitutes the main computational phase, involves solving systems of linear
equations with a large dense symmetric and positive definite covariance matrix.
Cholesky, the standard algorithm, requires O(n^3) floating point operators and
has an O(n^2) memory footprint, where n is the number of geographical
locations. Here, we present a mixed-precision tile algorithm to accelerate the
Cholesky factorization during the log-likelihood function evaluation. Under an
appropriate ordering, it operates with double-precision arithmetic on tiles
around the diagonal, while reducing to single-precision arithmetic for tiles
sufficiently far off. This translates into an improvement of the performance
without any deterioration of the numerical accuracy of the application. We rely
on the StarPU dynamic runtime system to schedule the tasks and to overlap them
with data movement. To assess the performance and the accuracy of the proposed
mixed-precision algorithm, we use synthetic and real datasets on various shared
and distributed-memory systems possibly equipped with hardware accelerators. We
compare our mixed-precision Cholesky factorization against the double-precision
reference implementation as well as an independent block approximation method.
We obtain an average of 1.6X performance speedup on massively parallel
architectures while maintaining the accuracy necessary for modeling and
prediction.

Title: Evaluating Abstract Asynchronous Schwarz solvers
Authors: Pratik Nayak, Terry Cojean, Hartwig Anzt
Categories: cs.DC cs.MS
Comments: Preprint submitted to IJHPCA
\\
  With the commencement of the exascale computing era, we realize that the
majority of the leadership supercomputers are heterogeneous and massively
parallel even on a single node with multiple co-processors such as GPUs and
multiple cores on each node. For example, ORNLs Summit accumulates six NVIDIA
Tesla V100s and 42 core IBM Power9s on each node. Synchronizing across all
these compute resources in a single node or even across multiple nodes is
prohibitively expensive. Hence it is necessary to develop and study
asynchronous algorithms that circumvent this issue of bulk-synchronous
computing for massive parallelism. In this study, we examine the asynchronous
version of the abstract Restricted Additive Schwarz method as a solver where we
do not explicitly synchronize, but allow for communication of the data between
the sub-domains to be completely asynchronous thereby removing the bulk
synchronous nature of the algorithm.
  We accomplish this by using the onesided RMA functions of the MPI standard.
We study the benefits of using such an asynchronous solver over its synchronous
counterpart on both multi-core architectures and on multiple GPUs. We also
study the communication patterns and local solvers and their effect on the
global solver. Finally, we show that this concept can render attractive runtime
benefits over the synchronous counterparts.

Subject Authority Data (FRSAD) and the Simple Knowledge Organization System
(SKOS); natural language processing techniques are also implemented. Applying a
comparative analysis, the dataset comprises a thesaurus (Eurovoc), a subject
headings system (LCSH) and a classification scheme (DDC). These are compared
with an ontology (CIDOC-CRM) by focusing on how they define and handle concepts
and relations. It was observed that LCSH and DDC focus on the formalism of
character strings (nomens) rather than on the modelling of semantics; their
definition of what constitutes a concept is quite fuzzy, and they comprise a
large number of complex concepts. By contrast, thesauri have a coherent
definition of what constitutes a concept, and apply a systematic approach to
the modelling of relations. Ontologies explicitly define diverse types of
relations, and are by their nature machine-processable. The paper concludes
that the potential of both the expressiveness and machine processability of
each KOS is extensively regulated by its structural rules. It is harder to
represent subject headings and classification schemes as semantic networks with
nodes and arcs, while thesauri are more suitable for such a representation. In
addition, a paradigm shift is revealed which focuses on the modelling of
relations between concepts, rather than the concepts themselves.

Title: Online Graph Matching Problems with a Worst-Case Reassignment Budget
Authors: Yongho Shin, Kangsan Kim, Seungmin Lee, Hyung-Chan An

Comments: 16 pages, excluding the title page
ACM-class: F.2.2
\\
  In the online bipartite matching with reassignments problem, an algorithm is
initially given only one side of the vertex set of a bipartite graph; the
vertices on the other side are revealed to the algorithm one by one, along with
its incident edges. The algorithm is required to maintain a matching in the
current graph, where the algorithm revises the matching after each vertex
arrival by reassigning vertices. Bernstein, Holm, and Rotenberg showed that an
online algorithm can maintain a matching of maximum cardinality by performing
amortized $O(\log^2 n)$ reassignments per arrival.
  In this paper, we propose to consider the general question of how requiring a
non-amortized hard budget $k$ on the number of reassignments affects the
algorithms' performances, under various models from the literature.
  We show that a simple, widely-used algorithm is a best-possible deterministic
algorithm for all these models. For the unweighted maximum-cardinality problem,
the algorithm is a $(1-\frac{2}{k+2})$-competitive algorithm, which is the best
possible for a deterministic algorithm both under vertex arrivals and edge
arrivals. Applied to the load balancing problem, this yields a bifactor online
algorithm. For the weighted problem, which is traditionally studied assuming
the triangle inequality, we show that the power of reassignment allows us to
lift this assumption and the algorithm becomes a $\frac{1}{2}$-competitive
algorithm for $k=4$, improving upon the $\frac{1}{3}$ of the previous algorithm
without reassignments. We show that this also is a best-possible deterministic
algorithm.

\\
  A hole in a graph is an induced cycle of length at least 4. A hole is long if
its length is at least 5. By $P_t$ we denote a path on $t$ vertices. In this
paper we give polynomial-time algorithms for the following problems: the
Maximum Weight Independent Set problem in long-hole-free graphs, and the
Feedback Vertex Set problem in $P_5$-free graphs. Each of the above results
resolves a corresponding long-standing open problem.
  An extended $C_5$ is a five-vertex hole with an additional vertex adjacent to
one or two consecutive vertices of the hole. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the class of
graphs excluding an extended $C_5$ and holes of length at least $6$ as induced
subgraphs; $\mathcal{C}$ contains all long-hole-free graphs and all $P_5$-free
graphs. We show that, given an $n$-vertex graph $G \in \mathcal{C}$ with vertex
weights and an integer $k$, one can in time $n^{\Oh(k)}$ find a maximum-weight
induced subgraph of $G$ of treewidth less than $k$. This implies both
aforementioned results.

\\
  We introduce the Scheduling.jl Julia package, which is intended for
collaboratively conducting scheduling research and for sharing implementations
of algorithms. It provides the fundamental building blocks for implementing
scheduling algorithms following the three-field notation of Graham et al.,
i.e., it has functionality to describe machine environments, job
characteristics, and optimality criteria. Our goal is to foster algorithm and
code sharing in the scheduling community. Scheduling.jl can also be used to
support teaching scheduling theory in classes. We will show the main
functionalities of Scheduling.jl and give an example on how to use it by
comparing different algorithms for the problem of P||Cmax .

Title: Hitting Long Directed Cycles is Fixed-Parameter Tractable
Authors: Alexander G\"oke and D\'aniel Marx and Matthias Mnich
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 50 pages, 5 figures
\\
  In the Directed Long Cycle Hitting Set} problem we are given a directed graph
$G$, and the task is to find a set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices/arcs such that
$G-S$ has no cycle of length longer than $\ell$. We show that the problem can
be solved in time $2^{\mathcal O(\ell k^3\log k + k^5\log k\log\ell)}\cdot
n^{\mathcal O(1)}$, that is, it is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)
parameterized by $k$ and $\ell$. This algorithm can be seen as a far-reaching
generalization of the fixed-parameter tractability of {\sc Mixed Graph Feedback
Vertex Set} [Bonsma and Lokshtanov WADS 2011], which is already a common
generalization of the fixed-parameter tractability of (undirected) {\sc
Feedback Vertex Set} and the {\sc Directed Feedback Vertex Set} problems, two
classic results in parameterized algorithms. The algorithm requires significant
insights into the structure of graphs without directed cycles length longer
than $\ell$ and can be seen as an exact version of the approximation algorithm
following from the Erd{\H{o}}s-P{\'o}sa property for long cycles in directed
graphs proved by Kreutzer and Kawarabayashi [STOC 2015].

Title: Balanced Independent and Dominating Sets on Colored Interval Graphs
Authors: Sujoy Bhore, Jan-Henrik Haunert, Fabian Klute, Guangping Li, Martin

Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We study two new versions of independent and dominating set problems on
vertex-colored interval graphs, namely \emph{$f$-Balanced Independent Set}
($f$-BIS) and \emph{$f$-Balanced Dominating Set} ($f$-BDS). Let $G=(V,E)$ be a
vertex-colored interval graph with a $k$-coloring $\gamma \colon V \rightarrow
\{1,\ldots,k\}$ for some $k \in \mathbb N$. A subset of vertices $S\subseteq V$
is called \emph{$f$-balanced} if $S$ contains $f$ vertices from each color
class. In the $f$-BIS and $f$-BDS problems, the objective is to compute an
independent set or a dominating set that is $f$-balanced. We show that both
problems are \NP-complete even on proper interval graphs. For the BIS problem
on interval graphs, we design two \FPT\ algorithms, one parameterized by
$(f,k)$ and the other by the vertex cover number of $G$. Moreover, we present a
2-approximation algorithm for a slight variation of BIS on proper interval
graphs.

Title: SIMBA: A Skyrmionic In-Memory Binary Neural Network Accelerator
Authors: Venkata Pavan Kumar Miriyala, Kale Rahul Vishwanath, Xuanyao Fong
Categories: cs.ET cond-mat.dis-nn
\\
  Magnetic skyrmions are emerging as potential candidates for next generation
non-volatile memories. In this paper, we propose an in-memory binary neural
network (BNN) accelerator based on the non-volatile skyrmionic memory, which we
call as SIMBA. SIMBA consumes 26.7 mJ of energy and 2.7 ms of latency when
running an inference on a VGG-like BNN. Furthermore, we demonstrate
improvements in the performance of SIMBA by optimizing material parameters such
as saturation magnetization, anisotropic energy and damping ratio. Finally, we
show that the inference accuracy of BNNs is robust against the possible
stochastic behavior of SIMBA (88.5% +/- 1%).

Title: Voter Verification of BMD Ballots Is a Two-Part Question: Can They?
  Mostly, They Can. Do They? Mostly, They Don't
Authors: Philip Kortum, Michael D. Byrne, and Julie Whitmore
Categories: cs.HC cs.CR
Comments: 21 pages, 9 figures

\\
  The question of whether or not voters actually verify ballots produced by
ballot marking devices (BMDs) is presently the subject of some controversy.
Recent studies (e.g., Bernhard, et al. 2020) suggest the verification rate is
low. What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result
of voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters
simply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to
understand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants
participated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true
choices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The
design of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes
that were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the
instructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.
Results indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,
76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on
their ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative
remedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual
capabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,
which could prove as an effective countermeasure.

Title: Super-reflective Data: Speculative Imaginings of a World Where Data
  Works for People
Authors: Max Van Kleek
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  It's the year 2020, and every space and place on- and off-line has been
augmented with digital things that observe, record, transmit, and compute, for
the purposes of recording endless data traces of what is happening in the
world. Individually, these things (and the invisible services the power them)
have reached considerable sophistication in their ability to analyse and
dissect such observations, turning streams of audio and video into informative
data fragments. Yet somehow, individuals as end-users of platforms and services
have not seen the full potential of such data. In this speculative paper, we
propose two hypothetical mini scenarios different from our current digital
world. In the former, instead of hoarding it, data controllers turn captured
data over to those who need it as quickly as possible, working together to
combine, validate, and refine it for maximum usefulness. This simultaneously
addresses the data fragmentation and privacy problem, by handing over long-term
data governance to those that value it the most In the latter, we discuss
ethical dilemmas using the long-term use of such rich data and its tendency to
cause people to relentlessly optimise.

\\
  Current text visualization techniques typically provide overviews of document
content and structure using intrinsic properties such as term frequencies, term
co-occurrences, and sentence structures. However, these visualization
techniques do not provide conceptual overviews that consider domain-relevant
knowledge that is needed when examining documents such as research articles,
technical panels, or news reports. To address this shortcoming, we present
ConceptScope, a text visualization technique that aids visual analysis of
documents by referencing a domain ontology to represent the conceptual
relationships in a document. ConceptScope uses a Bubble TreeMap visualization
linked to multiple coordinated views of document structure and concept
hierarchy. The visualization also includes overviews of each concept and
corresponding information from the document. ConceptScope provides two
visualization modes: an exploration mode that allows an overview+detail
examination of a given document, and a comparison mode that allows the user to
visually compare conceptual structure between multiple documents. We
demonstrate ConceptScope by visualizing research articles and transcripts of
technical presentations in the computer science domain, and compare it with
Docuburst, the popular knowledge visualization tool for text.

  Construction of Digital Nudges. 53rd Hawaii International Conference on
  Systems Sciences (HICSS), pp. 3928-3937
\\
  Under certain circumstances, humans tend to behave in irrational ways,
leading to situations in which they make undesirable choices. The concept of
digital nudging addresses these limitations of bounded rationality by
establishing a libertarian paternalist alternative to nudge users in virtual
environments towards their own preferential choices. Thereby, choice
architectures are designed to address biases and heuristics involved in
cognitive thinking. As research on digital nudging has become increasingly
popular in the Information Systems community, an increasing necessity for
ethical guidelines has emerged around this concept to safeguard its
legitimization in distinction to e.g. persuasion or manipulation. However,
reflecting on ethical debates regarding digital nudging in academia, we find
that current conceptualizations are scare. This is where on the basis of
existing literature, we provide a conceptualization of ethical guidelines for
the design of digital nudges, and thereby aim to ensure the applicability of
nudging mechanisms in virtual environments.

Title: Human-in-the-Loop Design Cycles -- A Process Framework that Integrates

\\
  Demands on more transparency of the backbox nature of machine learning models
have led to the recent rise of human-in-the-loop in machine learning, i.e.
processes that integrate humans in the training and application of machine
learning models. The present work argues that this process requirement does not
represent an obstacle but an opportunity to optimize the design process. Hence,
this work proposes a new process framework, Human-in-the-learning-loop (HILL)
Design Cycles - a design process that integrates the structural elements of
agile and design thinking process, and controls the training of a machine
learning model by the human in the loop. The HILL Design Cycles process
replaces the qualitative user testing by a quantitative psychometric
measurement instrument for design perception. The generated user feedback
serves to train a machine learning model and to instruct the subsequent design
cycle along four design dimensions (novelty, energy, simplicity, tool). Mapping
the four-dimensional user feedback into user stories and priorities, the design
sprint thus transforms the user feedback directly into the implementation
process. The human in the loop is a quality engineer who scrutinizes the
collected user feedback to prevents invalid data to enter machine learning
model training.

Title: Text classification with word embedding regularization and soft

\\
  Since the seminal work of Mikolov et al., word embeddings have become the
preferred word representations for many natural language processing tasks.
Document similarity measures extracted from word embeddings, such as the soft
cosine measure (SCM) and the Word Mover's Distance (WMD), were reported to
achieve state-of-the-art performance on semantic text similarity and text
classification.
  Despite the strong performance of the WMD on text classification and semantic
text similarity, its super-cubic average time complexity is impractical. The
SCM has quadratic worst-case time complexity, but its performance on text
classification has never been compared with the WMD. Recently, two word
embedding regularization techniques were shown to reduce storage and memory
costs, and to improve training speed, document processing speed, and task
performance on word analogy, word similarity, and semantic text similarity.
However, the effect of these techniques on text classification has not yet been
studied.
  In our work, we investigate the individual and joint effect of the two word
embedding regularization techniques on the document processing speed and the
task performance of the SCM and the WMD on text classification. For evaluation,
we use the $k$NN classifier and six standard datasets: BBCSPORT, TWITTER,
OHSUMED, REUTERS-21578, AMAZON, and 20NEWS.
  We show 39% average $k$NN test error reduction with regularized word
embeddings compared to non-regularized word embeddings. We describe a practical
procedure for deriving such regularized embeddings through Cholesky
factorization. We also show that the SCM with regularized word embeddings
significantly outperforms the WMD on text classification and is over 10,000
times faster.

Comments: Preprint of a full paper at European Semantic Web Conference 2020
  (ESWC 2020)
\\
  When it comes to factual knowledge about a wide range of domains, Wikipedia
is often the prime source of information on the web. DBpedia and YAGO, as large
cross-domain knowledge graphs, encode a subset of that knowledge by creating an
entity for each page in Wikipedia, and connecting them through edges. It is
well known, however, that Wikipedia-based knowledge graphs are far from
complete. Especially, as Wikipedia's policies permit pages about subjects only
if they have a certain popularity, such graphs tend to lack information about
less well-known entities. Information about these entities is oftentimes
available in the encyclopedia, but not represented as an individual page. In
this paper, we present a two-phased approach for the extraction of entities
from Wikipedia's list pages, which have proven to serve as a valuable source of
information. In the first phase, we build a large taxonomy from categories and
list pages with DBpedia as a backbone. With distant supervision, we extract
training data for the identification of new entities in list pages that we use
in the second phase to train a classification model. With this approach we
extract over 700k new entities and extend DBpedia with 7.5M new type statements
and 3.8M new facts of high precision.

Title: A Practical Approach to Navigating the Tradeoff Between Privacy and
  Precise Utility
Authors: Chandra Sharma, George Amariucai
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Due to the recent popularity of online social networks, coupled with people's
propensity to disclose personal information in an effort to achieve certain
gratifications, the problem of navigating the tradeoff between privacy and
utility attracted a lot of recent interest and generated a rich body of
research. A critical prerequisite to solving the problem is to appropriately
capture the privacy and the utility aspects in the problem formulation. Most of
the existing works' focus is on the notion of privacy, while utility loss is
often treated as the undesirable but necessary distortion of the true data,
introduced by the privacy mechanism. By contrast, we are interested in
modelling utility differently, by associating it with specific attributes of a
user, just like privacy is associated with specific private attributes in the
literature. Our model of utility facilitates a better and more precise privacy
mechanism, and achieves better privacy-utility tradeoffs. We further
incorporate into our problem formulation a practical constraint on acceptable
loss in utility per unit gain in privacy, which allows users to customize the
privacy mechanisms in order to account for the relative values that each user
associates with their own privacy and utility. This paper discusses the
intricacies of our utility model and the corresponding privacy-utility
tradeoff, and introduces a heuristic greedy algorithm to solve the problem.

Title: Beam Designs for Millimeter-Wave Backhaul with Dual-Polarized Uniform
  Planar Arrays
Authors: Sucheol Kim, Junil Choi, and Jiho Song
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Communications
\\
  This paper proposes hybrid beamforming designs for millimeter-wave (mmWave)
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) backhaul systems equipped with uniform
planar arrays (UPAs) of dual-polarization antennas at both the transmit and
receive base stations. The proposed beamforming designs are to near-optimally
solve optimization problems taking the dual-polarization UPA structure into
account. Based on the solutions of optimization problems, this paper shows it
is possible to generate the optimal dual-polarization beamformer from the
optimal single-polarization beamformer sharing the same optimality. As specific
examples, squared error and magnitude of inner product are considered
respectively for optimization criteria. To optimize proposed beamformers,
partial channel information is needed, and the use of low overhead pilot
sequences is also proposed to figure out the required information. Simulation
results verify that the resulting beamformers have the most uniform gain (with
the squared error criterion) or the highest average gain (with the magnitude of
inner product criterion) in the covering region with the UPA of
dual-polarization antennas.

  Cache-aided content delivery is studied in a multi-server system with $P$
servers and $K$ users, each equipped with a local cache memory. In the delivery
phase, each user connects randomly to any $\rho$ out of $P$ servers. Thanks to
the availability of multiple servers, which model small-cell base stations
(SBSs), demands can be satisfied with reduced storage capacity at each server
and reduced delivery rate per server; however, this also leads to reduced
multicasting opportunities compared to the single-server scenario. A joint
storage and proactive caching scheme is proposed, which exploits coded storage
across the servers, uncoded cache placement at the users, and coded delivery.
The delivery \textit{latency} is studied for both \textit{successive} and
\textit{parallel} transmissions from the servers. It is shown that, with
successive transmissions the achievable average delivery latency is comparable
to the one achieved in the single-server scenario, while the gap between the
two depends on $\rho$, the available redundancy across the servers, and can be
reduced by increasing the storage capacity at the SBSs. The optimality of the
proposed scheme with uncoded cache placement and MDS-coded server storage is
also proved for successive transmissions.

  Many generator matrices for constructing extremal binary self-dual codes of
different lengths have the form G=(I|A), where I is the n by n identity matrix
and A is the n by n matrix fully determined by the first row. In this work, we
define a generator matrix in which A is a block matrix, where the blocks come
from group rings and also, A is not fully determined by the elements appearing
in the first row. By applying our construction over F_2+uF_2 and by employing
the extension method for codes, we were able to construct new extremal binary
self-dual codes of length 68. Additionally, by employing a generalised
neighbour method to the codes obtained, we were able to construct many new
binary self-dual [68,34,12]-codes with the rare parameters gamma=7,8 and 9 in
W_{68,2}. In particular, we find 92 new binary self-dual [68,34,12]-codes.

  We analyse the effect of correlation between the forward and backward links
on the capacity of backscatter communication systems. To that aim, we obtain an
analytical expression for the average capacity under a correlated Rayleigh
product fading channel, as well as closed-form asymptotic expressions for the
high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Our results show that
correlation is indeed detrimental for a fixed target SNR; contrarily to the
common belief, we also see that correlation can be actually beneficial in some
instances when a fixed power budget is considered.

Title: Beyond the Guruswami-Sudan (and Parvaresh-Vardy) Radii: Folded
  Reed-Solomon, Multiplicity and Derivative Codes
Authors: Neophytos Charalambides
Categories: cs.IT cs.DM math.IT
Comments: Expository
\\
  The classical family of Reed-Solomon codes consist of evaluations of
polynomials over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of degree less than $k$, at
$n$ distinct field elements. These are arguably the most widely used and
studied codes, as they have both erasure and error-correction capabilities,
among many others nice properties. In this survey we study closely related
codes, folded Reed-Solomon codes, which are the first constructive codes to
achieve the list decoding capacity. We then study two more codes which also
have this feature, \textit{multiplicity codes} and \textit{derivative codes}.
Our focus for the most part are the list decoding algorithms of these codes,
though we also look into the local decodability of multiplicity codes.

Title: Curriculum Learning for Reinforcement Learning Domains: A Framework and
  Survey
Authors: Sanmit Narvekar, Bei Peng, Matteo Leonetti, Jivko Sinapov, Matthew E.
  Taylor, and Peter Stone
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular paradigm for addressing sequential
decision tasks in which the agent has only limited environmental feedback.
Despite many advances over the past three decades, learning in many domains
still requires a large amount of interaction with the environment, which can be
prohibitively expensive in realistic scenarios. To address this problem,
transfer learning has been applied to reinforcement learning such that
experience gained in one task can be leveraged when starting to learn the next,
harder task. More recently, several lines of research have explored how tasks,
or data samples themselves, can be sequenced into a curriculum for the purpose
of learning a problem that may otherwise be too difficult to learn from
scratch. In this article, we present a framework for curriculum learning (CL)
in reinforcement learning, and use it to survey and classify existing CL
methods in terms of their assumptions, capabilities, and goals. Finally, we use
our framework to find open problems and suggest directions for future RL
curriculum learning research.

  To facilitate research in the direction of sample-efficient reinforcement
learning, we held the MineRL Competition on Sample-Efficient Reinforcement
Learning Using Human Priors at the Thirty-fourth Conference on Neural
Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019). The primary goal of this
competition was to promote the development of algorithms that use human
demonstrations alongside reinforcement learning to reduce the number of samples
needed to solve complex, hierarchical, and sparse environments. We describe the
competition and provide an overview of the top solutions, each of which uses
deep reinforcement learning and/or imitation learning. We also discuss the
impact of our organizational decisions on the competition as well as future
directions for improvement.

Title: Context-aware Non-linear and Neural Attentive Knowledge-based Models for
  Grade Prediction
Authors: Sara Morsy and George Karypis
Categories: cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1904.11858
\\
  Grade prediction for future courses not yet taken by students is important as
it can help them and their advisers during the process of course selection as
well as for designing personalized degree plans and modifying them based on
their performance. One of the successful approaches for accurately predicting a
student's grades in future courses is Cumulative Knowledge-based Regression
Models (CKRM). CKRM learns shallow linear models that predict a student's
grades as the similarity between his/her knowledge state and the target course.
However, prior courses taken by a student can have \black{different
contributions when estimating a student's knowledge state and towards each
target course, which} cannot be captured by linear models. Moreover, CKRM and
other grade prediction methods ignore the effect of concurrently-taken courses
on a student's performance in a target course. In this paper, we propose
context-aware non-linear and neural attentive models that can potentially
better estimate a student's knowledge state from his/her prior course
information, as well as model the interactions between a target course and
concurrent courses. Compared to the competing methods, our experiments on a
large real-world dataset consisting of more than $1.5$M grades show the
effectiveness of the proposed models in accurately predicting students' grades.
Moreover, the attention weights learned by the neural attentive model can be
helpful in better designing their degree plans.

Title: Multi-Objective Variational Autoencoder: an Application for Smart
  Infrastructure Maintenance
Authors: Ali Anaissi, Seid Miad Zandavi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Multi-way data analysis has become an essential tool for capturing underlying
structures in higher-order data sets where standard two-way analysis techniques
often fail to discover the hidden correlations between variables in multi-way
data. We propose a multi-objective variational autoencoder (MVA) method for
smart infrastructure damage detection and diagnosis in multi-way sensing data
based on the reconstruction probability of autoencoder deep neural network
(ADNN). Our method fuses data from multiple sensors in one ADNN at which
informative features are being extracted and utilized for damage
identification. It generates probabilistic anomaly scores to detect damage,
asses its severity and further localize it via a new localization layer
introduced in the ADNN.
  We evaluated our method on multi-way datasets in the area of structural
health monitoring for damage diagnosis purposes. The data was collected from
our deployed data acquisition system on a cable-stayed bridge in Western Sydney
and from a laboratory based building structure obtained from Los Alamos
National Laboratory (LANL). Experimental results show that the proposed method
can accurately detect structural damage. It was also able to estimate the
different levels of damage severity, and capture damage locations in an
unsupervised aspect. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our proposed
method shows better performance in terms of damage detection and localization.

Title: Tensorized Random Projections
Authors: Beheshteh T. Rakhshan and Guillaume Rabusseau
Categories: cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML
\\
  We introduce a novel random projection technique for efficiently reducing the
dimension of very high-dimensional tensors. Building upon classical results on
Gaussian random projections and Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms~(JLT), we
propose two tensorized random projection maps relying on the tensor train~(TT)
and CP decomposition format, respectively. The two maps offer very low memory
requirements and can be applied efficiently when the inputs are low rank
tensors given in the CP or TT format. Our theoretical analysis shows that the
dense Gaussian matrix in JLT can be replaced by a low-rank tensor implicitly
represented in compressed form with random factors, while still approximately
preserving the Euclidean distance of the projected inputs. In addition, our
results reveal that the TT format is substantially superior to CP in terms of
the size of the random projection needed to achieve the same distortion ratio.
Experiments on synthetic data validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate
the superiority of the TT decomposition.

Title: Trusted Confidence Bounds for Learning Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Dimitrios Boursinos and Xenofon Koutsoukos
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted at the Workshop on Assured Autonomous Systems (WAAS) 2020
\\
  Cyber-physical systems (CPS) can benefit by the use of learning enabled
components (LECs) such as deep neural networks (DNNs) for perception and
desicion making tasks. However, DNNs are typically non-transparent making
reasoning about their predictions very difficult, and hence their application
to safety-critical systems is very challenging. LECs could be integrated easier
into CPS if their predictions could be complemented with a confidence measure
that quantifies how much we trust their output. The paper presents an approach
for computing confidence bounds based on Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP).
We train a Triplet Network architecture to learn representations of the input
data that can be used to estimate the similarity between test examples and
examples in the training data set. Then, these representations are used to
estimate the confidence of a set predictor based on the DNN architecture used
in the triplet based on ICP. The approach is evaluated using a robotic
navigation benchmark and the results show that we can computed trusted
confidence bounds efficiently in real-time.

Title: Kernel Quantization for Efficient Network Compression
Authors: Zhongzhi Yu, Yemin Shi, Tiejun Huang, Yizhou Yu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This paper presents a novel network compression framework Kernel Quantization
(KQ), targeting to efficiently convert any pre-trained full-precision
convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a low-precision version without
significant performance loss. Unlike existing methods struggling with weight
bit-length, KQ has the potential in improving the compression ratio by
considering the convolution kernel as the quantization unit. Inspired by the
evolution from weight pruning to filter pruning, we propose to quantize in both
kernel and weight level. Instead of representing each weight parameter with a
low-bit index, we learn a kernel codebook and replace all kernels in the
convolution layer with corresponding low-bit indexes. Thus, KQ can represent
the weight tensor in the convolution layer with low-bit indexes and a kernel
codebook with limited size, which enables KQ to achieve significant compression
ratio. Then, we conduct a 6-bit parameter quantization on the kernel codebook
to further reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet
classification task prove that KQ needs 1.05 and 1.62 bits on average in VGG
and ResNet18, respectively, to represent each parameter in the convolution
layer and achieves the state-of-the-art compression ratio with little accuracy
loss.

Title: Improving the Backpropagation Algorithm with Consequentialism Weight
  Updates over Mini-Batches
Authors: Naeem Paeedeh and Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Least mean squares (LMS) is a particular case of the backpropagation (BP)
algorithm applied to single-layer neural networks with the mean squared error
(MSE) loss. One drawback of the LMS is that the instantaneous weight update is
proportional to the square of the norm of the input vector. Normalized least
mean squares (NLMS) algorithm amends this drawback by dividing the weight
changes by the square of the norm of the input vector. The affine projection
algorithm (APA) improved the NLMS algorithm to weight update over a batch of
recently seen samples. However, the application of NLMS and APA had been
limited to single-layer networks and adaptive filters. In this paper, we
consider a virtual target for each neuron of a multi-layer neural network and
show that the BP algorithm is equivalent to training the weights of each layer
using these virtual targets and the LMS algorithm. We also introduce a
consequentialism interpretation of the NLMS and the APA algorithms that
justifies their use in multi-layer neural networks. Given any optimization
algorithm based on the BP over mini-batches, we propose a novel
consequentialism method for updating the weights.Consequently, our proposed
weight update can be applied both to plain stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
and to momentum methods like RMSProp, Adam, and NAG. These ideas helped us to
update the weights more carefully in such a way that minimization of the loss
for one sample of the mini-batch does not interfere with other samples in that
mini-batch. Our experiments show the usefulness of the proposed method in
optimizing deep neural network architectures.

  Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM) are often used to describe the conditional
correlations between the components of a random vector. In this article, we
compare two families of GGM inference methods: nodewise edge selection and
penalised likelihood maximisation. We demonstrate on synthetic data that, when
the sample size is small, the two methods produce graphs with either too few or
too many edges when compared to the real one. As a result, we propose a
composite procedure that explores a family of graphs with an nodewise numerical
scheme and selects a candidate among them with an overall likelihood criterion.
We demonstrate that, when the number of observations is small, this selection
method yields graphs closer to the truth and corresponding to distributions
with better KL divergence with regards to the real distribution than the other
two. Finally, we show the interest of our algorithm on two concrete cases:
first on brain imaging data, then on biological nephrology data. In both cases
our results are more in line with current knowledge in each field.

Title: Delay-Adaptive Learning in Generalized Linear Contextual Bandits
Authors: Jose Blanchet, Renyuan Xu and Zhengyuan Zhou
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we consider online learning in generalized linear contextual
bandits where rewards are not immediately observed. Instead, rewards are
available to the decision-maker only after some delay, which is unknown and
stochastic. We study the performance of two well-known algorithms adapted to
this delayed setting: one based on upper confidence bounds, and the other based
on Thompson sampling. We describe modifications on how these two algorithms
should be adapted to handle delays and give regret characterizations for both
algorithms. Our results contribute to the broad landscape of contextual bandits
literature by establishing that both algorithms can be made to be robust to
delays, thereby helping clarify and reaffirm the empirical success of these two
algorithms, which are widely deployed in modern recommendation engines.

\\
  Deep Neural Network (DNN) has been showing great potential in kinds of
real-world applications such as fraud detection and distress prediction.
Meanwhile, data isolation has become a serious problem currently, i.e.,
different parties cannot share data with each other. To solve this issue, most
research leverages cryptographic techniques to train secure DNN models for
multi-parties without compromising their private data. Although such methods
have strong security guarantee, they are difficult to scale to deep networks
and large datasets due to its high communication and computation complexities.
To solve the scalability of the existing secure Deep Neural Network (DNN) in
data isolation scenarios, in this paper, we propose an industrial scale privacy
preserving neural network learning paradigm, which is secure against
semi-honest adversaries. Our main idea is to split the computation graph of DNN
into two parts, i.e., the computations related to private data are performed by
each party using cryptographic techniques, and the rest computations are done
by a neutral server with high computation ability. We also present a defender
mechanism for further privacy protection. We conduct experiments on real-world
fraud detection dataset and financial distress prediction dataset, the
encouraging results demonstrate its practicalness.

Title: Imputing Missing Boarding Stations With Machine Learning Methods
Authors: Nadav Shalit, Michael Fire and Eran Ben Elia
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  With the increase in population densities and environmental awareness, public
transport has become an important aspect of urban life. Consequently, large
quantities of transportation data are generated, and mining data from smart
card use has become a standardized method to understand the travel habits of
passengers. Public transport datasets, however, often may lack data integrity;
boarding stop information may be missing due to either imperfect acquirement
processes or inadequate reporting. As a result, large quantities of
observations and even complete sections of cities might be absent from the
smart card database. We have developed a machine (supervised) learning method
to impute missing boarding stops based on ordinal classification. In addition,
we present a new metric, Pareto Accuracy, to evaluate algorithms where classes
have an ordinal nature. Results are based on a case study in the Israeli city
of Beer Sheva for one month of data. We show that our proposed method
significantly notably outperforms current imputation methods and can improve
the accuracy and usefulness of large-scale transportation data.

Title: A Safety Framework for Critical Systems Utilising Deep Neural Networks

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Submitted and under review
\\
  Increasingly sophisticated mathematical modelling processes from Machine
Learning are being used to analyse complex data. However, the performance and
explainability of these models within practical critical systems requires a
rigorous and continuous verification of their safe utilisation. Working towards
addressing this challenge, this paper presents a principled novel safety
argument framework for critical systems that utilise deep neural networks. The
approach allows various forms of predictions, e.g., future reliability of
passing some demands, or confidence on a required reliability level. It is
supported by a Bayesian analysis using operational data and the recent
verification and validation techniques for deep learning. The prediction is
conservative -- it starts with partial prior knowledge obtained from lifecycle
activities and then determines the worst-case prediction. Open challenges are
also identified.

Title: Meta-learning curiosity algorithms

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Published in ICLR 2020
\\
  We hypothesize that curiosity is a mechanism found by evolution that
encourages meaningful exploration early in an agent's life in order to expose
it to experiences that enable it to obtain high rewards over the course of its
lifetime. We formulate the problem of generating curious behavior as one of
meta-learning: an outer loop will search over a space of curiosity mechanisms
that dynamically adapt the agent's reward signal, and an inner loop will
perform standard reinforcement learning using the adapted reward signal.
However, current meta-RL methods based on transferring neural network weights
have only generalized between very similar tasks. To broaden the
generalization, we instead propose to meta-learn algorithms: pieces of code
similar to those designed by humans in ML papers. Our rich language of programs
combines neural networks with other building blocks such as buffers,
nearest-neighbor modules and custom loss functions. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the approach empirically, finding two novel curiosity
algorithms that perform on par or better than human-designed published
curiosity algorithms in domains as disparate as grid navigation with image
inputs, acrobot, lunar lander, ant and hopper.

Title: Fairness by Explicability and Adversarial SHAP Learning
Authors: James M. Hickey, Pietro G. Di Stefano and Vlasios Vasileiou
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 16 pages, 2 figures
\\
  The ability to understand and trust the fairness of model predictions,
particularly when considering the outcomes of unprivileged groups, is critical
to the deployment and adoption of machine learning systems. SHAP values provide
a unified framework for interpreting model predictions and feature attribution
but do not address the problem of fairness directly. In this work, we propose a
new definition of fairness that emphasises the role of an external auditor and
model explicability. To satisfy this definition, we develop a framework for
mitigating model bias using regularizations constructed from the SHAP values of
an adversarial surrogate model. We focus on the binary classification task with
a single unprivileged group and link our fairness explicability constraints to
classical statistical fairness metrics. We demonstrate our approaches using
gradient and adaptive boosting on: a synthetic dataset, the UCI Adult (Census)
Dataset and a real-world credit scoring dataset. The models produced were
fairer and performant.

Title: Online Meta-Critic Learning for Off-Policy Actor-Critic Methods
Authors: Wei Zhou, Yiying Li, Yongxin Yang, Huaimin Wang, Timothy M. Hospedales
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Off-Policy Actor-Critic (Off-PAC) methods have proven successful in a variety
of continuous control tasks. Normally, the critic's action-value function is
updated using temporal-difference, and the critic in turn provides a loss for
the actor that trains it to take actions with higher expected return. In this
paper, we introduce a novel and flexible meta-critic that observes the learning
process and meta-learns an additional loss for the actor that accelerates and
improves actor-critic learning. Compared to the vanilla critic, the meta-critic
network is explicitly trained to accelerate the learning process; and compared
to existing meta-learning algorithms, meta-critic is rapidly learned online for
a single task, rather than slowly over a family of tasks. Crucially, our
meta-critic framework is designed for off-policy based learners, which
currently provide state-of-the-art reinforcement learning sample efficiency. We
demonstrate that online meta-critic learning leads to improvements in avariety
of continuous control environments when combined with contemporary Off-PAC
methods DDPG, TD3 and the state-of-the-art SAC.

Title: Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs: Anisotropic convolutions on geometric
  graphs
Authors: Pim de Haan, Maurice Weiler, Taco Cohen and Max Welling
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  A common approach to define convolutions on meshes is to interpret them as a
graph and apply graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Such GCNs utilize
isotropic kernels and are therefore insensitive to the relative orientation of
vertices and thus to the geometry of the mesh as a whole. We propose Gauge
Equivariant Mesh CNNs which generalize GCNs to apply anisotropic gauge
equivariant kernels. Since the resulting features carry orientation
information, we introduce a geometric message passing scheme defined by
parallel transporting features over mesh edges. Our experiments validate the
significantly improved expressivity of the proposed model over conventional
GCNs and other methods.

  Many learning algorithms such as kernel machines, nearest neighbors,
clustering, or anomaly detection, are based on the concept of 'distance' or
'similarity'. Before similarities are used for training an actual machine
learning model, we would like to verify that they are bound to meaningful
patterns in the data. In this paper, we propose to make similarities
interpretable by augmenting them with an explanation in terms of input
features. We develop BiLRP, a scalable and theoretically founded method to
systematically decompose similarity scores on pairs of input features. Our
method can be expressed as a composition of LRP explanations, which were shown
in previous works to scale to highly nonlinear functions. Through an extensive
set of experiments, we demonstrate that BiLRP robustly explains complex
similarity models, e.g. built on VGG-16 deep neural network features.
Additionally, we apply our method to an open problem in digital humanities:
detailed assessment of similarity between historical documents such as
astronomical tables. Here again, BiLRP provides insight and brings
verifiability into a highly engineered and problem-specific similarity model.

Title: Learning Predictive Representations for Deformable Objects Using

  Using visual model-based learning for deformable object manipulation is
challenging due to difficulties in learning plannable visual representations
along with complex dynamic models. In this work, we propose a new learning
framework that jointly optimizes both the visual representation model and the
dynamics model using contrastive estimation. Using simulation data collected by
randomly perturbing deformable objects on a table, we learn latent dynamics
models for these objects in an offline fashion. Then, using the learned models,
we use simple model-based planning to solve challenging deformable object
manipulation tasks such as spreading ropes and cloths. Experimentally, we show
substantial improvements in performance over standard model-based learning
techniques across our rope and cloth manipulation suite. Finally, we transfer
our visual manipulation policies trained on data purely collected in simulation
to a real PR2 robot through domain randomization.

Title: Interval Temporal Logic Decision Tree Learning
Authors: Andrea Brunello, Guido Sciavicco, and Ionel Eduard Stan

DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-19570-0_50
\\
  Decision trees are simple, yet powerful, classification models used to
classify categorical and numerical data, and, despite their simplicity, they
are commonly used in operations research and management, as well as in
knowledge mining. From a logical point of view, a decision tree can be seen as
a structured set of logical rules written in propositional logic. Since
knowledge mining is rapidly evolving towards temporal knowledge mining, and
since in many cases temporal information is best described by interval temporal
logics, propositional logic decision trees may evolve towards interval temporal
logic decision trees. In this paper, we define the problem of interval temporal
logic decision tree learning, and propose a solution that generalizes classical
decision tree learning.

Title: Animated Logic: Correct Functional Conversion to Conjunctive Normal Form
Authors: Pedro Barroso, M\'ario Pereira and Ant\'onio Ravara
Categories: cs.LO
Comments: 24 pages
ACM-class: F.3.1
\\
  We present an approach to obtain formally verified implementations of
classical Computational Logic algorithms. We choose the Why3 platform because
it allows to implement functions in a style very close to the mathematical
definitions, as well as it allows a high degree of automation in the
verification process.
  As proof of concept, we present a mathematical definition of the algorithm to
convert propositional formulae to conjunctive normal form, implementations in
WhyML (the Why3 language, very similar to OCaml), and proofs of correctness of
the implementations. We apply our proposal on two variants of this algorithm:
one in direct-style and another with an explicit stack structure. Being both
first-order versions, Why3 processes the proofs naturally.

Title: The Sequent Calculus of Skew Monoidal Categories
Authors: Tarmo Uustalu, Niccol\`o Veltri, and Noam Zeilberger
Categories: cs.LO math.CT
Comments: This article is a revised and extended version of a paper presented
  at MFPS 2018
\\
  Szlach\'anyi's skew monoidal categories are a well-motivated variation of
monoidal categories in which the unitors and associator are not required to be
natural isomorphisms, but merely natural transformations in a particular
direction. We present a sequent calculus for skew monoidal categories, building
on the recent formulation by one of the authors of a sequent calculus for the
Tamari order (skew semigroup categories). In this calculus, antecedents consist
of a stoup (an optional formula) followed by a context, and the connectives
behave like in the standard monoidal sequent calculus except that the left
rules may only be applied in stoup position. We prove that this calculus is
sound and complete with respect to existence of maps in the free skew monoidal
category, and moreover that it captures equality of maps once a suitable
equivalence relation is imposed on derivations. We then identify a subsystem of
focused derivations and establish that it contains exactly one canonical
representative from each equivalence class. This coherence theorem leads
directly to simple procedures for deciding equality of maps in the free skew
monoidal category and for enumerating any homset without duplicates. Finally,
and in the spirit of Lambek's work, we describe the close connection between
this proof-theoretic analysis and Bourke and Lack's recent characterization of
skew monoidal categories as left representable skew multicategories. We have
formalized this development in the dependently typed programming language Agda.

Title: Local Local Reasoning: A BI-Hyperdoctrine for Full Ground Store
Authors: Miriam Polzer and Sergey Goncharov
Categories: cs.LO
Comments: version with appendix
\\
  Modelling and reasoning about dynamic memory allocation is one of the
well-established strands of theoretical computer science, which is particularly
well-known as a source of notorious challenges in semantics, reasoning, and
proof theory. We capitalize on recent progress on categorical semantics of full
ground store, in terms of a full ground store monad, to build a corresponding
semantics of a higher order logic over the corresponding programs. Our main
result is a construction of an (intuitionistic) BI-hyperdoctrine, which is
arguably the semantic core of higher order logic over local store. Although we
have made an extensive use of the existing generic tools, certain principled
changes had to be made to enable the desired construction: while the original
monad works over total heaps (to disable dangling pointers), our version
involves partial heaps (heaplets) to enable compositional reasoning using
separating conjunction. Another remarkable feature of our construction is that,
in contrast to the existing generic approaches, our BI-algebra does not
directly stem from an internal categorical partial commutative monoid.

  The increasing popularity of social media promotes the proliferation of fake
news, which has caused significant negative societal effects. Therefore, fake
news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research area of
great concern. With the development of multimedia technology, fake news
attempts to utilize multimedia content with images or videos to attract and
mislead consumers for rapid dissemination, which makes visual content an
important part of fake news. Despite the importance of visual content, our
understanding of the role of visual content in fake news detection is still
limited. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of the visual content in
fake news, including the basic concepts, effective visual features,
representative detection methods and challenging issues of multimedia fake news
detection. This chapter can help readers to understand the role of visual
content in fake news detection, and effectively utilize visual content to
assist in detecting multimedia fake news.

Title: The Smooth Forcing Extension Method: A High-Order Technique for Solving
  Elliptic Equations on Complex Domains
Authors: Saad Qadeer and Boyce E. Griffith
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  High-order numerical methods for solving elliptic equations over arbitrary
domains typically require specialized machinery, such as high-quality
conforming grids for finite elements method, and quadrature rules for boundary
integral methods. These tools make it difficult to apply these techniques to
higher dimensions. In contrast, fixed Cartesian grid methods, such as the
immersed boundary (IB) method, are easy to apply and generalize, but typically
are low-order accurate. In this study, we introduce the Smooth Forcing
Extension (SFE) method, a fixed Cartesian grid technique that builds on the
insights of the IB method, and allows one to obtain arbitrary orders of
accuracy. Our approach relies on a novel Fourier continuation method to compute
extensions of the inhomogeneous terms to any desired regularity. This is
combined with the highly accurate Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform for
interpolation operations to yield a fast and robust method. Numerical tests
confirm that the technique performs precisely as expected on one-dimensional
test problems. In higher dimensions, the performance is even better, in some
cases yielding sub-geometric convergence. We also demonstrate how this
technique can be applied to solving parabolic problems and for computing the
eigenvalues of elliptic operators on general domains, in the process
illustrating its stability and amenability to generalization.

  The paper presents a construction of a quantitative measure of variability
for parameter estimates in the data fitting problem under interval uncertainty.
It shows the degree of variability and ambiguity of the estimate, and the need
for its introduction is dictated by non-uniqueness of answers to the problems
with interval data. A substantiation of the new variability measure is given,
its application and motivations are discussed. Several examples and a series of
numerical tests are considered, showing the features of the new characteristic
and the specifics of its use.

Title: hp-VPINNs: Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks With Domain
  Decomposition
Authors: Ehsan Kharazmi, Zhongqiang Zhang, George Em Karniadakis
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG cs.NA math.NA
\\
  We formulate a general framework for hp-variational physics-informed neural
networks (hp-VPINNs) based on the nonlinear approximation of shallow and deep
neural networks and hp-refinement via domain decomposition and projection onto
space of high-order polynomials. The trial space is the space of neural
network, which is defined globally over the whole computational domain, while
the test space contains the piecewise polynomials. Specifically in this study,
the hp-refinement corresponds to a global approximation with local learning
algorithm that can efficiently localize the network parameter optimization. We
demonstrate the advantages of hp-VPINNs in accuracy and training cost for
several numerical examples of function approximation and solving differential
equations.

Title: Constellation: A High Performance Geo-Distributed Middlebox Framework
Authors: Milad Ghaznavi, Ali Jose Mashtizadeh, Bernard Wong, and Raouf Boutaba
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Middleboxes are increasingly deployed across geographically distributed data
centers. In these scenarios, the WAN latency between different sites can
significantly impact the performance of stateful middleboxes. The deployment of
middleboxes across such infrastructures can even become impractical due to the
high cost of remote state accesses.
  We introduce Constellation, a framework for the geo distributed deployment of
middleboxes. Constellation uses asynchronous replication of specialized state
objects to achieve high performance and scalability. The evaluation of our
implementation shows that, compared with the state-of-the-art [80],
Constellation improves the throughput by a factor of 96 in wide area networks.

Title: In Situ Network and Application Performance Measurement on Android

Authors: Mohammad A. Hoque, Ashwin Rao, Sasu Tarkoma
Categories: cs.NI cs.PF
\\
  Understanding network and application performance are essential for
debugging, improving user experience, and performance comparison. Meanwhile,
modern mobile systems are optimized for energy-efficient computation and
communications that may limit the performance of network and applications. In
recent years, several tools have emerged that analyze network performance of
mobile applications in~situ with the help of the VPN service. There is a
limited understanding of how these measurement tools and system optimizations
affect the network and application performance. In this study, we first
demonstrate that mobile systems employ energy-aware system hardware tuning,
which affects application performance and network throughput. We next show that
the VPN-based application performance measurement tools, such as Lumen,
PrivacyGuard, and Video Optimizer, aid in ambiguous network performance
measurements and degrade the application performance. Our findings suggest that
sound application and network performance measurement on Android devices
requires a good understanding of the device, networks, measurement tools, and
applications.

Title: On the Reproduction of Real Wireless Channel Occupancy in ns-3
Authors: Renato Cruz, Helder Fontes, Jos\'e Ruela, Manuel Ricardo, Rui Campos
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  In wireless networking R&D we typically depend on simulation and
experimentation to evaluate and validate new networking solutions. While
simulations allow full control over the scenario conditions, real-world
experiments are influenced by external random phenomena and may produce hardly
repeatable and reproducible results, impacting the validation of the solution
under evaluation. Previously, we have proposed the Trace-based Simulation (TS)
approach to address the problem. TS uses traces of radio link quality and
position of nodes to accurately reproduce past experiments in ns-3. Yet, in its
current version, the TS approach is not compatible with scenarios where the
radio spectrum is shared with concurrent networks, as it does not reproduce
their channel occupancy. In this paper, we introduce the
InterferencePropagationLossModel and a modified MacLow to allow reproducing the
channel occupancy experienced in past experiments. To validate the proposed
models, the network throughput was measured in different experiments performed
in the w-iLab.t testbed, controlling the channel occupancy introduced by
concurrent networks. The experimental results were then compared with the
network throughput achieved using the improved TS approach, the legacy TS
approach, and pure simulation, validating the new proposed models and
confirming their relevance to reproduce experiments previously executed in real
environments.

  With the rapid development of Internet and communication systems, both in
services and technologies, communication networks have been suffering
increasing complexity. It is imperative to improve intelligence in
communication network, and several aspects have been incorporating with
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Optical network, which
plays an important role both in core and access network in communication
networks, also faces great challenges of system complexity and the requirement
of manual operations. To overcome the current limitations and address the
issues of future optical networks, it is essential to deploy more intelligence
capability to enable autonomous and exible network operations. ML techniques
are proved to have superiority on solving complex problems; and thus recently,
ML techniques have been used for many optical network applications. In this
paper, a detailed survey of existing applications of ML for intelligent optical
networks is presented. The applications of ML are classified in terms of their
use cases, which are categorized into optical network control and resource
management, and optical networks monitoring and survivability. The use cases
are analyzed and compared according to the used ML techniques. Besides, a
tutorial for ML applications is provided from the aspects of the introduction
of common ML algorithms, paradigms of ML, and motivations of applying ML.
Lastly, challenges and possible solutions of ML application in optical networks
are also discussed, which intends to inspire future innovations in leveraging
ML to build intelligent optical networks.

Title: Fissile Locks
Authors: Dave Dice and Alex Kogan
Categories: cs.OS
\\
  Classic test-and-test (TS) mutual exclusion locks are simple, and enjoy high
performance and low latency of ownership transfer under light or no contention.
However, they do not scale gracefully under high contention and do not provide
any admission order guarantees. Such concerns led to the development of
scalable queue-based locks, such as a recent Compact NUMA-aware (CNA) lock, a
variant of another popular queue-based MCS lock. CNA scales well under load and
provides certain admission guarantees, but has more complicated lock handover
operations than TS and incurs higher latencies at low contention. We propose
Fissile locks, which capture the most desirable properties of both TS and CNA.
A Fissile lock consists of two underlying locks: a TS lock, which serves as a
fast path, and a CNA lock, which serves as a slow path. The key feature of
Fissile locks is the ability of threads on the fast path to bypass threads
enqueued on the slow path, and acquire the lock with less overhead than CNA.
Bypass is bounded (by a tunable parameter) to avoid starvation and ensure
long-term fairness. The result is a highly scalable NUMA-aware lock with
progress guarantees that performs like TS at low contention and like CNA at
high contention.

\\
  Systems in many safety-critical application domains are subject to
certification requirements. In such a system, there are typically different
applications providing functionalities that have varying degrees of
criticality. Consequently, the certification requirements for functionalities
at these different criticality levels are also varying, with very high levels
of assurance required for a highly critical functionality, whereas relatively
low levels of assurance required for a less critical functionality. Considering
the timing assurance given to various applications in the form of guaranteed
budgets within deadlines, a theory of real-time scheduling for such
multi-criticality systems has been under development in the recent past. In
particular, an algorithm called Earliest Deadline First with Virtual Deadlines
(EDF-VD) has shown a lot of promise for systems with two criticality levels,
especially in terms of practical performance demonstrated through experiment
results. In this paper we design a new schedulability test for EDF-VD that
extend these performance benefits to multi-criticality systems. We propose a
new test based on demand bound functions and also present a novel virtual
deadline assignment strategy. Through extensive experiments we show that the
proposed technique significantly outperforms existing strategies for a variety
of generic real-time systems.

\\
  In this paper we consider the problem of mixed-criticality (MC) scheduling of
implicit-deadline sporadic task systems on a homogenous multiprocessor
platform. Focusing on dual-criticality systems, algorithms based on the fluid
scheduling model have been proposed in the past. These algorithms use a
dual-rate execution model for each high-criticality task depending on the
system mode. Once the system switches to the high-criticality mode, the
execution rates of such tasks are increased to meet their increased demand.
Although these algorithms are speed-up optimal, they are unable to schedule
several feasible dual-criticality task systems. This is because a single fixed
execution rate for each high-criticality task after the mode switch is not
efficient to handle the high variability in demand during the transition period
immediately following the mode switch. This demand variability exists as long
as the carry-over jobs of high-criticality tasks, that is jobs released before
the mode switch, have not completed. Addressing this shortcoming, we propose a
multi-rate fluid execution model for dual-criticality task systems in this
paper. Under this model, high-criticality tasks are allocated varying execution
rates in the transition period after the mode switch to efficiently handle the
demand variability. We derive a sufficient schedulability test for the proposed
model and show its dominance over the dual-rate fluid execution model. Further,
we also present a speed-up optimal rate assignment strategy for the multi-rate
model, and experimentally show that the proposed model outperforms all the
existing MC scheduling algorithms with known speed-up bounds.

Title: Correctness of Sequential Monte Carlo Inference for Probabilistic
  Programming Languages
Authors: Daniel Lund\'en, Johannes Borgstr\"om, David Broman
Categories: cs.PL
\\
  Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) make it possible to reason under
uncertainty, by encoding inference problems as programs. In order to solve
these inference problems, PPLs employ many different inference algorithms.
Existing research on such inference algorithms mainly concerns their
implementation and efficiency, rather than the correctness of the algorithms
themselves when applied in the context of expressive PPLs. To remedy this, we
give a correctness proof for sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods in the
context of an expressive PPL calculus, representative of popular PPLs such as
WebPPL, Anglican, and Birch. Previous work have studied correctness of Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using an operational semantics, and in a denotational
setting without term recursion. However, for SMC inference---one of the most
commonly used algorithms in PPLs as of today---no formal correctness proof
exists in an untyped operational setting. In particular, an open question is if
the resample locations in a probabilistic program affects the correctness of
SMC. We solve this fundamental problem, and make three novel contributions: (i)
we prove, for the first time, that SMC inference is correct in an untyped
operational context of an expressive PPL calculus, and we show that, under mild
assumptions, the correctness is independent of the placement of explicit
resampling points, (ii) we formalize the bootstrap particle filter for the
calculus, and (iii) we demonstrate a classical law of large numbers from the
SMC literature that holds as a consequence of our proof.

  This paper presents a new fractional-order normalized Bouc-Wen (BW) (FONBW)

model is only efficient for the symmetric and rate-independent hysteresis
description, the FONBW model is devoted to characterizing the asymmetric and
rate-dependent behaviors of the hysteresis in PEAs by adopting a generalized
input function and two fractional operators, respectively. Different from the
traditional modified BW models, the proposed FONBW model also eliminates the
redundancy of parameters in the CBW model via the normalization processing. By
this way, the developed FONBW model has a relative simple mathematic expression
with fewer parameters to simultaneously characterize the asymmetric and
rate-dependent hysteresis behaviors of PEAs. Model parameters are identified by
the self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm. To validate the
effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of experimental studies are
carried out on a PEA system. Results show that the proposed model is superior
to the CBW model in accuracy.

Title: GPU Parallelization of Policy Iteration RRT#

  Sampling-based planning has become a de facto standard for complex robots
given its superior ability to rapidly explore high-dimensional configuration
spaces. Most existing optimal sampling-based planning algorithms are sequential
in nature and cannot take advantage of wide parallelism available on modern
computer hardware. Further, tight synchronization of exploration and
exploitation phases in these algorithms limits sample throughput and planner
performance. Policy Iteration RRT# (PI-RRT#) exposes fine-grained parallelism
during the exploitation phase, but this parallelism has not yet been evaluated
using a concrete implementation. We first present a novel GPU implementation of
PI-RRT#'s exploitation phase and discuss data structure considerations to
maximize parallel performance. Our implementation achieves 2-3x speedup over a
serial PI-RRT# implementation for a 52.6% decrease in overall planning time on
average. As a second contribution, we introduce the Batched-Extension RRT#
algorithm, which loosens the synchronization present in PI-RRT# to realize
independent 11.3x and 6.0x speedups under serial and parallel exploitation,
respectively.

  Being able to quickly adapt to changes in dynamics is paramount in
model-based control for object manipulation tasks. In order to influence fast
adaptation of the inverse dynamics model's parameters, data efficiency is
crucial. Given observed data, a key element to how an optimizer updates model
parameters is the loss function. In this work, we propose to apply
meta-learning to learn structured, state-dependent loss functions during a
meta-training phase. We then replace standard losses with our learned losses
during online adaptation tasks. We evaluate our proposed approach on inverse
dynamics learning tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware data. In both
settings, the structured learned losses improve online adaptation speed, when
compared to standard, state-independent loss functions.

  Control barrier functions are mathematical constructs used to guarantee
safety for robotic systems. When integrated as constraints in a quadratic
programming optimization problem, instantaneous control synthesis with
real-time performance demands can be achieved for robotics applications.
Prevailing use has assumed full knowledge of the safety barrier functions,
however there are cases where the safe regions must be estimated online from
sensor measurements. In these cases, the corresponding barrier function must be
synthesized online. This paper describes a learning framework for estimating
control barrier functions from sensor data. Doing so affords system operation
in unknown state space regions without compromising safety. Here, a support
vector machine classifier provides the barrier function specification as
determined by sets of safe and unsafe states obtained from sensor measurements.
Theoretical safety guarantees are provided. Experimental ROS-based simulation
results for an omnidirectional robot equipped with LiDAR demonstrate safe
operation.

Title: SQUIRL: Robust and Efficient Learning from Video Demonstration of
  Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation Tasks
Authors: Bohan Wu, Feng Xu, Zhanpeng He, Abhi Gupta, and Peter K. Allen
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated its
potential to learn complex robotic manipulation tasks. However, RL still
requires the robot to collect a large amount of real-world experience. To
address this problem, recent works have proposed learning from expert
demonstrations (LfD), particularly via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL),
given its ability to achieve robust performance with only a small number of
expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, deploying IRL on real robots is still
challenging due to the large number of robot experiences it requires. This
paper aims to address this scalability challenge with a robust,
sample-efficient, and general meta-IRL algorithm, SQUIRL, that performs a new
but related long-horizon task robustly given only a single video demonstration.
First, this algorithm bootstraps the learning of a task encoder and a
task-conditioned policy using behavioral cloning (BC). It then collects
real-robot experiences and bypasses reward learning by directly recovering a
Q-function from the combined robot and expert trajectories. Next, this
algorithm uses the Q-function to re-evaluate all cumulative experiences
collected by the robot to improve the policy quickly. In the end, the policy
performs more robustly (90%+ success) than BC on new tasks while requiring no
trial-and-errors at test time. Finally, our real-robot and simulated
experiments demonstrate our algorithm's generality across different state
spaces, action spaces, and vision-based manipulation tasks, e.g.,
pick-pour-place and pick-carry-drop.

\\
  We present a novel POMDP problem formulation for a robot that must
autonomously decide where to go to collect new and scientifically relevant
images given a limited ability to communicate with its human operator. From
this formulation we derive constraints and design principles for the
observation model, reward model, and communication strategy of such a robot,
exploring techniques to deal with the very high-dimensional observation space
and scarcity of relevant training data. We introduce a novel active reward
learning strategy based on making queries to help the robot minimize path
"regret" online, and evaluate it for suitability in autonomous visual
exploration through simulations. We demonstrate that, in some bandwidth-limited
environments, this novel regret-based criterion enables the robotic explorer to
collect up to 17% more reward per mission than the next-best criterion.

Title: A General Arbitration Model for Robust Human-Robot Shared Control with
  Multi-Source Uncertainty Modeling
Authors: Songpo Li, Michael Bowman, and Xiaoli Zhang
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Shared control in teleoperation leverages both human and robot's strengths
and has demonstrated great advantages of reducing the difficulties in
teleoperating a robot and increasing the task performance. One fundamental
question in shared control is how to effectively allocate the control power to
the human and robot. Researchers have been subjectively defining the arbitrate
policies following conflicting principles, which resulted in great
inconsistency in the policies. We attribute this inconsistency to the
inconsiderateness of the multi-resource uncertainty in the human-robot system.
To fill the gap, we developed a multi-source uncertainty model that was
applicable to various types of uncertainty in real world, and then a general
arbitration model was developed to comprehensively fuse the uncertainty and
regulate the arbitration weight assigned to the robotic agent. Beside
traditional macro performance metrics, we introduced objective and quantitative
metrics of robotic helpfulness and friendliness that evaluated the assistive
robot's cooperation at micro and macro levels. Results from simulations and
experiments showed the new arbitration model was more effective and friendly
over the existing policies and was robust to coping with multi-source
uncertainty. With this new arbitration model, we expect the increased adoption
of human-robot shared control in practical and complex teleoperation tasks.

Title: FlowFusion: Dynamic Dense RGB-D SLAM Based on Optical Flow
Authors: Tianwei Zhang, Huayan Zhang, Yang Li, Yoshihiko Nakamura and Lei Zhang
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
Comments: To be published in ICRA2020
\\
  Dynamic environments are challenging for visual SLAM since the moving objects
occlude the static environment features and lead to wrong camera motion
estimation. In this paper, we present a novel dense RGB-D SLAM solution that
simultaneously accomplishes the dynamic/static segmentation and camera
ego-motion estimation as well as the static background reconstructions. Our
novelty is using optical flow residuals to highlight the dynamic semantics in
the RGB-D point clouds and provide more accurate and efficient dynamic/static
segmentation for camera tracking and background reconstruction. The dense
reconstruction results on public datasets and real dynamic scenes indicate that
the proposed approach achieved accurate and efficient performances in both
dynamic and static environments compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

  With the rapid rise of 3D-printing as a competitive mass manufacturing
method, manual "decaking" - i.e. removing the residual powder that sticks to a
3D-printed part - has become a significant bottleneck. Here, we introduce, for
the first time to our knowledge, a robotic system for automated decaking of
3D-printed parts. Combining Deep Learning for 3D perception, smart mechanical
design, motion planning, and force control for industrial robots, we developed
a system that can automatically decake parts in a fast and efficient way.
Through a series of decaking experiments performed on parts printed by a Multi
Jet Fusion printer, we demonstrated the feasibility of robotic decaking for
3D-printing-based mass manufacturing.

  Learning-based approaches often outperform hand-coded algorithmic solutions
for many problems in robotics. However, learning long-horizon tasks on real
robot hardware can be intractable, and transferring a learned policy from
simulation to reality is still extremely challenging. We present a novel
approach to model-free reinforcement learning that can leverage existing
sub-optimal solutions as an algorithmic prior during training and deployment.
During training, our gated fusion approach enables the prior to guide the
initial stages of exploration, increasing sample-efficiency and enabling
learning from sparse long-horizon reward signals. Importantly, the policy can
learn to improve beyond the performance of the sub-optimal prior since the
prior's influence is annealed gradually. During deployment, the policy's
uncertainty provides a reliable strategy for transferring a simulation-trained
policy to the real world by falling back to the prior controller in uncertain
states. We show the efficacy of our Multiplicative Controller Fusion approach
on the task of robot navigation and demonstrate safe transfer from simulation
to the real world without any fine tuning. The code for this project is made
publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/mcf-nav/home.

Title: Retraction Mechanism of Soft Torus Robot with a Hydrostatic Skeleton

  and Satoshi Tadokoro
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Soft robots have attracted much attention in recent years owing to their high
adaptability. Long articulated soft robots enable diverse operations, and
tip-extending robots that navigate their environment through growth are highly
effective in robotic search applications. Because the robot membrane extends
from the tip, these robots can lengthen without friction from the environment.
However, the flexibility of the membrane inhibits tip retraction. Two methods
have been proposed to resolve this issue; increasing the pressure of the
internal fluid to reinforce rigidity, and mounting an actuator at the tip. The
disadvantage of the former is that the increase is limited by the membrane
pressure resistance, while the second method adds to the robot complexity. In
this paper, we present a tip-retraction mechanism without bending motion that
takes advantage of the friction from the external environment. Water is used as
the internal fluid to increase ground pressure with the environment. We explore
the failure pattern of the retraction motion and propose plausible solutions by
using hydrostatic skeleton robot. Additionally, we develop a prototype robot
that successfully retracts by using the proposed methodology. Our solution can
contribute to the advancement of mechanical design in the soft robotics field
with applications to soft snakes and manipulators.

  Currently, drone research and development has received significant attention
worldwide. Particularly, delivery services employ drones as it is a viable
method to improve delivery efficiency by using a several unmanned drones.
Research has been conducted to realize complete automation of drone control for
such services. However, regarding the takeoff and landing port of the drones,
conventional methods have focused on the landing operation of a single drone,
and the continuous landing of multiple drones has not been realized. To address
this issue, we propose a completely novel port system, "EAGLES Port," that
allows several drones to continuously land and takeoff in a short time.
Experiments verified that the landing time efficiency of the proposed port is
ideally 7.5 times higher than that of conventional vertical landing systems.
Moreover, the system can tolerate 270 mm of horizontal positional error, +-30
deg of angular error in the drone's approach (+-40 deg with the proposed gate
mechanism), and up to 1.9 m/s of drone's approach speed. This technology
significantly contributes to the scalability of drone usage. Therefore, it is
critical for the development of a future drone port for the landing of
automated drone swarms.

Title: Decentralized Visual-Inertial-UWB Fusion for Relative State Estimation

Authors: Hao Xu, Luqi Wang, Yichen Zhang, Kejie Qiu, Shaojie Shen

Comments: Accepted ICRA 2020
\\
  The collaboration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become a popular
research topic for its practicability in multiple scenarios. The collaboration
of multiple UAVs, which is also known as aerial swarm is a highly complex
system, which still lacks a state-of-art decentralized relative state
estimation method. In this paper, we present a novel fully decentralized
visual-inertial-UWB fusion framework for relative state estimation and
demonstrate the practicability by performing extensive aerial swarm flight
experiments. The comparison result with ground truth data from the motion
capture system shows the centimeter-level precision which outperforms all the
Ultra-WideBand (UWB) and even vision based method. The system is not limited by
the field of view (FoV) of the camera or Global Positioning System (GPS),
meanwhile on account of its estimation consistency, we believe that the
proposed relative state estimation framework has the potential to be
prevalently adopted by aerial swarm applications in different scenarios in
multiple scales.

Title: Self-supervised Point Set Local Descriptors for Point Cloud Registration
Authors: Yijun Yuan, Jiawei Hou, Andreas N\"uchter and S\"oren Schwertfeger
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  In this work, we propose to learn local descriptors for point clouds in a
self-supervised manner. In each iteration of the training, the input of the
network is merely one unlabeled point cloud. On top of our previous work, that
directly solves the transformation between two point sets in one step without
correspondences, the proposed method is able to train from one point cloud, by
supervising its self-rotation, that we randomly generate. The whole training
requires no manual annotation. In several experiments we evaluate the
performance of our method on various datasets and compare to other state of the
art algorithms. The results show, that our self-supervised learned descriptor
achieves equivalent or even better performance than the supervised learned
model, while being easier to train and not requiring labeled data.

  In this paper, we present a multimodal mobile teleoperation system that
consists of a novel vision-based hand pose regression network (Transteleop) and
an IMU-based arm tracking method. Transteleop observes the human hand through a
low-cost depth camera and generates not only joint angles but also depth images
of paired robot hand poses through an image-to-image translation process. A
keypoint-based reconstruction loss explores the resemblance in appearance and
anatomy between human and robotic hands and enriches the local features of
reconstructed images. A wearable camera holder enables simultaneous hand-arm
control and facilitates the mobility of the whole teleoperation system. Network
evaluation results on a test dataset and a variety of complex manipulation
tasks that go beyond simple pick-and-place operations show the efficiency and
stability of our multimodal teleoperation system.

\\
  This paper presents the design and integration of 3 Survivor, a rough terrain
negotiable teleoperated mobile rescue and service robot. 3 Survivor is an
improved version of two previously studied surveillance robots named Sigma 3
and Alpha N. In 3 Survivor, a modified double tracked with caterpillar
mechanism is incorporated in the body design. A passive adjustment established
in the body balance enables the front and rear body to operate in excellent
synchronization. Instead of using an actuator, a re configurable dynamic method
is constructed with a 6 DOF arm. This dynamic method is configured with the
planer, spatial mechanism, rotation matrix, motion control of rotation using
inverse kinematics and controlling power consumption of the manipulator using
angular momentum. The robot is remotely controlled using a handheld Radio
Frequency RF transmitter. 3 Survivor is equipped with a Raspberry Pi 12 MP
camera which is used for livestreaming of robot operations. Object detection
algorithms are run on the live video stream. The object detection method is
built using a Faster RCNN with VGGNet16 architecture of CNN. The entire
operations of the robot are monitored through a web control window. Therefore,
the control portal provides a brief scenario of the environment to run, control
and steer the robot for more precise operation. A very impressive 88.25 percent
accuracy is acquired from this module in a rescue operation. Along with the
ODM, the sensor system of the robot provides information on the hazardous
terrain. The feasibility of the 3 Survivor is tested and presented by different
experiments throughout the paper.

  How to provide explanations has experienced a surge of interest in
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) over the last three years. In HRI this is known
as explainability, expressivity, transparency or sometimes legibility, and the
challenge for embodied agents is that they offer a unique array of modalities
to communicate this information thanks to their embodiment. Responding to this
surge of interest, we review the existing literature in explainability and
organize it by (1) providing an overview of existing definitions, (2) showing
how explainability is implemented and how it exploits different modalities, and
(3) showing how the impact of explainability is measured. Additionally, we
present a list of open questions and challenges that highlight areas that
require further investigation by the community. This provides the interested

against our team's previous solution, which won FSG 2018, and show improved

  Safety Case has become an integral component for safety-certification in
various Cyber Physical System domains including automotive, aviation, medical
devices, and military. The certification processes for these systems are
stringent and require robust safety assurance arguments and substantial
evidence backing. Despite the strict requirements, current practices still rely
on manual methods that are brittle, do not have a systematic approach or
thorough consideration of sound arguments. In addition, stringent certification
requirements and ever-increasing system complexity make ad-hoc, manual
assurance case generation (ACG) inefficient, time consuming, and expensive. To
improve the current state of practice, we introduce a structured ACG tool which
uses system design artifacts, accumulated evidence, and developer expertise to
construct a safety case and evaluate it in an automated manner. We also
illustrate the applicability of the ACG tool on a remote-control car testbed

Title: Frozone: Freezing-Free, Pedestrian-Friendly Navigation in Human Crowds

Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 9 pages, 6 figures
\\
  We present Frozone, a novel algorithm to deal with the Freezing Robot Problem
(FRP) that arises when a robot navigates through dense scenarios and crowds.
Our method senses and explicitly predicts the trajectories of pedestrians and
constructs a Potential Freezing Zone (PFZ); a spatial zone where the robot
could freeze or be obtrusive to humans. Our formulation computes a deviation
velocity to avoid the PFZ, which also accounts for social constraints.
Furthermore, Frozone is designed for robots equipped with sensors with a
limited sensing range and field of view. We ensure that the robot's deviation
is bounded, thus avoiding sudden angular motion which could lead to the loss of
perception data of the surrounding obstacles. We have combined Frozone with a
Deep Reinforcement Learning-based (DRL) collision avoidance method and use our
hybrid approach to handle crowds of varying densities. Our overall approach
results in smooth and collision-free navigation in dense environments. We have
evaluated our method's performance in simulation and on real differential drive
robots in challenging indoor scenarios. We highlight the benefits of our
approach over prior methods in terms of success rates (up to 50% increase),
pedestrian-friendliness (100% increase) and the rate of freezing (> 80%
decrease) in challenging scenarios.

Title: Adaptive Neural Trajectory Tracking Control for Flexible-Joint Robots
  with Online Learning
Authors: Shuyang Chen and John Wen
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Accepted by ICRA 2020
\\
  Collaborative robots and space manipulators contain significant joint
flexibility. It complicates the control design, compromises the control
bandwidth, and limits the tracking accuracy. The imprecise knowledge of the
flexible joint dynamics compounds the challenge. In this paper, we present a
new control architecture for controlling flexible-joint robots. Our approach
uses a multi-layer neural network to approximate unknown dynamics needed for
the feedforward control. The network may be viewed as a linear-in-parameter
representation of the robot dynamics, with the nonlinear basis of the robot
dynamics connected to the linear output layer. The output layer weights are
updated based on the tracking error and the nonlinear basis. The internal
weights of the nonlinear basis are updated by online backpropagation to further
reduce the tracking error. To use time scale separation to reduce the coupling
of the two steps - the update of the internal weights is at a lower rate
compared to the update of the output layer weights. With the update of the
output layer weights, our controller adapts quickly to the unknown dynamics
change and disturbances (such as attaching a load). The update of the internal
weights would continue to improve the converge of the nonlinear basis
functions. We show the stability of the proposed scheme under the "outer loop"
control, where the commanded joint position is considered as the control input.
Simulation and physical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed controller on a Baxter robot, which exhibits
significant joint flexibility due to the series-elastic joint actuators.

Title: A Simulation Study of Bandit Algorithms to Address External Validity of
  Software Fault Prediction

\\
  Various software fault prediction models and techniques for building
algorithms have been proposed. Many studies have compared and evaluated them to
identify the most effective ones. However, in most cases, such models and
techniques do not have the best performance on every dataset. This is because
there is diversity of software development datasets, and therefore, there is a
risk that the selected model or technique shows bad performance on a certain
dataset. To avoid selecting a low accuracy model, we apply bandit algorithms to
predict faults. Consider a case where player has 100 coins to bet on several
slot machines. Ordinary usage of software fault prediction is analogous to the
player betting all 100 coins in one slot machine. In contrast, bandit
algorithms bet one coin on each machine (i.e., use prediction models)
step-by-step to seek the best machine. In the experiment, we developed an
artificial dataset that includes 100 modules, 15 of which include faults. Then,
we developed various artificial fault prediction models and selected them
dynamically using bandit algorithms. The Thomson sampling algorithm showed the
best or second-best prediction performance compared with using only one
prediction model.

Title: On Tracking Java Methods with Git Mechanisms
Authors: Yoshiki Higo and Shinpei Hayashi and Shinji Kusumoto
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: accepted by Journal of Systems and Software
\\
  Method-level historical information is useful in research on mining software
repositories such as fault-prone module detection or evolutionary coupling
identification. An existing technique named Historage converts a Git repository
of a Java project to a finer-grained one. In a finer-grained repository, each
Java method exists as a single file. Treating Java methods as files has an
advantage, which is that Java methods can be tracked with Git mechanisms. The
biggest benefit of tracking methods with Git mechanisms is that it can easily
connect with any other tools and techniques build on Git infrastructure.
However, Historage's tracking has an issue of accuracy, especially on small
methods. More concretely, in the case that a small method is renamed or moved
to another class, Historage has a limited capability to track the method. In
this paper, we propose a new technique, FinerGit, to improve the trackability
of Java methods with Git mechanisms. We implement FinerGit as a system and
apply it to 182 open source software projects, which include 1,768K methods in
total. The experimental results show that our tool has a higher capability of
tracking methods in the case that methods are renamed or moved to other
classes.

Title: On the Feasibility of Automated Issue Type Prediction
Authors: Steffen Herbold, Alexander Trautsch, Fabian Trautsch
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: Under review
\\
  Context: Issue tracking systems are used to track and describe tasks in the
development process, e.g., requested feature improvements or reported bugs.
However, past research has shown that the reported issue types often do not
match the description of the issue.
  Objective: We want to understand the overall maturity of the state of the art
of issue type prediction with the goal to predict if issues are bugs and
evaluate if we can improve existing models by incorporating manually specified
knowledge about issues.
  Method: We train different models for the title and description of the issue
to account for the difference in structure between these fields, e.g., the
length. Moreover, we manually detect issues whose description contains a null
pointer exception, as these are strong indicators that issues are bugs.
  Results: Our approach performs best overall, but not significantly different
from an approach from the literature based on the fastText classifier from
Facebook AI Research. The small improvements in prediction performance are due
to structural information about the issues we used. We found that using
information about the content of issues in form of null pointer exceptions is
not useful. We demonstrate the usefulness of issue type prediction through the
example of labelling bugfixing commits.
  Conclusions: Issue type prediction works well and can be a useful tool if the
use case allows either for a certain amount of missed bug reports or the
prediction of too many issues as bug is acceptable.

Title: Research Directions for Developing and Operating Artificial Intelligence
  Models in Trustworthy Autonomous Systems
Authors: Silverio Mart\'inez-Fern\'andez, Xavier Franch, Andreas Jedlitschka,

\\
  Context: Autonomous Systems (ASs) are becoming increasingly pervasive in
today's society. One reason lies in the emergence of sophisticated Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions that boost the ability of ASs to self-adapt in
increasingly complex and dynamic environments. Companies dealing with AI models
in ASs face several problems, such as users' lack of trust in adverse or
unknown conditions, and gaps between systems engineering and AI model
development and evolution in a continuously changing operational environment.
Objective: This vision paper aims to close the gap between the development and
operation of trustworthy AI-based ASs by defining a process that coordinates
both activities. Method: We synthesize the main challenges of AI-based ASs in
industrial settings. To overcome such challenges, we propose a novel, holistic
DevOps approach and reflect on the research efforts required to put it into
practice. Results: The approach sets up five critical research directions: (a)
a trustworthiness score to monitor operational AI-based ASs and identify
self-adaptation needs in critical situations; (b) an integrated agile process
for the development and continuous evolution of AI models; (c) an
infrastructure for gathering key feedback required to address the
trustworthiness of AI models at operation time; (d) continuous and seamless
deployment of different context-specific instances of AI models in a
distributed setting of ASs; and (e) a holistic and effective DevOps-based
lifecycle for AI-based ASs. Conclusions: An approach supporting the continuous
delivery of evolving AI models and their operation in ASs under adverse
conditions would support companies in increasing users' trust in their
products.

  We address the diffusion of information about the COVID-19 with a massive
data analysis on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit and Gab. We analyze
engagement and interest in the COVID-19 topic and provide a differential
assessment on the evolution of the discourse on a global scale for each
platform and their users. We fit information spreading with epidemic models
characterizing the basic reproduction numbers $R_0$ for each social media
platform. Moreover, we characterize information spreading from questionable
sources, finding different volumes of misinformation in each platform. However,
information from both reliable and questionable sources do not present
different spreading patterns. Finally, we provide platform-dependent numerical
estimates of rumors' amplification.

Title: Variable-Based Network Analysis of Datasets on Data Exchange Platforms
Authors: Teruaki Hayashi, Yukio Ohsawa
Categories: cs.SI cs.CY
\\
  Recently, data exchange platforms have emerged in the digital economy to
enable better resource allocation in a data-driven society, which requires
cross-organizational data collaborations. Understanding the characteristics of
the data on these platforms is important for their application; however, the
structures of such platforms have not been extensively investigated. In this
study, we apply a network approach with a novel variable-based structural
analysis to the metadata of datasets on two data platform services. It was
noted that the structures of the data networks are locally dense and highly
assortative, similar to human-related net-works. Even though the data on these
platforms are designed and collected differently, depending on the use
objectives, the variables of heterogeneous data exhibit a power distribution,
and the data networks exhibit multi-scaling behavior. Furthermore, we found
that the data collection strategies of the platforms are related to the variety
of variables, density of the networks, and their robustness from the viewpoint
of sustainability and social acceptability of the data platforms.

Title: Combined Centrality Measures for an Improved Characterization of

\\
  Influence Maximization (IM) aims at finding the most influential users in a
social network, i. e., users who maximize the spread of an opinion within a
certain propagation model. Previous work investigated the correlation between
influence spread and nodal centrality measures to bypass more expensive IM
simulations. The results were promising but incomplete, since these studies
investigated the performance (i. e., the ability to identify influential users)
of centrality measures only in restricted settings, e. g., in
undirected/unweighted networks and/or within a propagation model less common
for IM. In this paper, we first show that good results within the Susceptible-
Infected-Removed (SIR) propagation model for unweighted and undirected networks
do not necessarily transfer to directed or weighted networks under the popular
Independent Cascade (IC) propagation model. Then, we identify a set of
centrality measures with good performance for weighted and directed networks
within the IC model. Our main contribution is a new way to combine the
centrality measures in a closed formula to yield even better results.
Additionally, we also extend gravitational centrality (GC) with the proposed
combined centrality measures. Our experiments on 50 real-world data sets show
that our proposed centrality measures outperform well-known centrality measures
and the state-of-the art GC measure significantly. social networks, influence

Title: Disrupting Resilient Criminal Networks through Data Analysis: The case

\\
  Compared to other types of social networks, criminal networks present hard
challenges, due to their strong resilience to disruption, which poses severe
hurdles to law-enforcement agencies. Herein, we borrow methods and tools from
Social Network Analysis to (i) unveil the structure of Sicilian Mafia gangs,
based on two real-world datasets, and (ii) gain insights as to how to
efficiently disrupt them. Mafia networks have peculiar features, due to the
links distribution and strength, which makes them very different from other
social networks, and extremely robust to exogenous perturbations. Analysts are
also faced with the difficulty in collecting reliable datasets that accurately
describe the gangs' internal structure and their relationships with the
external world, which is why earlier studies are largely qualitative, elusive
and incomplete. An added value of our work is the generation of two real-world
datasets, based on raw data derived from juridical acts, relating to a Mafia
organization that operated in Sicily during the first decade of 2000s. We
created two different networks, capturing phone calls and physical meetings,
respectively. Our network disruption analysis simulated different intervention
procedures: (i) arresting one criminal at a time (sequential node removal); and
(ii) police raids (node block removal). We measured the effectiveness of each
approach through a number of network centrality metrics. We found Betweeness
Centrality to be the most effective metric, showing how, by neutralizing only
the 5% of the affiliates, network connectivity dropped by 70%. We also
identified that, due the peculiar type of interactions in criminal networks
(namely, the distribution of the interactions frequency) no significant
differences exist between weighted and unweighted network analysis. Our work
has significant practical applications for tackling criminal and terrorist
networks.

Title: Scalable Computation of Controlled Invariant Sets for Discrete-Time
  Linear Systems with Input Delays
Authors: Zexiang Liu, Liren Yang, Necmiye Ozay
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures, accepted by ACC 2020
\\
  In this paper, we first propose a method that can efficiently compute the
maximal robust controlled invariant set for discrete-time linear systems with
pure delay in input. The key to this method is to construct an auxiliary linear
system (without delay) with the same state-space dimension of the original
system in consideration and to relate the maximal invariant set of the
auxiliary system to that of the original system. When the system is subject to
disturbances, guaranteeing safety is harder for systems with input delays.
Ability to incorporate any additional information about the disturbance becomes
more critical in these cases. Motivated by this observation, in the second part
of the paper, we generalize the proposed method to take into account additional
preview information on the disturbances, while maintaining computational
efficiency. Compared with the naive approach of constructing a higher
dimensional system by appending the state-space with the delayed inputs and
previewed disturbances, the proposed approach is demonstrated to scale much
better with the increasing delay time.

  With the advancement of sensing and communication in power networks,
high-frequency real-time data from a power network can be used as a resource to
develop better monitoring capabilities. In this work, a systematic approach
based on data-driven operator theoretic methods involving Koopman operator is
proposed for the online identification of power system dynamics. In particular,
a new algorithm is provided, which unlike any previously existing algorithms,
updates the Koopman operator iteratively as new data points are acquired. The
proposed algorithm has three advantages: a) allows for real-time monitoring of
the power system dynamics b) linear power system dynamics (this linear system
is usually in a higher dimensional feature space and is not same as
linearization of the underlying nonlinear dynamics) and c) computationally fast
and less intensive when compared to the popular Extended Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (EDMD) algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is
illustrated on an IEEE 9 bus system using synthetic data from the nonlinear
model and on IEEE 39 bus system using synthetic data from the linearized model.

  Information and communication technology (ICT) is an enabler for establishing
automated vehicles (AVs) in today's traffic systems. By providing complementary
and/or redundant information via radio communication to the AV's perception by
on-board sensors, higher levels of automated driving become more comfortable,
safer, or even possible without interaction by the driver, especially in
complex scenarios. Additionally, communication between vehicles and/or a
central service can improve the efficiency of traffic flow. This paper presents
a reference architecture for such an infrastructure-based support of AVs. The
architecture combines innovative concepts and technologies from different
technological fields like communication, IT environment and data flows, and
cyber-security and privacy. Being the basis for the EU-funded project ICT4CART,
exemplary implementations of this architecture will show its power for a
variety of use cases on highways and in urban areas in test sites in Austria,
Germany, and Italy, including cross-border interoperability.

  The widespread diffusion of distributed energy resources, especially those
based on renewable energy, and energy storage devices has deeply modified power
systems. As a consequence, demand response, the ability of customers to respond
to regulating signals, has moved from large high-voltage and medium-voltage
end-users to small, low-voltage, customers. In order to be effective, the
participation to demand response of such small players must be gathered by
aggregators. The role and the business models of these new entities have been
studied in literature from a variety of viewpoints. Demand response can be
clearly applied by sending a dedicated price signal to customers, but this
methodology cannot obtain a diverse, punctual, predictable, and reliable
response. These characteristics can be achieved by directly controlling the
loads units. This approach involves communication problems and technological
readiness. This paper proposes a fully decentralized mixed integer linear
programming approach for demand response. In this framework, each load unit
performs an optimization, subject to technical and user-based constraints, and
gives to the aggregator a desired profile along with a reserve, which is
guaranteed to comply with the constraints. In this way, the aggregator can
trade the reserve coming from several load units, being the only interface to
the market. Upon request, then, the aggregator communicates to the load units
the modifications to their desired profiles without either knowing or caring
how this modification would be accomplished. The effectiveness is simulated on
200 realistic load units.

Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We introduce a family of multilayer graph kernels and establish new links
between graph convolutional neural networks and kernel methods. Our approach
generalizes convolutional kernel networks to graph-structured data, by
representing graphs as a sequence of kernel feature maps, where each node
carries information about local graph substructures. On the one hand, the
kernel point of view offers an unsupervised, expressive, and easy-to-regularize
data representation, which is useful when limited samples are available. On the
other hand, our model can also be trained end-to-end on large-scale data,
leading to new types of graph convolutional neural networks. We show that our
method achieves competitive performance on several graph classification
benchmarks, while offering simple model interpretation. Our code is freely

Authors: Amitabh Basu, Michele Conforti, Marco Di Summa, Hongyi Jiang
Categories: math.OC cs.CC
MSC-class: 90C11, 90C57, 90C60
\\
  We investigate the theoretical complexity of branch-and-bound (BB) and
cutting plane (CP) algorithms for mixed-integer optimization. In particular, we
study the relative efficiency of BB and CP, when both are based on the same
family of disjunctions. We extend a result of Dash to the nonlinear setting
which shows that for convex 0/1 problems, CP does at least as well as BB, with
variable disjunctions. We sharpen this by giving instances of the stable set
problem where we can provably establish that CP does exponentially better than
BB. We further show that if one moves away from 0/1 sets, this advantage of CP
over BB disappears; there are examples where BB finishes in O(1) time, but CP
takes infinitely long to prove optimality, and exponentially long to get to
arbitrarily close to the optimal value (for variable disjunctions). We next
show that if the dimension is considered a fixed constant, then the situation
reverses and BB does at least as well as CP (up to a polynomial blow up), no
matter which family of disjunctions is used. This is also complemented by
examples where this gap is exponential (in the size of the input data).

Title: Computed Tomography Reconstruction Using Deep Image Prior and Learned
  Reconstruction Methods
Authors: Daniel Otero Baguer, Johannes Leuschner, Maximilian Schmidt
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this work, we investigate the application of deep learning methods for
computed tomography in the context of having a low-data regime. As motivation,
we review some of the existing approaches and obtain quantitative results after
training them with different amounts of data. We find that the learned
primal-dual has an outstanding performance in terms of reconstruction quality
and data efficiency. However, in general, end-to-end learned methods have two
issues: a) lack of classical guarantees in inverse problems and b) lack of
generalization when not trained with enough data. To overcome these issues, we
bring in the deep image prior approach in combination with classical
regularization. The proposed methods improve the state-of-the-art results in
the low data-regime.

\\
  Medical image segmentation has been very challenging due to the large
variation of anatomy across different cases. Recent advances in deep learning
frameworks have exhibited faster and more accurate performance in image
segmentation. Among the existing networks, U-Net has been successfully applied
on medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose an extension of U-Net
for medical image segmentation, in which we take full advantages of U-Net,
Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block, bi-directional ConvLSTM (BConvLSTM), and the
mechanism of dense convolutions. (I) We improve the segmentation performance by
utilizing SE modules within the U-Net, with a minor effect on model complexity.
These blocks adaptively recalibrate the channel-wise feature responses by
utilizing a self-gating mechanism of the global information embedding of the
feature maps. (II) To strengthen feature propagation and encourage feature
reuse, we use densely connected convolutions in the last convolutional layer of
the encoding path. (III) Instead of a simple concatenation in the skip
connection of U-Net, we employ BConvLSTM in all levels of the network to
combine the feature maps extracted from the corresponding encoding path and the

  We report a model to predict patient's radiological response to curative
radiation therapy (RT) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
  Cone-Beam Computed Tomography images acquired weekly during the six-week
course of RT were contoured with the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) by senior
radiation oncologists for 53 patients (7 images per patient).
  Deformable registration of the images yielded six deformation fields for each
pair of consecutive images per patient.
  Jacobian of a field provides a measure of local expansion/contraction and is
used in our model.
  Delineations were compared post-registration to compute unchanged ($U$),
newly grown ($G$), and reduced ($R$) regions within GTV.
  The mean Jacobian of these regions $\mu_U$, $\mu_G$ and $\mu_R$ are
statistically compared and a response assessment model is proposed.
  A good response is hypothesized if $\mu_R < 1.0$, $\mu_R < \mu_U$, and $\mu_G
< \mu_U$.
  For early prediction of post-treatment response, first, three weeks' images
are used.
  Our model predicted clinical response with a precision of $74\%$.
  Using reduction in CT numbers (CTN) and percentage GTV reduction as features
in logistic regression, yielded an area-under-curve of 0.65 with p=0.005.
  Combining logistic regression model with the proposed hypothesis yielded an
odds ratio of 20.0 (p=0.0).

  We show that the diameter of the directed configuration model with $n$
vertices rescaled by $\log n$ converges in probability to a constant. Our

maximizes a given function evaluated at its degree sequence. While the problem
is intractable already for convex functions, we show that it can be solved in
polynomial time for convex multi-criteria objectives. We next consider the
problem with separable objectives, which is NP-hard already when all vertex
functions are the square. We consider a colored extension of the separable
problem, which includes the notorious exact matching problem as a special case,
and show that it can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded
tree-depth for any vertex functions. We mention some of the many remaining open
problems.

  In reliability theory and survival analysis, the residual entropy is known as
a measure suitable to describe the dynamic information content in stochastic
systems conditional on survival. Aiming to analyze the variability of such
information content, in this paper we introduce the variance of the residual
lifetimes, "residual varentropy" in short. After a theoretical investigation of
some properties of the residual varentropy, we illustrate certain applications
related to the proportional hazards model and the first-passage times of an

\\
  Atomistic molecular dynamics simulation is an important tool for predicting
materials properties. Accuracy depends crucially on the model for the
interatomic potential. The gold standard would be quantum mechanics (QM) based
force calculations, but such a first-principles approach becomes prohibitively
expensive at large system sizes. Efficient machine learning models (ML) have
become increasingly popular as surrogates for QM. Neural networks with many
thousands of parameters excel in capturing structure within a large dataset,
but may struggle to extrapolate beyond the scope of the available data. Here we
present a highly automated active learning approach to iteratively collect new
QM data that best resolves weaknesses in the existing ML model. We exemplify
our approach by developing a general potential for elemental aluminum. At each
active learning iteration, the method (1) trains an ANI-style neural network
potential from the available data, (2) uses this potential to drive molecular
dynamics simulations, and (3) collects new QM data whenever the neural network
identifies an atomic configuration for which it cannot make a good prediction.
All molecular dynamics simulations are initialized to a disordered
configuration, and then driven according to randomized, time-varying
temperatures. This nonequilibrium molecular dynamics forms a variety of
crystalline and defected configurations. By training on all such automatically
collected data, we produce ANI-Al, our new interatomic potential for aluminum.
We demonstrate the remarkable transferability of ANI-Al by benchmarking against
experimental data, e.g., the radial distribution function in melt, various
properties of the stable face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal, and the coexistence
curve between melt and FCC.

Title: Error Estimation for Sketched SVD via the Bootstrap
Authors: Miles E. Lopes and N. Benjamin Erichson and Michael W. Mahoney
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO
\\
  In order to compute fast approximations to the singular value decompositions
(SVD) of very large matrices, randomized sketching algorithms have become a
leading approach. However, a key practical difficulty of sketching an SVD is
that the user does not know how far the sketched singular vectors/values are
from the exact ones. Indeed, the user may be forced to rely on analytical
worst-case error bounds, which do not account for the unique structure of a
given problem. As a result, the lack of tools for error estimation often leads
to much more computation than is really necessary. To overcome these
challenges, this paper develops a fully data-driven bootstrap method that
numerically estimates the actual error of sketched singular vectors/values. In
particular, this allows the user to inspect the quality of a rough initial
sketched SVD, and then adaptively predict how much extra work is needed to
reach a given error tolerance. Furthermore, the method is computationally
inexpensive, because it operates only on sketched objects, and it requires no
passes over the full matrix being factored. Lastly, the method is supported by
theoretical guarantees and a very encouraging set of experimental results.

this paper clarifies the theory. Furthermore, Ogburn et al. (2020) proposes

Title: Prediction of Bayesian Intervals for Tropical Storms
Authors: Max Chiswick and Sam Ganzfried
Categories: stat.AP cs.LG physics.ao-ph stat.ML
\\
  Building on recent research for prediction of hurricane trajectories using
recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we have developed improved methods and
generalized the approach to predict Bayesian intervals in addition to simple
point estimates. Tropical storms are capable of causing severe damage, so
accurately predicting their trajectories can bring significant benefits to
cities and lives, especially as they grow more intense due to climate change
effects. By implementing the Bayesian interval using dropout in an RNN, we
improve the actionability of the predictions, for example by estimating the
areas to evacuate in the landfall region. We used an RNN to predict the
trajectory of the storms at 6-hour intervals. We used latitude, longitude,
windspeed, and pressure features from a Statistical Hurricane Intensity
Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) dataset of about 500 tropical storms in the Atlantic
Ocean. Our results show how neural network dropout values affect predictions
and intervals.

Title: KALE: When Energy-Based Learning Meets Adversarial Training
Authors: Michael Arbel and Liang Zhou and Arthur Gretton
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Legendre duality provides a variational lower-bound for the Kullback-Leibler
divergence (KL) which can be estimated using samples, without explicit
knowledge of the density ratio. We use this estimator, the \textit{KL
Approximate Lower-bound Estimate} (KALE), in a contrastive setting for learning
energy-based models, and show that it provides a maximum likelihood estimate
(MLE). We then extend this procedure to adversarial training, where the
discriminator represents the energy and the generator is the base measure of
the energy-based model. Unlike in standard generative adversarial networks
(GANs), the learned model makes use of both generator and discriminator to
generate samples. This is achieved using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in the latent
space of the generator, using information from the discriminator, to find
regions in that space that produce better quality samples. We also show that,
unlike the KL, KALE enjoys smoothness properties that make it suitable for
adversarial training, and provide convergence rates for KALE when the negative
log density ratio belongs to the variational family. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach on simple datasets.

Title: Estimation of Accurate and Calibrated Uncertainties in Deterministic
  models
Authors: Enrico Camporeale and Algo Car\`e
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  In this paper we focus on the problem of assigning uncertainties to
single-point predictions generated by a deterministic model that outputs a
continuous variable. This problem applies to any state-of-the-art physics or
engineering models that have a computational cost that does not readily allow
to run ensembles and to estimate the uncertainty associated to single-point
predictions. Essentially, we devise a method to easily transform a
deterministic prediction into a probabilistic one. We show that for doing so,
one has to compromise between the accuracy and the reliability (calibration) of
such a probabilistic model. Hence, we introduce a cost function that encodes
their trade-off. We use the Continuous Rank Probability Score to measure
accuracy and we derive an analytic formula for the reliability, in the case of
forecasts of continuous scalar variables expressed in terms of Gaussian
distributions. The new Accuracy-Reliability cost function is then used to
estimate the input-dependent variance, given a black-box mean function, by
solving a two-objective optimization problem. The simple philosophy behind this
strategy is that predictions based on the estimated variances should not only
be accurate, but also reliable (i.e. statistical consistent with observations).
Conversely, early works based on the minimization of classical cost functions,
such as the negative log probability density, cannot simultaneously enforce
both accuracy and reliability. We show several examples both with synthetic
data, where the underlying hidden noise can accurately be recovered, and with
large real-world datasets.

Title: Coordinate-wise Armijo's condition: General case
Authors: Tuyen Trung Truong
Categories: math.OC cs.LG math.DS stat.ML
Comments: 6 pages. Preprint arXiv:1911.07820 is incorporated as a very special
  case
\\
  Let $z=(x,y)$ be coordinates for the product space $\mathbb{R}^{m_1}\times
\mathbb{R}^{m_2}$. Let $f:\mathbb{R}^{m_1}\times \mathbb{R}^{m_2}\rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$ be a $C^1$ function, and $\nabla f=(\partial _xf,\partial _yf)$ its
gradient. Fix $0<\alpha <1$. For a point $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^{m_1}\times
\mathbb{R}^{m_2}$, a number $\delta >0$ satisfies Armijo's condition at $(x,y)$
if the following inequality holds: \begin{eqnarray*} f(x-\delta \partial
_xf,y-\delta \partial _yf)-f(x,y)\leq -\alpha \delta (||\partial
_xf||^2+||\partial _yf||^2). \end{eqnarray*}
  In one previous paper, we proposed the following {\bf coordinate-wise}
Armijo's condition. Fix again $0<\alpha <1$. A pair of positive numbers $\delta
_1,\delta _2>0$ satisfies the coordinate-wise variant of Armijo's condition at
$(x,y)$ if the following inequality holds: \begin{eqnarray*} [f(x-\delta
_1\partial _xf(x,y), y-\delta _2\partial _y f(x,y))]-[f(x,y)]\leq -\alpha
(\delta _1||\partial _xf(x,y)||^2+\delta _2||\partial _yf(x,y)||^2).
\end{eqnarray*} Previously we applied this condition for functions of the form
$f(x,y)=f(x)+g(y)$, and proved various convergent results for them. For a
general function, it is crucial - for being able to do real computations - to
have a systematic algorithm for obtaining $\delta _1$ and $\delta _2$
satisfying the coordinate-wise version of Armijo's condition, much like
Backtracking for the usual Armijo's condition. In this paper we propose such an
algorithm, and prove according convergent results.
  We then analyse and present experimental results for some functions such as
$f(x,y)=a|x|+y$ (given by Asl and Overton in connection to Wolfe's method),
$f(x,y)=x^3 sin (1/x) + y^3 sin(1/y)$ and Rosenbrock's function.

Title: Majorization Minimization Methods to Distributed Pose Graph Optimization
  with Convergence Guarantees
Authors: Taosha Fan and Todd Murphey
Categories: math.OC cs.LG cs.RO
Comments: 13 pages
\\
  In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed pose graph optimization
(PGO) that has extensive applications in multi-robot simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM). We propose majorization minimization methods to distributed
PGO and show that our proposed methods are guaranteed to converge to
first-order critical points under mild conditions. Furthermore, since our
proposed methods rely a proximal operator of distributed PGO, the convergence
rate can be significantly accelerated with Nesterov's method, and more
importantly, the acceleration induces no compromise of theoretical guarantees.
In addition, we also present accelerated majorization minimization methods to
the distributed chordal initialization that have a quadratic convergence, which
can be used to compute an initial guess for distributed PGO. The efficacy of
this work is validated through applications on a number of 2D and 3D SLAM
datasets and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, which
indicates that our proposed methods have faster convergence and result in
better solutions to distributed PGO.

Title: FuDGE: Functional Differential Graph Estimation with fully and
  discretely observed curves
Authors: Boxin Zhao, Y. Samuel Wang, Mladen Kolar
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 79 pages, 4 figures, submitted to JMLR
\\
  We consider the problem of estimating the difference between two functional
undirected graphical models with shared structures. In many applications, data
are naturally regarded as high-dimensional random function vectors rather than
multivariate scalars. For example, electroencephalography (EEG) data are more
appropriately treated as functions of time. In these problems, not only can the
number of functions measured per sample be large, but each function is itself
an infinite dimensional object, making estimation of model parameters
challenging. In practice, curves are usually discretely observed, which makes
graph structure recovery even more challenging. We formally characterize when
two functional graphical models are comparable and propose a method that
directly estimates the functional differential graph, which we term FuDGE.
FuDGE avoids separate estimation of each graph, which allows for estimation in
problems where individual graphs are dense, but their difference is sparse. We
show that FuDGE consistently estimates the functional differential graph in a
high-dimensional setting for both discretely observed and fully observed
function paths. We illustrate finite sample properties of our method through
simulation studies. In order to demonstrate the benefits of our method, we
propose Joint Functional Graphical Lasso as a competitor, which is a
generalization of the Joint Graphical Lasso. Finally, we apply our method to
EEG data to uncover differences in functional brain connectivity between
alcoholics and control subjects.

Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures, submitted to EUSIPCO 2020
\\
  Deep neural networks are a very powerful tool for many computer vision tasks,
including image restoration, exhibiting state-of-the-art results. However, the
performance of deep learning methods tends to drop once the observation model
used in training mismatches the one in test time. In addition, most deep
learning methods require vast amounts of training data, which are not
accessible in many applications. To mitigate these disadvantages, we propose to
combine two image restoration approaches: (i) Deep Image Prior (DIP), which
trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch in test time using the
given degraded image. It does not require any training data and builds on the
implicit prior imposed by the CNN architecture; and (ii) a backprojection (BP)
fidelity term, which is an alternative to the standard least squares loss that
is usually used in previous DIP works. We demonstrate the performance of the
proposed method, termed BP-DIP, on the deblurring task and show its advantages
over the plain DIP, with both higher PSNR values and better inference run-time.

  The human brain contains approximately $10^9$ neurons, each with
approximately $10^3$ connections, synapses, with other neurons. Most sensory,
cognitive and motor functions of our brains depend on the interaction of a
large population of neurons. In recent years, many technologies are developed
for recording large numbers of neurons either sequentially or simultaneously.
An increase in computational power and algorithmic developments have enabled
advanced analyses of neuronal population parallel to the rapid growth of
quantity and complexity of the recorded neuronal activity. Recent studies made
use of dimensionality and model order reduction techniques to extract coherent
features which are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. It has been
observed that the neuronal activity evolves on low-dimensional subspaces. The
aim of model reduction of large-scale neuronal networks is an accurate and fast
prediction of patterns and their propagation in different areas of the brain.
Spatiotemporal features of the brain activity are identified on low dimensional
subspaces with methods such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD), discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) and
combined parameter and state reduction. In this paper, we give an overview of
the currently used dimensionality reduction and model order reduction
techniques in neuroscience.

  This paper is focused on American option pricing in the subdiffusive Black
Scholes model. Two methods for valuing American options in the considered model
are proposed. The weighted scheme of the finite difference (FD) method is
derived and the main properties of the method are presented. The
Longstaff-Schwartz method is applied for the discussed model and is compared to
the previous method. In the article it is also shown how to valuate wide range
of Barrier options using the FD approach. The proposed FD method has $2-\alpha$
order of accuracy with respect to time, where $\alpha\in(0, 1)$ is the
subdiffusion parameter, and 2 with respect to space. The paper is a
continuation of [13], where the derivation of the governing fractional
differential equation, similarly as the stability and convergence analysis can
be found.

Title: Entanglement Accessibility Measures for the Quantum Internet
Authors: Laszlo Gyongyosi, Sandor Imre
Categories: quant-ph cs.NI
Journal-ref: Quantum Inf Process 19, 115 (2020)
DOI: 10.1007/s11128-020-2605-y
\\
  We define metrics and measures to characterize the ratio of accessible
quantum entanglement for complex network failures in the quantum Internet. A
complex network failure models a situation in the quantum Internet in which a
set of quantum nodes and a set of entangled connections become unavailable. A
complex failure can cover a quantum memory failure, a physical link failure, an
eavesdropping activity, or any other random physical failure scenario. Here, we
define the terms entanglement accessibility ratio, cumulative probability of
entanglement accessibility ratio, probabilistic reduction of entanglement
accessibility ratio, domain entanglement accessibility ratio, and occurrence
coefficient. The proposed methods can be applied to an arbitrary topology
quantum network to extract relevant statistics and to handle the quantum
network failure scenarios in the quantum Internet.

Title: Optimizing High-Efficiency Quantum Memory with Quantum Machine Learning
  for Near-Term Quantum Devices
Authors: Laszlo Gyongyosi, Sandor Imre

DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-56689-0
\\
  Quantum memories are a fundamental of any global-scale quantum Internet,
high-performance quantum networking and near-term quantum computers. A main
problem of quantum memories is the low retrieval efficiency of the quantum
systems from the quantum registers of the quantum memory. Here, we define a
novel quantum memory called high-retrieval-efficiency (HRE) quantum memory for
near-term quantum devices. An HRE quantum memory unit integrates local unitary
operations on its hardware level for the optimization of the readout procedure
and utilizes the advanced techniques of quantum machine learning. We define the
integrated unitary operations of an HRE quantum memory, prove the learning
procedure, and evaluate the achievable output signal-to-noise ratio values. We
prove that the local unitaries of an HRE quantum memory achieve the
optimization of the readout procedure in an unsupervised manner without the use
of any labeled data or training sequences. We show that the readout procedure
of an HRE quantum memory is realized in a completely blind manner without any
information about the input quantum system or about the unknown quantum
operation of the quantum register. We evaluate the retrieval efficiency of an
HRE quantum memory and the output SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). The results are
particularly convenient for gate-model quantum computers and the near-term
quantum devices of the quantum Internet.

Title: Theory of Noise-Scaled Stability Bounds and Entanglement Rate
  Maximization in the Quantum Internet
Authors: Laszlo Gyongyosi, Sandor Imre
Categories: quant-ph cs.NI
Journal-ref: Sci Rep 10, 2745 (2020)
DOI: 10.1038/s41598-020-58200-6
\\
  Crucial problems of the quantum Internet are the derivation of stability
properties of quantum repeaters and theory of entanglement rate maximization in
an entangled network structure. The stability property of a quantum repeater
entails that all incoming density matrices can be swapped with a target density
matrix. The strong stability of a quantum repeater implies stable entanglement
swapping with the boundness of stored density matrices in the quantum memory
and the boundness of delays. Here, a theoretical framework of noise-scaled
stability analysis and entanglement rate maximization is conceived for the
quantum Internet. We define the term of entanglement swapping set that models
the status of quantum memory of a quantum repeater with the stored density
matrices. We determine the optimal entanglement swapping method that maximizes
the entanglement rate of the quantum repeaters at the different entanglement
swapping sets as function of the noise of the local memory and local
operations. We prove the stability properties for non-complete entanglement
swapping sets, complete entanglement swapping sets and perfect entanglement
swapping sets. We prove the entanglement rates for the different entanglement
swapping sets and noise levels. The results can be applied to the experimental
quantum Internet.

Title: Covert Cycle Stealing in a Single FIFO Server
Authors: Bo Jiang, Philippe Nain, Don Towsley
Categories: math.PR cs.PF
\\
  Consider a setting where Willie generates a Poisson stream of jobs and routes
them to a single server that follows the first-in first-out discipline. Suppose
there is an adversary Alice, who desires to receive service without being
detected. We ask the question: what is the amount of service that she can
receive covertly, i.e. without being detected by Willie? In the case where both
Willie and Alice jobs have exponential service times with respective rates
$\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, we demonstrate a phase-transition when Alice adopts the
strategy of inserting a single job probabilistically when the server idles :
over $n$ busy periods, she can achieve a covert throughput of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ when $\mu_1 < 2\mu_2$, $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n/\log n})$
when $\mu_1 = 2\mu_2$, and $\mathcal{O}(n^{\mu_2/\mu_1})$ when $\mu_1 >
2\mu_2$. When both Willie and Alice jobs have general service times we
establish an upper bound for the amount of service Alice can get covertly. This
bound is related to the Fisher information. Additional upper bounds are
obtained for more general insertion policies.

Title: On the Localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Cellular Networks

Comments: IEEE WCNC - IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking
  Conference-2020
\\
  Localization plays a key role for safe operation of UAVs enabling beyond
visual line of sight applications. Compared to GPS based localization, cellular
networks can reduce the positioning error and cost since cellular connectivity
is becoming a prominent solution as a communication system for UAVs. As a first
step towards localization, UAV needs to receive sufficient number of
localization signals each having a signal to interference plus noise ratio
(SINR) greater than a threshold, which is defined as localizability. On the
other hand, three-dimensional mobility of UAVs, altitude dependent channel
characteristics between base stations (BSs) and UAVs, its line of sight and
non-line of sight conditions, and resulting interference from the neighboring
BSs pose challenges to receive usable signals from the required number of BSs.
In this paper, we utilize a tractable approach to calculate localizability,
probability of successfully receiving usable signals from a certain number of
BSs, in a two-tier hexagonal cellular network. Localizability has an impact on
overall localization performance regardless of the localization technique to be
used. In our simulation study, we investigate the relation between the
probability of localizability with respect to number of participating BSs,
post-processing SINR requirement, air-to-ground channel characteristics, and
network coordination, which are shown to be the most important factors for the
localizability performance of UAVs.

Title: A Mean-Field Game Approach to Equilibrium Pricing, Optimal Generation,
  and Trading in Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) Markets
Authors: Arvind Shrivats, Dena Firoozi, Sebastian Jaimungal
Categories: q-fin.MF cs.SY eess.SY math.OC q-fin.TR

\\
  SREC markets are a market-based system designed to incentivize solar energy
generation. A regulatory body imposes a lower bound on the amount of energy
each regulated firm must generate via solar means, providing them with a
certificate for each MWh generated. Regulated firms seek to navigate the market
to minimize the cost imposed on them, by modulating their SREC generation and
trading activities. As such, the SREC market can be viewed through the lens of
a large stochastic game with heterogeneous agents, where agents interact
through the market price of the certificates. We study this stochastic game by
solving the mean-field game (MFG) limit with sub-populations of heterogeneous
agents. Our market participants optimize costs accounting for trading
frictions, cost of generation, SREC penalty, and generation uncertainty. Using
techniques from variational analysis, we characterize firms' optimal controls
as the solution of a new class of McKean-Vlasov FBSDE and determine the
equilibrium SREC price. We numerically solve the MV-FBSDEs and conclude by
demonstrating how firms behave in equilibrium using simulated examples.
