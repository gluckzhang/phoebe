Title: Modeling Contrary-to-Duty with CP-nets
Authors: Roberta Calegari, Andrea Loreggia, Emiliano Lorini, Francesca Rossi,
  Giovanni Sartor
Categories: cs.AI cs.LO
\\
  In a ceteris-paribus semantics for deontic logic, a state of affairs where a
larger set of prescriptions is respected is preferable to a state of affairs
where some of them are violated. Conditional preference nets (CP-nets) are a
compact formalism to express and analyse ceteris paribus preferences, which
nice computational properties. This paper shows how deontic concepts can be
captured through conditional preference models. A restricted deontic logic will
be defined, and mapped into conditional preference nets. We shall also show how
to model contrary to duties obligations in CP-nets and how to capture in this
formalism the distinction between strong and weak permission.

Title: Neural Game Engine: Accurate learning ofgeneralizable forward models
  from pixels
Authors: Chris Bamford, Simon Lucas
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Access to a fast and easily copied forward model of a game is essential for
model-based reinforcement learning and for algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree
search, and is also beneficial as a source of unlimited experience data for
model-free algorithms. Learning forward models is an interesting and important
challenge in order to address problems where a model is not available. Building
upon previous work on the Neural GPU, this paper introduces the Neural Game
Engine, as a way to learn models directly from pixels. The learned models are
able to generalise to different size game levels to the ones they were trained
on without loss of accuracy. Results on 10 deterministic General Video Game AI
games demonstrate competitive performance, with many of the games models being
learned perfectly both in terms of pixel predictions and reward predictions.
The pre-trained models are available through the OpenAI Gym interface and are
available publicly for future research here:

Title: Anticipatory Psychological Models for Quickest Change Detection: Human
  Sensor Interaction
Authors: Vikram Krishnamurthy
Categories: cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  We consider anticipatory psychological models for human decision makers and
their effect on sequential decision making. From a decision theoretic point of
view, such models are time inconsistent meaning that Bellman's principle of
optimality does not hold. The aim of this paper is to study how such an
anxiety-based anticipatory utility can affect sequential decision making, such
as quickest change detection, in multi-agent systems. We show that the
interaction between anticipation-driven agents and sequential decision maker
results in unusual (nonconvex) structure of the optimal decision policy. The
methodology yields a useful mathematical framework for sensor interaction
involving a human decision maker (with behavioral economics constraints) and a
sensor equipped with automated sequential detector.

Title: A distributed memory, local configuration technique for re-configurable
  logic designs
Authors: Alexander E. Beasley
Categories: cs.AR
Comments: 13 files, 19 images
\\
  The use and location of memory in integrated circuits plays a key factor in
their performance. Memory requires large physical area, access times limit
overall system performance and connectivity can result in large fan-out. Modern
FPGA systems and ASICs contain an area of memory used to set the operation of
the device from a series of commands set by a host. Implementing these settings
registers requires a level of care otherwise the resulting implementation can
result in a number of large fan-out nets that consume valuable resources
complicating the placement of timing critical pathways. This paper presents an
architecture for implementing and programming these settings registers in a
distributed method across an FPGA and how the presented architecture works in
both clock-domain crossing and dynamic partial re-configuration applications.
The design is compared to that of a `global' settings register architecture. We
implement the architectures using Intel FPGAs Quartus Prime software targeting
an Intel FPGA Cyclone V. It is shown that the distributed memory architecture
has a smaller resource cost (as small as 25% of the ALMs and 20% of the
registers) compared to the global memory architectures.

Title: A low-overhead soft-hard fault-tolerant architecture, design and
  management scheme for reliable high-performance many-core 3D-NoC systems
Authors: Khanh N Dang, Michael Meyer, Yuichi Okuyama, Abderazek Ben Abdallah
Categories: cs.AR
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.09616

DOI: 10.1007/s11227-016-1951-0
\\
  The Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm has been proposed as a favorable solution
to handle the strict communication requirements between the increasingly large
number of cores on a single chip. However, NoC systems are exposed to the
aggressive scaling down of transistors, low operating voltages, and high
integration and power densities, making them vulnerable to permanent (hard)
faults and transient (soft) errors. A hard fault in a NoC can lead to external
blocking, causing congestion across the whole network. A soft error is more
challenging because of its silent data corruption, which leads to a large area
of erroneous data due to error propagation, packet re-transmission, and
deadlock. In this paper, we present the architecture and design of a
comprehensive soft error and hard fault-tolerant 3D-NoC system, named
3D-Hard-Fault-Soft-Error-Tolerant-OASIS-NoC (3D-FETO). With the aid of
efficient mechanisms and algorithms, 3D-FETO is capable of detecting and
recovering from soft errors which occur in the routing pipeline stages and
leverages reconfigurable components to handle permanent faults in links, input
buffers, and crossbars. In-depth evaluation results show that the 3D-FETO
system is able to work around different kinds of hard faults and soft errors,
ensuring graceful performance degradation, while minimizing additional hardware
complexity and remaining power efficient.

Title: Data-Driven Failure Prediction in Brittle Materials: A Phase-Field Based
  Machine Learning Framework
Authors: Eduardo A. Barros de Moraes, Hadi Salehi and Mohsen Zayernouri
Categories: cs.CE cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Failure in brittle materials led by the evolution of micro- to macro-cracks
under repetitive or increasing loads is often catastrophic with no significant
plasticity to advert the onset of fracture. Early failure detection with
respective location are utterly important features in any practical
application, both of which can be effectively addressed using artificial
intelligence. In this paper, we develop a supervised machine learning (ML)
framework to predict failure in an isothermal, linear elastic and isotropic
phase-field model for damage and fatigue of brittle materials. Time-series data
of the phase-field model is extracted from virtual sensing nodes at different
locations of the geometry. A pattern recognition scheme is introduced to
represent time-series data/sensor nodes responses as a pattern with a
corresponding label, integrated with ML algorithms, used for damage
classification with identified patterns. We perform an uncertainty analysis by
superposing random noise to the time-series data to assess the robustness of
the framework with noise-polluted data. Results indicate that the proposed
framework is capable of predicting failure with acceptable accuracy even in the
presence of high noise levels. The findings demonstrate satisfactory
performance of the supervised ML framework, and the applicability of artificial
intelligence and ML to a practical engineering problem, i.,e, data-driven
failure prediction in brittle materials.

Title: ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than
  Generators
Authors: Kevin Clark, Minh-Thang Luong, Quoc V. Le, Christopher D. Manning
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  Masked language modeling (MLM) pre-training methods such as BERT corrupt the
input by replacing some tokens with [MASK] and then train a model to
reconstruct the original tokens. While they produce good results when
transferred to downstream NLP tasks, they generally require large amounts of
compute to be effective. As an alternative, we propose a more sample-efficient
pre-training task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the
input, our approach corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible
alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead of training
a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train
a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input
was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate
this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is
defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked
out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our approach
substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size,
data, and compute. The gains are particularly strong for small models; for
example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained
using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark.
Our approach also works well at scale, where it performs comparably to RoBERTa
and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when
using the same amount of compute.

\\
  Yor\`ub\'a is a widely spoken West African language with a writing system
rich in orthographic and tonal diacritics. They provide morphological
information, are crucial for lexical disambiguation, pronunciation and are
vital for any computational Speech or Natural Language Processing tasks.
However diacritic marks are commonly excluded from electronic texts due to
limited device and application support as well as general education on proper
usage. We report on recent efforts at dataset cultivation. By aggregating and
improving disparate texts from the web and various personal libraries, we were
able to significantly grow our clean Yor\`ub\'a dataset from a majority
Bibilical text corpora with three sources to millions of tokens from over a
dozen sources. We evaluate updated diacritic restoration models on a new,
general purpose, public-domain Yor\`ub\'a evaluation dataset of modern
journalistic news text, selected to be multi-purpose and reflecting
contemporary usage. All pre-trained models, datasets and source-code have been
released as an open-source project to advance efforts on Yor\`ub\'a language
technology.

Title: Felix: Flexible Text Editing Through Tagging and Insertion
Authors: Jonathan Mallinson, Aliaksei Severyn, Eric Malmi, Guillermo Garrido
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  We present Felix --- a flexible text-editing approach for generation,
designed to derive the maximum benefit from the ideas of decoding with
bi-directional contexts and self-supervised pre-training. In contrast to
conventional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, Felix is efficient in
low-resource settings and fast at inference time, while being capable of
modeling flexible input-output transformations. We achieve this by decomposing
the text-editing task into two sub-tasks: tagging to decide on the subset of
input tokens and their order in the output text and insertion to in-fill the
missing tokens in the output not present in the input. The tagging model
employs a novel Pointer mechanism, while the insertion model is based on a
Masked Language Model. Both of these models are chosen to be non-autoregressive
to guarantee faster inference. Felix performs favourably when compared to
recent text-editing methods and strong seq2seq baselines when evaluated on four
NLG tasks: Sentence Fusion, Machine Translation Automatic Post-Editing,
Summarization, and Text Simplification.

Title: Towards Neural Machine Translation for Edoid Languages
Authors: Iroro Orife
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to ICLR 2020 AfricaNLP workshop
\\
  Many Nigerian languages have relinquished their previous prestige and purpose
in modern society to English and Nigerian Pidgin. For the millions of L1
speakers of indigenous languages, there are inequalities that manifest
themselves as unequal access to information, communications, health care,
security as well as attenuated participation in political and civic life. To
minimize exclusion and promote socio-linguistic and economic empowerment, this
work explores the feasibility of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for the Edoid
language family of Southern Nigeria. Using the new JW300 public dataset, we
trained and evaluated baseline translation models for four widely spoken
languages in this group: \`Ed\'o, \'Es\'an, Urhobo and Isoko. Trained models,
code and datasets have been open-sourced to advance future research efforts on
Edoid language technology.

Title: Generating Chinese Poetry from Images via Concrete and Abstract
  Information
Authors: Yusen Liu, Dayiheng Liu, Jiancheng Lv, Yongsheng Sang
Categories: cs.CL cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by the 2020 International Joint Conference on Neural
  Networks (IJCNN 2020)
\\
  In recent years, the automatic generation of classical Chinese poetry has
made great progress. Besides focusing on improving the quality of the generated
poetry, there is a new topic about generating poetry from an image. However,
the existing methods for this topic still have the problem of topic drift and
semantic inconsistency, and the image-poem pairs dataset is hard to be built
when training these models. In this paper, we extract and integrate the
Concrete and Abstract information from images to address those issues. We
proposed an infilling-based Chinese poetry generation model which can infill
the Concrete keywords into each line of poems in an explicit way, and an
abstract information embedding to integrate the Abstract information into
generated poems. In addition, we use non-parallel data during training and
construct separate image datasets and poem datasets to train the different
components in our framework. Both automatic and human evaluation results show
that our approach can generate poems which have better consistency with images
without losing the quality.

Title: Cross-Lingual Adaptation Using Universal Dependencies
Authors: Nasrin Taghizadeh and Heshaam Faili
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  We describe a cross-lingual adaptation method based on syntactic parse trees
obtained from the Universal Dependencies (UD), which are consistent across
languages, to develop classifiers in low-resource languages. The idea of UD
parsing is to capture similarities as well as idiosyncrasies among
typologically different languages. In this paper, we show that models trained
using UD parse trees for complex NLP tasks can characterize very different
languages. We study two tasks of paraphrase identification and semantic
relation extraction as case studies. Based on UD parse trees, we develop
several models using tree kernels and show that these models trained on the
English dataset can correctly classify data of other languages e.g. French,
Farsi, and Arabic. The proposed approach opens up avenues for exploiting UD
parsing in solving similar cross-lingual tasks, which is very useful for
languages that no labeled data is available for them.

Title: Method for Extracting Patterns of Coordinated Network Attacks on
  Electric Power CPS based on Temporal-Topological Correlation
Authors: Lei Wang, Zhaoyang Qu, Yang Li, Kewei Hu, Jian Sun, Kai Xue and
  Mingshi Cui
Categories: cs.CR cs.SY eess.SY math.OC
Comments: Accepted by IEEE Access
DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982057
\\
  In the analysis of coordinated network attacks on electric power
cyber-physical system (CPS), it is difficult to restore the complete attack
path, and the intent of the attack cannot be identified automatically. A method
is therefore proposed for the extracting patterns of coordinated network
attacks on electric power CPS based on temporal-topological correlation. First,
the attack events are aggregated according to the alarm log of the cyber space,
and a temporal-causal Bayesian network-based cyber attack recognition algorithm
is proposed to parse out the cyber attack sequences of the same attacker. Then,
according to the characteristic curves of different attack measurement data in
physical space, a combination of physical attack event criteria algorithm is
designed to distinguish the types of physical attack events. Finally, physical
attack events and cyber attack sequences are matched via temporal-topological
correlation, frequent patterns of attack sequences are extracted, and hidden
multi-step attack patterns are found from scattered grid measurement data and
information from alarm logs. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
method are verified by the testbed at Mississippi State University.

Title: Backflash Light as a Security Vulnerability in Quantum Key Distribution
  Systems
Authors: Ivan Vybornyi, Abderrahmen Trichili, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Categories: cs.CR quant-ph
\\
  Based on the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics, two communicating
parties can generate and share a secret random key that can be used to encrypt
and decrypt messages sent over an insecure channel. This process is known as
quantum key distribution (QKD). Contrary to classical encryption schemes, the
security of a QKD system does not depend on the computational complexity of
specific mathematical problems. However, QKD systems can be subject to
different kinds of attacks, exploiting engineering and technical imperfections
of the components forming the systems. Here, we review the security
vulnerabilities of QKD. We mainly focus on a particular effect known as
backflash light, which can be a source of eavesdropping attacks. We equally
highlight the methods for quantifying backflash emission and the different ways
to mitigate this effect.

\\
  Embedded software is developed under the assumption that hardware execution
is always correct. Fault attacks break and exploit that assumption. Through the
careful introduction of targeted faults, an adversary modifies the control-flow
or data-flow integrity of software. The modified program execution is then
analyzed and used as a source of information leakage, or as a mechanism for
privilege escalation. Due to the increasing complexity of modern embedded
systems, and due to the difficulty of guaranteeing correct hardware execution
even under a weak adversary, fault attacks are a growing threat. For example,
the assumption that an adversary has to be close to the physical execution of
software, in order to inject an exploitable fault into hardware, has repeatedly
been shown to be incorrect. This article is a review on hardware-based fault
attacks on software, with emphasis on the context of embedded systems. We
present a detailed discussion of the anatomy of a fault attack, and we make a
review of fault attack evaluation techniques. The paper emphasizes the
perspective from the attacker, rather than the perspective of countermeasure
development. However, we emphasize that improvements to countermeasures often
build on insight into the attacks.

Title: An Incentive Mechanism for Building a Secure Blockchain-based Industrial
  Internet of Things
Authors: Xingjian Ding, Jianxiong Guo, Deying Li, Weili Wu
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  The world-changing blockchain technique provides a novel method to establish
a secure, trusted and decentralized system for solving the security and
personal privacy problems in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications.
The mining process in blockchain requires miners to solve a proof-of-work
puzzle, which requires high computational power. However, the lightweight IIoT
devices cannot directly participate in the mining process due to the limitation
of power and computational resources. The edge computing service makes it
possible for IIoT applications to build a blockchain network, in which IIoT
devices purchase computational resources from edge servers and thus can offload
their computational tasks. The amount of computational resource purchased by
IIoT devices depends on how many profits they can get in the mining process,
and will directly affect the security of the blockchain network. In this paper,
we investigate the incentive mechanism for the blockchain platform to attract
IIoT devices to purchase more computational power from edge servers to
participate in the mining process, thereby building a more secure blockchain
network. We model the interaction between the blockchain platform and IIoT
devices as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the blockchain platform act as
the leader, and IIoT devices act as followers. We analyze the existence and
uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium, and propose an efficient algorithm
to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium point. Furthermore, we evaluate the
performance of our algorithm through extensive simulations, and analyze the
strategies of blockchain platform and IIoT devices under different situations.

Title: Systematic Evaluation of Privacy Risks of Machine Learning Models
Authors: Liwei Song, Prateek Mittal
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: code is available at
  https://github.com/inspire-group/membership-inference-evaluation
\\
  Machine learning models are prone to memorizing sensitive data, making them
vulnerable to membership inference attacks in which an adversary aims to guess
if an input sample was used to train the model. In this paper, we show that
prior work on membership inference attacks may severely underestimate the
privacy risks by relying solely on training custom neural network classifiers
to perform attacks and focusing only on the aggregate results over data
samples, such as the attack accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we first
propose to benchmark membership inference privacy risks by improving existing
non-neural network based inference attacks and proposing a new inference attack
method based on a modification of prediction entropy. We also propose
benchmarks for defense mechanisms by accounting for adaptive adversaries with
knowledge of the defense and also accounting for the trade-off between model
accuracy and privacy risks. Using our benchmark attacks, we demonstrate that
existing defense approaches are not as effective as previously reported.
  Next, we introduce a new approach for fine-grained privacy analysis by
formulating and deriving a new metric called the privacy risk score. Our
privacy risk score metric measures an individual sample's likelihood of being a
training member, which allows an adversary to perform membership inference
attacks with high confidence. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of
the privacy risk score metric and demonstrate that the distribution of the
privacy risk score across individual samples is heterogeneous. Finally, we

Title: Attention-Based Self-Supervised Feature Learning for Security Data
Authors: I-Ta Lee, Manish Marwah, and Martin Arlitt
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  While applications of machine learning in cyber-security have grown rapidly,
most models use manually constructed features. This manual approach is
error-prone and requires domain expertise. In this paper, we design a
self-supervised sequence-to-sequence model with attention to learn an embedding
for data routinely used in cyber-security applications. The method is validated
on two real world public data sets. The learned features are used in an anomaly
detection model and perform better than learned features from baseline methods.

Title: Obfuscating the Interconnects: Low-Cost and Resilient Full-Chip Layout
  Camouflaging
Authors: Satwik Patnaik, Mohammed Ashraf, Ozgur Sinanoglu, Johann Knechtel

\\
  Layout camouflaging can protect the intellectual property of modern circuits.
Most prior art, however, incurs excessive layout overheads and necessitates
customization of active-device manufacturing processes, i.e., the
front-end-of-line (FEOL). As a result, camouflaging has typically been applied
selectively, which can ultimately undermine its resilience. Here, we propose a
low-cost and generic scheme---full-chip camouflaging can be finally realized
without reservations. Our scheme is based on obfuscating the interconnects,
i.e., the back-end-of-line (BEOL), through design-time handling for real and
dummy wires and vias. To that end, we implement custom, BEOL-centric
obfuscation cells, and develop a CAD flow using industrial tools. Our scheme
can be applied to any design and technology node without FEOL-level
modifications. Considering its BEOL-centric nature, we advocate applying our
scheme in conjunction with split manufacturing, to furthermore protect against
untrusted fabs. We evaluate our scheme for various designs at the physical,
DRC-clean layout level. Our scheme incurs a significantly lower cost than most
of the prior art. Notably, for fully camouflaged layouts, we observe average
power, performance, and area overheads of 24.96%, 19.06%, and 32.55%,
respectively. We conduct a thorough security study addressing the threats
(attacks) related to untrustworthy FEOL fabs (proximity attacks) and malicious
end-users (SAT-based attacks). An empirical key finding is that only
large-scale camouflaging schemes like ours are practically secure against
powerful SAT-based attacks. Another key finding is that our scheme hinders both
placement- and routing-centric proximity attacks; correct connections are
reduced by 7.47X, and complexity is increased by 24.15X, respectively, for such
attacks.

Title: Improving Transaction Success Rate via Smart Gateway Selection in
  Cryptocurrency Payment Channel Networks
Authors: Suat Mercan, Enes Erdin, Kemal Akkaya
Categories: cs.CR cs.NI
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.00294
\\
  The last decade has experienced a vast interest in Blockchain-based
cryptocurrencies with a specific focus on the applications of this technology.
However, slow confirmation times of transactions and unforeseeable high fees
hamper their wide adoption for micro-payments. The idea of establishing payment
channel networks is one of the many proposed solutions to address this
scalability issue where nodes, by utilizing smart contracting, establish
payment channels between each other and perform off-chain transactions.
However, due to the way these channels are created, both sides have a certain
one-way capacity for making transactions. Consequently, if one sides exceeds
this one-way capacity, the channel becomes useless in that particular
direction, which causes failures of payments and eventually creates an
imbalance in the overall network. To keep the payment channel network
sustainable, in this paper, we aim to increase the overall success rate of
payments by effectively exploiting the fact that end-users are usually
connected to the network at multiple points (i.e., gateways) any of which can
be used to initiate the payment. We propose an efficient method for selection
of the gateway for a user by considering the gateway's inbound and outbound
payment traffic ratio. We then augment this proposed method with split payment
capability to further increase success rate especially for large transactions.
The evaluation of the proposed method shows that compared to greedy and
maxflow-based approaches, we can achieve much higher success rates, which are
further improved with split payments.

Title: Learning Object Permanence from Video
Authors: Aviv Shamsian, Ofri Kleinfeld, Amir Globerson, Gal Chechik
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Object Permanence allows people to reason about the location of non-visible
objects, by understanding that they continue to exist even when not perceived
directly. Object Permanence is critical for building a model of the world,
since objects in natural visual scenes dynamically occlude and contain
each-other. Intensive studies in developmental psychology suggest that object
permanence is a challenging task that is learned through extensive experience.
Here we introduce the setup of learning Object Permanence from data. We explain
why this learning problem should be dissected into four components, where
objects are (1) visible, (2) occluded, (3) contained by another object and (4)
carried by a containing object. The fourth subtask, where a target object is
carried by a containing object, is particularly challenging because it requires
a system to reason about a moving location of an invisible object. We then
present a unified deep architecture that learns to predict object location
under these four scenarios. We evaluate the architecture and system on a new
dataset based on CATER, and find that it outperforms previous localization
methods and various baselines.

Title: Label Noise Types and Their Effects on Deep Learning
Authors: G\"orkem Algan, \.Ilkay Ulusoy
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The recent success of deep learning is mostly due to the availability of big
datasets with clean annotations. However, gathering a cleanly annotated dataset
is not always feasible due to practical challenges. As a result, label noise is
a common problem in datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural
networks in the presence of noisy labels are proposed in the literature. These
methods commonly use benchmark datasets with synthetic label noise on the
training set. However, there are multiple types of label noise, and each of
them has its own characteristic impact on learning. Since each work generates a
different kind of label noise, it is problematic to test and compare those
algorithms in the literature fairly. In this work, we provide a detailed
analysis of the effects of different kinds of label noise on learning.
Moreover, we propose a generic framework to generate feature-dependent label
noise, which we show to be the most challenging case for learning. Our proposed
method aims to emphasize similarities among data instances by sparsely
distributing them in the feature domain. By this approach, samples that are
more likely to be mislabeled are detected from their softmax probabilities, and
their labels are flipped to the corresponding class. The proposed method can be
applied to any clean dataset to synthesize feature-dependent noisy labels. For
the ease of other researchers to test their algorithms with noisy labels, we
share corrupted labels for the most commonly used benchmark datasets. Our code
and generated noisy synthetic labels are available online.

Title: Distillating Knowledge from Graph Convolutional Networks
Authors: Yiding Yang, Jiayan Qiu, Mingli Song, Dacheng Tao, Xinchao Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Existing knowledge distillation methods focus on convolutional neural
networks~(CNNs), where the input samples like images lie in a grid domain, and
have largely overlooked graph convolutional networks~(GCN) that handle non-grid
data. In this paper, we propose to our best knowledge the first dedicated
approach to {distilling} knowledge from a pre-trained GCN model. To enable the
knowledge transfer from the teacher GCN to the student, we propose a local
structure preserving module that explicitly accounts for the topological
semantics of the teacher. In this module, the local structure information from
both the teacher and the student are extracted as distributions, and hence
minimizing the distance between these distributions enables topology-aware
knowledge transfer from the teacher, yielding a compact yet high-performance
student model. Moreover, the proposed approach is readily extendable to dynamic
graph models, where the input graphs for the teacher and the student may
differ. We evaluate the proposed method on two different datasets using GCN
models of different architectures, and demonstrate that our method achieves the
state-of-the-art knowledge distillation performance for GCN models.

  Although occlusion widely exists in nature and remains a fundamental
challenge for pose estimation, existing heatmap-based approaches suffer serious
degradation on occlusions. Their intrinsic problem is that they directly
localize the joints based on visual information; however, the invisible joints
are lack of that. In contrast to localization, our framework estimates the
invisible joints from an inference perspective by proposing an Image-Guided
Progressive GCN module which provides a comprehensive understanding of both
image context and pose structure. Moreover, existing benchmarks contain limited
occlusions for evaluation. Therefore, we thoroughly pursue this problem and
propose a novel OPEC-Net framework together with a new Occluded Pose (OCPose)
dataset with 9k annotated images. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that OPEC-Net achieves significant
improvements over recent leading works. Notably, our OCPose is the most complex
occlusion dataset with respect to average IoU between adjacent instances.
Source code and OCPose will be publicly available.

\\
  Optical character recognition (OCR) systems performance have improved
significantly in the deep learning era. This is especially true for handwritten
text recognition (HTR), where each author has a unique style, unlike printed
text, where the variation is smaller by design. That said, deep learning based
HTR is limited, as in every other task, by the number of training examples.
Gathering data is a challenging and costly task, and even more so, the labeling
task that follows, of which we focus here. One possible approach to reduce the
burden of data annotation is semi-supervised learning. Semi supervised methods
use, in addition to labeled data, some unlabeled samples to improve
performance, compared to fully supervised ones. Consequently, such methods may
adapt to unseen images during test time.
  We present ScrabbleGAN, a semi-supervised approach to synthesize handwritten
text images that are versatile both in style and lexicon. ScrabbleGAN relies on
a novel generative model which can generate images of words with an arbitrary
length. We show how to operate our approach in a semi-supervised manner,
enjoying the aforementioned benefits such as performance boost over state of
the art supervised HTR. Furthermore, our generator can manipulate the resulting
text style. This allows us to change, for instance, whether the text is
cursive, or how thin is the pen stroke.

  conference paper "Improved Search and Detection of Surface-to-Air Missile
  Sites Using Spatial Fusion of Component Object Detections from Deep Neural
  Networks"
\\
  Here we demonstrate how Deep Neural Network (DNN) detections of multiple
constitutive or component objects that are part of a larger, more complex, and
encompassing feature can be spatially fused to improve the search, detection,
and retrieval (ranking) of the larger complex feature. First, scores computed
from a spatial clustering algorithm are normalized to a reference space so that
they are independent of image resolution and DNN input chip size. Then,
multi-scale DNN detections from various component objects are fused to improve
the detection and retrieval of DNN detections of a larger complex feature. We
demonstrate the utility of this approach for broad area search and detection of
Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) sites that have a very low occurrence rate (only
16 sites) over a ~90,000 km^2 study area in SE China. The results demonstrate
that spatial fusion of multi-scale component-object DNN detections can reduce
the detection error rate of SAM Sites by $>$85% while still maintaining a 100%
recall. The novel spatial fusion approach demonstrated here can be easily
extended to a wide variety of other challenging object search and detection
problems in large-scale remote sensing image datasets.

Title: A Simple Fix for Convolutional Neural Network via Coordinate Embedding
Authors: Liliang Ren, Zhuonan Hao
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: 6 pages, 8 figures, Course Project for ECE271B
\\
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has been widely applied in the realm of
computer vision. However, given the fact that CNN models are translation
invariant, they are not aware of the coordinate information of each pixel. Thus
the generalization ability of CNN will be limited since the coordinate
information is crucial for a model to learn affine transformations which
directly operate on the coordinate of each pixel. In this project, we proposed
a simple approach to incorporate the coordinate information to the CNN model
through coordinate embedding. Our approach does not change the downstream model
architecture and can be easily applied to the pre-trained models for the task
like object detection. Our experiments on the German Traffic Sign Detection
Benchmark show that our approach not only significantly improve the model
performance but also have better robustness with respect to the affine
transformation.

\\
  Most people think that their handwriting is unique and cannot be imitated by
machines, especially not using completely new content. Current cursive
handwriting synthesis is visually limited or needs user interaction. We show
that subdividing the process into smaller subtasks makes it possible to imitate
someone's handwriting with a high chance to be visually indistinguishable for
humans. Therefore, a given handwritten sample will be used as the target style.
This sample is transferred to an online sequence. Then, a method for online
handwriting synthesis is used to produce a new realistic-looking text primed
with the online input sequence. This new text is then rendered and
style-adapted to the input pen. We show the effectiveness of the pipeline by
generating in- and out-of-vocabulary handwritten samples that are validated in
a comprehensive user study. Additionally, we show that also a typical writer
identification system can partially be fooled by the created fake handwritings.

  This work uses adversarial perturbations to enhance deepfake images and fool
common deepfake detectors. We created adversarial perturbations using the Fast
Gradient Sign Method and the Carlini and Wagner L2 norm attack in both blackbox
and whitebox settings. Detectors achieved over 95% accuracy on unperturbed
deepfakes, but less than 27% accuracy on perturbed deepfakes. We also explore
two improvements to deepfake detectors: (i) Lipschitz regularization, and (ii)
Deep Image Prior (DIP). Lipschitz regularization constrains the gradient of the
detector with respect to the input in order to increase robustness to input
perturbations. The DIP defense removes perturbations using generative
convolutional neural networks in an unsupervised manner. Regularization
improved the detection of perturbed deepfakes on average, including a 10%
accuracy boost in the blackbox case. The DIP defense achieved 95% accuracy on
perturbed deepfakes that fooled the original detector, while retaining 98%
accuracy in other cases on a 100 image subsample.

Title: Synergic Adversarial Label Learning with DR and AMD for Retinal Image
  Grading
Authors: Lie Ju, Xin Wang, Paul Bonnington, Zongyuan Ge
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The need for comprehensive and automated screening methods for retinal image
classification has long been recognized. Well-qualified doctors annotated
images are very expensive and only a limited amount of data is available for
various retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and
diabetic retinopathy (DR). Some studies show that AMD and DR share some common
features like hemorrhagic points and exudation but most classification
algorithms only train those disease models independently. Inspired by knowledge
distillation where additional monitoring signals from various sources is
beneficial to train a robust model with much fewer data. We propose a method
called synergic adversarial label learning (SALL) which leverages relevant
retinal disease labels in both semantic and feature space as additional signals
and train the model in a collaborative manner. Our experiments on DR and AMD
fundus image classification task demonstrate that the proposed method can
significantly improve the accuracy of the model for grading diseases. In
addition, we conduct additional experiments to show the effectiveness of SALL
from the aspects of reliability and interpretability in the context of medical
imaging application.

  Synthetic data has been a critical tool for training scene text detection and
recognition models. On the one hand, synthetic word images have proven to be a
successful substitute for real images in training scene text recognizers. On
the other hand, however, scene text detectors still heavily rely on a large
amount of manually annotated real-world images, which are expensive. In this
paper, we introduce UnrealText, an efficient image synthesis method that
renders realistic images via a 3D graphics engine. 3D synthetic engine provides
realistic appearance by rendering scene and text as a whole, and allows for
better text region proposals with access to precise scene information, e.g.
normal and even object meshes. The comprehensive experiments verify its
effectiveness on both scene text detection and recognition. We also generate a

  Temporal camera relocalization estimates the pose with respect to each video
frame in sequence, as opposed to one-shot relocalization which focuses on a
still image. Even though the time dependency has been taken into account,
current temporal relocalization methods still generally underperform the
state-of-the-art one-shot approaches in terms of accuracy. In this work, we
improve the temporal relocalization method by using a network architecture that
incorporates Kalman filtering (KFNet) for online camera relocalization. In
particular, KFNet extends the scene coordinate regression problem to the time
domain in order to recursively establish 2D and 3D correspondences for the pose
determination. The network architecture design and the loss formulation are
based on Kalman filtering in the context of Bayesian learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple relocalization benchmarks demonstrate the high accuracy
of KFNet at the top of both one-shot and temporal relocalization approaches.

Title: Gen-LaneNet: A Generalized and Scalable Approach for 3D Lane Detection
Authors: Yuliang Guo, Guang Chen, Peitao Zhao, Weide Zhang, Jinghao Miao,
  Jingao Wang and Tae Eun Choe
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present a generalized and scalable method, called Gen-LaneNet, to detect
3D lanes from a single image. The method, inspired by the latest
state-of-the-art 3D-LaneNet, is a unified framework solving image encoding,
spatial transform of features and 3D lane prediction in a single network.
However, we propose unique designs for Gen-LaneNet in two folds. First, we
introduce a new geometry-guided lane anchor representation in a new coordinate
frame and apply a specific geometric transformation to directly calculate real
3D lane points from the network output. We demonstrate that aligning the lane
points with the underlying top-view features in the new coordinate frame is
critical towards a generalized method in handling unfamiliar scenes. Second, we
present a scalable two-stage framework that decouples the learning of image
segmentation subnetwork and geometry encoding subnetwork. Compared to
3D-LaneNet, the proposed Gen-LaneNet drastically reduces the amount of 3D lane
labels required to achieve a robust solution in real-world application.
Moreover, we release a new synthetic dataset and its construction strategy to
encourage the development and evaluation of 3D lane detection methods. In
experiments, we conduct extensive ablation study to substantiate the proposed
Gen-LaneNet significantly outperforms 3D-LaneNet in average precision(AP) and
F-score.

  Over the past few years, state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms are
based on deep convolutional neural networks. To render a deep network with the
ability to understand a concept, humans need to collect a large amount of
pixel-level annotated data to train the models, which is time-consuming and
tedious. Recently, few-shot segmentation is proposed to solve this problem.
Few-shot segmentation aims to learn a segmentation model that can be
generalized to novel classes with only a few training images. In this paper, we
propose a cross-reference network (CRNet) for few-shot segmentation. Unlike
previous works which only predict the mask in the query image, our proposed
model concurrently make predictions for both the support image and the query
image. With a cross-reference mechanism, our network can better find the
co-occurrent objects in the two images, thus helping the few-shot segmentation
task. We also develop a mask refinement module to recurrently refine the
prediction of the foreground regions. For the $k$-shot learning, we propose to
finetune parts of networks to take advantage of multiple labeled support
images. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset show that our network
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Modeling Cross-view Interaction Consistency for Paired Egocentric
  Interaction Recognition
Authors: Zhongguo Li, Fan Lyu, Wei Feng, Song Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICME2020
\\
  With the development of Augmented Reality (AR), egocentric action recognition
(EAR) plays important role in accurately understanding demands from the user.
However, EAR is designed to help recognize human-machine interaction in single
egocentric view, thus difficult to capture interactions between two
face-to-face AR users. Paired egocentric interaction recognition (PEIR) is the
task to collaboratively recognize the interactions between two persons with the
videos in their corresponding views. Unfortunately, existing PEIR methods
always directly use linear decision function to fuse the features extracted
from two corresponding egocentric videos, which ignore consistency of
interaction in paired egocentric videos. The consistency of interactions in
paired videos, and features extracted from them are correlated to each other.
On top of that, we propose to build the relevance between two views using
biliear pooling, which capture the consistency of two views in feature-level.
Specifically, each neuron in the feature maps from one view connects to the
neurons from another view, which guarantee the compact consistency between two
views. Then all possible paired neurons are used for PEIR for the inside
consistent information of them. To be efficient, we use compact bilinear
pooling with Count Sketch to avoid directly computing outer product in
bilinear. Experimental results on dataset PEV shows the superiority of the
proposed methods on the task PEIR.

Title: On Localizing a Camera from a Single Image
Authors: Pradipta Ghosh, Xiaochen Liu, Hang Qiu, Marcos A. M. Vieira, Gaurav S.

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Public cameras often have limited metadata describing their attributes. A key
missing attribute is the precise location of the camera, using which it is
possible to precisely pinpoint the location of events seen in the camera. In
this paper, we explore the following question: under what conditions is it
possible to estimate the location of a camera from a single image taken by the
camera? We show that, using a judicious combination of projective geometry,
neural networks, and crowd-sourced annotations from human workers, it is
possible to position 95% of the images in our test data set to within 12 m.
This performance is two orders of magnitude better than PoseNet, a
state-of-the-art neural network that, when trained on a large corpus of images
in an area, can estimate the pose of a single image. Finally, we show that the
camera's inferred position and intrinsic parameters can help design a number of
virtual sensors, all of which are reasonably accurate.

Title: Real-time 3D object proposal generation and classification under limited

Authors: Xuesong Li, Jose Guivant, Subhan Khan
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  The task of detecting 3D objects is important to various robotic
applications. The existing deep learning-based detection techniques have
achieved impressive performance. However, these techniques are limited to run
with a graphics processing unit (GPU) in a real-time environment. To achieve
real-time 3D object detection with limited computational resources for robots,
we propose an efficient detection method consisting of 3D proposal generation
and classification. The proposal generation is mainly based on point
segmentation, while the proposal classification is performed by a lightweight
convolution neural network (CNN) model. To validate our method, KITTI datasets
are utilized. The experimental results demonstrate the capability of proposed
real-time 3D object detection method from the point cloud with a competitive
performance of object recall and classification.

Title: Deep Line Art Video Colorization with a Few References
Authors: Min Shi, Jia-Qi Zhang, Shu-Yu Chen, Lin Gao, Yu-Kun Lai, Fang-Lue
  Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Coloring line art images based on the colors of reference images is an
important stage in animation production, which is time-consuming and tedious.
In this paper, we propose a deep architecture to automatically color line art
videos with the same color style as the given reference images. Our framework
consists of a color transform network and a temporal constraint network. The
color transform network takes the target line art images as well as the line
art and color images of one or more reference images as input, and generates
corresponding target color images. To cope with larger differences between the
target line art image and reference color images, our architecture utilizes
non-local similarity matching to determine the region correspondences between
the target image and the reference images, which are used to transform the
local color information from the references to the target. To ensure global
color style consistency, we further incorporate Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) with the transformation parameters obtained from a style embedding
vector that describes the global color style of the references, extracted by an
embedder. The temporal constraint network takes the reference images and the
target image together in chronological order, and learns the spatiotemporal
features through 3D convolution to ensure the temporal consistency of the
target image and the reference image. Our model can achieve even better
coloring results by fine-tuning the parameters with only a small amount of
samples when dealing with an animation of a new style. To evaluate our method,
we build a line art coloring dataset. Experiments show that our method achieves
the best performance on line art video coloring compared to the
state-of-the-art methods and other baselines.

Title: Dynamic Hierarchical Mimicking Towards Consistent Optimization
  Objectives
Authors: Duo Li and Qifeng Chen

\\
  While the depth of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) surpasses that
of the pioneering networks with a significant margin, the traditional way of
appending supervision only over the final classifier and progressively
propagating gradient flow upstream remains the training mainstay. Seminal
Deeply-Supervised Networks (DSN) were proposed to alleviate the difficulty of
optimization arising from gradient flow through a long chain. However, it is
still vulnerable to issues including interference to the hierarchical
representation generation process and inconsistent optimization objectives, as
illustrated theoretically and empirically in this paper. Complementary to
previous training strategies, we propose Dynamic Hierarchical Mimicking, a
generic feature learning mechanism, to advance CNN training with enhanced
generalization ability. Partially inspired by DSN, we fork delicately designed
side branches from the intermediate layers of a given neural network. Each
branch can emerge from certain locations of the main branch dynamically, which
not only retains representation rooted in the backbone network but also
generates more diverse representations along its own pathway. We go one step
further to promote multi-level interactions among different branches through an
optimization formula with probabilistic prediction matching losses, thus
guaranteeing a more robust optimization process and better representation
ability. Experiments on both category and instance recognition tasks
demonstrate the substantial improvements of our proposed method over its
corresponding counterparts using diverse state-of-the-art CNN architectures.

Title: Scalable learning for bridging the species gap in image-based plant
  phenotyping
Authors: Daniel Ward, Peyman Moghadam
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Under review. Abstract modified to meed arXiv requirements. Dataset
  available at: https://danielcward.github.io/UPGen/
\\
  The traditional paradigm of applying deep learning -- collect, annotate and
train on data -- is not applicable to image-based plant phenotyping as almost
400,000 different plant species exists. Data costs include growing physical
samples, imaging and labelling them. Model performance is impacted by the
species gap between the domain of each plant species, it is not generalisable
and may not transfer to unseen plant species. In this paper, we investigate the
use of synthetic data for leaf instance segmentation. We study multiple
synthetic data training regimes using Mask-RCNN when few or no annotated real
data is available. We also present UPGen: a Universal Plant Generator for
bridging the species gap. UPGen leverages domain randomisation to produce
widely distributed data samples and models stochastic biological variation. Our
methods outperform standard practices, such as transfer learning from publicly
available plant data, by 26.6% and 51.46% on two unseen plant species
respectively. We benchmark UPGen by competing in the CVPPP Leaf Segmentation
Challenge and set a new state-of-the-art, a mean of 88% across A1-4 test
datasets. This study is applicable to use of synthetic data for automating the
measurement of phenotypic traits. Our synthetic dataset and pretrained model
are available at https://danielcward.github.io/UPGen/.

Title: FADNet: A Fast and Accurate Network for Disparity Estimation
Authors: Qiang Wang, Shaohuai Shi, Shizhen Zheng, Kaiyong Zhao, Xiaowen Chu
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in the area of
computer vision. The disparity estimation problem tends to be addressed by DNNs
which achieve much better prediction accuracy in stereo matching than
traditional hand-crafted feature based methods. On one hand, however, the
designed DNNs require significant memory and computation resources to
accurately predict the disparity, especially for those 3D convolution based
networks, which makes it difficult for deployment in real-time applications. On
the other hand, existing computation-efficient networks lack expression
capability in large-scale datasets so that they cannot make an accurate
prediction in many scenarios. To this end, we propose an efficient and accurate
deep network for disparity estimation named FADNet with three main features: 1)
It exploits efficient 2D based correlation layers with stacked blocks to
preserve fast computation; 2) It combines the residual structures to make the
deeper model easier to learn; 3) It contains multi-scale predictions so as to
exploit a multi-scale weight scheduling training technique to improve the
accuracy. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of FADNet on
two popular datasets, Scene Flow and KITTI 2015. Experimental results show that
FADNet achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, and runs at a significant
order of magnitude faster speed than existing 3D models. The codes of FADNet
are available at https://github.com/HKBU-HPML/FADNet.

Title: Two-Step Surface Damage Detection Scheme using Convolutional Neural
  Network and Artificial Neural Neural
Authors: Alice Yi Yang and Ling Cheng
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Surface damage on concrete is important as the damage can affect the
structural integrity of the structure. This paper proposes a two-step surface
damage detection scheme using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Artificial
Neural Network (ANN). The CNN classifies given input images into two
categories: positive and negative. The positive category is where the surface
damage is present within the image, otherwise the image is classified as
negative. This is an image-based classification. The ANN accepts image inputs
that have been classified as positive by the ANN. This reduces the number of
images that are further processed by the ANN. The ANN performs feature-based
classification, in which the features are extracted from the detected edges
within the image. The edges are detected using Canny edge detection. A total of
19 features are extracted from the detected edges. These features are inputs
into the ANN. The purpose of the ANN is to highlight only the positive damaged
edges within the image. The CNN achieves an accuracy of 80.7% for image
classification and the ANN achieves an accuracy of 98.1% for surface detection.
The decreased accuracy in the CNN is due to the false positive detection,
however false positives are tolerated whereas false negatives are not. The
false negative detection for both CNN and ANN in the two-step scheme are 0%.

Title: Rethinking Class-Balanced Methods for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition
  from a Domain Adaptation Perspective
Authors: Muhammad Abdullah Jamal and Matthew Brown and Ming-Hsuan Yang and
  Liqiang Wang and Boqing Gong
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted for publication at CVPR2020
\\
  Object frequency in the real world often follows a power law, leading to a
mismatch between datasets with long-tailed class distributions seen by a
machine learning model and our expectation of the model to perform well on all
classes. We analyze this mismatch from a domain adaptation point of view. First
of all, we connect existing class-balanced methods for long-tailed
classification to target shift, a well-studied scenario in domain adaptation.
The connection reveals that these methods implicitly assume that the training
data and test data share the same class-conditioned distribution, which does
not hold in general and especially for the tail classes. While a head class
could contain abundant and diverse training examples that well represent the
expected data at inference time, the tail classes are often short of
representative training data. To this end, we propose to augment the classic
class-balanced learning by explicitly estimating the differences between the
class-conditioned distributions with a meta-learning approach. We validate our
approach with six benchmark datasets and three loss functions.

\\
  In recent years, large "in the wild" face datasets have been released in an
attempt to facilitate progress in tasks such as face detection, face
recognition, and other tasks. Most of these datasets are acquired from webpages
with automatic procedures. As a consequence, noisy data are often found.
Furthermore, in these large face datasets, the annotation of identities is
important as they are used for training face recognition algorithms. But due to
the automatic way of gathering these datasets and due to their large size, many
identities folder contain mislabeled samples which deteriorates the quality of
the datasets. In this work, it is presented a semi-automatic method for
cleaning the noisy large face datasets with the use of face recognition. This
methodology is applied to clean the CelebA dataset and show its effectiveness.
Furthermore, the list with the mislabelled samples in the CelebA dataset is
made available.

Title: Toward Accurate and Realistic Virtual Try-on Through Shape Matching and
  Multiple Warps
Authors: Kedan Li, Min Jin Chong, Jingen Liu, David Forsyth
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  A virtual try-on method takes a product image and an image of a model and
produces an image of the model wearing the product. Most methods essentially
compute warps from the product image to the model image and combine using image
generation methods. However, obtaining a realistic image is challenging because
the kinematics of garments is complex and because outline, texture, and shading
cues in the image reveal errors to human viewers. The garment must have
appropriate drapes; texture must be warped to be consistent with the shape of a
draped garment; small details (buttons, collars, lapels, pockets, etc.) must be
placed appropriately on the garment, and so on. Evaluation is particularly
difficult and is usually qualitative.
  This paper uses quantitative evaluation on a challenging, novel dataset to
demonstrate that (a) for any warping method, one can choose target models
automatically to improve results, and (b) learning multiple coordinated
specialized warpers offers further improvements on results. Target models are
chosen by a learned embedding procedure that predicts a representation of the
products the model is wearing. This prediction is used to match products to
models. Specialized warpers are trained by a method that encourages a second
warper to perform well in locations where the first works poorly. The warps are
then combined using a U-Net. Qualitative evaluation confirms that these
improvements are wholesale over outline, texture shading, and garment details.

weights act as a soft selection for the neighborhood of surface points thus
avoiding the scale selection required of previous methods. To train the network

estimation. The method enables extracting normal vectors and other geometrical
properties, such as principal curvatures, the latter were not presented as
ground truth during training. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a

\\
  Generating realistic palmprint (more generally biometric) images has always
been an interesting and, at the same time, challenging problem. Classical
statistical models fail to generate realistic-looking palmprint images, as they
are not powerful enough to capture the complicated texture representation of
palmprint images. In this work, we present a deep learning framework based on
generative adversarial networks (GAN), which is able to generate realistic
palmprint images. To help the model learn more realistic images, we proposed to
add a suitable regularization to the loss function, which imposes the line
connectivity of generated palmprint images. This is very desirable for
palmprints, as the principal lines in palm are usually connected. We apply this
framework to a popular palmprint databases, and generate images which look very
realistic, and similar to the samples in this database. Through experimental
results, we show that the generated palmprint images look very realistic, have
a good diversity, and are able to capture different parts of the prior
distribution. We also report the Frechet Inception distance (FID) of the
proposed model, and show that our model is able to achieve really good
quantitative performance in terms of FID score.

  In this paper, we present a deep learning-based image processing technique
for extraction of bone structures in chest radiographs using a U-Net FCNN. The
U-Net was trained to accomplish the task in a fully supervised setting. To
create the training image pairs, we employed simulated X-Ray or Digitally
Reconstructed Radiographs (DRR), derived from 664 CT scans belonging to the
LIDC-IDRI dataset. Using HU based segmentation of bone structures in the CT
domain, a synthetic 2D "Bone x-ray" DRR is produced and used for training the
network. For the reconstruction loss, we utilize two loss functions- L1 Loss
and perceptual loss. Once the bone structures are extracted, the original image
can be enhanced by fusing the original input x-ray and the synthesized "Bone
X-ray". We show that our enhancement technique is applicable to real x-ray
data, and display our results on the NIH Chest X-Ray-14 dataset.

  In minimal invasive surgery, it is important to rebuild and visualize the
latest deformed shape of soft-tissue surfaces to mitigate tissue damages. This
paper proposes an innovative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
algorithm for deformable dense reconstruction of surfaces using a sequence of
images from a stereoscope. We introduce a warping field based on the Embedded
Deformation (ED) nodes with 3D shapes recovered from consecutive pairs of
stereo images. The warping field is estimated by deforming the last updated
model to the current live model. Our SLAM system can: (1) Incrementally build a
live model by progressively fusing new observations with vivid accurate
texture. (2) Estimate the deformed shape of unobserved region with the
principle As-Rigid-As-Possible. (3) Show the consecutive shape of models. (4)
Estimate the current relative pose between the soft-tissue and the scope.
In-vivo experiments with publicly available datasets demonstrate that the 3D
models can be incrementally built for different soft-tissues with different
deformations from sequences of stereo images obtained by laparoscopes. Results
show the potential clinical application of our SLAM system for providing
surgeon useful shape and texture information in minimal invasive surgery.

Title: EllipBody: A Light-weight and Part-based Representation for Human Pose
  and Shape Recovery
Authors: Min Wang, Feng Qiu, Wentao Liu, Chen Qian, Xiaowei Zhou, Lizhuang Ma
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Human pose and shape recovery is an important task in computer vision and
real-world understanding. Current works are tackled due to the lack of 3D
annotations for whole body shapes. We find that part segmentation is a very
efficient 2D annotation in 3D human body recovery. It not only indicates the
location of each part but also contains 3D information through occlusions from
the shape of parts, as indicated in Figure 1. To better utilize 3D information
contained in part segmentation, we propose a part-level differentiable renderer
which model occlusion between parts explicitly. It enhances the performance in
both learning-based and optimization-based methods. To further improve the
efficiency of the task, we propose a light-weight body model called EllipBody,
which uses ellipsoids to indicate each body part. Together with SMPL, the
relationship between forward time, performance and number of faces in body
models are analyzed. A small number of faces is chosen for achieving good
performance and efficiency at the same time. Extensive experiments show that
our methods achieve the state-of-the-art results on Human3.6M and LSP dataset
for 3D pose estimation and part segmentation.

Title: Do We Need Depth in State-Of-The-Art Face Authentication?
Authors: Amir Livne, Alex Bronstein, Ron Kimmel, Ziv Aviv, Shahaf Grofit
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Some face recognition methods are designed to utilize geometric features
extracted from depth sensors to handle the challenges of single-image based
recognition technologies. However, calculating the geometrical data is an
expensive and challenging process. Here, we introduce a novel method that
learns distinctive geometric features from stereo camera systems without the
need to explicitly compute the facial surface or depth map. The raw face stereo
images along with coordinate maps allow a CNN to learn geometric features. This
way, we keep the simplicity and cost efficiency of recognition from a single
image, while enjoying the benefits of geometric data without explicitly
reconstructing it. We demonstrate that the suggested method outperforms both
existing single-image and explicit depth based methods on large-scale
benchmarks. We also provide an ablation study to show that the suggested method
uses the coordinate maps to encode more informative features.

  Consecutive frames in a video are highly redundant. Therefore, to perform the
task of video object detection, executing single frame detectors on every frame
without reusing any information is quite wasteful. It is with this idea in mind
that we propose RN-VID, a novel approach to video object detection. Our
contributions are twofold. First, we propose a new architecture that allows the

propose a novel module to merge feature maps of same dimensions using
re-ordering of channels and 1 x 1 convolutions. We then demonstrate that RN-VID
achieves better mAP than corresponding single frame detectors with little
additional cost during inference.

Title: Learning Compact Reward for Image Captioning
Authors: Nannan Li, Zhenzhong Chen
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
Comments: 13 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Adversarial learning has shown its advances in generating natural and diverse
descriptions in image captioning. However, the learned reward of existing
adversarial methods is vague and ill-defined due to the reward ambiguity
problem. In this paper, we propose a refined Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (rAIRL) method to handle the reward ambiguity problem by disentangling
reward for each word in a sentence, as well as achieve stable adversarial
training by refining the loss function to shift the generator towards Nash
equilibrium. In addition, we introduce a conditional term in the loss function
to mitigate mode collapse and to increase the diversity of the generated
descriptions. Our experiments on MS COCO and Flickr30K show that our method can
learn compact reward for image captioning.

Title: MaskFlownet: Asymmetric Feature Matching with Learnable Occlusion Mask
Authors: Shengyu Zhao, Yilun Sheng, Yue Dong, Eric I-Chao Chang, Yan Xu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR 2020 (Oral)
\\
  Feature warping is a core technique in optical flow estimation; however, the
ambiguity caused by occluded areas during warping is a major problem that
remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose an asymmetric occlusion-aware
feature matching module, which can learn a rough occlusion mask that filters
useless (occluded) areas immediately after feature warping without any explicit
supervision. The proposed module can be easily integrated into end-to-end
network architectures and enjoys performance gains while introducing negligible
computational cost. The learned occlusion mask can be further fed into a
subsequent network cascade with dual feature pyramids with which we achieve
state-of-the-art performance. At the time of submission, our method, called
MaskFlownet, surpasses all published optical flow methods on the MPI Sintel,
KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks. Code is available at

Title: Exploiting Event Cameras by Using a Network Grafting Algorithm
Authors: Yuhuang Hu and Tobi Delbruck and Shih-Chii Liu
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Novel vision sensors such as event cameras provide information that is not
available from conventional intensity cameras. An obstacle to using these
sensors with current powerful deep neural networks is the lack of large labeled
training datasets. This paper proposes a Network Grafting Algorithm (NGA),
where a new front end network driven by unconventional visual inputs replaces
the front end network of a pretrained deep network that processes intensity
frames. The self-supervised training uses only synchronously-recorded intensity
frames and novel sensor data to maximize feature similarity between the
pretrained network and the grafted network. We show that the enhanced grafted
network reaches comparable average precision (AP$_{50}$) scores to the
pretrained network on an object detection task using an event camera dataset,
with no increase in inference costs. The grafted front end has only 5--8% of
the total parameters and can be trained in a few hours on a single GPU
equivalent to 5% of the time that would be needed to train the entire object
detector from labeled data. NGA allows these new vision sensors to capitalize
on previously pretrained powerful deep models, saving on training cost.

Title: Deep Local Shapes: Learning Local SDF Priors for Detailed 3D
  Reconstruction
Authors: Rohan Chabra, Jan Eric Lenssen, Eddy Ilg, Tanner Schmidt, Julian
  Straub, Steven Lovegrove, Richard Newcombe
Categories: cs.CV cs.CG cs.LG
\\
  Efficiently reconstructing complex and intricate surfaces at scale is a
long-standing goal in machine perception. To address this problem we introduce
Deep Local Shapes (DeepLS), a deep shape representation that enables encoding
and reconstruction of high-quality 3D shapes without prohibitive memory
requirements. DeepLS replaces the dense volumetric signed distance function
(SDF) representation used in traditional surface reconstruction systems with a
set of locally learned continuous SDFs defined by a neural network, inspired by
recent work such as DeepSDF. Unlike DeepSDF, which represents an object-level
SDF with a neural network and a single latent code, we store a grid of
independent latent codes, each responsible for storing information about
surfaces in a small local neighborhood. This decomposition of scenes into local
shapes simplifies the prior distribution that the network must learn, and also
enables efficient inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization power of DeepLS by showing object shape encoding and
reconstructions of full scenes, where DeepLS delivers high compression,
accuracy, and local shape completion.

  Rain streaks in the air appear in various blurring degrees and resolutions
due to different distances from their positions to the camera. Similar rain
patterns are visible in a rain image as well as its multi-scale (or
multi-resolution) versions, which makes it possible to exploit such
complementary information for rain streak representation. In this work, we
explore the multi-scale collaborative representation for rain streaks from the
perspective of input image scales and hierarchical deep features in a unified
framework, termed multi-scale progressive fusion network (MSPFN) for single
image rain streak removal. For similar rain streaks at different positions, we
employ recurrent calculation to capture the global texture, thus allowing to
explore the complementary and redundant information at the spatial dimension to
characterize target rain streaks. Besides, we construct multi-scale pyramid
structure, and further introduce the attention mechanism to guide the fine
fusion of this correlated information from different scales. This multi-scale
progressive fusion strategy not only promotes the cooperative representation,
but also boosts the end-to-end training. Our proposed method is extensively
evaluated on several benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results.
Moreover, we conduct experiments on joint deraining, detection, and
segmentation tasks, and inspire a new research direction of vision task-driven
image deraining. The source code is available at

Title: Generalizing Spatial Transformers to Projective Geometry with
  Applications to 2D/3D Registration
Authors: Cong Gao, Xingtong Liu, Wenhao Gu, Benjamin Killeen, Mehran Armand,
  Russell Taylor and Mathias Unberath
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Differentiable rendering is a technique to connect 3D scenes with
corresponding 2D images. Since it is differentiable, processes during image
formation can be learned. Previous approaches to differentiable rendering focus
on mesh-based representations of 3D scenes, which is inappropriate for medical
applications where volumetric, voxelized models are used to represent anatomy.
We propose a novel Projective Spatial Transformer module that generalizes
spatial transformers to projective geometry, thus enabling differentiable
volume rendering. We demonstrate the usefulness of this architecture on the
example of 2D/3D registration between radiographs and CT scans. Specifically,
we show that our transformer enables end-to-end learning of an image processing
and projection model that approximates an image similarity function that is
convex with respect to the pose parameters, and can thus be optimized
effectively using conventional gradient descent. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time that spatial transformers have been described for
projective geometry. The source code will be made public upon publication of
this manuscript and we hope that our developments will benefit related 3D
research applications.

Title: Know Your Surroundings: Exploiting Scene Information for Object Tracking
Authors: Goutam Bhat, Martin Danelljan, Luc Van Gool, Radu Timofte
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Current state-of-the-art trackers only rely on a target appearance model in
order to localize the object in each frame. Such approaches are however prone
to fail in case of e.g. fast appearance changes or presence of distractor
objects, where a target appearance model alone is insufficient for robust
tracking. Having the knowledge about the presence and locations of other
objects in the surrounding scene can be highly beneficial in such cases. This
scene information can be propagated through the sequence and used to, for
instance, explicitly avoid distractor objects and eliminate target candidate
regions.
  In this work, we propose a novel tracking architecture which can utilize
scene information for tracking. Our tracker represents such information as
dense localized state vectors, which can encode, for example, if the local
region is target, background, or distractor. These state vectors are propagated
through the sequence and combined with the appearance model output to localize
the target. Our network is learned to effectively utilize the scene information
by directly maximizing tracking performance on video segments. The proposed
approach sets a new state-of-the-art on 3 tracking benchmarks, achieving an AO
score of 63.6% on the recent GOT-10k dataset.

\\
  Lack of interactions and engagement among different welfare organizations,
donors, and the general public severely limits opportunities that welfare
organizations create for street children in third-world countries. Developing a
digital hub can eliminate barriers by integrating people across all groups.
However, in doing so, critical human factor challenges need to be overcome.
Accordingly, in this study conducted over a couple of years, we design and
develop a digital hub deployed to serve children living on the streets in
Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh (an excellent candidate to represent life in
highly populated cities in a third-world country). Here, we - a) conduct
face-to-face interviews with members of representative welfare organizations to
identify fundamental human-centric challenges; b) design a digital hub that
provides an effective interface for pairing welfare organizations, donors, and
the general public; c) enable different organizations to use our system
24$\times$7, and report results; and d) present critical human-computing
issues, more challenges, theoretical advancement, and potential scopes for
future work in this realm with broad applicability.

Title: Crowdsourced Smartphone Sensing for Localization in Metro Trains
Authors: Haibo Ye, Tao Gu, Xianping Tao, Jian Lu
Categories: cs.CY
\\
  Traditional fingerprint based localization techniques mainly rely on
infrastructure support such as RFID, Wi-Fi or GPS. They operate by war-driving
the entire space which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this
paper, we present MLoc, a novel infrastructure-free localization system to
locate mobile users in a metro line. It does not rely on any Wi-Fi
infrastructure, and does not need to war-drive the metro line. Leveraging
crowdsourcing, we collect accelerometer,magnetometer and barometer readings on
smartphones, and analyze these sensor data to extract patterns. Through
advanced data manipulating techniques, we build the pattern map for the entire
metro line, which can then be used for localization. We conduct field studies
to demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and robustness of M-Loc. The results
of our field studies in 3 metro lines with 55 stations show that M-Loc achieves
an accuracy of 93% when travelling 3 stations, 98% when travelling 5 stations.

  Stanford Medicine is building a new data platform for our academic research
community to do better clinical data science. Hospitals have a large amount of
patient data and researchers have demonstrated the ability to reuse that data
and AI approaches to derive novel insights, support patient care, and improve
care quality. However, the traditional data warehouse and Honest Broker
approaches that are in current use, are not scalable. We are establishing a new
secure Big Data platform that aims to reduce time to access and analyze data.
In this platform, data is anonymized to preserve patient data privacy and made
available preparatory to Institutional Review Board (IRB) submission.
Furthermore, the data is standardized such that analysis done at Stanford can
be replicated elsewhere using the same analytical code and clinical concepts.
Finally, the analytics data warehouse integrates with a secure data science
computational facility to support large scale data analytics. The ecosystem is
designed to bring the modern data science community to highly sensitive
clinical data in a secure and collaborative big data analytics environment with
a goal to enable bigger, better and faster science.

Title: Prob2Vec: Mathematical Semantic Embedding for Problem Retrieval in
  Adaptive Tutoring
Authors: Du Su, Ali Yekkehkhany, Yi Lu, Wenmiao Lu
Categories: cs.CY cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose a new application of embedding techniques for problem retrieval in
adaptive tutoring. The objective is to retrieve problems whose mathematical
concepts are similar. There are two challenges: First, like sentences, problems
helpful to tutoring are never exactly the same in terms of the underlying
concepts. Instead, good problems mix concepts in innovative ways, while still
displaying continuity in their relationships. Second, it is difficult for
humans to determine a similarity score that is consistent across a large enough
training set. We propose a hierarchical problem embedding algorithm, called
Prob2Vec, that consists of abstraction and embedding steps. Prob2Vec achieves
96.88\% accuracy on a problem similarity test, in contrast to 75\% from
directly applying state-of-the-art sentence embedding methods. It is
interesting that Prob2Vec is able to distinguish very fine-grained differences
among problems, an ability humans need time and effort to acquire. In addition,
the sub-problem of concept labeling with imbalanced training data set is
interesting in its own right. It is a multi-label problem suffering from
dimensionality explosion, which we propose ways to ameliorate. We propose the
novel negative pre-training algorithm that dramatically reduces false negative
and positive ratios for classification, using an imbalanced training data set.

Authors: Artur Strzelecki

\\
  The recent emergence of a new coronavirus, COVID-19, has gained extensive
coverage in public media and global news. As of 24 March 2020, the virus has
caused viral pneumonia in tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, China, and
thousands of cases in 184 other countries and territories. This study explores
the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor worldwide interest in this
COVID-19 epidemic. GT was chosen as a source of reverse engineering data, given
the interest in the topic. Current data on COVID-19 is retrieved from (GT)
using one main search topic: Coronavirus. Geographical settings for GT are
worldwide, China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. The reported period is 15
January 2020 to 24 March 2020. The results show that the highest worldwide peak
in the first wave of demand for information was on 31 January 2020. After the
first peak, the number of new cases reported daily rose for 6 days. A second
wave started on 21 February 2020 after the outbreaks were reported in Italy,
with the highest peak on 16 March 2020. The second wave is six times as big as
the first wave. The number of new cases reported daily is rising day by day.
This short communication gives a brief introduction to how the demand for
information on coronavirus epidemic is reported through GT.

Title: Elle: Inferring Isolation Anomalies from Experimental Observations
Authors: Kyle Kingsbury and Peter Alvaro
Categories: cs.DB cs.DC
ACM-class: H.2.4
\\
  Users who care about their data store it in databases, which (at least in
principle) guarantee some form of transactional isolation. However, experience
shows [Kleppmann 2019, Kingsbury and Patella 2019a] that many databases do not
provide the isolation guarantees they claim. With the recent proliferation of
new distributed databases, demand has grown for checkers that can, by
generating client workloads and injecting faults, produce anomalies that
witness a violation of a stated guarantee. An ideal checker would be sound (no
false positives), efficient (polynomial in history length and concurrency),
effective (finding violations in real databases), general (analyzing many
patterns of transactions), and informative (justifying the presence of an
anomaly with understandable counterexamples). Sadly, we are aware of no
checkers that satisfy these goals.
  We present Elle: a novel checker which infers an Adya-style dependency graph
between client-observed transactions. It does so by carefully selecting
database objects and operations when generating histories, so as to ensure that
the results of database reads reveal information about their version history.
Elle can detect every anomaly in Adya et al's formalism [Adya et al. 2000]
(except for predicates), discriminate between them, and provide concise
explanations of each. This paper makes the following contributions: we present
Elle, demonstrate its soundness, measure its efficiency against the current
state of the art, and give evidence of its effectiveness via a case study of
four real databases.

Title: SOL: Effortless Device Support for AI Frameworks without Source Code
  Changes
Authors: Nicolas Weber and Felipe Huici
Categories: cs.DC cs.LG
Comments: HPML Workshop 2020
\\
  Modern high performance computing clusters heavily rely on accelerators to
overcome the limited compute power of CPUs. These supercomputers run various
applications from different domains such as simulations, numerical applications
or artificial intelligence (AI). As a result, vendors need to be able to
efficiently run a wide variety of workloads on their hardware. In the AI domain
this is in particular exacerbated by the existence of a number of popular
frameworks (e.g, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) that have no common code base, and
can vary in functionality. The code of these frameworks evolves quickly, making
it expensive to keep up with all changes and potentially forcing developers to
go through constant rounds of upstreaming. In this paper we explore how to
provide hardware support in AI frameworks without changing the framework's
source code in order to minimize maintenance overhead. We introduce SOL, an AI
acceleration middleware that provides a hardware abstraction layer that allows
us to transparently support heterogeneous hardware. As a proof of concept, we
implemented SOL for PyTorch with three backends: CPUs, GPUs and vector
processors.

Title: ShadowTutor: Distributed Partial Distillation for Mobile Video DNN
  Inference
Authors: Jae-Won Chung, Jae-Yun Kim, Soo-Mook Moon
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Following the recent success of deep neural networks (DNN) on video computer
vision tasks, performing DNN inferences on videos that originate from mobile
devices has gained practical significance. As such, previous approaches
developed methods to offload DNN inference computations for images to cloud
servers to manage the resource constraints of mobile devices. However, when it
comes to video data, communicating information of every frame consumes
excessive network bandwidth and renders the entire system susceptible to
adverse network conditions such as congestion. Thus, in this work, we seek to
exploit the temporal coherence between nearby frames of a video stream to
mitigate network pressure. That is, we propose ShadowTutor, a distributed video
DNN inference framework that reduces the number of network transmissions
through intermittent knowledge distillation to a student model. Moreover, we
update only a subset of the student's parameters, which we call partial
distillation, to reduce the data size of each network transmission.
Specifically, the server runs a large and general teacher model, and the mobile
device only runs an extremely small but specialized student model. On sparsely
selected key frames, the server partially trains the student model by targeting
the teacher's response and sends the updated part to the mobile device. We
investigate the effectiveness of ShadowTutor with HD video semantic
segmentation. Evaluations show that network data transfer is reduced by 95% on
average. Moreover, the throughput of the system is improved by over three times
and shows robustness to changes in network bandwidth.

Title: How do academic topics shift across altmetric sources? A case study of

MSC-class: 97P70
DOI: 10.1007/s11192-020-03415-7
\\
  Taking the research area of Big Data as a case study, we propose an approach
for exploring how academic topics shift through the interactions among
audiences across different altmetric sources. Data used is obtained from Web of
Science (WoS) and Altmetric.com, with a focus on Blog, News, Policy, Wikipedia,
and Twitter. Author keywords from publications and terms from online events are
extracted as the main topics of the publications and the online discussion of
their audiences at Altmetric. Different measures are applied to determine the
(dis)similarities between the topics put forward by the publication authors and
those by the online audiences. Results show that overall there are substantial
differences between the two sets of topics around Big Data scientific research.
The main exception is Twitter, where high-frequency hashtags in tweets have a
stronger concordance with the author keywords in publications. Among the online
communities, Blogs and News show a strong similarity in the terms commonly
used, while Policy documents and Wikipedia articles exhibit the strongest
dissimilarity in considering and interpreting Big Data related research.
Specifically, the audiences not only focus on more easy-to-understand academic
topics related to social or general issues, but also extend them to a broader
range of topics in their online discussions. This study lays the foundations
for further investigations about the role of online audiences in the
transformation of academic topics across altmetric sources, and the degree of
concern and reception of scholarly contents by online communities.

Title: On the complexity of Broadcast Domination and Multipacking in digraphs
Authors: Florent Foucaud, Benjamin Gras, Anthony Perez, Florian Sikora
Categories: cs.DS cs.CC
Comments: Extended abstract accepted in IWOCA 2020
\\
  We study the complexity of the two dual covering and packing distance-based
problems Broadcast Domination and Multipacking in digraphs. A dominating
broadcast of a digraph $D$ is a function $f:V(D)\to\mathbb{N}$ such that for
each vertex $v$ of $D$, there exists a vertex $t$ with $f(t)>0$ having a
directed path to $v$ of length at most $f(t)$. The cost of $f$ is the sum of
$f(v)$ over all vertices $v$. A multipacking is a set $S$ of vertices of $D$
such that for each vertex $v$ of $D$ and for every integer $d$, there are at
most $d$ vertices from $S$ within directed distance at most $d$ from $v$. The
maximum size of a multipacking of $D$ is a lower bound to the minimum cost of a
dominating broadcast of $D$. Let Broadcast Domination denote the problem of
deciding whether a given digraph $D$ has a dominating broadcast of cost at most
$k$, and Multipacking the problem of deciding whether $D$ has a multipacking of
size at least $k$. It is known that Broadcast Domination is polynomial-time
solvable for the class of all undirected graphs (that is, symmetric digraphs),
while polynomial-time algorithms for Multipacking are known only for a few
classes of undirected graphs. We prove that Broadcast Domination and
Multipacking are both NP-complete for digraphs, even for planar layered acyclic
digraphs of small maximum degree. Moreover, when parameterized by the solution
cost/solution size, we show that the problems are W-hard. We also show that
Broadcast Domination is FPT on acyclic digraphs, and that it does not admit a
polynomial kernel for such inputs, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to
its third level. In addition, we show that both problems are FPT when
parameterized by the solution cost/solution size together with the maximum
out-degree, and as well, by the vertex cover number. Finally, we give for both

Title: Approximate Aggregate Queries Under Additive Inequalities
Authors: Mahmoud Abo-Khamis and Sungjin Im and Benjamin Moseley and Kirk Pruhs
  and Alireza Samadian
Categories: cs.DS cs.DB cs.LG
\\
  We consider the problem of evaluating an aggregation query, which is a
sum-of-sum query or a sum-of-product query, subject to additive inequalities.
Such aggregation queries, with a smallish number of additive inequalities,
arise naturally/commonly in many applications, particularly in machine learning
applications. We give a relatively complete categorization of the computational
complexity of such problems. We first show that the problem is NP-hard, even in
the case of one additive inequality. Thus we turn to approximating the query.
Our main result is an efficient algorithm for approximating, with arbitrarily
small relative error, many natural aggregation queries with one additive
inequality. We give examples of natural queries that can be efficiently solved
using this algorithm. In contrast we show that the situation with two additive
inequalities is quite different, by showing that it is NP-hard to evaluate
simple aggregation queries, with two additive inequalities, with any bounded
relative error. We end by considering the problem of computing the gradient of
the objective function in the Support Vector Machines (SVM) problem, a
canonical machine learning problem. While computing the gradient for SVM can be
reduced to the problem of computing an aggregation query with one additive
inequality, our algorithm is not applicable due to what we call the
``subtraction problem''. However, we show how to circumvent this subtraction
problem within the context of SVM to obtain a gradient-descent algorithm that
will result in an approximately correct optimal solution, using an alternative
notion of approximate correctness, which may be of independent interest.

Title: A Distributed Algorithm for Spectral Sparsification of Graphs with
  Applications to Data Clustering

\\
  Spectral sparsification is a technique that is used to reduce the number of
non-zero entries in a positive semidefinite matrix with little changes to its
spectrum. In particular, the main application of spectral sparsification is to
construct sparse graphs whose spectra are close to a given dense graph. We
study spectral sparsification under the assumption that the edges of a graph
are allocated among sites which can communicate among each other. In this work
we show that if a graph is allocated among several sites, the union of the
spectral sparsifiers of each induced subgraph give us an spectral sparsifier of
the original graph. In contrast to other works in the literature, we present
precise computations of the approximation factor of the union of spectral
sparsifiers and give an explicit calculation of the edge weights. Then we
present an application of this result to data clustering in the
Number-On-Forehead model of multiparty communication complexity when input data
is allocated as a sunflower among sites in the party.

Title: Parameterized Algorithms for Red-Blue Weighted Vertex Cover on Trees
Authors: Vishnu Veerathu and Yogesh Tripathi
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  \textproc{Weighted Vertex Cover} is a variation of an extensively studied
NP-complete problem, \textproc{Vertex Cover}, in which we are given a graph, $G
= (V,E,w)$, where function $w:V \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}^{+}$ and a parameter
$k$. The objective is to determine if there exists a vertex cover, $S$, such
that $\sum_{v \in S}w(v) \leq k$. In our work, we first study the hardness of
\textproc{Weighted Vertex Cover} and then examine this problem under
parameterization by $l$ and $k$, where $l$ is the number of vertices with
fractional weights. Then, we study the \textproc{Red-Blue Weighted Vertex
Cover} problem on trees in detail. In this problem, we are given a tree,
$T=(V,E,w)$, where function $w:V \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}^{+}$, a function $c:V
\rightarrow \{R,B\}$ and two parameters $k$ and $k_R$. We have to determine if
there exists a vertex cover, $S$, such that $\sum_{v \in S}w(v) \leq k$ and
$\sum_{\substack{v \in S\\ c(v) = R}}w(v) \leq k_R$. We tackle this problem by
applying different reduction techniques and meaningful parameterizations. We
also study some restrictive versions of this problem.

\\
  This study presents the design, fabrication, and test of a micro
accelerometer with intrinsic processing capabilities, that integrates the
functions of sensing and computing in the same MEMS. The device consists of an
inertial mass electrostatically coupled to an oscillating beam through a gap of
8 {\mu}m. The motion of the inertial mass modulates an AC electrostatic field
that drives the beam in its non-linear regime. This non-linearity is used to
implement machine learning in the mechanical domain, using reservoir computing
with delayed feedback to process the acceleration information provided by the
inertial mass. The device is microfabricated on a silicon-on-insulator
substrate using conventional MEMS processes. Dynamic characterization showed
good accelerometer functionalities, with an inertial mass sensitivity on the
order of 100 mV/g from 250 to 1300 Hz and a natural frequency of 1.7 kHz. In
order to test the device computing capabilities, two different machine learning
benchmarks were implemented, with the inputs fed to the device as
accelerations. The neuromorphic MEMS accelerometer was able to accurately
emulate non-linear autoregressive moving average models and compute the parity
of random bit streams. These results were obtained in a test system with a
non-trivial transfer function, showing a robustness that is well-suited to
anticipated applications.

Title: Memcomputing for Accelerated Optimization
Authors: John Aiken and Fabio L. Traversa
Categories: cs.ET cs.AR nlin.AO
\\
  In this work, we introduce the concept of an entirely new circuit
architecture based on the novel, physics-inspired computing paradigm:
Memcomputing. In particular, we focus on digital memcomputing machines (DMMs)
that can be designed leveraging properties of non-linear dynamical systems;
ultimate descriptors of electronic circuits. The working principle of these
systems relies on the ability of currents and voltages of the circuit to
self-organize in order to satisfy mathematical relations. In particular for
this work, we discuss self-organizing gates, namely Self-Organizing Algebraic
Gates (SOAGs), aimed to solve linear inequalities and therefore used to solve
optimization problems in Integer Linear Programming (ILP) format. Unlike
conventional I\O gates, SOAGs are terminal-agnostic, meaning each terminal
handles a superposition of input and output signals. When appropriately
assembled to represent a given ILP problem, the corresponding self-organizing
circuit converges to the equilibria that express the solutions to the problem
at hand. Because DMM's components are non-quantum, the ordinary differential
equations describing it can be efficiently simulated on our modern computers in
software, as well as be built in hardware with off-of-the-shelf technology. As
an example, we show the performance of this novel approach implemented as
Software as a Service (MemCPU XPC) to address an ILP problem. Compared to
today's best solution found using a world renowned commercial solver, MemCPU
XPC brings the time to solution down from 23 hours to less than 2 minutes.

  Equation to Networks of Binary ReRAM cells
Authors: V. J. Dowling, V. A. Slipko, and Y. V. Pershin
Categories: cs.ET cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci
\\
  The possibility of using non-deterministic circuit components has been
gaining significant attention in recent years. The modeling and simulation of
their circuits require novel approaches, as now the state of a circuit at an
arbitrary moment in time cannot be precisely predicted. Generally, these
circuits should be described in terms of probabilities, the circuit variables
should be calculated on average, and correlation functions should be used to
explore interrelations among the variables. In this paper we use, for the first
time, a master equation to analyze the networks composed of probabilistic
binary memristors. Analytical solutions of the master equation for the case of
identical memristors connected in-series and in-parallel are found. Our
analytical results are supplemented by results of numerical simulations that
extend our findings beyond the case of identical memristors. The approach
proposed in this paper facilitates the development of probabilistic/stochastic
electronic circuits and advance their real-world applications.

Title: Pose to Seat: Automated Design of Body-Supporting Surfaces
Authors: Kurt Leimer, Andreas Winkler, Stefan Ohrhallinger, Przemyslaw
  Musialski
Categories: cs.GR
Comments: 14 pages, 15 figures
\\
  The design of functional seating furniture is a complicated process which
often requires extensive manual design effort and empirical evaluation. We
propose a computational design framework for pose-driven automated generation
of body-supports which are optimized for comfort of sitting. Given a human body
in a specified pose as input, our method computes an approximate pressure
distribution that also takes frictional forces and body torques into
consideration which serves as an objective measure of comfort. Utilizing this
information to find out where the body needs to be supported in order to
maintain comfort of sitting, our algorithm can create a supporting mesh suited
for a person in that specific pose. This is done in an automated fitting
process, using a template model capable of supporting a large variety of
sitting poses. The results can be used directly or can be considered as a
starting point for further interactive design.

  In this paper alternative method for real-time 3D model rasterization is
given. Surfaces are drawn in perspective-map space which acts as a virtual
camera lens. It can render single-pass 360{\deg} angle of view (AOV) image of
unlimited shape, view-directions count and unrestrained projection geometry
complexity (e.g. direct lens distortion, projection mapping, curvilinear
perspective), natively aliasing-free. In conjunction to perspective vector map,
visual-sphere perspective model is proposed. A model capable of combining
pictures from sources previously incompatible, like fish-eye camera and
wide-angle lens picture. More so, method is proposed for measurement and
simulation of a real optical system variable no-parallax point (NPP). This
study also explores philosophical and historical aspects of picture perception
and presents a guide for perspective design.

\\
  The Berlin Conference of 1885 has influenced the way native Africans, and the
African Diaspora live their daily lives. France contractually controls several
resources generated by the continent of Africa. Herein lies a technical
proposal to free Africa from the financial and economic agreements coerced upon
the continent over a century ago by utilizing decentralized collaboration
through advanced technology. AfricaOS (AOS) aims to provide a philosophical,
and fundamental framework for implementing a simple, distributed, collaborative
computer for agreement amongst peers. The work also demonstrates an algebra
over transactions, use of the protocol for privatization, a method for
tokenizing barter economies, and methods to design mechanisms for use in
implementing protocol behavior.

Title: Menu-size Complexity and Revenue Continuity of Buy-many Mechanisms
Authors: Shuchi Chawla, Yifeng Teng, Christos Tzamos
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  We study the multi-item mechanism design problem where a monopolist sells $n$
heterogeneous items to a single buyer. We focus on buy-many mechanisms, a
natural class of mechanisms frequently used in practice. The buy-many property
allows the buyer to interact with the mechanism multiple times instead of once
as in the more commonly studied buy-one mechanisms. This imposes additional
incentive constraints and thus restricts the space of mechanisms that the
seller can use.
  In this paper, we explore the qualitative differences between buy-one and
buy-many mechanisms focusing on two important properties: revenue continuity
and menu-size complexity.
  Our first main result is that when the value function of the buyer is
perturbed multiplicatively by a factor of $1\pm\epsilon$, the optimal revenue
obtained by buy-many mechanisms only changes by a factor of $1 \pm
\textrm{poly}(n,\epsilon)$. In contrast, for buy-one mechanisms, the revenue of
the resulting optimal mechanism after such a perturbation can change
arbitrarily.
  Our second main result shows that under any distribution of arbitrary
valuations, finite menu size suffices to achieve a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation
to the optimal buy-many mechanism. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the
number of menu entries as a function of $n$ and $\epsilon$. On the other hand,
such a result fails to hold for buy-one mechanisms as even for two items and a
buyer with either unit-demand or additive valuations, the menu-size complexity
of approximately optimal mechanisms is unbounded.

Comments: 32 pages, 4 figures,
\\
  Interest in collective robotic systems has increased rapidly due to the
potential benefits that can be offered to operators, such as increased safety
and support, who perform challenging tasks in high-risk environments.
Human-collective transparency research has focused on how the design of the
algorithms, visualizations, and control mechanisms influence human-collective
behavior. Traditional collective visualizations have shown all of the
individual entities composing a collective, which may become problematic as
collectives scale in size and heterogeneity, and tasks become more demanding.
Human operators can become overloaded with information, which will negatively
affect their understanding of the collective's current state and overall
behaviors, which can cause poor teaming performance. An analysis of
visualization transparency and the derived visualization design guidance, based
on remote supervision of collectives, are the primary contributions of this
manuscript. The individual agent and abstract visualizations were analyzed for
sequential best-of-n decision-making tasks involving four collectives, composed
of 200 entities each. The abstract visualization provided better transparency
by enabling operators with different individual differences and capabilities to
perform relatively the same and promoted higher human-collective performance.

\\
  With the advancements in social robotics and virtual avatars, it becomes
increasingly important that these agents adapt their behavior to the mood,
feelings and personality of their users. One such aspect of the user is
empathy. Whereas many studies measure empathy through offline measures that are
collected after empathic stimulation (e.g. post-hoc questionnaires), the
current study aimed to measure empathy online, using brain activity collected
during the experience. Participants watched an affective 360 video of a child
experiencing domestic violence in a virtual reality headset while their EEG
signals were recorded. Results showed a significant attenuation of alpha, theta
and delta asymmetry in the frontal and central areas of the brain. Moreover, a
significant relationship between participants' empathy scores and their frontal
alpha asymmetry at baseline was found. These results demonstrate specific brain
activity alterations when participants are exposed to an affective virtual
reality environment, with the level of empathy as a personality trait being
visible in brain activity during a baseline measurement. These findings suggest
the potential of EEG measurements for development of passive brain-computer
interfaces that assess the user's affective responses in real-time and
consequently adapt the behavior of socially intelligent agents for a
personalized interaction.

\\
  Telepresence robots (TPRs) are versatile, remotely controlled vehicles that
enable physical presence and human-to-human interaction over a distance. Thanks
to improving hardware and dropping price points, TPRs enjoy the growing
interest in various industries and application domains. Still, a satisfying
experience remains key for their acceptance and successful adoption, not only
in terms of enabling remote communication with others, but also in terms of
managing robot mobility by means of remote navigation. This paper focuses on
the latter aspect of remote operation which has been hitherto neglected. We
present the results of an extensive subjective study designed to systematically
assess remote navigation Quality of Experience (QoE) in the context of using a
TPR live over the Internet. Participants were 'beamed' into a remote office
space and asked to perform characteristic TPR remote operation tasks (driving,
turning, parking). Visual and control dimensions of their experience were
systematically impaired by altering network characteristics (bandwidth, delay
and packet loss rate) in a controlled fashion. Our results show that users can
differentiate well between visual and navigation/control aspects of their
experience. Furthermore, QoE impairment sensitivity varies with the actual task
at hand.

Journal-ref: HUMANIZE Workshop @ IUI'2020

  In this paper, we introduce a psychology-inspired approach to model and
predict the music genre preferences of different groups of users by utilizing
human memory processes. These processes describe how humans access information
units in their memory by considering the factors of (i) past usage frequency,
(ii) past usage recency, and (iii) the current context. Using a publicly
available dataset of more than a billion music listening records shared on the
music streaming platform Last.fm, we find that our approach provides
significantly better prediction accuracy results than various baseline
algorithms for all evaluated user groups, i.e., (i) low-mainstream music
listeners, (ii) medium-mainstream music listeners, and (iii) high-mainstream
music listeners. Furthermore, our approach is based on a simple psychological
model, which contributes to the transparency and explainability of the
calculated predictions.

  Knowledge about the software used in scientific investigations is necessary
for different reasons, including provenance of the results, measuring software
impact to attribute developers, and bibliometric software citation analysis in
general. Additionally, providing information about whether and how the software
and the source code are available allows an assessment about the state and role
of open source software in science in general. While such analyses can be done
manually, large scale analyses require the application of automated methods of
information extraction and linking. In this paper, we present SoftwareKG - a
knowledge graph that contains information about software mentions from more
than 51,000 scientific articles from the social sciences. A silver standard
corpus, created by a distant and weak supervision approach, and a gold standard
corpus, created by manual annotation, were used to train an LSTM based neural
network to identify software mentions in scientific articles. The model
achieves a recognition rate of .82 F-score in exact matches. As a result, we
identified more than 133,000 software mentions. For entity disambiguation, we
used the public domain knowledge base DBpedia. Furthermore, we linked the
entities of the knowledge graph to other knowledge bases such as the Microsoft
Academic Knowledge Graph, the Software Ontology, and Wikidata. Finally, we
illustrate, how SoftwareKG can be used to assess the role of software in the
social sciences.

Title: Multi-Feature Discrete Collaborative Filtering for Fast Cold-start
  Recommendation
Authors: Yang Xu, Lei Zhu, Zhiyong Cheng, Jingjing Li, Jiande Sun
Categories: cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  Hashing is an effective technique to address the large-scale recommendation
problem, due to its high computation and storage efficiency on calculating the
user preferences on items. However, existing hashing-based recommendation
methods still suffer from two important problems: 1) Their recommendation
process mainly relies on the user-item interactions and single specific content
feature. When the interaction history or the content feature is unavailable
(the cold-start problem), their performance will be seriously deteriorated. 2)
Existing methods learn the hash codes with relaxed optimization or adopt
discrete coordinate descent to directly solve binary hash codes, which results
in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. In
this paper, we propose a fast cold-start recommendation method, called
Multi-Feature Discrete Collaborative Filtering (MFDCF), to solve these
problems. Specifically, a low-rank self-weighted multi-feature fusion module is
designed to adaptively project the multiple content features into binary yet
informative hash codes by fully exploiting their complementarity. Additionally,
we develop a fast discrete optimization algorithm to directly compute the
binary hash codes with simple operations. Experiments on two public
recommendation datasets demonstrate that MFDCF outperforms the
state-of-the-arts on various aspects.

Title: Increasing Security Degree of Freedom in Multi-user and Multi-eve
  Systems
Authors: Kun Xie, Wen Chen, Lili Wei

Comments: TIFS
\\
  Secure communication in the Multi-user and Multi-eavesdropper (MUME) scenario
is considered in this paper. It has be shown that secrecy can be improved when
the transmitter simultaneously transmits information-bearing signal to the
intended receivers and artificial noise to confuse the eavesdroppers. Several
processing schemes have been proposed to limit the co-channel interference
(CCI). In this paper, we propose the increasing security degree of freedom
(ISDF) method, which takes idea from the dirty-paper coding (DPC) and ZF
beam-forming. By means of known interference pre-cancelation at the
transmitter, we design each precoder according to the previously designed
precoding matrices, rather than other users' channels, which in return provides
extra freedom for the design of precoders. Simulations demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves the better performance and relatively low complexity.

  Traditional seismic acquisition systems suffer from a number of difficulties
related to telemetry cables that are used as a means of data transmission.
Transforming the traditional seismic acquisition system to a wireless system
has been considered as a potential solution to most of these difficulties. The
wireless seismic acquisition system has to serve a huge aggregate data rate
requirement as is usually the case in a large wireless sensor network. This
paper considers the wireless acquisition system, and studies the maximum
achievable transmission data rates from the geophones to the wireless gateways.
Successive interference cancellation decoding is assumed to be used at the
gateway nodes. We consider the problem of sum-rate maximization by optimizing
the decoding process at each gateway node. The optimization searches for
optimal decoding set at each gateway, i.e. which group of geophones will be
decoded at each gateway. Various integer programming algorithms are proposed
for solving the maximization problem. These optimization algorithms are
simulated and compared among each other, where it is shown that the ant system
algorithm achieves the highest sum-rate with lower computational complexity
compared to other algorithms. Furthermore, the data delivery from the gateways
to the data center is also considered. In this stage, two gateways with
different buffer sizes are studied. For small-size buffers, two optimization
problems are identified and solved. The first problem considers the
minimization of the total power of the gateways, and the second problem
considers power fairness between the gateways. For large-size buffers, the
problem of maximizing the weighted sum rate of the gateways is solved.

Title: A Comprehensive Analysis of Correlated Source Compression Using Edge
  Computing in Distributed Systems
Authors: Benjamin Rosen, Shane House, Shamin Achari and Ling Cheng
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to the 23rd International Conference on
  Information Fusion, ISIF
ACM-class: E.4
\\
  This paper examines the theory pertaining to lossless compression of
correlated sources located at the edge of a network. Importantly, communication
between nodes is prohibited. In particular, a method that combines correlated
source coding and matrix partitioning is explained. This technique is then made
more flexible, by restricting the method to operate on two distinct groups of
nodes. As a result, this new method allows for more freedom in compression
performance, with consequent trade-off in node integrity validation.
Specifically, it provides 2-3 times the compression savings when using a
Hamming(7,4) with 4 nodes. It also decreases the complexity with regard to
managing the nodes as they join/leave the network, while retaining the range
within which the information can be losslessly decoded.

Title: Optimized Caching and Spectrum Partitioning for D2D enabled Cellular
  Systems with Clustered Devices

\\
  Caching at mobile devices and leveraging device- to-device (D2D)
communication are two promising approaches to support massive content delivery
over wireless networks. The analysis of cache-enabled wireless networks is
usually carried out by assuming that devices are uniformly distributed,
however, in social networks, mobile devices are intrinsically grouped into
disjoint clusters. In this regards, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal
mathematical model that tracks the service requests arrivals and account for
the clustered devices geometry. Two kinds of devices are assumed, particularly,
content clients and content providers. Content providers are assumed to have a
surplus memory which is exploited to proactively cache contents from a known
library, following a random probabilistic caching scheme. Content clients can
retrieve a requested content from the nearest content provider in their
proximity (cluster), or, as a last resort, the base station (BS). The developed
spatiotemporal model is leveraged to formulate a joint optimization problem of
the content caching and spectrum partitioning in order to minimize the average
service delay. Due to the high complexity of the optimization problem, the
caching and spectrum partitioning problems are decoupled and solved iteratively
using the block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization technique. To this end,
an optimal and suboptimal solutions are obtained for the bandwidth partitioning
and probabilistic caching subproblems, respectively. Numerical results
highlight the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional caching
schemes under equal and optimized bandwidth allocations. Particularly, it is
shown that the average service delay is reduced by nearly 100% and 350%,
compared to the Zipf and uniform caching schemes under equal bandwidth
allocations, respectively.

Title: Efficient Tensor Kernel methods for sparse regression
Authors: Feliks Hibraj, Marcello Pelillo, Saverio Salzo, Massimiliano Pontil
Categories: cs.LG cs.PF stat.ML
Comments: M.Sc. Thesis introducing a novel layout to efficiently store
  symmetric tensor data
\\
  Recently, classical kernel methods have been extended by the introduction of
suitable tensor kernels so to promote sparsity in the solution of the
underlying regression problem. Indeed, they solve an lp-norm regularization
problem, with p=m/(m-1) and m even integer, which happens to be close to a
lasso problem. However, a major drawback of the method is that storing tensors
requires a considerable amount of memory, ultimately limiting its
applicability. In this work we address this problem by proposing two advances.
First, we directly reduce the memory requirement, by intriducing a new and more
efficient layout for storing the data. Second, we use a Nystrom-type
subsampling approach, which allows for a training phase with a smaller number
of data points, so to reduce the computational cost. Experiments, both on
synthetic and read datasets, show the effectiveness of the proposed
improvements. Finally, we take case of implementing the cose in C++ so to
further speed-up the computation.

Title: Creating Synthetic Datasets via Evolution for Neural Program Synthesis
Authors: Alexander Suh and Yuval Timen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages, 0 figures, submitted to ICML 2020
\\
  Program synthesis is the task of automatically generating a program
consistent with a given specification. A natural way to specify programs is to
provide examples of desired input-output behavior, and many current program
synthesis approaches have achieved impressive results after training on
randomly generated input-output examples. However, recent work has discovered
that some of these approaches generalize poorly to data distributions different
from that of the randomly generated examples. We show that this problem applies
to other state-of-the-art approaches as well and that current methods to
counteract this problem are insufficient. We then propose a new, adversarial
approach to control the bias of synthetic data distributions and show that it
outperforms current approaches.

Title: ProGraML: Graph-based Deep Learning for Program Optimization and
  Analysis

Comments: 20 pages, author preprint
\\
  The increasing complexity of computing systems places a tremendous burden on
optimizing compilers, requiring ever more accurate and aggressive
optimizations. Machine learning offers significant benefits for constructing
optimization heuristics but there remains a gap between what state-of-the-art
methods achieve and the performance of an optimal heuristic. Closing this gap
requires improvements in two key areas: a representation that accurately
captures the semantics of programs, and a model architecture with sufficient
expressiveness to reason about this representation.
  We introduce ProGraML - Program Graphs for Machine Learning - a novel
graph-based program representation using a low level, language agnostic, and
portable format; and machine learning models capable of performing complex
downstream tasks over these graphs. The ProGraML representation is a directed
attributed multigraph that captures control, data, and call relations, and
summarizes instruction and operand types and ordering. Message Passing Neural
Networks propagate information through this structured representation, enabling
whole-program or per-vertex classification tasks.
  ProGraML provides a general-purpose program representation that equips
learnable models to perform the types of program analysis that are fundamental
to optimization. To this end, we evaluate the performance of our approach first
on a suite of traditional compiler analysis tasks: control flow reachability,
dominator trees, data dependencies, variable liveness, and common subexpression
detection. On a benchmark dataset of 250k LLVM-IR files covering six source
programming languages, ProGraML achieves an average 94.0 F1 score,
significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. We then apply our
approach to two high-level tasks - heterogeneous device mapping and program
classification - setting new state-of-the-art performance in both.

Title: The Internet of Things as a Deep Neural Network
Authors: Rong Du, Sindri Magn\'usson, Carlo Fischione

Comments: 3 figures, 1 table, 15 pages; The paper is under review in IEEE
  Communications Magazine
\\
  An important task in the Internet of Things (IoT) is field monitoring, where
multiple IoT nodes take measurements and communicate them to the base station
or the cloud for processing, inference, and analysis. This communication
becomes costly when the measurements are high-dimensional (e.g., videos or
time-series data). The IoT networks with limited bandwidth and low power
devices may not be able to support such frequent transmissions with high data
rates. To ensure communication efficiency, this article proposes to model the
measurement compression at IoT nodes and the inference at the base station or
cloud as a deep neural network (DNN). We propose a new framework where the data
to be transmitted from nodes are the intermediate outputs of a layer of the
DNN. We show how to learn the model parameters of the DNN and study the
trade-off between the communication rate and the inference accuracy. The
experimental results show that we can save approximately 96% transmissions with
only a degradation of 2.5% in inference accuracy. Our findings have the
potentiality to enable many new IoT data analysis applications generating large
amount of measurements.

Title: Efficient Gaussian Process Bandits by Believing only Informative Actions
Authors: Amrit Singh Bedi, Dheeraj Peddireddy, Vaneet Aggarwal, Alec Koppel
Categories: cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
\\
  Bayesian optimization is a framework for global search via maximum a
posteriori updates rather than simulated annealing, and has gained prominence
for decision-making under uncertainty. In this work, we cast Bayesian
optimization as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is
sampled from a Gaussian process (GP). Further, we focus on action selections
via upper confidence bound (UCB) or expected improvement (EI) due to their
prevalent use in practice. Prior works using GPs for bandits cannot allow the
iteration horizon $T$ to be large, as the complexity of computing the posterior
parameters scales cubically with the number of past observations. To circumvent
this computational burden, we propose a simple statistical test: only
incorporate an action into the GP posterior when its conditional entropy
exceeds an $\epsilon$ threshold. Doing so permits us to derive sublinear regret
bounds of GP bandit algorithms up to factors depending on the compression
parameter $\epsilon$ for both discrete and continuous action sets. Moreover,
the complexity of the GP posterior remains provably finite. Experimentally, we
observe state of the art accuracy and complexity tradeoffs for GP bandit
algorithms applied to global optimization, suggesting the merits of compressed
GPs in bandit settings.

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Counterfactual prediction is a fundamental task in decision-making.
G-computation is a method for estimating expected counterfactual outcomes under
dynamic time-varying treatment strategies. Existing G-computation
implementations have mostly employed classical regression models with limited
capacity to capture complex temporal and nonlinear dependence structures. This
paper introduces G-Net, a novel sequential deep learning framework for
G-computation that can handle complex time series data while imposing minimal
modeling assumptions and provide estimates of individual or population-level
time varying treatment effects. We evaluate alternative G-Net implementations
using realistically complex temporal simulated data obtained from CVSim, a
mechanistic model of the cardiovascular system.

Title: Symmetry & critical points for a model shallow neural network
Authors: Yossi Arjevani and Michael Field
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  A detailed analysis is given of a family of critical points determining
spurious minima for a model student-teacher 2-layer neural network, with ReLU
activation function, and a natural $\Gamma = S_k \times S_k$-symmetry. For a
$k$-neuron shallow network of this type, analytic equations are given which,
for example, determine the critical points of the spurious minima described by
Safran and Shamir (2018) for $6 \le k \le 20$. These critical points have
isotropy (conjugate to) the diagonal subgroup $\Delta S_{k-1}\subset \Delta
S_k$ of $\Gamma$. It is shown that critical points of this family can be
expressed as an infinite series in $1/\sqrt{k}$ (for large enough $k$) and, as
an application, the critical values decay like $a k^{-1}$, where $a \approx
0.3$. Other non-trivial families of critical points are also described with
isotropy conjugate to $\Delta S_{k-1}, \Delta S_k$ and $\Delta (S_2\times
S_{k-2})$ (the latter giving spurious minima for $k\ge 9$). The methods used
depend on symmetry breaking, bifurcation, and algebraic geometry, notably
Artin's implicit function theorem, and are applicable to other families of
critical points that occur in this network.

Title: Learning End-to-End Codes for the BPSK-constrained Gaussian Wiretap
  Channel
Authors: Alireza Nooraiepour and Sina Rezaei Aghdam
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Finite-length codes are learned for the Gaussian wiretap channel in an
end-to-end manner assuming that the communication parties are equipped with
deep neural networks (DNNs), and communicate through binary phase-shift keying
(BPSK) modulation scheme. The goal is to find codes via DNNs which allow a pair
of transmitter and receiver to communicate reliably and securely in the
presence of an adversary aiming at decoding the secret messages. Following the
information-theoretic secrecy principles, the security is evaluated in terms of
mutual information utilizing a deep learning tool called MINE (mutual
information neural estimation). System performance is evaluated for different
DNN architectures, designed based on the existing secure coding schemes, at the
transmitter. Numerical results demonstrate that the legitimate parties can
indeed establish a secure transmission in this setting as the learned codes
achieve points on almost the boundary of the equivocation region.

Title: Meta Pseudo Labels
Authors: Hieu Pham, Qizhe Xie, Zihang Dai, Quoc V. Le
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Many training algorithms of a deep neural network can be interpreted as
minimizing the cross entropy loss between the prediction made by the network
and a target distribution. In supervised learning, this target distribution is
typically the ground-truth one-hot vector. In semi-supervised learning, this
target distribution is typically generated by a pre-trained teacher model to
train the main network. In this work, instead of using such predefined target
distributions, we show that learning to adjust the target distribution based on
the learning state of the main network can lead to better performances. In
particular, we propose an efficient meta-learning algorithm, which encourages
the teacher to adjust the target distributions of training examples in the
manner that improves the learning of the main network. The teacher is updated
by policy gradients computed by evaluating the main network on a held-out
validation set.
  Our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over strong baselines
and establish state-ofthe-art performance on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet. For
instance, with ResNets on small datasets, we achieve 96.1% on CIFAR-10 with
4,000 labeled examples and 73.9% top-1 on ImageNet with 10% examples.
Meanwhile, with EfficientNet on full datasets plus extra unlabeled data, we
attain 98.6% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 86.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

  In this work we develop a novel Bayesian neural network methodology to
achieve strong adversarial robustness without the need for online adversarial
training. Unlike previous efforts in this direction, we do not rely solely on
the stochasticity of network weights by minimizing the divergence between the
learned parameter distribution and a prior. Instead, we additionally require
that the model maintain some expected uncertainty with respect to all input
covariates. We demonstrate that by encouraging the network to distribute evenly
across inputs, the network becomes less susceptible to localized, brittle
features which imparts a natural robustness to targeted perturbations. We show
empirical robustness on several benchmark datasets.

  Sullivan, Kilian M. Pohl
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The BOLD signal of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) records the functional brain
connectivity in a rich dynamic spatio-temporal setting. However, existing
methods applied to rs-fMRI often fail to consider both spatial and temporal
characteristics of the data. They either neglect the functional dependency
between different brain regions in a network or discard the information in the
temporal dynamics of brain activity. To overcome those shortcomings, we propose
to formulate functional connectivity networks within the context of
spatio-temporal graphs. We then train a spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) on short sub-sequences of the BOLD time series to model the
non-stationary nature of functional connectivity. We simultaneously learn the
graph edge importance within ST-GCN to enable interpretation of functional
connectivities contributing to the prediction model. In analyzing the rs-fMRI
of the Human Connectome Project (HCP, N=1,091) and the National Consortium on
Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA, N=773), ST-GCN is
significantly more accurate than common approaches in predicting gender and age
based on BOLD signals. The matrix recording edge importance localizes brain
regions and functional connections with significant aging and sex effects,
which are verified by the neuroscience literature.

  Subjective Class Problem
Authors: Kei Nemoto and Shweta Jain
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Under review by ECML PKDD 2020
\\
  Research in the supervised learning algorithms field implicitly assumes that
training data is labeled by domain experts or at least semi-professional
labelers accessible through crowdsourcing services like Amazon Mechanical Turk.
With the advent of the Internet, data has become abundant and a large number of
machine learning based systems started being trained with user-generated data,
using categorical data as true labels. However, little work has been done in
the area of supervised learning with user-defined labels where users are not
necessarily experts and might be motivated to provide incorrect labels in order
to improve their own utility from the system. In this article, we propose two
types of classes in user-defined labels: subjective class and objective class -
showing that the objective classes are as reliable as if they were provided by
domain experts, whereas the subjective classes are subject to bias and
manipulation by the user. We define this as a subjective class issue and
provide a framework for detecting subjective labels in a dataset without
querying oracle. Using this framework, data mining practitioners can detect a
subjective class at an early stage of their projects, and avoid wasting their
precious time and resources by dealing with subjective class problem with
traditional machine learning techniques.

Title: FedSel: Federated SGD under Local Differential Privacy with Top-k
  Dimension Selection
Authors: Ruixuan Liu, Yang Cao, Masatoshi Yoshikawa, Hong Chen
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
Comments: 18 pages, to be published in DASFAA 2020
\\
  As massive data are produced from small gadgets, federated learning on mobile
devices has become an emerging trend. In the federated setting, Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) has been widely used in federated learning for various
machine learning models. To prevent privacy leakages from gradients that are
calculated on users' sensitive data, local differential privacy (LDP) has been
considered as a privacy guarantee in federated SGD recently. However, the
existing solutions have a dimension dependency problem: the injected noise is
substantially proportional to the dimension $d$. In this work, we propose a
two-stage framework FedSel for federated SGD under LDP to relieve this problem.
Our key idea is that not all dimensions are equally important so that we
privately select Top-k dimensions according to their contributions in each
iteration of federated SGD. Specifically, we propose three private dimension
selection mechanisms and adapt the gradient accumulation technique to stabilize
the learning process with noisy updates. We also theoretically analyze privacy,
accuracy and time complexity of FedSel, which outperforms the state-of-the-art
solutions. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.

Title: Robust and On-the-fly Dataset Denoising for Image Classification
Authors: Jiaming Song, Lunjia Hu, Yann Dauphin, Michael Auli, Tengyu Ma
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Memorization in over-parameterized neural networks could severely hurt
generalization in the presence of mislabeled examples. However, mislabeled
examples are hard to avoid in extremely large datasets collected with weak
supervision. We address this problem by reasoning counterfactually about the
loss distribution of examples with uniform random labels had they were trained
with the real examples, and use this information to remove noisy examples from
the training set. First, we observe that examples with uniform random labels
have higher losses when trained with stochastic gradient descent under large
learning rates. Then, we propose to model the loss distribution of the
counterfactual examples using only the network parameters, which is able to
model such examples with remarkable success. Finally, we propose to remove
examples whose loss exceeds a certain quantile of the modeled loss
distribution. This leads to On-the-fly Data Denoising (ODD), a simple yet
effective algorithm that is robust to mislabeled examples, while introducing
almost zero computational overhead compared to standard training. ODD is able
to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of datasets including
real-world ones such as WebVision and Clothing1M.

Authors: Piyush Gupta, Demetris Coleman, Joshua E. Siegel
Categories: cs.LG cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
\\
  Automated vehicles' neural networks suffer from overfit, poor
generalizability, and untrained edge cases due to limited data availability.
Researchers synthesize randomized edge-case scenarios to assist in the training
process, though simulation introduces potential for overfit to latent rules and
features. Automating worst-case scenario generation could yield informative
data for improving self driving. To this end, we introduce a "Physically
Adversarial Intelligent Network" (PAIN), wherein self-driving vehicles interact
aggressively in the CARLA simulation environment. We train two agents, a
protagonist and an adversary, using dueling double deep Q networks (DDDQNs)
with prioritized experience replay. The coupled networks alternately
seek-to-collide and to avoid collisions such that the "defensive" avoidance
algorithm increases the mean-time-to-failure and distance traveled under
non-hostile operating conditions. The trained protagonist becomes more
resilient to environmental uncertainty and less prone to corner case failures
resulting in collisions than the agent trained without an adversary.

Title: Mirrored Autoencoders with Simplex Interpolation for Unsupervised
  Anomaly Detection
Authors: Y. Wu, Y. Balaji, B. Vinzamuri, S. Feizi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Use of deep generative models for unsupervised anomaly detection has shown
great promise partially owing to their ability to learn proper representations
of complex input data distributions. Current methods, however, lack a strong
latent representation of the data, thereby resulting in sub-optimal
unsupervised anomaly detection results. In this work, we propose a novel
representation learning technique using deep autoencoders to tackle the problem
of unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach replaces the $L_{p}$
reconstruction loss in the autoencoder optimization objective with a novel
adversarial loss to enforce semantic-level reconstruction. In addition, we
propose a novel simplex interpolation loss to improve the structure of the
latent space representation in the autoencoder. Our technique improves the
state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection performance by a large margin
on several image datasets including MNIST, fashion MNIST, CIFAR and Coil-100 as
well as on several non-image datasets including KDD99, Arrhythmia and Thyroid.
For example, On the CIFAR-10 dataset, using a standard leave-one-out evaluation
protocol, our method achieves a substantial performance gain of 0.23 AUC points
compared to the state-of-the-art.

  Systems using Variational Autoencoder for Regression

\\
  Learning-enabled components (LECs) are widely used in cyber-physical systems
(CPS) since they can handle the uncertainty and variability of the environment
and increase the level of autonomy. However, it has been shown that LECs such
as deep neural networks (DNN) are not robust and adversarial examples can cause
the model to make a false prediction. The paper considers the problem of
efficiently detecting adversarial examples in LECs used for regression in CPS.
The proposed approach is based on inductive conformal prediction and uses a
regression model based on variational autoencoder. The architecture allows to
take into consideration both the input and the neural network prediction for
detecting adversarial, and more generally, out-of-distribution examples. We
demonstrate the method using an advanced emergency braking system implemented
in an open source simulator for self-driving cars where a DNN is used to
estimate the distance to an obstacle. The simulation results show that the
method can effectively detect adversarial examples with a short detection
delay.

Title: Capturing and Explaining Trajectory Singularities using Composite Signal
  Neural Networks
Authors: Hippolyte Dubois, Patrick Le Callet, Antoine Coutrot

\\
  Spatial trajectories are ubiquitous and complex signals. Their analysis is
crucial in many research fields, from urban planning to neuroscience. Several
approaches have been proposed to cluster trajectories. They rely on
hand-crafted features, which struggle to capture the spatio-temporal complexity
of the signal, or on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which can be more
efficient but less interpretable. In this paper we present a novel ANN
architecture designed to capture the spatio-temporal patterns characteristic of
a set of trajectories, while taking into account the demographics of the
navigators. Hence, our model extracts markers linked to both behaviour and
demographics. We propose a composite signal analyser (CompSNN) combining three
simple ANN modules. Each of these modules uses different signal representations
of the trajectory while remaining interpretable. Our CompSNN performs
significantly better than its modules taken in isolation and allows to
visualise which parts of the signal were most useful to discriminate the
trajectories.

Title: Tree Index: A New Cluster Evaluation Technique
Authors: A. H. Beg, Md Zahidul Islam, Vladimir Estivill-Castro
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We introduce a cluster evaluation technique called Tree Index. Our Tree Index
algorithm aims at describing the structural information of the clustering
rather than the quantitative format of cluster-quality indexes (where the
representation power of clustering is some cumulative error similar to vector
quantization). Our Tree Index is finding margins amongst clusters for easy
learning without the complications of Minimum Description Length. Our Tree
Index produces a decision tree from the clustered data set, using the cluster
identifiers as labels. It combines the entropy of each leaf with their depth.
Intuitively, a shorter tree with pure leaves generalizes the data well (the
clusters are easy to learn because they are well separated). So, the labels are
meaningful clusters. If the clustering algorithm does not separate well, trees
learned from their results will be large and too detailed. We show that, on the
clustering results (obtained by various techniques) on a brain dataset, Tree
Index discriminates between reasonable and non-sensible clusters. We confirm
the effectiveness of Tree Index through graphical visualizations. Tree Index
evaluates the sensible solutions higher than the non-sensible solutions while
existing cluster-quality indexes fail to do so.

Title: Model-based Asynchronous Hyperparameter Optimization
Authors: Louis C. Tiao, Aaron Klein, Cedric Archambeau, Matthias Seeger
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We introduce a model-based asynchronous multi-fidelity hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method, combining strengths of asynchronous Hyperband and
Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization. Our method obtains substantial
speed-ups in wall-clock time over, both, synchronous and asynchronous
Hyperband, as well as a prior model-based extension of the former. Candidate
hyperparameters to evaluate are selected by a novel jointly dependent Gaussian
process-based surrogate model over all resource levels, allowing evaluations at
one level to be informed by evaluations gathered at all others. We benchmark
several covariance functions and conduct extensive experiments on
hyperparameter tuning for multi-layer perceptrons on tabular data,
convolutional networks on image classification, and recurrent networks on
language modelling, demonstrating the benefits of our approach.

Title: Cost-aware Bayesian Optimization
Authors: Eric Hans Lee, Valerio Perrone, Cedric Archambeau, Matthias Seeger
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Bayesian optimization (BO) is a class of global optimization algorithms,
suitable for minimizing an expensive objective function in as few function
evaluations as possible. While BO budgets are typically given in iterations,
this implicitly measures convergence in terms of iteration count and assumes
each evaluation has identical cost. In practice, evaluation costs may vary in
different regions of the search space. For example, the cost of neural network
training increases quadratically with layer size, which is a typical
hyperparameter. Cost-aware BO measures convergence with alternative cost
metrics such as time, energy, or money, for which vanilla BO methods are
unsuited. We introduce Cost Apportioned BO (CArBO), which attempts to minimize
an objective function in as little cost as possible. CArBO combines a
cost-effective initial design with a cost-cooled optimization phase which
depreciates a learned cost model as iterations proceed. On a set of 20
black-box function optimization problems we show that, given the same cost
budget, CArBO finds significantly better hyperparameter configurations than
competing methods.

Title: Dynamic Narrowing of VAE Bottlenecks Using GECO and $L_0$ Regularization
Authors: Cedric De Boom, Samuel Wauthier, Tim Verbelen, Bart Dhoedt
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, 1 table
\\
  When designing variational autoencoders (VAEs) or other types of latent space
models, the dimensionality of the latent space is typically defined upfront. In
this process, it is possible that the number of dimensions is under- or
overprovisioned for the application at hand. In case the dimensionality is not
predefined, this parameter is usually determined using time- and
resource-consuming cross-validation. For these reasons we have developed a
technique to shrink the latent space dimensionality of VAEs automatically and
on-the-fly during training using Generalized ELBO with Constrained Optimization
(GECO) and the $L_0$-Augment-REINFORCE-Merge ($L_0$-ARM) gradient estimator.
The GECO optimizer ensures that we are not violating a predefined upper bound
on the reconstruction error. This paper presents the algorithmic details of our
method along with experimental results on five different datasets. We find that
our training procedure is stable and that the latent space can be pruned
effectively without violating the GECO constraints.

Title: Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Ensembles

\\
  It is well-known that ensemble methods often provide enhanced performance in
reinforcement learning. In this paper we explore this concept further by using
group-aided training within the distributional reinforcement learning paradigm.
Specifically, we propose an extension to categorical reinforcement learning,
where distributional learning targets are implicitly based on the total
information gathered by an ensemble. We empirically show that this may lead to
much more robust initial learning, a stronger individual performance level and
good efficiency on a per-sample basis.

Title: Learn to Forget: User-Level Memorization Elimination in Federated
  Learning
Authors: Yang Liu, Zhuo Ma, Ximeng Liu, Jianfeng Ma
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning technique that evokes
widespread attention in both the research field and the real-world market.
However, the current privacy-preserving federated learning scheme only provides
a secure way for the users to contribute their private data but never leaves a
way to withdraw the contribution to model update. Such an irreversible setting
potentially breaks the regulations about data protection and increases the risk
of data extraction. To resolve the problem, this paper describes a novel
concept for federated learning, called memorization elimination. Based on the
concept, we propose \sysname, a federated learning framework that allows the
user to eliminate the memorization of its private data in the trained model.
Specifically, each user in \sysname is deployed with a trainable dummy gradient
generator. After steps of training, the generator can produce dummy gradients
to stimulate the neurons of a machine learning model to eliminate the
memorization of the specific data. Also, we prove that the additional
memorization elimination service of \sysname does not break the common
procedure of federated learning or lower its security.

Title: A Data-Efficient Sampling Method for Estimating Basins of Attraction
  Using Hybrid Active Learning (HAL)
Authors: Xue-She Wang, James D. Turner, Brian P. Mann
Categories: cs.LG nlin.CD stat.ML
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Although basins of attraction (BoA) diagrams are an insightful tool for
understanding the behavior of nonlinear systems, generating these diagrams is
either computationally expensive with simulation or difficult and cost
prohibitive experimentally. This paper introduces a data-efficient sampling
method for estimating BoA. The proposed method is based upon hybrid active
learning (HAL) and is designed to find and label the "informative" samples,
which efficiently determine the boundary of BoA. It consists of three primary
parts: 1) additional sampling on trajectories (AST) to maximize the number of
samples obtained from each simulation or experiment; 2) an active learning (AL)
algorithm to exploit the local boundary of BoA; and 3) a density-based sampling
(DBS) method to explore the global boundary of BoA. An example of estimating
the BoA for a bistable nonlinear system is presented to show the high
efficiency of our HAL sampling method.

Title: Hybrid Classification and Reasoning for Image-based Constraint Solving
Authors: Maxime Mulamba, Jayanta Mandi, Rocsildes Canoy, Tias Guns
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  There is an increased interest in solving complex constrained problems where
part of the input is not given as facts but received as raw sensor data such as
images or speech. We will use "visual sudoku" as a prototype problem, where the
given cell digits are handwritten and provided as an image thereof. In this
case, one first has to train and use a classifier to label the images, so that
the labels can be used for solving the problem. In this paper, we explore the
hybridization of classifying the images with the reasoning of a constraint
solver. We show that pure constraint reasoning on predictions does not give
satisfactory results. Instead, we explore the possibilities of a tighter
integration, by exposing the probabilistic estimates of the classifier to the
constraint solver. This allows joint inference on these probabilistic
estimates, where we use the solver to find the maximum likelihood solution. We
explore the trade-off between the power of the classifier and the power of the
constraint reasoning, as well as further integration through the additional use
of structural knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of calibration
of the probabilistic estimates on the reasoning. Our results show that such
hybrid approaches vastly outperform a separate approach, which encourages a
further integration of prediction (probabilities) and constraint solving.

Title: Computer-Assisted Verification of Four Interval Arithmetic Operators
Authors: Daisuke Ishii, Tomohito Yabu
Categories: cs.LO
Comments: Submitted to Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics
  (Special Issue on SCAN 2018)
\\
  Interval arithmetic libraries provide the four elementary arithmetic
operators for operand intervals bounded by floating-point numbers. However,
actual implementations need to make a large case analysis that considers, e.g.,
magnitude relations between all pairs of argument bounds, positional relations
between the arguments and zero, and handling of the special values, i.e.
infinities and NaN. Their correctness is not obvious as they are implemented by
human hands, which comes to be critical for the reliability. This work provides
a mechanically-verified interval arithmetic library. For this purpose, we
utilize the Why3 platform equipped with a specification language for annotated
programs and back-end theorem provers. We conducted several proof tasks for
each of three properties of the target code: validity, soundness, and
tightness. To accomplish the proof, we propose several techniques to
specify/verify the target annotated code. First, we specify additional lemmas
that support deductions made by back-end SMT solvers. Second, we examine the
tightness property so that the code annotated the property with our proposed
comparison predicates is verified successfully. In the experiments, applying
the techniques in conjunction with the Alt-Ergo SMT solver and the Coq proof
assistant proved the entire code.

Title: Deep Weisfeiler Leman
Authors: Martin Grohe and Pascal Schweitzer and Daniel Wiebking
Categories: cs.LO cs.DM cs.DS
\\
  We introduce the framework of Deep Weisfeiler Leman algorithms (DeepWL),
which allows the design of purely combinatorial graph isomorphism tests that
are more powerful than the well-known Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.
  We prove that, as an abstract computational model, polynomial time
DeepWL-algorithms have exactly the same expressiveness as the logic Choiceless
Polynomial Time (with counting) introduced by Blass, Gurevich, and Shelah (Ann.
Pure Appl. Logic., 1999)
  It is a well-known open question whether the existence of a polynomial time
graph isomorphism test implies the existence of a polynomial time canonisation
algorithm. Our main technical result states that for each class of graphs
(satisfying some mild closure condition), if there is a polynomial time DeepWL
isomorphism test then there is a polynomial canonisation algorithm for this
class. This implies that there is also a logic capturing polynomial time on
this class.

\\
  In the semantics of stochastic rewriting systems (SRSs) based on rule
algebras, the evolution equations for average expected pattern counts are
computed via so-called commutators counting the distinct sequential
compositions of rules and observable patterns regarded as identity rules. In
this paper, we consider the commutators for conditional SRS in the
Sesqui-Pushout (SqPO) approach. However, graphs are often subject to
constraints. To minimise the construction of spurious compositions prohibited
by such constraints, we develop strategies for computing rule composition, both
theoretically and using the SMT solver Z3 with its Python interface. Our two
equivalent solutions for checking constraints include a straightforward
generate-and-test approach based on forbidden graph patterns and a modular
solution, where the patterns are decomposed as pushouts of monic spans into
forbidden relation patterns. The implementation is based on a framework that
allows a direct and modular representation of the categorical and logical
theory in Python/Z3. For an example of SqPO rewriting of rigid multigraphs
modelling polymer formation in organic chemistry, we assess and compare the
performance of the two strategies.

  Networks, vol. 6, pp. 1-17, 2020
DOI: 10.1109/TSIPN.2019.2957731
\\
  In this paper, we study resilient distributed diffusion for multi-task
estimation in the presence of adversaries where networked agents must estimate
distinct but correlated states of interest by processing streaming data. We
show that in general diffusion strategies are not resilient to malicious agents
that do not adhere to the diffusion-based information processing rules. In
particular, by exploiting the adaptive weights used for diffusing information,
we develop time-dependent attack models that drive normal agents to converge to
states selected by the attacker. We show that an attacker that has complete
knowledge of the system can always drive its targeted agents to its desired
estimates. Moreover, an attacker that does not have complete knowledge of the
system including streaming data of targeted agents or the parameters they use
in diffusion algorithms, can still be successful in deploying an attack by
approximating the needed information. The attack models can be used for both
stationary and non-stationary state estimation.In addition, we present and
analyze a resilient distributed diffusion algorithm that is resilient to any
data falsification attack in which the number of compromised agents in the
local neighborhood of a normal agent is bounded. The proposed algorithm
guarantees that all normal agents converge to their true target states if
appropriate parameters are selected. We also analyze trade-off between the
resilience of distributed diffusion and its performance in terms of
steady-state mean-square-deviation (MSD) from the correct estimates. Finally,
we evaluate the proposed attack models and resilient distributed diffusion
algorithm using stationary and non-stationary multi-target localization.

Categories: cs.MA cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Accepted for publication at International Joint Conference on Neural

\\
  Many cooperative multi-agent problems require agents to learn individual
tasks while contributing to the collective success of the group. This is a
challenging task for current state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement
algorithms that are designed to either maximize the global reward of the team
or the individual local rewards. The problem is exacerbated when either of the
rewards is sparse leading to unstable learning. To address this problem, we
present Decomposed Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DE-MADDPG):
a novel cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
simultaneously learns to maximize the global and local rewards. We evaluate our
solution on the challenging defensive escort team problem and show that our
solution achieves a significantly better and more stable performance than the
direct adaptation of the MADDPG algorithm.

its own application programs is largely used in the investigation of document

  With the advancement in personal smart devices and pervasive network
connectivity, users are no longer passive content consumers, but also
contributors in producing new contents. This expansion in live services
requires a detailed analysis of broadcasters' and viewers' behavior to maximize
users' Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we present a dataset
gathered from one of the popular live streaming platforms: Facebook. In this
dataset, we stored more than 1,500,000 live stream records collected in June
and July 2018. These data include public live videos from all over the world.
However, Facebook live API does not offer the possibility to collect online
videos with their fine grained data. The API allows to get the general data of
a stream, only if we know its ID (identifier). Therefore, using the live map
website provided by Facebook and showing the locations of online streams and
locations of viewers, we extracted video IDs and different coordinates along
with general metadata. Then, having these IDs and using the API, we can collect
the fine grained metadata of public videos that might be useful for the
research community. We also present several preliminary analyses to describe
and identify the patterns of the streams and viewers. Such fine grained details
will enable the multimedia community to recreate real-world scenarios
particularly for resource allocation, caching, computation, and transcoding in
edge networks. Existing datasets do not provide the locations of the viewers,
which limits the efforts made to allocate the multimedia resources as close as
possible to viewers and to offer better QoE.

  We propose in this paper the Wavelet-based Edge Multiscale Parareal (WEMP)
Algorithm to efficiently solve parabolic equations with heterogeneous
coefficients. This algorithm combines the advantages of multiscale methods that
can deal with heterogeneity in the spacial domain effectively, and the strength
of parareal algorithms for speeding up time evolution problems when sufficient
processors are available. We derive the convergence rate of this algorithm in
terms of the mesh size in the spatial domain, the level parameter used in the
multiscale method, the coarse-scale time step and the fine-scale time step.
Several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm, which verify our theoretical results perfectly.

Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This paper is devoted to the numerical analysis of a control constrained
distributed optimal control problem subject to a time fractional diffusion
equation with non-smooth initial data. The solutions of state and co-state are
decomposed into singular and regular parts, and some growth estimates are
obtained for the singular parts. Following the variational discretization
concept, a full discretization is applied to the corresponding state and
co-state equations by using linear conforming finite element method in space
and piecewise constant discontinuous Galerkin method in time. By the growth
estimates, error estimates are derived with non-smooth initial data. In
particular, graded temporal grids are used to obtain the first-order temporal
accuracy. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to verify the
theoretical results.

  The nonlinear convection terms in the governing equations of compressible
fluid flows are hyperbolic in nature and are nontrivial for modelling and
numerical simulation. Many numerical methods have been developed in the last
few decades for this purpose and are typically based on Riemann solvers, which
are strongly dependent on the underlying eigen-structure of the governing
equations. Objective of the present work is to develop simple algorithms which
are not dependent on the eigen-structure and yet can tackle easily the
hyperbolic parts. Central schemes with smart diffusion mechanisms are apt for
this purpose. For fixing the numerical diffusion, the basic ideas of satisfying
the Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) conditions along with generalized Riemann invariants
are proposed. Two such interesting algorithms are presented, which capture
grid-aligned steady contact discontinuities exactly and yet have sufficient
numerical diffusion to avoid numerical shock instabilities. Both the algorithms
presented are robust in avoiding shock instabilities, apart from being accurate
in capturing contact discontinuities, do not need wave speed corrections and
are independent of eigen-strutures of the underlying hyperbolic parts of the
systems.

Title: Theoretical analysis and simulation methods for Hawkes processes and

  Oscillatory systems of interacting Hawkes processes with Erlang memory
kernels were introduced in Ditlevsen (2017). They are piecewise deterministic
Markov processes (PDMP) and can be approximated by a stochastic diffusion.
First, a strong error bound between the PDMP and the diffusion is proved.
Second, moment bounds for the resulting diffusion are derived. Third,
approximation schemes for the diffusion, based on the numerical splitting
approach, are proposed. These schemes are proved to converge with mean-square
order 1 and to preserve the properties of the diffusion, in particular the
hypoellipticity, the ergodicity and the moment bounds. Finally, the PDMP and
the diffusion are compared through numerical experiments, where the PDMP is
simulated with an adapted thinning procedure.

  We consider adaptive finite element methods for second-order elliptic PDEs,
where the arising discrete systems are not solved exactly. For contractive
iterative solvers, we formulate an adaptive algorithm which monitors and steers
the adaptive mesh-refinement as well as the inexact solution of the arising
discrete systems. We prove that the proposed strategy leads to linear
convergence with optimal algebraic rates. Unlike prior works, however, we focus
on convergence rates with respect to the overall computational costs. In
explicit terms, the proposed adaptive strategy thus guarantees quasi-optimal
computational time. In particular, our analysis covers linear problems, where
the linear systems are solved by an optimally preconditioned CG method as well
as nonlinear problems with strongly monotone nonlinearity which are linearized
by the so-called Zarantonello iteration.

Title: Goal-Oriented Error Estimation for the Automatic Variationally Stable FE
  Method for Convection-Dominated Diffusion Problems
Authors: Eirik Valseth and Albert Romkes
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We present goal-oriented a posteriori error estimates for the automatic
variationally stable finite element (AVS FE) method for scalar-valued
convection-diffusion problems. The AVS-FE method is a Petrov-Galerkin method in
which the test space is broken, whereas the trial space consists of classical
FE basis functions, e.g., C0 or Raviart Thomas functions. We employ the concept
of optimal test functions of the discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG) method by
Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, leading to unconditionally stable FE
approximations. Remarkably, by using C0 or Raviart Thomas trial spaces, the
optimal discontinuous test functions can be computed in a completely decoupled
element by element fashion.
  To establish the error estimators we present two approaches: i) following the
classical approach of Becker and Rannacher, i.e., the dual solution is sought
in the (broken) test space, and ii) introducing an alternative approach in
which we seek C0, or Raviart Thomas, AVS FE approximations of the dual solution
by using the underlying strong form of the dual boundary value problem (BVP).
Various numerical verifications for 2D convection-dominated diffusion BVPs show
that the estimates of the approximation error by the new alternative method are
highly accurate, while the classical approach leads to error estimates of poor
quality. Lastly, we present an algorithm for h adaptive processes based on
control of the numerical approximation error via the new alternative approach.
Numerical verifications show that the estimator maintains high accuracy as the
error converges to zero.

Title: Robust Parameter Inversion using Adaptive Reduced Order Models

\\
  Nonlinear parametric inverse problems appear in many applications and are
typically very expensive to solve, especially if they involve many
measurements. These problems pose huge computational challenges as evaluating
the objective function or misfit requires the solution of a large number of
parameterized partial differential equations, typically one per source term.
Newton-type algorithms, which may be required for fast convergence, typically
require the additional solution of a large number of adjoint problems.
  The use of parametric model reduction may substantially alleviate this
problem. In [de Sturler, E., Gugercin, S., Kilmer, M. E., Chaturantabut, S.,
Beattie, C., and O'Connell, M. (2015). Nonlinear Parametric Inversion Using
Interpolatory Model Reduction. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 37(3)],
interpolatory model reduction was successfully used to drastically speed up
inversion for Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT). However, when using model
reduction in high dimensional parameter spaces, obtaining error bounds in
parameter space is typically intractable. In this paper, we propose to use
stochastic estimates to remedy this problem. At the cost of one (randomized)
full-scale linear solve per optimization step we obtain a robust algorithm.
Moreover, since we can now update the model when needed, this robustness allows
us to further reduce the order of the reduced order model and hence the cost of
computing and using it, further decreasing the cost of inversion. We also
propose a method to update the model reduction basis that reduces the number of
large linear solves required by 46%-98% compared with the fixed reduced-order
model. We demonstrate that this leads to a highly efficient and robust
inversion method.

Title: Input representation in recurrent neural networks dynamics
Authors: Pietro Verzelli and Cesare Alippi and Lorenzo Livi and Peter Tino
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG math.DS
\\
  Reservoir computing is a popular approach to design recurrent neural
networks, due to its training simplicity and its approximation performance. The
recurrent part of these networks is not trained (e.g. via gradient descent),
making them appealing for analytical studies, raising the interest of a vast
community of researcher spanning from dynamical systems to neuroscience. It
emerges that, even in the simple linear case, the working principle of these
networks is not fully understood and the applied research is usually driven by
heuristics. A novel analysis of the dynamics of such networks is proposed,
which allows one to express the state evolution using the controllability
matrix. Such a matrix encodes salient characteristics of the network dynamics:
in particular, its rank can be used as an input-indepedent measure of the
memory of the network. Using the proposed approach, it is possible to compare
different architectures and explain why a cyclic topology achieves favourable
results.

\\
  Multitasking optimization is an incipient research area which is lately
gaining a notable research momentum. Unlike traditional optimization paradigm
that focuses on solving a single task at a time, multitasking addresses how
multiple optimization problems can be tackled simultaneously by performing a
single search process. The main objective to achieve this goal efficiently is
to exploit synergies between the problems (tasks) to be optimized, helping each
other via knowledge transfer (thereby being referred to as Transfer
Optimization). Furthermore, the equally recent concept of Evolutionary
Multitasking (EM) refers to multitasking environments adopting concepts from
Evolutionary Computation as their inspiration for the simultaneous solving of
the problems under consideration. As such, EM approaches such as the
Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has shown a remarkable success
when dealing with multiple discrete, continuous, single-, and/or
multi-objective optimization problems. In this work we propose a novel
algorithmic scheme for Multifactorial Optimization scenarios - the
Multifactorial Cellular Genetic Algorithm (MFCGA) - that hinges on concepts
from Cellular Automata to implement mechanisms for exchanging knowledge among
problems. We conduct an extensive performance analysis of the proposed MFCGA
and compare it to the canonical MFEA under the same algorithmic conditions and
over 15 different multitasking setups (encompassing different reference
instances of the discrete Traveling Salesman Problem). A further contribution
of this analysis beyond performance benchmarking is a quantitative examination
of the genetic transferability among the problem instances, eliciting an
empirical demonstration of the synergies emerged between the different
optimization tasks along the MFCGA search process.

Title: User Association and Resource Allocation in 5G (AURA-5G): A Joint
  Optimization Framework
Authors: Akshay Jain, Elena Lopez-Aguilera, Ilker Demirkol
Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
Comments: Submitted to Elsevier Computer Networks
\\
  In this paper, we provide a novel application aware user association and
resource allocation framework, i.e., AURA-5G, which utilizes a joint
optimization strategy to accomplish the same. Concretely, our methodology
considers all the real network constraints that will be prevalent in the 5G
networks as well as practical deployment scenarios. Furthermore, AURA-5G, being
an application aware framework, considers the resource requirements of both
eMBB and mMTC services whilst performing the optimization task. We have
demonstrated that our strategy performs significantly better than the baseline
algorithm, given any of the multiple combinations of network constraints
explored in this paper. In addition, we have also presented a novel
computational complexity analysis for the AURA-5G framework as well as a
solvability and convergence time analysis. Such an analysis will be beneficial
for both industry and academia in determining the applicability and performance
of the AURA-5G framework, given the scenario and constraints. Lastly, we have
also provisioned a short study on the aspect of network re-dimensioning,
wherein we demonstrate the efficacy of the AURA-5G framework in providing
insights to the operators with regards to their deployment and how they can
utilize it to optimize the performance of their networks.

Title: Joint Optimization of Spectrum and Energy Efficiency Considering the
  C-V2X Security: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Zhipeng Liu, Yinhui Han, Jianwei Fan, Lin Zhang, Yunzhi Lin
Categories: cs.NI cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication, as a part of 5G
wireless communication, has been considered one of the most significant
techniques for Smart City. Vehicles platooning is an application of Smart City
that improves traffic capacity and safety by C-V2X. However, different from
vehicles platooning travelling on highways, C-V2X could be more easily
eavesdropped and the spectrum resource could be limited when they converge at
an intersection. Satisfying the secrecy rate of C-V2X, how to increase the
spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in the platooning network
is a big challenge. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a
Security-Aware Approach to Enhancing SE and EE Based on Deep Reinforcement
Learning, named SEED. The SEED formulates an objective optimization function
considering both SE and EE, and the secrecy rate of C-V2X is treated as a
critical constraint of this function. The optimization problem is transformed
into the spectrum and transmission power selections of V2V and V2I links using
deep Q network (DQN). The heuristic result of SE and EE is obtained by the DQN
policy based on rewards. Finally, we simulate the traffic and communication
environments using Python. The evaluation results demonstrate that the SEED
outperforms the DQN-wopa algorithm and the baseline algorithm by 31.83 % and
68.40 % in efficiency. Source code for the SEED is available at

Title: DeepSIP: A System for Predicting Service Impact of Network Failure by
  Temporal Multimodal CNN

Categories: cs.NI cs.SI stat.AP stat.ML
Comments: to appear in IEEE/IFIP International Workshop on Analytics for
  Network and Service Management (AnNet 2020)
\\
  When a failure occurs in a network, network operators need to recognize
service impact, since service impact is essential information for handling
failures. In this paper, we propose Deep learning based Service Impact
Prediction (DeepSIP), a system to predict the time to recovery from the failure
and the loss of traffic volume due to the failure in a network element using a
temporal multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN). Since the time to
recovery is useful information for a service level agreement (SLA) and the loss
of traffic volume is directly related to the severity of the failures, we
regard these as the service impact. The service impact is challenging to
predict, since a network element does not explicitly contain any information
about the service impact. Thus, we aim to predict the service impact from
syslog messages and traffic volume by extracting hidden information about
failures. To extract useful features for prediction from syslog messages and
traffic volume which are multimodal and strongly correlated, and have temporal
dependencies, we use temporal multimodal CNN. We experimentally evaluated
DeepSIP and DeepSIP reduced prediction error by approximately 50% in comparison
with other NN-based methods with a synthetic dataset.

\\
  The air-ground integrated network is a key component of future sixth
generation (6G) networks to support seamless and near-instant
super-connectivity. There is a pressing need to intelligently provision various
services in 6G networks, which however is challenging. To meet this need, in
this article, we propose a novel architecture called UaaS (UAVs as a Service)
for the air-ground integrated network, featuring UAV as a key enabler to boost
edge intelligence with the help of machine learning (ML) techniques. We
envision that the proposed UaaS architecture could intelligently provision
wireless communication service, edge computing service, and edge caching
service by a network of UAVs, making full use of UAVs' flexible deployment and
diverse ML techniques. We also conduct a case study where UAVs participate in
the model training of distributed ML among multiple terrestrial users, whose
result shows that the model training is efficient with a negligible energy
consumption of UAVs, compared to the flight energy consumption. Finally, we
discuss the challenges and open research issues in the UaaS.

  We revisit multi-tenant network virtualization in data centers, and make the

virtual switches allow cloud providers to extend fine-grained billing (known,
e.g., from serverless architectures) to the network, accounting not only for
IO, but also CPU or energy. We sketch an architecture and present economical
motivation and recent technological enablers. We also find that virtual
switches today do not offer sufficient multi-tenancy and can introduce
artificial performance bottlenecks, e.g., in load balancers. We conclude by
discussing additional use cases for tentant-specific switches.

\\
  Health monitoring is important for maintaining reliable information and
communications technology (ICT) systems. Anomaly detection methods based on
machine learning, which train a model for describing "normality" are promising
for monitoring the state of ICT systems. However, these methods cannot be used
when the type of monitored log data changes from that of training data due to
the replacement of certain equipment. Therefore, such methods may dismiss an
anomaly that appears when log data changes. To solve this problem, we propose
an ICT-systems-monitoring method with deep learning models divided based on the
correlation of log data. We also propose an algorithm for extracting the
correlations of log data from a deep learning model and separating log data
based on the correlation. When some of the log data changes, our method can
continue health monitoring with the divided models which are not affected by
changes in the log data. We present the results from experiments involving
benchmark data and real log data, which indicate that our method using divided
models does not decrease anomaly detection accuracy and a model for anomaly
detection can be divided to continue monitoring a network state even if some
the log data change.

Comments: accepted for IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium

\\
  With the increase in scale and complexity of ICT systems, their operation
increasingly requires automatic recovery from failures. Although it has become
possible to automatically detect anomalies and analyze root causes of failures
with current methods, making decisions on what commands should be executed to
recover from failures still depends on manual operation, which is quite
time-consuming. Toward automatic recovery, we propose a method of estimating
recovery commands by using Seq2Seq, a neural network model. This model learns
complex relationships between logs obtained from equipment and recovery
commands that operators executed in the past. When a new failure occurs, our
method estimates plausible commands that recover from the failure on the basis
of collected logs. We conducted experiments using a synthetic dataset and
realistic OpenStack dataset, demonstrating that our method can estimate
recovery commands with high accuracy.

Title: FlexState: Enabling Innovation in Network Function State Management
Authors: Matteo Pozza, Ashwin Rao, Diego Lugones, Sasu Tarkoma
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Network function (NF) developers need to provide highly available solutions
with diverse packet processing features at line rate. A significant challenge
in developing such functions is to build flexible software that can be adapted
to different operating environments, vendors, and operator use-cases. Today,
refactoring NF software for specific scenarios can take months. Furthermore,
network operators are increasingly adopting fast-paced development practices
for continuous software delivery to gain market advantage, which imposes even
shorter development cycles. A key aspect in NF design is state management,
which can be optimized across deployments by carefully selecting the underlying
data store. However, migrating to a data store that suits a different use-case
is time consuming because it requires code refactoring while revisiting its
application programming interfaces, APIs.
  In this paper we introduce FlexState, a state management system that
decouples the NF packet processing logic from the data store that maintains its
state. The objective is to reduce code refactoring significantly by
incorporating an abstraction layer that exposes various data stores as
configuration alternatives. Experiments show that FlexState achieves
significant flexibility in optimizing the NF state management across several
scenarios with negligible overhead.

Title: Age of Processing: Age-driven Status Sampling and Processing Offloading
  for Edge Computing-enabled Real-time IoT Applications
Authors: Rui Li and Qian Ma and Jie Gong and Zhi Zhou and Xu Chen
Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
Comments: submitted for review
\\
  The freshness of status information is of great importance for time-critical
Internet of Things (IoT) applications. A metric measuring status freshness is
the age-of-information (AoI), which captures the time elapsed from the status
being generated at the source node (e.g., a sensor) to the latest status
update.However, in intelligent IoT applications such as video surveillance, the
status information is revealed after some computation intensive and
time-consuming data processing operations, which would affect the status
freshness. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, age-of-processing (AoP),
to quantify such status freshness, which captures the time elapsed of the
newest received processed status data since it is generated. Compared with AoI,
AoP further takes the data processing time into account. Since an IoT device
has limited computation and energy resource, the device can choose to offload
the data processing to the nearby edge server under constrained status sampling
frequency.We aim to minimize the average AoP in a long-term process by jointly
optimizing the status sampling frequency and processing offloading policy. We
formulate this online problem as an infinite-horizon constrained Markov
decision process (CMDP) with average reward criterion. We then transform the
CMDP problem into an unconstrained Markov decision process (MDP) by leveraging
a Lagrangian method, and propose a Lagrangian transformation framework for the
original CMDP problem. Furthermore, we integrate the framework with
perturbation based refinement for achieving the optimal policy of the CMDP
problem. Extensive numerical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms the benchmarks, with an average AoP reduction up to 30%.

Title: Learn to Schedule (LEASCH): A Deep reinforcement learning approach for
  radio resource scheduling in the 5G MAC layer
Authors: F. AL-Tam, N. Correia, J. Rodriguez

\\
  Network management tools are usually inherited from one generation to
another. This was successful since these tools have been kept in check and
updated regularly to fit new networking goals and service requirements.
Unfortunately, new networking services will render this approach obsolete and
handcrafting new tools or upgrading the current ones may lead to complicated
systems that will be extremely difficult to maintain and improve. Fortunately,
recent advances in AI have provided new promising tools that can help solving
many network management problems. Following this interesting trend, the current
article presents LEASCH, a deep reinforcement learning model able to solve the
radio resource scheduling problem in the MAC layer of 5G networks. LEASCH is
developed and trained in a sand-box and then deployed in a 5G network. The
experimental results validate the effectiveness of LEASCH compared to
conventional baseline methods in many key performance indicators.

Title: Risk-Aware Submodular Optimization for Multi-Robot Coordination
Authors: Lifeng Zhou and Pratap Tokekar
Categories: cs.RO math.OC
Comments: contains WAFR 2018 submission arXiv:1807.09358
\\
  We study the problem of incorporating risk while making combinatorial
decisions under uncertainty. We formulate a discrete submodular maximization
problem for selecting a set using Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a risk
metric commonly used in financial analysis. While CVaR has recently been used
in optimization of linear cost functions in robotics, we take the first step
towards extending this to discrete submodular optimization and provide several
positive results. Specifically, we propose the Sequential Greedy Algorithm that
provides an approximation guarantee on finding the maxima of the CVaR cost
function under a matroidal constraint. The approximation guarantee shows that
the solution produced by our algorithm is within a constant factor of the
optimal and an additive term that depends on the optimal. Our analysis uses the
curvature of the submodular set function, and proves that the algorithm runs in
polynomial time. This formulates a number of combinatorial optimization
problems that appear in robotics. We use two such problems, vehicle assignment
under uncertainty for mobility-on-demand and sensor selection with failures for
environmental monitoring, as case studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our
formulation. In particular, for the mobility-on-demand study, we propose an
online triggering assignment algorithm that triggers a new assignment only can
potentially lead to reducing the waiting time at demand locations. We verify
the performance of the Sequential Greedy Algorithm and the online triggering
assignment algorithm through simulations.

Title: RoboMem: Giving Long Term Memory to Robots
Authors: Ifrah Idrees, Steven P. Reiss, Stefanie Tellex

Comments: Poster Paper accepted in ICRA 2019 workshop - MoRobAE - Mobile Robot
  Assistants for the Elderly
\\
  Robots have the potential to improve health monitoring outcomes for the
elderly by providing doctors, and caregivers with information about the
person's behavior, health activities and their surrounding environment. Over
the years, less work has been done to enable robots to preserve information for
longer periods of time, on the order of months and years of data, and use this
contextual information to answer queries. Time complexity to process this
massive sensor data in a timely fashion, inability to anticipate the future
queries in advance and imprecision involved in the results have been the main
impediments in making progress in this area. We make a contribution by
introducing RoboMem, a query answering system for health-care assistance of
elderly over long term; continuous data feeds that intends to overcome the
challenges of giving long term memory to robots. The design for our framework
preprocesses the sensor data and stores this preprocessed data into the
database. This data is updated in the database by going through successive
refinements, improving its accuracy for responding to queries. If data in the
database is not enough to answer a query, a small set of relevant frames (also
obtained from the database) will be reprocessed to obtain the answer. [Our
initial prototype of RoboMem stores 3.5MB of data in the database as compared
to 535.8MB of actual video frames and with minimal data in the database it is
able to fetch information fundamental to respond to queries in 0.0002 seconds
on average].

Title: Where to relocate?: Object rearrangement inside cluttered and confined
  environments for robotic manipulation
Authors: Sang Hun Cheong, Brian Y. Cho, Jinhwi Lee, ChangHwan Kim, Changjoo Nam
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)
\\
  We present an algorithm determining where to relocate objects inside a
cluttered and confined space while rearranging objects to retrieve a target
object. Although methods that decide what to remove have been proposed,
planning for the placement of removed objects inside a workspace has not
received much attention. Rather, removed objects are often placed outside the
workspace, which incurs additional laborious work (e.g., motion planning and
execution of the manipulator and the mobile base, perception of other areas).
Some other methods manipulate objects only inside the workspace but without a
principle so the rearrangement becomes inefficient.
  In this work, we consider both monotone (each object is moved only once) and
non-monotone arrangement problems which have shown to be NP-hard. Once the
sequence of objects to be relocated is given by any existing algorithm, our
method aims to minimize the number of pick-and-place actions to place the
objects until the target becomes accessible. From extensive experiments, we
show that our method reduces the number of pick-and-place actions and the total
execution time (the reduction is up to 23.1% and 28.1% respectively) compared
to baseline methods while achieving higher success rates.

Comments: This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE International
  Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS'20), Seville, Spain, Oct. 2020
\\
  In this paper, we propose an autonomous UAV path planning framework using
deep reinforcement learning approach. The objective is to employ a self-trained
UAV as a flying mobile unit to reach spatially distributed moving or static
targets in a given three dimensional urban area. In this approach, a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with continuous action space is designed
to train the UAV to navigate through or over the obstacles to reach its
assigned target. A customized reward function is developed to minimize the
distance separating the UAV and its destination while penalizing collisions.
Numerical simulations investigate the behavior of the UAV in learning the
environment and autonomously determining trajectories for different selected
scenarios.

  SLAM

\\
  Registration methods for point clouds have become a key component of many
SLAM systems on autonomous vehicles. However, an accurate estimate of the
uncertainty of such registration is a key requirement to a consistent fusion of
this kind of measurements in a SLAM filter. This estimate, which is normally
given as a covariance in the transformation computed between point cloud
reference frames, has been modelled following different approaches, among which
the most accurate is considered to be the Monte Carlo method. However, a Monte
Carlo approximation is cumbersome to use inside a time-critical application
such as online SLAM. Efforts have been made to estimate this covariance via
machine learning using carefully designed features to abstract the raw point
clouds. However, the performance of this approach is sensitive to the features
chosen. We argue that it is possible to learn the features along with the
covariance by working with the raw data and thus we propose a new approach
based on PointNet. In this work, we train this network using the KL divergence
between the learned uncertainty distribution and one computed by the Monte
Carlo method as the loss. We test the performance of the general model
presented applying it to our target use-case of SLAM with an autonomous
underwater vehicle (AUV) restricted to the 2-dimensional registration of 3D
bathymetric point clouds.

\\
  During the last decade, tensegrity systems have been the focus of numerous
investigations exploring the possibility of adopting them for planetary landing
and exploration applications. Early approaches mainly focused on locomotion
aspects related to tensegrity systems, where mobility was achieved by actuating
the cable members of the system. Later efforts focused on understanding energy
storage mechanisms of tensegrity systems undergoing landing events. More
precisely, it was shown that under highly dynamic events, buckling of
individual members of a tensegrity structure does not necessarily imply
structural failure, suggesting that efficient structural design of planetary
landers could be achieved by allowing its compression members to buckle. In
this work, we combine both aspects of previous research on tensegrity
structures, showing a possible lattice-like structural configuration able to
withstand impact events, store pre-impact kinetic energy, and utilize a part of
that energy for the locomotion process. Our work shows the feasibility of this
proposed approach via both experimental and computational means.

  On average the lack of biological markers causes a one year diagnostic delay
to detect amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To improve the diagnostic
process an automatic voice assessment based on acoustic analysis can be used.
The purpose of this work was to verify the sutability of the sustain vowel
phonation test for automatic detection of patients with ALS. We proposed
enhanced procedure for separation of voice signal into fundamental periods that
requires for calculation of perturbation measurements (such as jitter and
shimmer). Also we proposed method for quantitative assessment of pathological
vibrato manifestations in sustain vowel phonation. The study's experiments show
that using the proposed acoustic analysis methods, the classifier based on
linear discriminant analysis attains 90.7\% accuracy with 86.7\% sensitivity
and 92.2\% specificity.

Title: Characterizing the Roles of Contributors in Open-source Scientific
  Software Projects

\\
  The development of scientific software is, more than ever, critical to the
practice of science, and this is accompanied by a trend towards more open and
collaborative efforts. Unfortunately, there has been little investigation into
who is driving the evolution of such scientific software or how the
collaboration happens. In this paper, we address this problem. We present an
extensive analysis of seven open-source scientific software projects in order
to develop an empirically-informed model of the development process. This
analysis was complemented by a survey of 72 scientific software developers. In
the majority of the projects, we found senior research staff (e.g. professors)
to be responsible for half or more of commits (an average commit share of 72%)
and heavily involved in architectural concerns (seniors were more likely to
interact with files related to the build system, project meta-data, and
developer documentation). Juniors (e.g.graduate students) also contribute
substantially -- in one studied project, juniors made almost 100% of its
commits. Still, graduate students had the longest contribution periods among
juniors (with 1.72 years of commit activity compared to 0.98 years for postdocs
and 4 months for undergraduates). Moreover, we also found that third-party
contributors are scarce, contributing for just one day for the project. The
results from this study aim to help scientists to better understand their own
projects, communities, and the contributors' behavior, while paving the road
for future software engineering research

  Event logs recorded during the execution of business processes constitute a
valuable source of information. Applying process mining techniques to them,
event logs may reveal the actual process execution and enable reasoning on
quantitative or qualitative process properties. However, event logs often
contain sensitive information that could be related to individual process
stakeholders through background information and cross-correlation. We therefore
argue that, when publishing event logs, the risk of such re-identification
attacks must be considered. In this paper, we show how to quantify the
re-identification risk with measures for the individual uniqueness in event
logs. We also report on a large-scale study that explored the individual
uniqueness in a collection of publicly available event logs. Our results
suggest that potentially up to all of the cases in an event log may be
re-identified, which highlights the importance of privacy-preserving techniques
in process mining.

hosting and repository service for open-source software projects. For
researchers that study software engineering, the content that is hosted on
these platforms provides much valuable data. There are some alternatives to get
GitHub data such as GitHub Archive, GitHub API or GHTorrent. Among these
options, GHTorrent is the most widely known and used GitHub dataset in the
literature. Although there are some review studies about software engineering
challenges across the GitHub platform, no review of GHTorrent dataset-specific
research is available. In this study, the 172 studies that use GHTorrent as a
data source were categorized within the scope of software engineering
challenges and a systematic mapping study was carried out. Moreover, the pros
and cons of the dataset have been indicated and the focused issues of the

\\
  Community partition is an important problem in many areas such as biology
network, social network. The objective of this problem is to analyse the
relationships among data via the network topology. In this paper, we consider
the community partition problem under IC model in social networks. We formulate
the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem which aims at partitioning
a given social network into disjoint M communities. The objective is to
maximize the sum of influence propagation of a social network through
maximizing it within each community. The existing work shows the influence
maximization for community partition problem (IMCPP) to be NP hard. We first
prove that the objective function of IMCPP under IC model is neither submodular
nor supermodular. Then both supermodular upper bound and submodular lower bound
are constructed and proved so that the sandwich framework can be applied. A
continuous greedy algorithm and a discrete implementation are designed for
upper bound and lower bound problems and the algorithm for both of the two
problems gets a 1-1/e approximation ratio. We also devise a simply greedy to
solve the original objective function and apply the sandwich approximation
framework to it to guarantee a data dependent approximation factor. Finally,
our algorithms are evaluated on two real data sets, which clearly verifies the
effectiveness of our method in community partition problem, as well as the
advantage of our method against the other methods.

  The Huff model has been widely used in location-based business analysis for
delineating a trading area containing potential customers to a store.
Calibrating the Huff model and its extensions requires empirical location visit
data. Many studies rely on labor-intensive surveys. With the increasing
availability of mobile devices, users in location-based platforms share rich
multimedia information about their locations in a fine spatiotemporal
resolution, which offers opportunities for business intelligence. In this
research, we present a time-aware dynamic Huff model (T-Huff) for
location-based market share analysis and calibrate this model using large-scale
store visit patterns based on mobile phone location data across ten most
populated U.S. cities. By comparing the hourly visit patterns of two types of
stores, we demonstrate that the calibrated T-Huff model is more accurate than
the original Huff model in predicting the market share of different types of
business (e.g., supermarkets vs. department stores) over time. We also identify
the regional variability where people in large metropolitan areas with a
well-developed transit system show less sensitivity to long-distance visits. In
addition, several socioeconomic and demographic factors (e.g., median household
income) that potentially affect people's visit decisions are examined and
summarized.

applications. The specificity of this report is that authors try to cover

Indeed, the main purpose is to give a quick overview of standard control
engineer approaches to non familiar readers. More specifically, using a simple
toy example, we discuss the main steps control engineers usually follow.
Namely, (i) the excitation signals construction, (ii) the (continuous-time)
linear model construction and approximation, (iii) the (continuous-time)
control design, and finally, (iv) its time-domain discretisation and control
signal modulation in view of practical implementation. This report is clearly
user-oriented and thus focuses on practical aspects (using Matlab code) rather
than on theoretical ones, let to the reader's curiosity with few but relevant

  Unlike conventional generators, inverter-based generation do not possess any
rotational inertia. While grid-forming inverters can synthesize small (virtual)
inertia via advanced feedback control loops, additional control mechanisms are
needed to ensure safety and security of the power grid during transients. In
this paper, we propose novel real-time safety-constrained feedback controllers
("safety filters") for droop-based (grid-forming) inverters to ensure transient
security of the grid. The safety filter acts as a buffer between the network
operational layer and the inverter-control layer, and only lets those dispatch
control signals pass to the inverter droop-controller, which are guaranteed to
not violate the safety specifications (frequency, voltage, current limits).
Using a distributed barrier certificates method, we construct state-inclusive
bounds on the allowable control inputs, which guarantee the satisfaction of
transient safety specifications. Sum-of-square programming is used to
synthesize the safety filters. Numerical simulation results are provided to
illustrate the performance of the proposed filter in inverter-based microgrids.

  An industrial process includes many devices, variables and sub-processes that
are physically or electronically interconnected. These interconnections imply
some level of correlation between different process variables. Since most of
the alarms in a process plant are defined on process variables, alarms are also
correlated. But this can be a nuisance to operators, for one fault might
trigger a, sometimes large, number of alarms. So, it is important to find and
correct correlated alarms. In this paper, we study different methods and
techniques that were proposed to measure correlation or similarity between
alarms. The similarity indices are first analytically calculated and then
studied. The results are also validated using Monte Carlo simulation.

Title: Adaptive Distributed Observer for an Uncertain Leader over General

Authors: Shimin Wang
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  In this paper, we propose a new technique to handle the general directed
graph and we also apply it to analyze the adaptive distributed observer for an
uncertain leader. The general directed graph can be found in many cooperative
control problems, these problems involved the general directed graph can be
solved rely on some assumptions such as undirected graph, detailed balanced
graph and directed acyclic graph. We first design a different parameter for
each agent to tackle the general directed graph and prove the existence of the
parameter for each agent. An adaptive distributed observer for an uncertain
neutrally stable leader system has been established over undirected connected
graphs and directed acyclic graphs. We further investigate the validity of the
adaptive distributed observer for an uncertain leader subject to general
directed graphs. We first establish a useful lemma to handle the general
directed graph. Then, a set of solvability conditions are given that guarantees
that our proposed adaptive distributed observer can estimate the state and the
uncertain parameters of the leader system.

Title: Sparse Sensing for $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ Optimal Observer
  Design with Bounded Errors
Authors: Vedang M. Deshpande and Raktim Bhattacharya
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  In this paper, we simultaneously determine the optimal sensor precision and
the observer gain, which achieves the specified accuracy in the state
estimates. Along with the unknown observer gain, the formulation parameterizes
the scaling of the exogenous inputs that correspond to the sensor noise.
Reciprocal of this scaling is defined as the sensor precision, and sparseness
is achieved by minimizing the $l_1$ norm of the precision vector. The
optimization is performed with constraints guaranteeing specified accuracy in
state estimates, which are defined in terms of $\mathcal{H}_2$ or
$\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norms of the error dynamics. The results presented in
this paper are applied to the linearized longitudinal model of an F-16
aircraft.

Title: Kalman Filtering with Probabilistic Uncertainty in System Parameters
Authors: Sunsoo Kim, Vedang M. Deshpande and Raktim Bhattacharya
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In this paper, we propose a robust Kalman filtering framework for systems
with probabilistic uncertainty in system parameters. We consider two cases,
namely discrete time systems, and continuous time systems with discrete
measurements. The uncertainty, characterized by mean and variance of the
states, is propagated using conditional expectations and polynomial chaos
expansion framework. The results obtained using the proposed filter are
compared with existing robust filters in the literature. The proposed filter
demonstrates better performance in terms of root mean squared error and rate of
convergence.

Title: Real-Time Dispatching of Large-Scale Ride-Sharing Systems: Integrating
  Optimization, Machine Learning, and Model Predictive Control
Authors: Connor Riley and Pascal Van Hentenryck and Enpeng Yuan
Categories: math.OC cs.AI
\\
  This paper considers the dispatching of large-scale real-time ride-sharing
systems to address congestion issues faced by many cities. The goal is to serve
all customers (service guarantees) with a small number of vehicles while
minimizing waiting times under constraints on ride duration. This paper
proposes an end-to-end approach that tightly integrates a state-of-the-art
dispatching algorithm, a machine-learning model to predict zone-to-zone demand
over time, and a model predictive control optimization to relocate idle
vehicles. Experiments using historic taxi trips in New York City indicate that
this integration decreases average waiting times by about 30% over all test
cases and reaches close to 55% on the largest instances for high-demand zones.

Title: The influence of initial perturbation power spectra on the growth of a
  turbulent mixing layer induced by Richtmyer-Meshkov instability
Authors: Michael Groom and Ben Thornber
Categories: physics.flu-dyn cs.CE
Journal-ref: Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 2020, 132463
DOI: 10.1016/j.physd.2020.132463
\\
  This paper investigates the influence of different broadband perturbations on
the evolution of a Richtmyer--Meshkov turbulent mixing layer initiated by a
Mach 1.84 shock traversing a perturbed interface separating gases with a
density ratio of 3:1. Both the bandwidth of modes in the interface
perturbation, as well as their relative amplitudes, are varied in a series of
carefully designed numerical simulations at grid resolutions up to
$3.2\times10^9$ cells. Three different perturbations are considered,
characterised by a power spectrum of the form $P(k)\propto k^m$ where $m=-1$,
$-2$ and $-3$. The growth of the mixing layer is shown to strongly depend on
the initial conditions, with the growth rate exponent $\theta$ found to be
$0.5$, $0.63$ and $0.75$ for each value of $m$ at the highest grid resolution.
The asymptotic values of the molecular mixing fraction $\Theta$ are also shown
to vary significantly with $m$; at the latest time considered $\Theta$ is
$0.56$, $0.39$ and $0.20$ respectively. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is also
analysed in both the temporal and spectral domains. The temporal decay rate of
TKE is found not to match the predicted value of $n=2-3\theta$, which is shown
to be due to a time-varying {normalised dissipation rate $C_\epsilon$}. In
spectral space, the data follow the theoretical scaling of $k^{(m+2)/2}$ at low
wavenumbers and tend towards $k^{-3/2}$ and $k^{-5/3}$ scalings at high
wavenumbers for the spectra of transverse and normal velocity components
respectively. The results represent a significant extension of previous work on
the Richtmyer--Meshkov instability evolving from broadband initial
perturbations and provide useful benchmarks for future research.

\\
  Cribriform growth patterns in prostate carcinoma are associated with poor
prognosis. We aimed to introduce a deep learning method to detect such patterns
automatically. To do so, convolutional neural network was trained to detect
cribriform growth patterns on 128 prostate needle biopsies. Ensemble learning
taking into account other tumor growth patterns during training was used to
cope with heterogeneous and limited tumor tissue occurrences. ROC and FROC
analyses were applied to assess network performance regarding detection of
biopsies harboring cribriform growth pattern. The ROC analysis yielded an area
under the curve up to 0.82. FROC analysis demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.9 for
regions larger than 0.0150 mm2 with on average 6.8 false positives. To
benchmark method performance for intra-observer annotation variability, false
positive and negative detections were re-evaluated by the pathologists.
Pathologists considered 9% of the false positive regions as cribriform, and 11%
as possibly cribriform; 44% of the false negative regions were not annotated as
cribriform. As a final experiment, the network was also applied on a dataset of
60 biopsy regions annotated by 23 pathologists. With the cut-off reaching
highest sensitivity, all images annotated as cribriform by at least 7/23 of the
pathologists, were all detected as cribriform by the network. In conclusion,
the proposed deep learning method has high sensitivity for detecting cribriform
growth patterns at the expense of a limited number of false positives. It can
detect cribriform regions that are labelled as such by at least a minority of
pathologists. Therefore, it could assist clinical decision making by suggesting
suspicious regions.

Title: Learning regularization and intensity-gradient-based fidelity for single
  image super resolution
Authors: Hu Liang, Shengrong Zhao
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  How to extract more and useful information for single image super resolution
is an imperative and difficult problem. Learning-based method is a
representative method for such task. However, the results are not so stable as
there may exist big difference between the training data and the test data. The
regularization-based method can effectively utilize the self-information of
observation. However, the degradation model used in regularization-based method
just considers the degradation in intensity space. It may not reconstruct
images well as the degradation reflections in various feature space are not
considered. In this paper, we first study the image degradation progress, and
establish degradation model both in intensity and gradient space. Thus, a
comprehensive data consistency constraint is established for the
reconstruction. Consequently, more useful information can be extracted from the
observed data. Second, the regularization term is learned by a designed
symmetric residual deep neural-network. It can search similar external
information from a predefined dataset avoiding the artificial tendency.
Finally, the proposed fidelity term and designed regularization term are
embedded into the regularization framework. Further, an optimization method is
developed based on the half-quadratic splitting method and the pseudo conjugate
method. Experimental results indicated that the subjective and the objective
metric corresponding to the proposed method were better than those obtained by
the comparison methods.

Title: Organ Segmentation From Full-size CT Images Using Memory-Efficient FCN
Authors: Chenglong Wang, Masahiro Oda, Kensaku Mori
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Journal-ref: Proc. SPIE 11314, Medical Imaging 2020: Computer-Aided Diagnosis,

DOI: 10.1117/12.2551024
\\
  In this work, we present a memory-efficient fully convolutional network (FCN)
incorporated with several memory-optimized techniques to reduce the run-time
GPU memory demand during training phase. In medical image segmentation tasks,
subvolume cropping has become a common preprocessing. Subvolumes (or small
patch volumes) were cropped to reduce GPU memory demand. However, small patch
volumes capture less spatial context that leads to lower accuracy. As a pilot
study, the purpose of this work is to propose a memory-efficient FCN which
enables us to train the model on full size CT image directly without subvolume
cropping, while maintaining the segmentation accuracy. We optimize our network
from both architecture and implementation. With the development of computing
hardware, such as graphics processing unit (GPU) and tensor processing unit
(TPU), now deep learning applications is able to train networks with large
datasets within acceptable time. Among these applications, semantic
segmentation using fully convolutional network (FCN) also has gained a
significant improvement against traditional image processing approaches in both
computer vision and medical image processing fields. However, unlike general
color images used in computer vision tasks, medical images have larger scales
than color images such as 3D computed tomography (CT) images, micro CT images,
and histopathological images. For training these medical images, the large
demand of computing resource become a severe problem. In this paper, we present
a memory-efficient FCN to tackle the high GPU memory demand challenge in organ
segmentation problem from clinical CT images. The experimental results
demonstrated that our GPU memory demand is about 40% of baseline architecture,
parameter amount is about 30% of the baseline.

  Automatic surgical phase recognition is a challenging and crucial task with
the potential to improve patient safety and become an integral part of
intra-operative decision-support systems. In this paper, we propose, for the
first time in workflow analysis, a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network
(MS-TCN) that performs hierarchical prediction refinement for surgical phase
recognition. Causal, dilated convolutions allow for a large receptive field and
online inference with smooth predictions even during ambiguous transitions. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated on two datasets of laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos with and without the use of additional surgical tool information.
Outperforming various state-of-the-art LSTM approaches, we verify the
suitability of the proposed causal MS-TCN for surgical phase recognition.

Title: Estimating Uncertainty and Interpretability in Deep Learning for
  Coronavirus (COVID-19) Detection
Authors: Biraja Ghoshal, Allan Tucker
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep Learning has achieved state of the art performance in medical imaging.
However, these methods for disease detection focus exclusively on improving the
accuracy of classification or predictions without quantifying uncertainty in a
decision. Knowing how much confidence there is in a computer-based medical
diagnosis is essential for gaining clinicians trust in the technology and
therefore improve treatment. Today, the 2019 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
infections are a major healthcare challenge around the world. Detecting
COVID-19 in X-ray images is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and treatment.
However, diagnostic uncertainty in the report is a challenging and yet
inevitable task for radiologist. In this paper, we investigate how drop-weights
based Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) can estimate uncertainty in
Deep Learning solution to improve the diagnostic performance of the
human-machine team using publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset and
show that the uncertainty in prediction is highly correlates with accuracy of
prediction. We believe that the availability of uncertainty-aware deep learning
solution will enable a wider adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a
clinical setting.

\\
  The emerging area of computational pathology (CPath) is ripe ground for the
application of deep learning (DL) methods to healthcare due to the sheer volume
of raw pixel data in whole-slide images (WSIs) of cancerous tissue slides,
generally of the order of $100K{\times}80K$ pixels. However, it is imperative
for the DL algorithms relying on nuclei-level details to be able to cope with
data from `the clinical wild', which tends to be quite challenging.
  We study, and extend recently released PanNuke dataset consisting of more
than 200,000 nuclei categorized into 5 clinically important classes for the
challenging tasks of detecting, segmenting and classifying nuclei in WSIs
\footnote{Download dataset here
\href{https://jgamper.github.io/PanNukeDataset}{https://jgamper.github.io/PanNukeDataset}}
\cite{gamper_pannuke:_2019}. Previous pan-cancer datasets consisted of only up
to 9 different tissues and up to 21,000 unlabeled nuclei \cite{kumar2019multi}
and just over 24,000 labeled nuclei with segmentation masks
\cite{graham_hover-net:_2019}. PanNuke consists of 19 different tissue types
from over 20,000 WSIs that have been semi-automatically annotated and quality
controlled by clinical pathologists, leading to a dataset with statistics
similar to `the clinical wild' and with minimal selection bias. We study the
performance of segmentation and classification models when applied to the
proposed dataset and demonstrate the application of models trained on PanNuke
to whole-slide images. We provide comprehensive statistics about the dataset
and outline recommendations and research directions to address the limitations
of existing DL tools when applied to real-world CPath applications.

Title: Registration by tracking for sequential 2D MRI
Authors: Niklas Gunnarsson, Jens Sj\"olund and Thomas B. Sch\"on
Categories: physics.med-ph cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: Currently under review for a conference
\\
  Our anatomy is in constant motion. With modern MR imaging it is possible to
record this motion in real-time during an ongoing radiation therapy session. In
this paper we present an image registration method that exploits the sequential
nature of 2D MR images to estimate the corresponding displacement field. The
method employs several discriminative correlation filters that independently
track specific points. Together with a sparse-to-dense interpolation scheme we
can then estimate of the displacement field. The discriminative correlation
filters are trained online, and our method is modality agnostic. For the
interpolation scheme we use a neural network with normalized convolutions that
is trained using synthetic diffeomorphic displacement fields. The method is
evaluated on a segmented cardiac dataset and when compared to two conventional
methods we observe an improved performance. This improvement is especially
pronounced when it comes to the detection of larger motions of small objects.

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  This paper focuses on finding the most optimal pre-processing methods
considering three common algorithms for image enhancement: Brightening, CLAHE
and Retinex. For the purpose of image training in general, these methods will
be combined to find out the most optimal method for image enhancement. We have
carried out the research on the different permutation of three methods:
Brightening, CLAHE and Retinex. The evaluation is based on Canny Edge detection
applied to all processed images. Then the sharpness of objects will be
justified by true positive pixels number in comparison between images. After
using different number combinations pre-processing functions on images, CLAHE
proves to be the most effective in edges improvement, Brightening does not show
much effect on the edges enhancement, and the Retinex even reduces the
sharpness of images and shows little contribution on images enhancement.

  Soil moisture is critical component of crop health and monitoring it can
enable further actions for increasing yield or preventing catastrophic die off.
As climate change increases the likelihood of extreme weather events and
reduces the predictability of weather, and non-optimal soil moistures for crops
may become more likely. In this work, we a series of LSTM architectures to
analyze measurements of soil moisture and vegetation indiced derived from
satellite imagery. The system learns to predict the future values of these
measurements. These spatially sparse values and indices are used as input
features to an interpolation method that infer spatially dense moisture map for
a future time point. This has the potential to provide advance warning for soil
moistures that may be inhospitable to crops across an area with limited

\\
  The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), with a starting point in China, has
spread rapidly among people living in other countries, and is approaching
approximately 305,275 cases worldwide according to the statistics of European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. There are a limited number of
COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals due to the increasing cases daily.
Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic detection system as a
quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19 spreading among people.
In this study, three different convolutional neural network based models
(ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) have been proposed for the
detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patient using chest X-ray
radiographs. ROC analyses and confusion matrices by these three models are
given and analyzed using 5-fold cross validation. Considering the performance
results obtained, it is seen that the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the
highest classification performance with 98% accuracy among other two proposed
models (97% accuracy for InceptionV3 and 87% accuracy for Inception-ResNetV2).

Title: Learning to Reconstruct Confocal Microscopy Stacks from Single Light

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV physics.optics
Comments: 22 pages, 12 figures
\\
  We present a novel deep learning approach to reconstruct confocal microscopy
stacks from single light field images. To perform the reconstruction, we
introduce the LFMNet, a novel neural network architecture inspired by the U-Net
design. It is able to reconstruct with high-accuracy a 112x112x57.6$\mu m^3$
volume (1287x1287x64 voxels) in 50ms given a single light field image of
1287x1287 pixels, thus dramatically reducing 720-fold the time for confocal
scanning of assays at the same volumetric resolution and 64-fold the required
storage. To prove the applicability in life sciences, our approach is evaluated
both quantitatively and qualitatively on mouse brain slices with fluorescently
labelled blood vessels. Because of the drastic reduction in scan time and
storage space, our setup and method are directly applicable to real-time in
vivo 3D microscopy. We provide analysis of the optical design, of the network
architecture and of our training procedure to optimally reconstruct volumes for
a given target depth range. To train our network, we built a data set of 362
light field images of mouse brain blood vessels and the corresponding aligned
set of 3D confocal scans, which we use as ground truth. The data set will be
made available for research purposes.

Title: Tractogram filtering of anatomically non-plausible fibers with geometric
  deep learning

\\
  Tractograms are virtual representations of the white matter fibers of the
brain. They are of primary interest for tasks like presurgical planning, and
investigation of neuroplasticity or brain disorders. Each tractogram is
composed of millions of fibers encoded as 3D polylines. Unfortunately, a large
portion of those fibers are not anatomically plausible and can be considered
artifacts of the tracking algorithms. Common methods for tractogram filtering
are based on signal reconstruction, a principled approach, but unable to
consider the knowledge of brain anatomy. In this work, we address the problem
of tractogram filtering as a supervised learning problem by exploiting the
ground truth annotations obtained with a recent heuristic method, which labels
fibers as either anatomically plausible or non-plausible according to
well-established anatomical properties. The intuitive idea is to model a fiber
as a point cloud and the goal is to investigate whether and how a geometric
deep learning model might capture its anatomical properties. Our contribution
is an extension of the Dynamic Edge Convolution model that exploits the
sequential relations of points in a fiber and discriminates with high accuracy
plausible/non-plausible fibers.

\\
  Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) when run in a synchronous
manner, suffers from delays in runtime as it waits for the slowest workers
(stragglers). Asynchronous methods can alleviate stragglers, but cause gradient
staleness that can adversely affect the convergence error. In this work, we
present a novel theoretical characterization of the speedup offered by
asynchronous methods by analyzing the trade-off between the error in the
trained model and the actual training runtime(wallclock time). The main novelty
in our work is that our runtime analysis considers random straggling delays,
which helps us design and compare distributed SGD algorithms that strike a
balance between straggling and staleness. We also provide a new error
convergence analysis of asynchronous SGD variants without bounded or
exponential delay assumptions. Finally, based on our theoretical
characterization of the error-runtime trade-off, we propose a method of
gradually varying synchronicity in distributed SGD and demonstrate its
performance on CIFAR10 dataset.

Title: Privacy-preserving Incremental ADMM for Decentralized Consensus
  Optimization
Authors: Yu Ye, Hao Chen, Ming Xiao, Mikael Skoglund, H. Vincent Poor
Categories: math.OC cs.DC
\\
  The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been recently
recognized as a promising optimizer for large-scale machine learning models.
However, there are very few results studying ADMM from the aspect of
communication costs, especially jointly with privacy preservation, which are
critical for distributed learning. We investigate the communication efficiency
and privacy-preservation of ADMM by solving the consensus optimization problem
over decentralized networks. Since walk algorithms can reduce communication
load, we first propose incremental ADMM (I-ADMM) based on the walk algorithm,
the updating order of which follows a Hamiltonian cycle instead. However,
I-ADMM cannot guarantee the privacy for agents against external eavesdroppers
even if the randomized initialization is applied. To protect privacy for
agents, we then propose two privacy-preserving incremental ADMM algorithms,
i.e., PI-ADMM1 and PI-ADMM2, where perturbation over step sizes and primal
variables is adopted, respectively. Through theoretical analyses, we prove the
convergence and privacy preservation for PI-ADMM1, which are further supported
by numerical experiments. Besides, simulations demonstrate that the proposed
PI-ADMM1 and PI-ADMM2 algorithms are communication efficient compared with
state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Notes on Equitable Partition into Matching Forests in Mixed Graphs and
  into $b$-branchings in Digraphs
Authors: Kenjiro Takazawa
Categories: math.CO cs.DM cs.DS
\\
  An equitable partition into branchings in a digraph is a partition of the arc
set into branchings such that the sizes of any two branchings differ at most by
one. For a digraph whose arc set can be partitioned into $k$ branchings, there
always exists an equitable partition into $k$ branchings. In this paper, we
present two extensions of equitable partitions into branchings in digraphs:
those into matching forests in mixed graphs; and into $b$-branchings in
digraphs. For matching forests, Kir\'{a}ly and Yokoi (2018) considered a
tricriteria equitability based on the sizes of the matching forest, and the
matching and branching therein. In contrast to this, we introduce a
single-criterion equitability based on the number of the covered vertices. For
$b$-branchings, we define an equitability based on the size of the
$b$-branching and the indegrees of all vertices. For both matching forests and
$b$-branchings, we prove that equitable partitions always exist.

Title: Fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking over time-varying
  communication networks with linear convergence rate
Authors: Mattia Bianchi, Sergio Grammatico
Categories: math.OC cs.GT cs.MA
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.09335
\\
  We design a distributed algorithm for learning Nash equilibria over
time-varying communication networks in a partial-decision information scenario,
where each agent can access its own cost function and local feasible set, but
can only observe the actions of some neighbors. Our algorithm is based on
projected pseudo-gradient dynamics, augmented with consensual terms. Under
strong monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity of the game mapping, we provide a
very simple proof of linear convergence, based on a contractivity property of
the iterates. Compared to similar solutions proposed in literature, we also
allow for a time-varying communication and derive tighter bounds on the step
sizes that ensure convergence. In fact, our numerical simulations show that our
algorithm outperforms the existing gradient-based methods. Finally, to relax
the assumptions on the network structure, we propose a different
pseudo-gradient algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge on time-varying
balanced directed graphs.

Title: Hessian metric via transport information geometry
Authors: Wuchen Li
Categories: math.DG cs.IT math-ph math.IT math.MP
\\
  We propose to study the Hessian metric of given functional in the space of
probability space embedded with $L^2$--Wasserstein (optimal transport) metric.
We name it transport Hessian metric, which contains and extends the classical
$L^2$--Wasserstein metric. We formulate several dynamical systems associated
with transport Hessian metrics. Several connections between transport Hessian
metrics and math physics equations are discovered. E.g., the transport Hessian
gradient flow, including Newton's flow, formulates a mean-field kernel Stein
variational gradient flow; The transport Hessian Hamiltonian flow of negative
Boltzmann-Shannon entropy forms the Shallow water's equation; The transport
Hessian gradient flow of Fisher information forms the heat equation. Several
examples and closed-form solutions of finite-dimensional transport Hessian
metrics and dynamics are presented.

Title: Robust Beamforming Design for Sum Secrecy Rate Optimization in MU-MISO
  Networks
Authors: Pu Zhao, Meng Zhang, Hui Yu, Hanwen Luo and Wen Chen
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: TIFS
\\
  This paper studies the beamforming design problem of a multi-user downlink
network, assuming imperfect channel state information known to the base
station. In this scenario, the base station is equipped with multiple antennas,
and each user is wiretapped by a specific eavesdropper where each user or
eavesdropper is equipped with one antenna. It is supposed that the base station
employs transmit beamforming with a given requirement on sum transmitting
power. The objective is to maximize the sum secrecy rate of the network. Due to
the uncertainty of the channel, it is difficult to calculate the exact sum
secrecy rate of the system. Thus, the maximum of lower bound of sum secrecy
rate is considered. The optimization of the lower bound of sum secrecy rate
still makes the considered beamforming design problem difficult to handle. To
solve this problem, a beamforming design scheme is proposed to transform the
original problem into a convex approximation problem, by employing semidefinite
relaxation and first-order approximation technique based on Taylor expansion.
Besides, with the advantage of low complexity, a zero-forcing based beamforming
method is presented in the case that base station is able to nullify the
eavesdroppers' rate. When the base station doesn't have the ability, user
selection algorithm would be in use. Numerical results show that the former
strategy achieves better performance than the latter one, which is mainly due
to the ability of optimizing beamforming direction, and both outperform the
signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio based algorithm.

Title: Improved Spectral Imaging Microscopy for Cultural Heritage through
  Oblique Illumination
Authors: Lindsay Oakley, Stephanie Zaleski, Billie Males, Ollie Cossairt, Marc
  Walton
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG physics.optics
\\
  This work presents the development of a flexible microscopic chemical imaging
platform for cultural heritage that utilizes wavelength-tunable oblique
illumination from a point source to obtain per-pixel reflectance spectra in the
VIS-NIR range. The microscope light source can be adjusted on two axes allowing
for a hemisphere of possible illumination directions. The synthesis of multiple
illumination angles allows for the calculation of surface normal vectors,
similar to phase gradients, and axial optical sectioning. The extraction of
spectral reflectance images with high spatial resolutions from these data is
demonstrated through the analysis of a replica cross-section, created from
known painting reference materials, as well as a sample extracted from a
painting by Pablo Picasso entitled La Mis\'ereuse accroupie (1902). These case
studies show the rich microscale molecular information that may be obtained
using this microscope and how the instrument overcomes challenges for spectral
analysis commonly encountered on works of art with complex matrices composed of
both inorganic minerals and organic lakes.

Title: Neural Networks and Polynomial Regression. Demystifying the
  Overparametrization Phenomena
Authors: Matt Emschwiller, David Gamarnik, Eren C. K{\i}z{\i}lda\u{g}, Ilias
  Zadik
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG cs.NE math.ST stat.TH
Comments: 59 pages, 3 figures
\\
  In the context of neural network models, overparametrization refers to the
phenomena whereby these models appear to generalize well on the unseen data,
even though the number of parameters significantly exceeds the sample sizes,
and the model perfectly fits the in-training data. A conventional explanation
of this phenomena is based on self-regularization properties of algorithms used
to train the data. In this paper we prove a series of results which provide a
somewhat diverging explanation. Adopting a teacher/student model where the
teacher network is used to generate the predictions and student network is
trained on the observed labeled data, and then tested on out-of-sample data, we
show that any student network interpolating the data generated by a teacher
network generalizes well, provided that the sample size is at least an explicit
quantity controlled by data dimension and approximation guarantee alone,
regardless of the number of internal nodes of either teacher or student
network.
  Our claim is based on approximating both teacher and student networks by
polynomial (tensor) regression models with degree depending on the desired
accuracy and network depth only. Such a parametrization notably does not depend
on the number of internal nodes. Thus a message implied by our results is that
parametrizing wide neural networks by the number of hidden nodes is misleading,
and a more fitting measure of parametrization complexity is the number of
regression coefficients associated with tensorized data. In particular, this
somewhat reconciles the generalization ability of neural networks with more
classical statistical notions of data complexity and generalization bounds. Our
empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets indeed confirm that
tensorized regression achieves a good out-of-sample performance, even when the
degree of the tensor is at most two.

Title: Training a U-Net based on a random mode-coupling matrix model to recover
  acoustic interference striations
Authors: Xiaolei Li, Wenhua Song, Dazhi Gao, Wei Gao and Haozhong Wan
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG eess.SP physics.app-ph
\\
  A U-Net is trained to recover acoustic interference striations (AISs) from
distorted ones. A random mode-coupling matrix model is introduced to generate a
large number of training data quickly, which are used to train the U-Net. The
performance of AIS recovery of the U-Net is tested in range-dependent
waveguides with nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs). Although the random
mode-coupling matrix model is not an accurate physical model, the test results
show that the U-Net successfully recovers AISs under different signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) and different amplitudes and widths of NLIWs for different
shapes.

Title: Quantum circuit-like learning: A fast and scalable classical
  machine-learning algorithm with similar performance to quantum circuit
  learning
Authors: Naoko Koide-Majima, Kei Majima
Categories: quant-ph cs.LG
Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures
\\
  The application of near-term quantum devices to machine learning (ML) has
attracted much attention. In one such attempt, Mitarai et al. (2018) proposed a
framework to use a quantum circuit for supervised ML tasks, which is called
quantum circuit learning (QCL). Due to the use of a quantum circuit, QCL can
employ an exponentially high-dimensional Hilbert space as its feature space.
However, its efficiency compared to classical algorithms remains unexplored. In
this study, using a statistical technique called count sketch, we propose a
classical ML algorithm that uses the same Hilbert space. In numerical
simulations, our proposed algorithm demonstrates similar performance to QCL for
several ML tasks. This provides a new perspective with which to consider the
computational and memory efficiency of quantum ML algorithms.

Title: Generative ODE Modeling with Known Unknowns
Authors: Ori Linial, Danny Eytan, Uri Shalit
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  In several crucial applications, domain knowledge is encoded by a system of
ordinary differential equations (ODE). A motivating example is intensive care
unit patients: The dynamics of some vital physiological variables such as heart
rate, blood pressure and arterial compliance can be approximately described by
a known system of ODEs. Typically, some of the ODE variables are directly
observed while some are unobserved, and in addition many other variables are
observed but not modeled by the ODE, for example body temperature. Importantly,
the unobserved ODE variables are ``known-unknowns'': We know they exist and
their functional dynamics, but cannot measure them directly, nor do we know the
function tying them to all observed measurements. Estimating these
known-unknowns is often highly valuable to physicians. Under this scenario we
wish to: (i) learn the static parameters of the ODE generating each observed
time-series (ii) infer the dynamic sequence of all ODE variables including the
known-unknowns, and (iii) extrapolate the future of the ODE variables and the
observations of the time-series. We address this task with a variational
autoencoder incorporating the known ODE function, called GOKU-net for
Generative ODE modeling with Known Unknowns. We test our method on videos of
pendulums with unknown length, and a model of the cardiovascular system.

Title: Quantifying the relationship between student enrollment patterns and
  student performance
Authors: Shahab Boumi, Adan Vela, Jacquelyn Chini
Categories: physics.ed-ph cs.LG stat.AP stat.ML
\\
  College students are enrolled at each semester with either part time or full
time status. While most of the students keep an overall constant enrollment
status during their education period, some of them may frequently change their
status between full time and part time from one semester to the next. The goal
of this research is to exploit the historic patterns to estimate and categorize
students$'$ strategy in three different groups of part time, full time and
mixed, investigate the educational features of each group and compare their
performance. Enrollment strategy refers to the student$'$s mindset for
enrollment plan and in one way can be captured from the student$'$s historic
enrollment status. Data is collected from the University of Central Florida
from 2008 to 2017 and Hidden Markov Model is applied to identify different
types of student strategy. Results show that students with Mixed Enrollment
Strategy (MES) have features (ex. time to graduation and graduation and halt
enrollment ratio) and performances (ex. cumulative GPA) relatively between
students with Full time Enrollment Strategy (FES) and students with Part time
Enrollment Strategy (PES).

Title: An Inverse-free Truncated Rayleigh-Ritz Method for Sparse Generalized
  Eigenvalue Problem
Authors: Yunfeng Cai and Ping Li
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  This paper considers the sparse generalized eigenvalue problem (SGEP), which
aims to find the leading eigenvector with at most $k$ nonzero entries. SGEP
naturally arises in many applications in machine learning, statistics, and
scientific computing, for example, the sparse principal component analysis
(SPCA), the sparse discriminant analysis (SDA), and the sparse canonical
correlation analysis (SCCA). In this paper, we focus on the development of a
three-stage algorithm named {\em inverse-free truncated Rayleigh-Ritz method}
({\em IFTRR}) to efficiently solve SGEP. In each iteration of IFTRR, only a
small number of matrix-vector products is required. This makes IFTRR
well-suited for large scale problems. Particularly, a new truncation strategy
is proposed, which is able to find the support set of the leading eigenvector
effectively. Theoretical results are developed to explain why IFTRR works well.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the merits of IFTRR.

Title: Finite-Time Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent under Markov
  Randomness
Authors: Thinh T. Doan, Lam M. Nguyen, Nhan H. Pham, Justin Romberg
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
\\
  Motivated by broad applications in reinforcement learning and machine
learning, this paper considers the popular stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
when the gradients of the underlying objective function are sampled from Markov
processes. This Markov sampling leads to the gradient samples being biased and
not independent. The existing results for the convergence of SGD under Markov
randomness are often established under the assumptions on the boundedness of
either the iterates or the gradient samples. Our main focus is to study the
finite-time convergence of SGD for different types of objective functions,
without requiring these assumptions. We show that SGD converges nearly at the
same rate with Markovian gradient samples as with independent gradient samples.
The only difference is a logarithmic factor that accounts for the mixing time
of the Markov chain.

Title: Solving the Robust Matrix Completion Problem via a System of Nonlinear
  Equations
Authors: Yunfeng Cai and Ping Li
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We consider the problem of robust matrix completion, which aims to recover a
low rank matrix $L_*$ and a sparse matrix $S_*$ from incomplete observations of
their sum $M=L_*+S_*\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$. Algorithmically, the robust
matrix completion problem is transformed into a problem of solving a system of
nonlinear equations, and the alternative direction method is then used to solve
the nonlinear equations. In addition, the algorithm is highly parallelizable
and suitable for large scale problems. Theoretically, we characterize the
sufficient conditions for when $L_*$ can be approximated by a low rank
approximation of the observed $M_*$. And under proper assumptions, it is shown
that the algorithm converges to the true solution linearly. Numerical
simulations show that the simple method works as expected and is comparable
with state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Learning-based Handover in Mobile Millimeter-wave Networks
Authors: Sara Khosravi, Hossein S. Ghadikolaei, and Marina Petrova
Categories: eess.SP cs.NI
\\
  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is considered as a key enabler of
ultra-high data rates in the future cellular and wireless networks. The need
for directional communication between base stations (BSs) and users in mmWave
systems, that is achieved through beamforming, increases the complexity of the
channel estimation. Moreover, in order to provide better coverage, dense
deployment of BSs is required which causes frequent handovers and increased
association overhead. In this paper, we present an approach that jointly
addresses the beamforming and handover problems. Our solution entails an
efficient beamforming method with a minimum number of pilots and a
learning-based handover method supporting mobile scenarios. We use
reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal choices of the backup BSs
in different locations of a mobile user. We show that our method provides high
rate and reliability in all locations of the user's trajectory with a minimal
number of handovers. Simulation results in an outdoor environment based on
geometric mmWave channel modeling and real building map data show the superior
performance of our proposed solution in achievable instantaneous rate and
trajectory rate.

  We present preliminary results of a GPU porting of all main Gadget3 modules
(gravity computation, SPH density computation, SPH hydrodynamic force, and
thermal conduction) using OpenACC directives. Here we assign one GPU to each
MPI rank and exploit both the host and accellerator capabilities by overlapping
computations on the CPUs and GPUs: while GPUs asynchronously compute
interactions between particles within their MPI ranks, CPUs perform tree-walks
and MPI communications of neighbouring particles. We profile various portions
of the code to understand the origin of our speedup, where we find that a peak
speedup is not achieved because of time-steps with few active particles. We run
a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation from the Magneticum project, with
$2\cdot10^{7}$ particles, where we find a final total speedup of $\approx 2.$
We also present the results of an encouraging scaling test of a preliminary
gravity-only OpenACC porting, run in the context of the EuroHack17 event, where
the prototype of the porting proved to keep a constant speedup up to $1024$
GPUs.

Title: Systematic Analysis of Distributed Optimization Algorithms over

Authors: Bryan Van Scoy and Laurent Lessard
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 6 pages
\\
  We consider the distributed optimization problem, where a group of agents
work together to optimize a common objective by communicating with neighboring
agents and performing local computations. Using tools from robust control, we
develop a systematic analysis of a large class of distributed algorithms for
solving this problem without using restrictive assumptions on the communication
network. In particular, we assume only that the network is jointly connected
over a finite time horizon (commonly referred to as B-connectivity), which does
not require connectivity at each time instant. When applied to the distributed
algorithm DIGing, our bounds are orders of magnitude tighter than those
available in the literature.
