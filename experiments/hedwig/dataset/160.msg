Title: Joint Optimization of AI Fairness and Utility: A Human-Centered Approach
Authors: Yunfeng Zhang, Rachel K. E. Bellamy, Kush R. Varshney
Categories: cs.AI cs.HC
Comments: To appear in AIES 2020 proceedings
DOI: 10.1145/3375627.3375862
\\
  Today, AI is increasingly being used in many high-stakes decision-making
applications in which fairness is an important concern. Already, there are many
examples of AI being biased and making questionable and unfair decisions. The
AI research community has proposed many methods to measure and mitigate
unwanted biases, but few of them involve inputs from human policy makers. We
argue that because different fairness criteria sometimes cannot be
simultaneously satisfied, and because achieving fairness often requires
sacrificing other objectives such as model accuracy, it is key to acquire and
adhere to human policy makers' preferences on how to make the tradeoff among
these objectives. In this paper, we propose a framework and some exemplar
methods for eliciting such preferences and for optimizing an AI model according
to these preferences.

Title: `Why not give this work to them?' Explaining AI-Moderated
  Task-Allocation Outcomes using Negotiation Trees
Authors: Zahra Zahedi, Sailik Sengupta, Subbarao Kambhampati
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: First two authors are equal contributors
\\
  The problem of multi-agent task allocation arises in a variety of scenarios
involving human teams. In many such settings, human teammates may act with
selfish motives and try to minimize their cost metrics. In the absence of (1)
complete knowledge about the reward of other agents and (2) the team's overall
cost associated with a particular allocation outcome, distributed algorithms
can only arrive at sub-optimal solutions within a reasonable amount of time. To
address these challenges, we introduce the notion of an AI Task Allocator
(AITA) that, with complete knowledge, comes up with fair allocations that
strike a balance between the individual human costs and the team's performance
cost. To ensure that AITA is explicable to the humans, we allow each human
agent to question AITA's proposed allocation with counterfactual allocations.
In response, we design AITA to provide a replay negotiation tree that acts as
an explanation showing why the counterfactual allocation, with the correct
costs, will eventually result in a sub-optimal allocation. This explanation
also updates a human's incomplete knowledge about their teammate's and the
team's actual costs. We then investigate whether humans are (1) able to
understand the explanations provided and (2) convinced by it using human factor
studies. Finally, we show the effect of various kinds of incompleteness on the
length of explanations. We conclude that underestimation of other's costs often
leads to the need for explanations and in turn, longer explanations on average.

Title: Knowledge representation and update in hierarchies of graphs
Authors: Russ Harmer and Eugenia Oshurko
Categories: cs.AI cs.DB cs.LO
Comments: 25 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the Journal of Logical and
  Algebraic Methods in Programming
\\
  A mathematical theory is presented for the representation of knowledge in the
form of a directed acyclic hierarchy of objects in a category where all paths
between any given pair of objects are required to be equal. The conditions
under which knowledge update, in the form of the sesqui-pushout rewriting of an
object in a hierarchy, can be propagated to the rest of the hierarchy, in order
to maintain all required path equalities, are analysed: some rewrites must be
propagated forwards, in the direction of the arrows, while others must be
propagated backwards, against the direction of the arrows, and, depending on
the precise form of the hierarchy, certain composability conditions may also be
necessary. The implementation of this theory, in the ReGraph Python library for
(simple) directed graphs with attributes on nodes and edges, is then discussed
in the context of two significant use cases.

Title: Evaluating approval-based multiwinner voting in terms of robustness to
  noise
Authors: Ioannis Caragiannis, Christos Kaklamanis, Nikos Karanikolas, George A.

Categories: cs.AI cs.GT

\\
  Approval-based multiwinner voting rules have recently received much attention
in the Computational Social Choice literature. Such rules aggregate approval
ballots and determine a winning committee of alternatives. To assess
effectiveness, we propose to employ new noise models that are specifically
tailored for approval votes and committees. These models take as input a ground
truth committee and return random approval votes to be thought of as noisy
estimates of the ground truth. A minimum robustness requirement for an
approval-based multiwinner voting rule is to return the ground truth when
applied to profiles with sufficiently many noisy votes. Our results indicate
that approval-based multiwinner voting is always robust to reasonable noise. We
further refine this finding by presenting a hierarchy of rules in terms of how
robust to noise they are.

Title: Complexity limitations on one-turn quantum refereed games
Authors: Soumik Ghosh, John Watrous
Categories: cs.CC quant-ph
Comments: 31 pages
\\
  This paper studies complexity theoretic aspects of quantum refereed games,
which are abstract games between two competing players that send quantum states
to a referee, who performs an efficiently implementable joint measurement on
the two states to determine which of the player wins. The complexity class
$\mathrm{QRG}(1)$ contains those decision problems for which one of the players
can always win with high probability on yes-instances and the other player can
always win with high probability on no-instances, regardless of the opposing
player's strategy. This class trivially contains $\mathrm{QMA} \cup
\text{co-}\mathrm{QMA}$ and is known to be contained in $\mathrm{PSPACE}$. We
prove stronger containments on two restricted variants of this class.
Specifically, if one of the players is limited to sending a classical
(probabilistic) state rather than a quantum state, the resulting complexity
class $\mathrm{CQRG}(1)$ is contained in $\exists\cdot\mathrm{PP}$ (the
nondeterministic polynomial-time operator applied to $\mathrm{PP}$); while if
both players send quantum states but the referee is forced to measure one of
the states first, and incorporates the classical outcome of this measurement
into a measurement of the second state, the resulting class $\mathrm{MQRG}(1)$
is contained in $\mathrm{P}\cdot\mathrm{PP}$ (the unbounded-error probabilistic
polynomial-time operator applied to $\mathrm{PP}$).

Title: Fracture in random heterogeneous media: I. Discrete mesoscale
  simulations of load capacity and active zone
Authors: Jan Eli\'a\v{s} and Miroslav Vo\v{r}echovsk\'y
Categories: cs.CE
Comments: 22 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Numerical simulations of concrete fracture performed with a probabilistic
mesoscale discrete model are presented. The model represents a substantial part
of material randomness by assigning random locations to the largest aggregates.
The remaining part of randomness is introduced by causing material parameters
to fluctuate randomly via a homogeneous random field. An extensive numerical
study performed with the model considers beams loaded in uniaxial tension with
both fixed and rotating platens, and also beams with and without a notch loaded
in three point bending. The results show the nontrivial effect of (i)
autocorrelation length and (ii) variance of the random field on the fracture
behavior of the model. Statistics of the peak load are presented as well as the
size and shape of an active zone at the time when the maximum load is attained.
The active zone is a region that is dissipating energy at a certain loading
stage, it is understood as an instantaneous contribution to the fracture
process zone. Local averaging within the active zone and weakest-link are
identified as underlying mechanisms explaining the reported results.

Title: FEA-Net: A Physics-guided Data-driven Model for Efficient Mechanical
  Response Prediction
Authors: Houpu Yao, Yi Gao, Yongming Liu
Categories: cs.CE cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  An innovative physics-guided learning algorithm for predicting the mechanical
response of materials and structures is proposed in this paper. The key concept
of the proposed study is based on the fact that physics models are governed by
Partial Differential Equation (PDE), and its loading/ response mapping can be
solved using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Based on this, a special type of
deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed that takes advantage of
our prior knowledge in physics to build data-driven models whose architectures
are of physics meaning. This type of network is named as FEA-Net and is used to
solve the mechanical response under external loading. Thus, the identification
of a mechanical system parameters and the computation of its responses are
treated as the learning and inference of FEA-Net, respectively. Case studies on
multi-physics (e.g., coupled mechanical-thermal analysis) and multi-phase
problems (e.g., composite materials with random micro-structures) are used to
demonstrate and verify the theoretical and computational advantages of the
proposed method.

Title: Generation of smoothly-varying infill configurations from a continuous
  menu of cell patterns and the asymptotic analysis of its mechanical behaviour
Authors: Dingchuan Xue, Yichao Zhu, Xu Guo
Categories: cs.CE physics.app-ph
\\
  We here introduce a novel scheme for generating smoothly-varying infill
graded microstructural (IGM) configurations from a given menu of generating
cells. The scheme was originally proposed for essentially improving the variety
of describable configurations in a modified asymptotic homogenisation-based
topology optimisation framework [1] for fast IGM design. But the proposed
scheme, after modification, also demonstrates its unique values in two aspects
of applications. First, it provides a fairly simple way of generating an IGM
configuration continuously patching any given cell configurations. Second, it
tenders a straightforward mean for decorating microstructures on a given
manifold. We will further show that the form of topology description function
given here effectively offers a platform for unifying most existing approaches
for IGM generation. Fuelled by asymptotic analysis of the mechanical behaviour
of the resulting IGM configurations, a topology optimisation scheme for
compliance minimisation is introduced. We will finally show that, the use of
the present scheme helps reduce the compliance value of an optimised structure
by nearly a half, if compared with that from the original framework [1].

Title: Machine learning accelerated topology optimization of nonlinear
  structures
Authors: Diab W. Abueiddaa, Seid Korica, Nahil A. Sobh
Categories: cs.CE cs.LG
\\
  The field of optimal design of linear elastic structures has seen many
exciting successes that resulted in new architected materials and designs. With
the availability of cloud computing, including high-performance computing,
machine learning, and simulation, searching for optimal nonlinear structures is
now within reach. In this study, we develop two convolutional neural network
models to predict optimized designs for a given set of boundary conditions,
loads, and volume constraints. The first convolutional neural network model is
for the case of materials with a linear elastic response while the second
developed model is for hyperelastic response where material and geometric
nonlinearities are involved. For the nonlinear elastic case, the neo-Hookean
model is utilized. For this purpose, we generate datasets, composed of the
optimized designs paired with the corresponding boundary conditions, loads, and
constraints, using topology optimization framework to train and validate both
models. The developed models are capable of accurately predicting the optimized
designs without requiring an iterative scheme and with negligible computational
time. The suggested pipeline can be generalized to other nonlinear mechanics
scenarios and design domains.

Title: Polygon Extraction from Triangular Meshes
Authors: Jeremy Castagno, Ella Atkins
Categories: cs.CG cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages, 9 Figures
\\
  This paper presents Polylidar, an efficient algorithm to extract non-convex
polygons from 2D point sets. Polylidar is able to extract multiple disjoint
polygons and capture interior holes. The algorithm begins by triangulating the
point set and filtering triangles by user configurable parameters such as
triangle edge length. Next, connected triangles are extracted into triangular
meshes representing the shape of the point set. The key to Polylidar's speed,
and the main contribution of this paper, is in efficiently transforming each
triangular mesh into a concave polygon. This paper describes Polylidar and
provides benchmarks to comparatively evaluate its speed and accuracy. Results
show good accuracy and $\sim$ 4 times speedup compared to other concave polygon
extraction methods.

Title: Generalizing meanings from partners to populations: Hierarchical
  inference supports convention formation on networks
Authors: Robert D. Hawkins, Noah D. Goodman, Adele E. Goldberg, Thomas L.
  Griffiths
Categories: cs.CL cs.SI
\\
  A key property of linguistic conventions is that they hold over an entire
community of speakers, allowing us to communicate efficiently even with people
we have never met before. At the same time, much of our language use is
partner-specific: we know that words may be understood differently by different
people based on local common ground. This poses a challenge for accounts of
convention formation. Exactly how do agents make the inferential leap to
community-wide expectations while maintaining partner-specific knowledge? We
propose a hierarchical Bayesian model of convention to explain how speakers and
listeners abstract away meanings that seem to be shared across partners. To
evaluate our model's predictions, we conducted an experiment where participants
played an extended natural-language communication game with different partners
in a small community. We examine several measures of generalization across
partners, and find key signatures of local adaptation as well as collective
convergence. These results suggest that local partner-specific learning is not
only compatible with global convention formation but may facilitate it when
coupled with a powerful hierarchical inductive mechanism.

Title: Lightweight Convolutional Representations for On-Device Natural Language
  Processing
Authors: Shrey Desai, Geoffrey Goh, Arun Babu, Ahmed Aly
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Accepted to MLSys 2020
\\
  The increasing computational and memory complexities of deep neural networks
have made it difficult to deploy them on low-resource electronic devices (e.g.,
mobile phones, tablets, wearables). Practitioners have developed numerous model
compression methods to address these concerns, but few have condensed input
representations themselves. In this work, we propose a fast, accurate, and
lightweight convolutional representation that can be swapped into any neural
model and compressed significantly (up to 32x) with a negligible reduction in
performance. In addition, we show gains over recurrent representations when
considering resource-centric metrics (e.g., model file size, latency, memory
usage) on a Samsung Galaxy S9.

\\
  In this work, we propose a new pooling strategy for language identification
by considering Indian languages. The idea is to obtain utterance level features
for any variable length audio for robust language recognition. We use the
GhostVLAD approach to generate an utterance level feature vector for any
variable length input audio by aggregating the local frame level features
across time. The generated feature vector is shown to have very good language
discriminative features and helps in getting state of the art results for
language identification task. We conduct our experiments on 635Hrs of audio
data for 7 Indian languages. Our method outperforms the previous state of the
art x-vector [11] method by an absolute improvement of 1.88% in F1-score and
achieves 98.43% F1-score on the held-out test data. We compare our system with
various pooling approaches and show that GhostVLAD is the best pooling approach
for this task. We also provide visualization of the utterance level embeddings
generated using Ghost-VLAD pooling and show that this method creates embeddings
which has very good language discriminative features.

  Recent analyses suggest that encoders pretrained for language modeling
capture certain morpho-syntactic structure. However, probing frameworks for
word vectors still do not report results on standard setups such as constituent
and dependency parsing. This paper addresses this problem and does full parsing
(on English) relying only on pretraining architectures -- and no decoding. We
first cast constituent and dependency parsing as sequence tagging. We then use
a single feed-forward layer to directly map word vectors to labels that encode
a linearized tree. This is used to: (i) see how far we can reach on syntax
modelling with just pretrained encoders, and (ii) shed some light about the
syntax-sensitivity of different word vectors (by freezing the weights of the
pretraining network during training). For evaluation, we use bracketing
F1-score and LAS, and analyze in-depth differences across representations for
span lengths and dependency displacements. The overall results surpass existing
sequence tagging parsers on the PTB (93.5%) and end-to-end EN-EWT UD (78.8%).

Title: Multi-Fusion Chinese WordNet (MCW) : Compound of Machine Learning and
  Manual Correction

\\
  Princeton WordNet (PWN) is a lexicon-semantic network based on cognitive
linguistics, which promotes the development of natural language processing.
Based on PWN, five Chinese wordnets have been developed to solve the problems
of syntax and semantics. They include: Northeastern University Chinese WordNet
(NEW), Sinica Bilingual Ontological WordNet (BOW), Southeast University Chinese
WordNet (SEW), Taiwan University Chinese WordNet (CWN), Chinese Open WordNet
(COW). By using them, we found that these word networks have low accuracy and
coverage, and cannot completely portray the semantic network of PWN. So we
decided to make a new Chinese wordnet called Multi-Fusion Chinese Wordnet (MCW)
to make up those shortcomings. The key idea is to extend the SEW with the help
of Oxford bilingual dictionary and Xinhua bilingual dictionary, and then
correct it. More specifically, we used machine learning and manual adjustment
in our corrections. Two standards were formulated to help our work. We
conducted experiments on three tasks including relatedness calculation, word
similarity and word sense disambiguation for the comparison of lemma's
accuracy, at the same time, coverage also was compared. The results indicate
that MCW can benefit from coverage and accuracy via our method. However, it
still has room for improvement, especially with lemmas. In the future, we will
continue to enhance the accuracy of MCW and expand the concepts in it.

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  We study the problem of injecting knowledge into large pre-trained models
like BERT and RoBERTa. Existing methods typically update the original
parameters of pre-trained models when injecting knowledge. However, when
multiple kinds of knowledge are injected, they may suffer from the problem of
catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose K-Adapter, which remains
the original parameters of the pre-trained model fixed and supports continual
knowledge infusion. Taking RoBERTa as the pre-trained model, K-Adapter has a
neural adapter for each kind of infused knowledge, like a plug-in connected to
RoBERTa. There is no information flow between different adapters, thus
different adapters are efficiently trained in a distributed way. We inject two
kinds of knowledge, including factual knowledge obtained from automatically
aligned text-triplets on Wikipedia and Wikidata, and linguistic knowledge
obtained from dependency parsing. Results on three knowledge-driven tasks
(total six datasets) including relation classification, entity typing and
question answering demonstrate that each adapter improves the performance, and
the combination of both adapters brings further improvements. Probing
experiments further show that K-Adapter captures richer factual and commonsense
knowledge than RoBERTa.

  One of the most complex syntactic representations used in computational
linguistics and NLP are discontinuous constituent trees, crucial for
representing all grammatical phenomena of languages such as German. Recent
advances in dependency parsing have shown that Pointer Networks excel in
efficiently parsing syntactic relations between words in a sentence. This kind
of sequence-to-sequence models achieve outstanding accuracies in building
non-projective dependency trees, but its potential has not been proved yet on a
more difficult task. We propose a novel neural network architecture that, by
means of Pointer Networks, is able to generate the most accurate discontinuous
constituent representations to date, even without the need of Part-of-Speech
tagging information. To do so, we internally model discontinuous constituent
structures as augmented non-projective dependency structures. The proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the two widely-used NEGRA and
TIGER benchmarks, outperforming previous work by a wide margin.

social media posts. Our goal is to correctly associate a set of messages posted
in a small radius around a given location with their corresponding location
type, e.g., school, church, restaurant or museum. We provide a dataset of
locations associated with tweets posted in close geographical proximity. We
explore two approaches to the problem: (a) a pipeline approach where each
message is first classified, and then the location associated with the message
set is inferred from the individual message labels; and (b) a joint approach
where the individual messages are simultaneously processed to yield the desired
location type. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the joint approach.
Moreover, we show that due to the unique structure of the problem, where
weakly-related messages are jointly processed to yield a single final label,
simpler linear classifiers outperform deep neural network alternatives that
have shown superior in previous text classification tasks.

  Techniques for automatically extracting important content elements from
business documents such as contracts, statements, and filings have the
potential to make business operations more efficient. This problem can be
formulated as a sequence labeling task, and we demonstrate the adaption of BERT
to two types of business documents: regulatory filings and property lease
agreements. There are aspects of this problem that make it easier than
"standard" information extraction tasks and other aspects that make it more
difficult, but on balance we find that modest amounts of annotated data (less
than 100 documents) are sufficient to achieve reasonable accuracy. We integrate
our models into an end-to-end cloud platform that provides both an easy-to-use
annotation interface as well as an inference interface that allows users to
upload documents and inspect model outputs.

Title: The Privacy Funnel from the viewpoint of Local Differential Privacy
Authors: Milan Lopuha\"a-Zwakenberg
Categories: cs.CR cs.DB cs.IT math.IT
\\
  We consider a database $\vec{X} = (X_1,\cdots,X_n)$ containing the data of
$n$ users. The data aggregator wants to publicise the database, but wishes to
sanitise the dataset to hide sensitive data $S_i$ correlated to $X_i$. This
setting is considered in the Privacy Funnel, which uses mutual information as a
leakage metric. The downsides to this approach are that mutual information does
not give worst-case guarantees, and that finding optimal sanitisation protocols
can be computationally prohibitive. We tackle these problems by using
differential privacy metrics, and by considering local protocols which operate
on one entry at a time. We show that under both the Local Differential Privacy
and Local Information Privacy leakage metrics, one can efficiently obtain
optimal protocols; however, Local Information Privacy is both more closely
aligned to the privacy requirements of the Privacy Funnel scenario, and more
efficiently computable. We also consider the scenario where each user has
multiple attributes (i.e. $X_i = (X^1_i,\cdots,X^m_i)$), for which we define
\emph{Side-channel Resistant Local Information Privacy}, and we give efficient
methods to find protocols satisfying this criterion while still offering good
utility. Exploratory experiments confirm the validity of these methods.

Title: Bicycle Attacks Considered Harmful: Quantifying the Damage of Widespread
  Password Length Leakage
Authors: Benjamin Harsha, Robert Morton, Jeremiah Blocki, John Springer,
  Melissa Dark
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  We examine the issue of password length leakage via encrypted traffic i.e.,
bicycle attacks. We aim to quantify both the prevalence of password length
leakage bugs as well as the potential harm to users. In an observational study,
we find that {\em most} of the Alexa top 100 rates sites are vulnerable to
bicycle attacks meaning that an eavesdropping attacker can infer the exact
length of a password based on the length the encrypted packet containing the
password. We discuss several ways in which an eavesdropping attacker could link
this password length with a particular user account e.g., a targeted campaign
against a smaller group of users or via DNS hijacking for larger scale
campaigns. We next use a decision-theoretic model to quantify the extent to
which password length leakage might help an attacker to crack user passwords.
In our analysis, we consider three different levels of password attackers:
hacker, criminal and nation-state. In all cases, we find that such an attacker
who knows the length of each user password gains a significant advantage over
one without knowing the password length. As part of this analysis, we also
release a new differentially private password frequency dataset from the 2016
LinkedIn breach using a differentially private algorithm of Blocki et al. (NDSS
2016) to protect user accounts. The LinkedIn frequency corpus is based on over
170 million passwords making it the largest frequency corpus publicly available
to password researchers. While the defense against bicycle attacks is
straightforward (i.e., ensure that passwords are always padded before
encryption), we discuss several practical challenges organizations may face
when attempting to patch this vulnerability. We advocate for a new W3C standard
on how password fields are handled which would effectively eliminate most
instances of password length leakage.

Title: Knowledge Federation: Hierarchy and Unification
Authors: Hongyu Li, Dan Meng, and Xiaolin Li
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  With the strengthening of data privacy and security, traditional data
centralization for AI faces huge challenges. Moreover, isolated data existing
in various industries and institutions is grossly underused and thus retards
the advance of AI applications. We propose a possible solution to these
problems: knowledge federation. Beyond the concepts of federated learning and
secure multi-party computation, we introduce a comprehensive knowledge
federation framework, which is a hierarchy with four-level federation. In terms
of the occurrence time of federation, knowledge federation can be categorized
into information level, model level, cognition level, and knowledge level. To
facilitate widespread academic and commercial adoption of this concept, we
provide definitions free from ambiguity for the knowledge federation framework.
In addition, we clarify the relationship and differentiation between knowledge
federation and other related research fields and conclude that knowledge
federation is a unified framework for secure multi-party computation and
learning.

  Advertisement drives the economy of the mobile app ecosystem. As a key
component in the mobile ad business model, mobile ad content has been
overlooked by the research community, which poses a number of threats, e.g.,
propagating malware and undesirable contents. To understand the practice of
these devious ad behaviors, we perform a large-scale study on the app contents
harvested through automated app testing. In this work, we first provide a
comprehensive categorization of devious ad contents, including five kinds of
behaviors belonging to two categories: \emph{ad loading content} and \emph{ad
clicking content}. Then, we propose MadDroid, a framework for automated
detection of devious ad contents. MadDroid leverages an automated app testing
framework with a sophisticated ad view exploration strategy for effectively
collecting ad-related network traffic and subsequently extracting ad contents.
We then integrate dedicated approaches into the framework to identify devious
ad contents. We have applied MadDroid to 40,000 Android apps and found that
roughly 6\% of apps deliver devious ad contents, e.g., distributing malicious
apps that cannot be downloaded via traditional app markets. Experiment results
indicate that devious ad contents are prevalent, suggesting that our community
should invest more effort into the detection and mitigation of devious ads
towards building a trustworthy mobile advertising ecosystem.

Title: Zendoo: a zk-SNARK Verifiable Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol Enabling
  Decoupled and Decentralized Sidechains
Authors: Alberto Garoffolo, Dmytro Kaidalov, Roman Oliynykov
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Sidechains are an appealing innovation devised to enable blockchain
scalability and extensibility. The basic idea is simple yet powerful: construct
a parallel chain -- sidechain -- with desired features, and provide a way to
transfer coins between the mainchain and the sidechain.
  In this paper, we introduce Zendoo, a construction for Bitcoin-like
blockchain systems that allows the creation and communication with sidechains
of different types without knowing their internal structure. We consider a
parent-child relationship between the mainchain and sidechains, where sidechain
nodes directly observe the mainchain while mainchain nodes only observe
cryptographically authenticated certificates from sidechain maintainers. We use
zk-SNARKs to construct a universal verifiable transfer mechanism that is used
by sidechains.
  Moreover, we propose a specific sidechain construction, named Latus, that can
be built on top of this infrastructure, and realizes a decentralized verifiable
blockchain system for payments. We leverage the use of recursive composition of
zk-SNARKs to generate succinct proofs of sidechain state progression that are
used to generate certificates' validity proofs. This allows the mainchain to
efficiently verify all operations performed in the sidechain without knowing
any details about those operations.

Title: Pure Differentially Private Summation from Anonymous Messages
Authors: Badih Ghazi, Noah Golowich, Ravi Kumar, Pasin Manurangsi, Rasmus Pagh,
  Ameya Velingker
Categories: cs.CR cs.DS
Comments: 40 pages, 3 figures
\\
  The shuffled (aka anonymous) model has recently generated significant
interest as a candidate distributed privacy framework with trust assumptions
better than the central model but with achievable errors smaller than the local
model. We study pure differentially private (DP) protocols in the shuffled
model for summation, a basic and widely used primitive:
  - For binary summation where each of n users holds a bit as an input, we give
a pure $\epsilon$-DP protocol for estimating the number of ones held by the
users up to an error of $O_\epsilon(1)$, and each user sends $O_\epsilon(\log
n)$ messages each of 1 bit. This is the first pure protocol in the shuffled
model with error $o(\sqrt{n})$ for constant $\epsilon$.
  Using this protocol, we give a pure $\epsilon$-DP protocol that performs
summation of real numbers in $[0, 1]$ up to an error of $O_{\epsilon}(1)$, and
where each user sends $O_{\epsilon}(\log^3 n)$ messages each of $O(\log\log n)$
bits.
  - In contrast, we show that for any pure $\epsilon$-DP protocol for binary
summation in the shuffled model having absolute error $n^{0.5-\Omega(1)}$, the
per user communication has to be at least $\Omega_{\epsilon}(\sqrt{\log n})$
bits. This implies the first separation between the (bounded-communication)
multi-message shuffled model and the central model, and the first separation
between pure and approximate DP protocols in the shuffled model.
  To prove our lower bound, we consider (a generalization of) the following
question: given $\gamma$ in $(0, 1)$, what is the smallest m for which there
are two random variables $X^0, X^1$ supported on $\{0, \dots ,m\}$ such that
(i) the total variation distance between $X^0$ and $X^1$ is at least
$1-\gamma$, and (ii) the moment generating functions of $X^0$ and $X^1$ are
within a constant factor of each other everywhere? We show that the answer is
$m = \Theta(\sqrt{\log(1/\gamma)})$.

Title: Unsupervised Community Detection with a Potts Model Hamiltonian, an
  Efficient Algorithmic Solution, and Applications in Digital Pathology
Authors: Brendon Lutnick, Wen Dong, Zohar Nussinov, and Pinaki Sarder
Categories: cs.CV cond-mat.stat-mech
Comments: 46 pages, 19 Figures
\\
  Unsupervised segmentation of large images using a Potts model Hamiltonian is
unique in that segmentation is governed by a resolution parameter which scales
the sensitivity to small clusters. Here, the input image is first modeled as a
graph, which is then segmented by minimizing a Hamiltonian cost function
defined on the graph and the respective segments. However, there exists no
closed form solution of this optimization, and using previous iterative
algorithmic solution techniques, the problem scales quadratically in the Input
Length. Therefore, while Potts model segmentation gives accurate segmentation,
it is grossly underutilized as an unsupervised learning technique. We propose a
fast statistical down-sampling of input image pixels based on the respective
color features, and a new iterative method to minimize the Potts model energy
considering pixel to segment relationship. This method is generalizable and can
be extended for image pixel texture features as well as spatial features. We
demonstrate that this new method is highly efficient, and outperforms existing
methods for Potts model based image segmentation. We demonstrate the
application of our method in medical microscopy image segmentation;
particularly, in segmenting renal glomerular micro-environment in renal
pathology. Our method is not limited to image segmentation, and can be extended
to any image/data segmentation/clustering task for arbitrary datasets with
discrete features.

Title: Anomaly Detection by Latent Regularized Dual Adversarial Networks
Authors: Chengwei Chen and Pan Chen and Haichuan Song and Yiqing Tao and Yuan
  Xie and Shouhong Ding and Lizhuang Ma
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision area with many
real-world applications. Given a wide range of images belonging to the normal
class, emerging from some distribution, the objective of this task is to
construct the model to detect out-of-distribution images belonging to abnormal
instances. Semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-based methods
have been gaining popularity in anomaly detection task recently. However, the
training process of GAN is still unstable and challenging. To solve these
issues, a novel adversarial dual autoencoder network is proposed, in which the
underlying structure of training data is not only captured in latent feature
space, but also can be further restricted in the space of latent representation
in a discriminant manner, leading to a more accurate detector. In addition, the
auxiliary autoencoder regarded as a discriminator could obtain an more stable
training process. Experiments show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art
results on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets as well as GTSRB stop signs dataset.

Title: Accelerating Object Detection by Erasing Background Activations
Authors: Byungseok Roh, Han-Cheol Cho, Myung-Ho Ju, Soon Hyung Pyo
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables
\\
  Recent advances in deep learning have enabled complex real-world use cases
comprised of multiple vision tasks and detection tasks are being shifted to the
edge side as a pre-processing step of the entire workload. However, since
running a deep model on resource-constraint devices is challenging, the design
of an efficient network is demanded. In this paper, we present an
objectness-aware object detection method to accelerate detection speed by
circumventing feature map computation on background regions where target
objects don't exist. To accomplish this goal, we incorporate a light-weight
objectness mask generation (OMG) network in front of an object detection (OD)
network so that it can zero out background areas of an input image before being
fed into the OD network. The inference speed, therefore, can be expedited with
sparse convolution. By switching background areas to zeros for entire
activations, the average number of zero values on MobileNetV2-SSDLite with ReLU
activation is increased further, from 36% to 68% during inference step, which
reduces 37.89\% MAC with negligible accuracy drop on MS-COCO. Moreover,
experimental results also show similar trends in heavy networks such as VGG and
RetinaNet with ResNet101, and an additional dataset, PASCAL VOC. The code will
be released.

Title: Generating Interpretable Poverty Maps using Object Detection in
  Satellite Images
Authors: Kumar Ayush, Burak Uzkent, Marshall Burke, David Lobell, Stefano Ermon
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Accurate local-level poverty measurement is an essential task for governments
and humanitarian organizations to track the progress towards improving
livelihoods and distribute scarce resources. Recent computer vision advances in
using satellite imagery to predict poverty have shown increasing accuracy, but
they do not generate features that are interpretable to policymakers,
inhibiting adoption by practitioners. Here we demonstrate an interpretable
computational framework to accurately predict poverty at a local level by
applying object detectors to high resolution (30cm) satellite images. Using the
weighted counts of objects as features, we achieve 0.539 Pearson's r^2 in
predicting village-level poverty in Uganda, a 31% improvement over existing
(and less interpretable) benchmarks. Feature importance and ablation analysis
reveal intuitive relationships between object counts and poverty predictions.
Our results suggest that interpretability does not have to come at the cost of
performance, at least in this important domain.

Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures, AAAI2020
\\
  Monocular 3D object detection task aims to predict the 3D bounding boxes of
objects based on monocular RGB images. Since the location recovery in 3D space
is quite difficult on account of absence of depth information, this paper
proposes a novel unified framework which decomposes the detection problem into
a structured polygon prediction task and a depth recovery task. Different from
the widely studied 2D bounding boxes, the proposed novel structured polygon in
the 2D image consists of several projected surfaces of the target object.
Compared to the widely-used 3D bounding box proposals, it is shown to be a
better representation for 3D detection. In order to inversely project the
predicted 2D structured polygon to a cuboid in the 3D physical world, the
following depth recovery task uses the object height prior to complete the
inverse projection transformation with the given camera projection matrix.
Moreover, a fine-grained 3D box refinement scheme is proposed to further
rectify the 3D detection results. Experiments are conducted on the challenging
KITTI benchmark, in which our method achieves state-of-the-art detection
accuracy.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Most existing works in Person Re-identification (ReID) focus on settings
where illumination either is kept the same or has very little fluctuation.
However, the changes in illumination degree may affect the robustness of a ReID
algorithm significantly. To address this problem, we proposed a Two-Stream
Network which can separate ReID features from lighting features so as to
enhance ReID performance. Its innovations are threefold: (1)A discriminative
Entropy loss is employed to ensure the ReID features contain no lighting
information. (2)A ReID Teacher model is trained by images under "neutral"
lighting conditions to guide ReID classification. (3)An illumination Teacher
model is trained by the differences between the illumination-adjusted and
original images to guide illumination classification. We construct two
augmented datasets by synthetically changing a set of predefined lighting
conditions in two of the most popular ReID benchmarks: Market1501 and
DukeMTMC-reID. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other
state-of-the-art works and particularly potent in handling images under
extremely low light.

Title: Solving Raven's Progressive Matrices with Neural Networks

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) have been widely used for Intelligence
Quotient (IQ) test of humans. In this paper, we aim to solve RPM with neural
networks in both supervised and unsupervised manners. First, we investigate
strategies to reduce over-fitting in supervised learning. We suggest the use of
a neural network with deep layers and pre-training on large-scale datasets to
improve model generalization. Experiments on the RAVEN dataset show that the
overall accuracy of our supervised approach surpasses human-level performance.
Second, as an intelligent agent requires to automatically learn new skills to
solve new problems, we propose the first unsupervised method, Multilabel
Classification with Pseudo Target (MCPT), for RPM problems. Based on the design
of the pseudo target, MCPT converts the unsupervised learning problem to a
supervised task. Experiments show that MCPT doubles the testing accuracy of
random guessing e.g. 28.50% vs. 12.5%. Finally, we discuss the problem of
solving RPM with unsupervised and explainable strategies in the future.

Title: CHAIN: Concept-harmonized Hierarchical Inference Interpretation of Deep
  Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Dan Wang, Xinrui Cui, and Z. Jane Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  With the great success of networks, it witnesses the increasing demand for
the interpretation of the internal network mechanism, especially for the net
decision-making logic. To tackle the challenge, the Concept-harmonized
HierArchical INference (CHAIN) is proposed to interpret the net decision-making
process. For net-decisions being interpreted, the proposed method presents the
CHAIN interpretation in which the net decision can be hierarchically deduced
into visual concepts from high to low semantic levels. To achieve it, we
propose three models sequentially, i.e., the concept harmonizing model, the
hierarchical inference model, and the concept-harmonized hierarchical inference
model. Firstly, in the concept harmonizing model, visual concepts from high to
low semantic-levels are aligned with net-units from deep to shallow layers.
Secondly, in the hierarchical inference model, the concept in a deep layer is
disassembled into units in shallow layers. Finally, in the concept-harmonized
hierarchical inference model, a deep-layer concept is inferred from its
shallow-layer concepts. After several rounds, the concept-harmonized
hierarchical inference is conducted backward from the highest semantic level to
the lowest semantic level. Finally, net decision-making is explained as a form
of concept-harmonized hierarchical inference, which is comparable to human
decision-making. Meanwhile, the net layer structure for feature learning can be
explained based on the hierarchical visual concepts. In quantitative and
qualitative experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CHAIN at the
instance and class levels.

\\
  We introduce an approach for updating older tree inventories with geographic
coordinates using street-level panorama images and a global optimization
framework for tree instance matching. Geolocations of trees in inventories
until the early 2000s where recorded using street addresses whereas newer
inventories use GPS. Our method retrofits older inventories with geographic
coordinates to allow connecting them with newer inventories to facilitate
long-term studies on tree mortality etc. What makes this problem challenging is
the different number of trees per street address, the heterogeneous appearance
of different tree instances in the images, ambiguous tree positions if viewed
from multiple images and occlusions. To solve this assignment problem, we (i)
detect trees in Google street-view panoramas using deep learning, (ii) combine
multi-view detections per tree into a single representation, (iii) and match
detected trees with given trees per street address with a global optimization
approach. Experiments for > 50000 trees in 5 cities in California, USA, show
that we are able to assign geographic coordinates to 38 % of the street trees,
which is a good starting point for long-term studies on the ecosystem services
value of street trees at large scale.

Title: Analyzing the Dependency of ConvNets on Spatial Information
Authors: Yue Fan, Yongqin Xian, Max Maria Losch, Bernt Schiele
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Intuitively, image classification should profit from using spatial
information. Recent work, however, suggests that this might be overrated in
standard CNNs. In this paper, we are pushing the envelope and aim to further
investigate the reliance on spatial information. We propose spatial shuffling
and GAP+FC to destroy spatial information during both training and testing
phases. Interestingly, we observe that spatial information can be deleted from
later layers with small performance drops, which indicates spatial information
at later layers is not necessary for good performance. For example, test
accuracy of VGG-16 only drops by 0.03% and 2.66% with spatial information
completely removed from the last 30% and 53% layers on CIFAR100, respectively.
Evaluation on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR100, Small-ImageNet,
ImageNet) with a wide range of CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet152)
shows an overall consistent pattern.

  Forecasting pedestrian trajectories in dynamic scenes remains a critical
problem with various applications, such as autonomous driving and socially
aware robots. Such forecasting is challenging due to human-human and
human-object interactions and future uncertainties caused by human randomness.
Generative model-based methods handle future uncertainties by sampling a latent
variable. However, few previous studies carefully explored the generation of
the latent variable. In this work, we propose the Trajectory Predictor with
Pseudo Oracle (TPPO), which is a generative model-based trajectory predictor.
The first pseudo oracle is pedestrians' moving directions, and the second one
is the latent variable estimated from observed trajectories. A social attention
module is used to aggregate neighbors' interactions on the basis of the
correlation between pedestrians' moving directions and their future
trajectories. This correlation is inspired by the fact that a pedestrian's
future trajectory is often influenced by pedestrians in front. A latent
variable predictor is proposed to estimate latent variable distributions from
observed and ground-truth trajectories. Moreover, the gap between these two
distributions is minimized during training. Therefore, the latent variable
predictor can estimate the latent variable from observed trajectories to
approximate that estimated from ground-truth trajectories. We compare the
performance of TPPO with related methods on several public datasets. Results
demonstrate that TPPO outperforms state-of-the-art methods with low average and
final displacement errors. Besides, the ablation study shows that the
prediction performance will not dramatically decrease as sampling times decline
during tests.

Title: Whose Side are Ethics Codes On? Power, Responsibility and the Social
  Good
Authors: Anne L. Washington, Rachel S. Kuo

\\
  The moral authority of ethics codes stems from an assumption that they serve
a unified society, yet this ignores the political aspects of any shared
resource. The sociologist Howard S. Becker challenged researchers to clarify
their power and responsibility in the classic essay: Whose Side Are We On.
Building on Becker's hierarchy of credibility, we report on a critical
discourse analysis of data ethics codes and emerging conceptualizations of
beneficence, or the "social good", of data technology. The analysis revealed
that ethics codes from corporations and professional associations conflated
consumers with society and were largely silent on agency. Interviews with
community organizers about social change in the digital era supplement the
analysis, surfacing the limits of technical solutions to concerns of
marginalized communities. Given evidence that highlights the gulf between the
documents and lived experiences, we argue that ethics codes that elevate
consumers may simultaneously subordinate the needs of vulnerable populations.
Understanding contested digital resources is central to the emerging field of
public interest technology. We introduce the concept of digital differential
vulnerability to explain disproportionate exposures to harm within data
technology and suggest recommendations for future ethics codes.

Title: Providing Insights for Queries affected by Failures and Stragglers
Authors: Bruhathi Sundarmurthy, Harshad Deshmukh, Paris Koutris, Jeffrey
  Naughton
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  Interactive time responses are a crucial requirement for users analyzing
large amounts of data. Such analytical queries are typically run in a
distributed setting, with data being sharded across thousands of nodes for high
throughput. However, providing real-time analytics is still a very big
challenge; with data distributed across thousands of nodes, the probability
that some of the required nodes are unavailable or very slow during query
execution is very high and unavailability may result in slow execution or even
failures. The sheer magnitude of data and users increase resource contention
and this exacerbates the phenomenon of stragglers and node failures during
execution. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to alleviate the
straggler/failure problem that exploits existing efficient partitioning
properties of the data, particularly, co-hash partitioned data, and provides
approximate answers along with confidence bounds to queries affected by
failed/straggler nodes. We consider aggregate queries that involve joins, group
bys, having clauses and a subclass of nested subqueries. Finally, we validate
our approach through extensive experiments on the TPC-H dataset.

Title: A workload-adaptive mechanism for linear queries under local
  differential privacy
Authors: Ryan McKenna, Raj Kumar Maity, Arya Mazumdar, Gerome Miklau
Categories: cs.DB cs.CR
\\
  We propose a new mechanism to accurately answer a user-provided set of linear
counting queries under local differential privacy (LDP). Given a set of linear
counting queries (the workload) our mechanism automatically adapts to provide
accuracy on the workload queries. We define a parametric class of mechanisms
that produce unbiased estimates of the workload, and formulate a constrained
optimization problem to select a mechanism from this class that minimizes
expected total squared error. We solve this optimization problem numerically
using projected gradient descent and provide an efficient implementation that
scales to large workloads. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
optimization-based approach in a wide variety of settings, showing that it
outperforms many competitors, even outperforming existing mechanisms on the
workloads for which they were intended.

  Workflows are among the most commonly used tools in a variety of execution
environments. Many of them target a specific environment; few of them make it
possible to execute an entire workflow in different environments, e.g.
Kubernetes and batch clusters. We present a novel approach to workflow
execution, called StreamFlow, that complements the workflow graph with the
declarative description of potentially complex execution environments, and that
makes it possible the execution onto multiple sites not sharing a common data
space. StreamFlow is then exemplified on a novel bioinformatics pipeline for
single-cell transcriptomic data analysis workflow.

Title: MKPipe: A Compiler Framework for Optimizing Multi-Kernel Workloads in
  OpenCL for FPGA
Authors: Ji Liu, Abdullah-Al Kafi, Xipeng Shen, Huiyang Zhou
Categories: cs.DC cs.PF
Comments: 12 pages, 17 figures
\\
  OpenCL for FPGA enables developers to design FPGAs using a programming model
similar for processors. Recent works have shown that code optimization at the
OpenCL level is important to achieve high computational efficiency. However,
existing works either focus primarily on optimizing single kernels or solely
depend on channels to design multi-kernel pipelines. In this paper, we propose
a source-to-source compiler framework, MKPipe, for optimizing multi-kernel
workloads in OpenCL for FPGA. Besides channels, we propose new schemes to
enable multi-kernel pipelines. Our optimizing compiler employs a systematic
approach to explore the tradeoffs of these optimizations methods. To enable
more efficient overlapping between kernel execution, we also propose a novel
workitem/workgroup-id remapping technique. Furthermore, we propose new
algorithms for throughput balancing and resource balancing to tune the
optimizations upon individual kernels in the multi-kernel workloads. Our
results show that our compiler-optimized multi-kernels achieve up to 3.6x (1.4x
on average) speedup over the baseline, in which the kernels have already been
optimized individually.

Title: Simplifying Activity-on-Edge Graphs
Authors: David Eppstein, Daniel Frishberg, Elham Havvaei
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We formalize the simplification of activity-on-edge graphs used for
visualizing project schedules, where the vertices of the graphs represent
project milestones, and the edges represent either tasks of the project or
timing constraints between milestones. In this framework, a timeline of the
project can be constructed as a leveled drawing of the graph, where the levels
of the vertices represent the time at which each milestone is scheduled to
happen. We focus on the following problem: given an activity-on-edge graph
representing a project, find an equivalent activity-on-edge graph (one with the
same critical paths) that has the minimum possible number of milestone vertices
among all equivalent activity-on-edge graphs. We provide a polynomial-time
algorithm for solving this graph minimization problem.

Title: Online Primal Dual Meets Online Matching with Stochastic Rewards:
  Configuration LP to the Rescue
Authors: Zhiyi Huang and Qiankun Zhang
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Mehta and Panigrahi (FOCS 2012) introduce the problem of online matching with
stochastic rewards, where edges are associated with success probabilities and a
match succeeds with the probability of the corresponding edge. It is one of the
few online matching problems that have defied the randomized online primal dual
framework by Devanur, Jain, and Kleinberg (SODA 2013) thus far. This paper
unlocks the power of randomized online primal dual in online matching with
stochastic rewards by employing the configuration linear program rather than
the standard matching linear program used in previous works. Our main result is
a 0.572 competitive algorithm for the case of vanishing and unequal
probabilities, improving the best previous bound of 0.534 by Mehta, Waggoner,
and Zadimoghaddam (SODA 2015) and, in fact, is even better than the best
previous bound of 0.567 by Mehta and Panigrahi (FOCS 2012) for the more
restricted case of vanishing and equal probabilities. For vanishing and equal
probabilities, we get a better competitive ratio of 0.576. Our results further
generalize to the vertex-weighted case due to the intrinsic robustness of the
randomized online primal dual analysis.

\\
  Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, or simply CSCW, is the research area
that studies the design and use of socio-technical technology for supporting
group work. CSCW has a long tradition in interdisciplinary work exploring
technical, social, and theoretical challenges for the design of technologies to
support cooperative and collaborative work and life activities. However, most
of the research tradition, methods, and theories in the field follow a strong
trend grounded in social and cultural aspects from North America and Western
Europe. Therefore, it is inevitable that some of the underlying, and
established, knowledge in the field will not be directly transferrable or
applicable to other populations. This paper presents the results of an
interview study conducted with Latin American faculty on the feasability,
viability, and prospect of a curriculum proposal for CSCW Education in Latin
America: To this end, we conducted nine interviews with faculty currently based
in six countries of the region, aiming to understand how a CSCW course targeted
to undergraduate and/or graduate students in Latin America might be deployed.
Our findings suggest that there are specific traits that need to be addressed
in such a course, such as: tailoring foundational CSCW concepts to the
diversity of local cultures, motivating the involvement of students by tackling
relevant problems to their local communities, and revitalizing CSCW research
and practice in the continent.

Title: Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence to Increase Trust in Computer
  Vision
Authors: Christian Meske, Enrico Bunde
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Computer Vision, and hence Artificial Intelligence-based extraction of
information from images, has increasingly received attention over the last
years, for instance in medical diagnostics. While the algorithms' complexity is
a reason for their increased performance, it also leads to the "black box"
problem, consequently decreasing trust towards AI. In this regard, "Explainable
Artificial Intelligence" (XAI) allows to open that black box and to improve the
degree of AI transparency. In this paper, we first discuss the theoretical
impact of explainability on trust towards AI, followed by showcasing how the
usage of XAI in a health-related setting can look like. More specifically, we
show how XAI can be applied to understand why Computer Vision, based on deep
learning, did or did not detect a disease (malaria) on image data (thin blood
smear slide images). Furthermore, we investigate, how XAI can be used to
compare the detection strategy of two different deep learning models often used
for Computer Vision: Convolutional Neural Network and Multi-Layer Perceptron.
Our empirical results show that i) the AI sometimes used questionable or
irrelevant data features of an image to detect malaria (even if correctly
predicted), and ii) that there may be significant discrepancies in how
different deep learning models explain the same prediction. Our theoretical
discussion highlights that XAI can support trust in Computer Vision systems,
and AI systems in general, especially through an increased understandability
and predictability.

  Teachable interfaces can empower end-users to attune machine learning systems
to their idiosyncratic characteristics and environment by explicitly providing
pertinent training examples. While facilitating control, their effectiveness
can be hindered by the lack of expertise or misconceptions. We investigate how
users may conceptualize, experience, and reflect on their engagement in machine
teaching by deploying a mobile teachable testbed in Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Using a performance-based payment scheme, Mechanical Turkers (N = 100) are
called to train, test, and re-train a robust recognition model in real-time
with a few snapshots taken in their environment. We find that participants
incorporate diversity in their examples drawing from parallels to how humans
recognize objects independent of size, viewpoint, location, and illumination.
Many of their misconceptions relate to consistency and model capabilities for
reasoning. With limited variation and edge cases in testing, the majority of
them do not change strategies on a second training attempt.

  Interview chatbots engage users in a text-based conversation to draw out

interview chatbots that can handle user free-text responses to open-ended
questions and deliver engaging user experience. As the first step, we are
investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of using publicly available,
practical AI technologies to build effective interview chatbots. To demonstrate
feasibility, we built a prototype scoped to enable interview chatbots with a
subset of active listening skills - the abilities to comprehend a user's input
and respond properly. To evaluate the effectiveness of our prototype, we
compared the performance of interview chatbots with or without active listening
skills on four common interview topics in a live evaluation with 206 users. Our
work presents practical design implications for building effective interview
chatbots, hybrid chatbot platforms, and empathetic chatbots beyond interview
tasks.

Title: Context-Aware Recommendations for Televisions Using Deep Embeddings with
  Relaxed N-Pairs Loss Objective
Authors: Miklas S. Kristoffersen, Sven E. Shepstone, Zheng-Hua Tan
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  This paper studies context-aware recommendations in the television domain by
proposing a deep learning-based method for learning joint context-content
embeddings (JCCE). The method builds on recent developments within
recommendations using latent representations and deep metric learning, in order
to effectively represent contextual settings of viewing situations as well as
available content in a shared latent space. This embedding space is used for
exploring relevant content in various viewing settings by applying an N -pairs
loss objective as well as a relaxed variant introduced in this paper.
Experiments on two datasets confirm the recommendation ability of JCCE,
achieving improvements when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further
experiments display useful structures in the learned embeddings that can be
used to gain valuable knowledge of underlying variables in the relationship
between contextual settings and content properties.

  Nowadays, social networks play a crucial role in human everyday life and no
longer purely associated with spare time spending. In fact, instant
communication with friends and colleagues has become an essential component of
our daily interaction giving a raise of multiple new social network types
emergence. By participating in such networks, individuals generate a multitude
of data points that describe their activities from different perspectives and,
for example, can be further used for applications such as personalized
recommendation or user profiling. However, the impact of the different social
media networks on machine learning model performance has not been studied
comprehensively yet. Particularly, the literature on modeling multi-modal data
from multiple social networks is relatively sparse, which had inspired us to
take a deeper dive into the topic in this preliminary study. Specifically, in
this work, we will study the performance of different machine learning models
when being learned on multi-modal data from different social networks. Our
initial experimental results reveal that social network choice impacts the
performance and the proper selection of data source is crucial.

Categories: cs.IR cs.DL
\\
  This paper presents results of various experiments carried out to improve
text retrieval of gujarati text documents. Text retrieval involves searching
and ranking of text documents for a given set of query terms. We have tested
various retrieval models that uses bag-of-words approach. Bag-of-words approach
is a traditional approach that is being used till date where the text document
is represented as collection of words. Measures like frequency count, inverse
document frequency etc. are used to signify and rank relevant documents for
user queries. Different ranking models have been used to quantify ranking
performance using the metric of mean average precision. Gujarati is a
morphologically rich language, we have compared techniques like stop word
removal, stemming and frequent case generation against baseline to measure the
improvements in information retrieval tasks. Most of the techniques are
language dependent and requires development of language specific tools. We used
plain unprocessed word index as the baseline, we have seen significant
improvements in comparison of MAP values after applying different indexing
techniques when compared to the baseline.

\\
  Search engines operate under a strict time constraint as a fast response is
paramount to user satisfaction. Thus, neural re-ranking models have a limited
time-budget to re-rank documents. Given the same amount of time, a faster
re-ranking model can incorporate more documents than a less efficient one,
leading to a higher effectiveness. To utilize this property, we propose TK
(Transformer-Kernel): a neural re-ranking model for ad-hoc search using an
efficient contextualization mechanism. TK employs a very small number of
Transformer layers (up to three) to contextualize query and document word
embeddings. To score individual term interactions, we use a document-length
enhanced kernel-pooling, which enables users to gain insight into the model. TK
offers an optimal ratio between effectiveness and efficiency: under realistic
time constraints (max. 200 ms per query) TK achieves the highest effectiveness
in comparison to BERT and other re-ranking models. We demonstrate this on three
large-scale ranking collections: MSMARCO-Passage, MSMARCO-Document, and TREC
CAR. In addition, to gain insight into TK, we perform a clustered query
analysis of TK's results, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses on queries
with different types of information need and we show how to interpret the cause
of ranking differences of two documents by comparing their internal scores.

Title: Joint Power Allocation and Load Balancing Optimization for
  Energy-Efficient Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks
Authors: Trinh Van Chien and Emil Bj\"ornson and Erik G. Larsson
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 30 pages, 9 figures, submitted for publication
\\
  Large-scale distributed antenna systems with many access points (APs) that
serve the users by coherent joint transmission is being considered for
5G-and-beyond networks. The technology is called Cell-free Massive MIMO and can
provide a more uniform service level to the users than a conventional cellular
topology. For a given user set, only a subset of the APs is likely needed to
satisfy the users' performance demands, particularly outside the peak traffic
hours. To find a flexible and energy-efficient implementation, we minimize the
total downlink power consumption at the APs, considering both the transmit
powers and hardware dissipation. APs can be temporarily turned off to reduce
the latter part. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex but,
nevertheless, a globally optimal solution is obtained by solving a
mixed-integer second-order cone program. Since the computational complexity is
prohibitive for real-time implementation, we also propose two low-complexity
algorithms that exploit the inherent group-sparsity and the optimized transmit
powers in the problem formulation. Numerical results manifest that our
optimization algorithms can greatly reduce the power consumption compared to
keeping all APs turned on and only minimizing the transmit powers. Moreover,
the low-complexity algorithms can effectively handle the power allocation and
AP activation for large-scale networks.

Title: Optimal Causal Rate-Constrained Sampling for a Class of Continuous
  Markov Processes
Authors: Nian Guo, Victoria Kostina
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Consider the following communication scenario. An encoder observes a
stochastic process and causally decides when and what to transmit about it,
under a constraint on bits transmitted per second. A decoder uses the received
codewords to causally estimate the process in real time. We aim to find the
optimal encoding and decoding policies that minimize the end-to-end estimation
mean-square error under the rate constraint. For a class of continuous Markov
processes satisfying regularity conditions, we show that the optimal encoding
policy transmits a $1$-bit codeword once the process innovation passes one of
two thresholds. The optimal decoder noiselessly recovers the last sample from
the 1-bit codewords and codeword-generating time stamps, and uses it as the
running estimate of the current process, until the next codeword arrives. In
particular, we show the optimal causal code for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
and calculate its distortion-rate function.

  This paper investigates the broadband channel estimation (CE) for intelligent

The CE for such systems is a challenging task due to the large dimension of
both the active massive MIMO at the base station (BS) and passive IRS. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based CE
solution for IRS-aided mmWave massive MIMO systems, whereby the angular channel
sparsity of large-scale array at mmWave is exploited for improved CE with
reduced pilot overhead. Specifically, we first propose a downlink pilot
transmission framework. By designing the pilot signals based on the prior
knowledge that the line-of-sight dominated BS-to-IRS channel is known, the
high-dimensional channels for BS-to-user and IRS-to-user can be jointly
estimated based on CS theory. Moreover, to efficiently estimate broadband
channels, a distributed orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is exploited,
where the common sparsity shared by the channels at different subcarriers is
utilized. Additionally, the redundant dictionary to combat the power leakage is
also designed for the enhanced CE performance. Simulation results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Title: Embedding linear codes into self-orthogonal codes and their optimal
  minimum distances
Authors: Jon-Lark Kim, Young-Hun Kim, and Nari Lee
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 19 pages
MSC-class: 94B05
\\
  We obtain a characterization on self-orthogonality for a given binary linear
code in terms of the number of column vectors in its generator matrix, which
extends the result of Bouyukliev et al. (2006). As an application, we give an
algorithmic method to embed a given binary $k$-dimensional linear code
$\mathcal{C}$ ($k = 2,3,4$) into a self-orthogonal code of the shortest length
which has the same dimension $k$ and minimum distance $d' \ge d(\mathcal{C})$.
For $k > 4$, we suggest a recursive method to embed a $k$-dimensional linear
code to a self-orthogonal code. We also give new explicit formulas for the
minimum distances of optimal self-orthogonal codes for any length $n$ with
dimension 4 and any length $n \not\equiv 6,13,14,21,22,28,29 \pmod{31}$ with
dimension 5. We determine the exact optimal minimum distances of $[n,4]$
self-orthogonal codes which were left open by Li-Xu-Zhao (2008) when $n \equiv
0,3,4,5,10,11,12 \pmod{15}$. Then, using MAGMA, we observe that our embedding
sends an optimal linear code to an optimal self-orthogonal code.

Title: Analysis of D2D Communication with RF Energy Harvesting and Interference
  Management
Authors: Nasrin Razmi, Mehdi Mahdavi, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Petar Popovski
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Device-to-device (D2D) underlaid cellular network, enabled with radio
frequency energy harvesting (RFEH), and enhanced interference management
schemes is a promising candidate to improve spectral and energy efficiency of
next generation wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a time division
duplexing (TDD)-based protocol, in which allows the devices to harvest energy
from the downlink transmissions of the base station, while controlling the
interference among D2D and cellular communication in the uplink. We propose two
schemes for transmission coordination, based on fixed transmission probability
(FTP) and adaptive transmission probability (ATP), respectively. In FTP, the
D2D transmitters that have harvested enough energy can initiate data
transmission with a fixed probability. Differently from this, in ATP a device
utilizes its sensing capability to get improved coordination and interference
control among the transmitting devices. We evaluate the network performance by
presenting an accurate energy model and leveraging tools from stochastic
geometry. The results on outage probability and D2D sum-rate reveal the
importance of transmission coordination on network performance. These
observations led to a solution for choosing the parameters of the ATP scheme
that achieves an optimal tradeoff between the D2D outage probability and number
of transmitting users.

Title: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Multibeam Satellite Communications
Authors: Longfei Yin and Bruno Clerckx
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
\\
  This paper studies the beamforming design problem to achieve max-min fairness
(MMF) in multibeam satellite communications. Contrary to the conventional
linear precoding (NoRS) that relies on fully treating any residual interference
as noise, we consider a novel multibeam multicast beamforming strategy based on
Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA). RSMA relies on linearly precoded
ratesplitting (RS) at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation
(SIC) at receivers to enable a flexible framework for non-orthogonal
transmission and robust interbeam interference management. Aiming at achieving
MMF among multiple co-channel multicast beams, a per-feed available power
constrained optimization problem is formulated with different quality of
channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The superiority of RS for
multigroup multicast and multibeam satellite communication systems compared
with conventional scheme (NoRS) is demonstrated via simulations.

Title: Resource Allocation in Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted NOMA
  Systems
Authors: Jiakuo Zuo, Yuanwei Liu, Zhijin Qin and Naofal Al-Dhahir
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  This paper investigates the downlink communications of intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. To
maximize the system throughput, we formulate a joint optimization problem over
the channel assignment, decoding order of NOMA users, power allocation, and
reflection coefficients. The formulated problem is proved to be NP-hard. To
tackle this problem, a three-step novel resource allocation algorithm is
proposed. Firstly, the channel assignment problem is solved by a many-to-one
matching algorithm. Secondly, by considering the IRS reflection coefficients
design, a low-complexity decoding order optimization algorithm is proposed.
Thirdly, given a channel assignment and decoding order, a joint optimization
algorithm is proposed for solving the joint power allocation and reflection
coefficient design problem. Numerical results illustrate that: i) with the aid
of IRS, the proposed IRS-NOMA system outperforms the conventional NOMA system
without the IRS in terms of system throughput; ii) the proposed IRS-NOMA system
achieves higher system throughput than the IRS assisted orthogonal multiple
access (IRS-OMA) systems; iii) simulation results show that the performance
gains of the IRS-NOMA and the IRS-OMA systems can be enhanced via carefully
choosing the location of the IRS.

  We consider the minimal free resolution of Stanley-Reisner rings associated
to a linear code and give an intrinsic characterization of linear codes having
a minimal free resolution. We use this characterization to quickly deduce the
minimal free resolution of Stanley-Reisner ring associated to MDS codes as well
as constant weight codes. Further, we compute the Betti numbers of the
Stanley-Reisner ring associated to first order Reed-Muller codes and prove that
resolutions of Stanley-Reisner ring associated to binary Reed-Muller codes are
not pure in general. Using these results we determine the nature of the minimal
free resolution of Stanley-Reisner rings corresponding to several known classes
of two-weight codes

Title: Status Updates with Priorities: Lexicographic Optimality
Authors: Ali Maatouk, Yin Sun, Anthony Ephremides, Mohamad Assaad
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we consider a transmission scheduling problem, in which
several streams of status update packets with diverse priority levels are sent
through a shared channel to their destinations. We introduce a notion of
Lexicographic age optimality, or simply lex-age-optimality, to evaluate the
performance of multi-class status update policies. In particular, a
lex-age-optimal scheduling policy first minimizes the Age of Information (AoI)
metrics for high-priority streams, and then, within the set of optimal policies
for high-priority streams, achieves the minimum AoI metrics for low-priority
streams. We propose a new scheduling policy named Preemptive Priority, Maximum
Age First, Last-Generated, First-Served (PP-MAF-LGFS), and prove that the
PP-MAF-LGFS scheduling policy is lex-age-optimal. This result holds (i) for
minimizing any time-dependent, symmetric, and non-decreasing age penalty
function; (ii) for minimizing any non-decreasing functional of the stochastic
process formed by the age penalty function; and (iii) for the cases where
different priority classes have distinct arrival traffic patterns, age penalty
functions, and age penalty functionals. For example, the PP-MAF-LGFS scheduling
policy is lex-age-optimal for minimizing the mean peak age of a high-priority
stream and the time-average age of a low-priority stream. Numerical results are
provided to illustrate our theoretical findings.

Title: Explicit Codes for the Wiretap Channel: A Unified Design Framework
Authors: Remi A. Chou
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 31 pages, 2 figures
\\
  A construction of explicit codes for the wiretap channel is proposed.
Appropriate choices of the construction parameters yield, within a unified
design framework, the achievability of the secrecy capacity of (i) Wyner's
wiretap channel, (ii) the wiretap channel of type II, (iii) the wiretap channel
of type II with noisy main channel, (iv) the hybrid Wyner's/type II wiretap
channel, and the best known single-letter achievable secrecy rates for (v) the
wiretap channel when uncertainties hold on the eavesdropper's channel
statistics (compound model), (vi) the wiretap channel when the eavesdropper's
channel statistics are arbitrarily varying. Results are obtained for strong
secrecy, do not require any symmetry or degradation assumptions on the channel,
and do not require a pre-shared secret between the legitimate users. The
underlying construction idea is an efficient emulation of random binning via
polar codes to obtain reliability, coupled with universal hashing implemented
via invertible extractors to ensure strong secrecy.

Title: A Deep Conditioning Treatment of Neural Networks
Authors: Naman Agarwal and Pranjal Awasthi and Satyen Kale
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We study the role of depth in training randomly initialized overparameterized
neural networks. We give the first general result showing that depth improves
trainability of neural networks by improving the {\em conditioning} of certain
kernel matrices of the input data. This result holds for arbitrary non-linear
activation functions, and we provide a characterization of the improvement in
conditioning as a function of the degree of non-linearity and the depth of the
network. We provide versions of the result that hold for training just the top
layer of the neural network, as well as for training all layers, via the neural
tangent kernel. As applications of these general results, we provide a
generalization of the results of Das et al. (2019) showing that learnability of
deep random neural networks with arbitrary non-linear activations (under mild
assumptions) degrades exponentially with depth. Additionally, we show how
benign overfitting can occur in deep neural networks via the results of
Bartlett et al. (2019b).

Title: Accelerating Psychometric Screening Tests With Bayesian Active

Authors: Trevor J. Larsen, Gustavo Malkomes, Dennis L. Barbour
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Extended Abstract accepted to ML4H: Machine Learning for Health
  Workshop at NeurIPS 2019
\\
  Classical methods for psychometric function estimation either require
excessive measurements or produce only a low-resolution approximation of the
target psychometric function. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for
rapid screening for a change in the psychometric function estimation of a given
patient. We use Bayesian active model selection to perform an automated
pure-tone audiogram test with the goal of quickly finding if the current
audiogram will be different from a previous audiogram. We validate our approach
using audiometric data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health NIOSH. Initial results show that with a few tones we can detect if the
patient's audiometric function has changed between the two test sessions with
high confidence.

Title: Large Batch Training Does Not Need Warmup
Authors: Zhouyuan Huo, Bin Gu, Heng Huang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Training deep neural networks using a large batch size has shown promising
results and benefits many real-world applications. However, the optimizer
converges slowly at early epochs and there is a gap between large-batch deep
learning optimization heuristics and theoretical underpinnings. In this paper,
we propose a novel Complete Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (CLARS) algorithm
for large-batch training. We also analyze the convergence rate of the proposed
method by introducing a new fine-grained analysis of gradient-based methods.
Based on our analysis, we bridge the gap and illustrate the theoretical
insights for three popular large-batch training techniques, including linear
learning rate scaling, gradual warmup, and layer-wise adaptive rate scaling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms
gradual warmup technique by a large margin and defeats the convergence of the
state-of-the-art large-batch optimizer in training advanced deep neural
networks (ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet) on ImageNet dataset.

Title: Dropout Prediction over Weeks in MOOCs via Interpretable Multi-Layer
  Representation Learning
Authors: Byungsoo Jeon, Namyong Park, Seojin Bang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at AAAI 2020 AI4Edu Workshop
\\
  Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become popular platforms for online
learning. While MOOCs enable students to study at their own pace, this
flexibility makes it easy for students to drop out of class. In this paper, our
goal is to predict if a learner is going to drop out within the next week,
given clickstream data for the current week. To this end, we present a
multi-layer representation learning solution based on branch and bound (BB)
algorithm, which learns from low-level clickstreams in an unsupervised manner,
produces interpretable results, and avoids manual feature engineering. In
experiments on Coursera data, we show that our model learns a representation
that allows a simple model to perform similarly well to more complex,
task-specific models, and how the BB algorithm enables interpretable results.
In our analysis of the observed limitations, we discuss promising future
directions.

Title: Exploratory Machine Learning with Unknown Unknowns
Authors: Yu-Jie Zhang and Peng Zhao and Zhi-Hua Zhou
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  In conventional supervised learning, a training dataset is given with
ground-truth labels from a known label set, and the learned model will classify
unseen instances to the known labels. In this paper, we study a new problem
setting in which there are unknown classes in the training dataset misperceived
as other labels, and thus their existence appears unknown from the given
supervision. We attribute the unknown unknowns to the fact that the training
dataset is badly advised by the incompletely perceived label space due to the
insufficient feature information. To this end, we propose the exploratory
machine learning, which examines and investigates the training dataset by
actively augmenting the feature space to discover potentially unknown labels.
Our approach consists of three ingredients including rejection model, feature
acquisition, and model cascade. The effectiveness is validated on both
synthetic and real datasets.

Title: Improved Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform for Linear SVM
Authors: Zijian Lei and Liang Lan
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: AAAI-20
\\
  Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform (SRHT), a popular random projection
method that can efficiently project a $d$-dimensional data into $r$-dimensional
space ($r \ll d$) in $O(dlog(d))$ time, has been widely used to address the
challenge of high-dimensionality in machine learning. SRHT works by rotating
the input data matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ by Randomized
Walsh-Hadamard Transform followed with a subsequent uniform column sampling on
the rotated matrix. Despite the advantages of SRHT, one limitation of SRHT is
that it generates the new low-dimensional embedding without considering any
specific properties of a given dataset. Therefore, this data-independent random
projection method may result in inferior and unstable performance when used for
a particular machine learning task, e.g., classification. To overcome this
limitation, we analyze the effect of using SRHT for random projection in the
context of linear SVM classification. Based on our analysis, we propose
importance sampling and deterministic top-$r$ sampling to produce effective
low-dimensional embedding instead of uniform sampling SRHT. In addition, we
also proposed a new supervised non-uniform sampling method. Our experimental
results have demonstrated that our proposed methods can achieve higher
classification accuracies than SRHT and other random projection methods on six
real-life datasets.

\\
  Clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis. Recently, deep clustering,
which derives inspiration primarily from deep learning approaches, achieves
state-of-the-art performance and has attracted considerable attention. Current
deep clustering methods usually boost the clustering results by means of the
powerful representation ability of deep learning, e.g., autoencoder, suggesting
that learning an effective representation for clustering is a crucial
requirement. The strength of deep clustering methods is to extract the useful
representations from the data itself, rather than the structure of data, which
receives scarce attention in representation learning. Motivated by the great
success of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) in encoding the graph structure,
we propose a Structural Deep Clustering Network (SDCN) to integrate the
structural information into deep clustering. Specifically, we design a delivery
operator to transfer the representations learned by autoencoder to the
corresponding GCN layer, and a dual self-supervised mechanism to unify these
two different deep neural architectures and guide the update of the whole
model. In this way, the multiple structures of data, from low-order to
high-order, are naturally combined with the multiple representations learned by
autoencoder. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the delivery operator, i.e.,
with the delivery operator, GCN improves the autoencoder-specific
representation as a high-order graph regularization constraint and autoencoder
helps alleviate the over-smoothing problem in GCN. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our propose model can consistently perform
better over the state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: Concept Whitening for Interpretable Image Recognition
Authors: Zhi Chen, Yijie Bei and Cynthia Rudin
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  What does a neural network encode about a concept as we traverse through the
layers? Interpretability in machine learning is undoubtedly important, but the
calculations of neural networks are very challenging to understand. Attempts to
see inside their hidden layers can either be misleading, unusable, or rely on
the latent space to possess properties that it may not have. In this work,
rather than attempting to analyze a neural network posthoc, we introduce a
mechanism, called concept whitening (CW), to alter a given layer of the network
to allow us to better understand the computation leading up to that layer. When
a concept whitening module is added to a CNN, the axes of the latent space can
be aligned with concepts of interest. By experiment, we show that CW can
provide us a much clearer understanding for how the network gradually learns
concepts over layers without hurting predictive performance.

Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: submitted to IEEE T-IP
\\
  Entropy minimization has been widely used in unsupervised domain adaptation
(UDA). However, existing works reveal that entropy minimization only may result
into collapsed trivial solutions. In this paper, we propose to avoid trivial
solutions by further introducing diversity maximization. In order to achieve
the possible minimum target risk for UDA, we show that diversity maximization
should be elaborately balanced with entropy minimization, the degree of which
can be finely controlled with the use of deep embedded validation in an
unsupervised manner. The proposed minimal-entropy diversity maximization (MEDM)
can be directly implemented by stochastic gradient descent without use of
adversarial learning. Empirical evidence demonstrates that MEDM outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on four popular domain adaptation datasets.

\\
  A/B testing, or online experiment is a standard business strategy to compare
a new product with an old one in pharmaceutical, technological, and traditional
industries. Major challenges arise in online experiments where there is only
one unit that receives a sequence of treatments over time. In those
experiments, the treatment at a given time impacts current outcome as well as
future outcomes. The aim of this paper is to introduce a reinforcement learning
framework for carrying A/B testing, while characterizing the long-term
treatment effects. Our proposed testing procedure allows for sequential
monitoring and online updating, so it is generally applicable to a variety of
treatment designs in different industries. In addition, we systematically
investigate the theoretical properties (e.g., asymptotic distribution and
power) of our testing procedure. Finally, we apply our framework to both
synthetic datasets and a real-world data example obtained from a ride-sharing
company to illustrate its usefulness.

\\
  By accurately predicting industrial aging processes (IAPs), it is possible to
schedule maintenance events further in advance, thereby ensuring a
cost-efficient and reliable operation of the plant. So far, these degradation
processes were usually described by mechanistic models or simple empirical
prediction models. In this paper, we evaluate a wider range of data-driven
models for this task, comparing some traditional stateless models (linear and
kernel ridge regression, feed-forward neural networks) to more complex
recurrent neural networks (echo state networks and LSTMs). To examine how much
historical data is needed to train each of the models, we first examine their
performance on a synthetic dataset with known dynamics. Next, the models are
tested on real-world data from a large scale chemical plant. Our results show
that LSTMs produce near perfect predictions when trained on a large enough
dataset, while linear models may generalize better given small datasets with
changing conditions.

Title: Feature-map-level Online Adversarial Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Inseop Chung, SeongUk Park, Jangho Kim, Nojun Kwak
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Feature maps contain rich information about image intensity and spatial
correlation. However, previous online knowledge distillation methods only
utilize the class probabilities. Thus in this paper, we propose an online
knowledge distillation method that transfers not only the knowledge of the
class probabilities but also that of the feature map using the adversarial
training framework. We train multiple networks simultaneously by employing
discriminators to distinguish the feature map distributions of different
networks. Each network has its corresponding discriminator which discriminates
the feature map from its own as fake while classifying that of the other
network as real. By training a network to fool the corresponding discriminator,
it can learn the other network's feature map distribution. We show that our
method performs better than the conventional direct alignment method such as L1
and is more suitable for online distillation. Also, we propose a novel cyclic
learning scheme for training more than two networks together. We have applied
our method to various network architectures on the classification task and
discovered a significant improvement of performance especially in the case of
training a pair of a small network and a large one.

Title: Proximity Preserving Binary Code using Signed Graph-Cut
Authors: Inbal Lav, Shai Avidan, Yoram Singer, Yacov Hel-Or

Journal-ref: AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence , Feb. 2020
\\
  We introduce a binary embedding framework, called Proximity Preserving Code
(PPC), which learns similarity and dissimilarity between data points to create
a compact and affinity-preserving binary code. This code can be used to apply
fast and memory-efficient approximation to nearest-neighbor searches. Our
framework is flexible, enabling different proximity definitions between data
points. In contrast to previous methods that extract binary codes based on
unsigned graph partitioning, our system models the attractive and repulsive
forces in the data by incorporating positive and negative graph weights. The
proposed framework is shown to boil down to finding the minimal cut of a signed
graph, a problem known to be NP-hard. We offer an efficient approximation and
achieve superior results by constructing the code bit after bit. We show that
the proposed approximation is superior to the commonly used spectral methods
with respect to both accuracy and complexity. Thus, it is useful for many other
problems that can be translated into signed graph cut.

Title: Understanding the Decision Boundary of Deep Neural Networks: An
  Empirical Study

Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Despite achieving remarkable performance on many image classification tasks,
state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) classifiers remain vulnerable to small
input perturbations. Especially, the existence of adversarial examples raises
concerns about the deployment of ML models in safety- and security-critical
environments, like autonomous driving and disease detection. Over the last few
years, numerous defense methods have been published with the goal of improving
adversarial as well as corruption robustness. However, the proposed measures
succeeded only to a very limited extent. This limited progress is partly due to
the lack of understanding of the decision boundary and decision regions of deep
neural networks. Therefore, we study the minimum distance of data points to the
decision boundary and how this margin evolves over the training of a deep
neural network. By conducting experiments on MNIST, FASHION-MNIST, and
CIFAR-10, we observe that the decision boundary moves closer to natural images
over training. This phenomenon even remains intact in the late epochs of
training, where the classifier already obtains low training and test error
rates. On the other hand, adversarial training appears to have the potential to
prevent this undesired convergence of the decision boundary.

\\
  Bayesian optimisation is a popular, surrogate model-based approach for
optimising expensive black-box functions. Given a surrogate model, the next
location to expensively evaluate is chosen via maximisation of a cheap-to-query
acquisition function. We present an $\epsilon$-greedy procedure for Bayesian
optimisation in batch settings in which the black-box function can be evaluated
multiple times in parallel. Our $\epsilon$-shotgun algorithm leverages the
model's prediction, uncertainty, and the approximated rate of change of the
landscape to determine the spread of batch solutions to be distributed around a
putative location. The initial target location is selected either in an
exploitative fashion on the mean prediction, or -- with probability $\epsilon$
-- from elsewhere in the design space. This results in locations that are more
densely sampled in regions where the function is changing rapidly and in
locations predicted to be good (i.e close to predicted optima), with more
scattered samples in regions where the function is flatter and/or of poorer
quality. We empirically evaluate the $\epsilon$-shotgun methods on a range of
synthetic functions and two real-world problems, finding that they perform at
least as well as state-of-the-art batch methods and in many cases exceed their
performance.

\\
  In the context of kernel methods, the similarity between data points is
encoded by the kernel function which is often defined thanks to the Euclidean
distance, a common example being the squared exponential kernel. Recently,
other distances relying on optimal transport theory - such as the Wasserstein
distance between probability distributions - have shown their practical
relevance for different machine learning techniques. In this paper, we study
the use of exponential kernels defined thanks to the regularized Wasserstein
distance and discuss their positive definiteness. More specifically, we define
Wasserstein feature maps and illustrate their interest for supervised learning
problems involving shapes and images. Empirically, Wasserstein squared
exponential kernels are shown to yield smaller classification errors on small
training sets of shapes, compared to analogous classifiers using Euclidean
distances.

Title: Locally-Adaptive Nonparametric Online Learning
Authors: Ilja Kuzborskij, Nicol\`o Cesa-Bianchi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  One of the main strengths of online algorithms is their ability to adapt to
arbitrary data sequences. This is especially important in nonparametric
settings, where regret is measured against rich classes of comparator functions
that are able to fit complex environments. Although such hard comparators and
complex environments may exhibit local regularities, efficient algorithms whose
performance can provably take advantage of these local patterns are hardly
known. We fill this gap introducing efficient online algorithms (based on a
single versatile master algorithm) that adapt to: (1) local Lipschitzness of
the competitor function, (2) local metric dimension of the instance sequence,
(3) local performance of the predictor across different regions of the instance
space. Extending previous approaches, we design algorithms that dynamically
grow hierarchical packings of the instance space, and whose prunings correspond
to different "locality profiles" for the problem at hand. Using a technique
based on tree experts, we simultaneously and efficiently compete against all
such prunings, and prove regret bounds scaling with quantities associated with
all three types of local regularities. When competing against "simple" locality
profiles, our technique delivers regret bounds that are significantly better
than those proven using the previous approach. On the other hand, the time
dependence of our bounds is not worse than that obtained by ignoring any local
regularities.

Title: Deep RBF Value Functions for Continuous Control
Authors: Kavosh Asadi, Ronald E. Parr, George D. Konidaris, Michael L. Littman
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  A core operation in reinforcement learning (RL) is finding an action that is
optimal with respect to a learned state-action value function. This operation
is often challenging when the learned value function takes continuous actions
as input. We introduce deep RBF value functions: state-action value functions
learned using a deep neural network with a radial-basis function (RBF) output
layer. We show that the optimal action with respect to a deep RBF value
function can be easily approximated up to any desired accuracy. Moreover, deep
RBF value functions can represent any true value function up to any desired
accuracy owing to their support for universal function approximation. By
learning a deep RBF value function, we extend the standard DQN algorithm to
continuous control, and demonstrate that the resultant agent, RBF-DQN,
outperforms standard baselines on a set of continuous-action RL problems.

and subgraph decoding, significantly speeds up the training of graph AE and VAE
while preserving or even improving performances. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of FastGAE on numerous real-world graphs, outperforming the few
existing approaches to scale graph AE and VAE by a wide margin.

  With the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
(ML) techniques, researchers are striving towards employing these techniques
for advancing clinical practice. One of the key objectives in healthcare is the
early detection and prediction of disease to timely provide preventive
interventions. This is especially the case for epilepsy, which is characterized
by recurrent and unpredictable seizures. Patients can be relieved from the
adverse consequences of epileptic seizures if it could somehow be predicted in
advance. Despite decades of research, seizure prediction remains an unsolved
problem. This is likely to remain at least partly because of the inadequate
amount of data to resolve the problem. There have been exciting new
developments in ML-based algorithms that have the potential to deliver a
paradigm shift in the early and accurate prediction of epileptic seizures. Here
we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art ML techniques in early
prediction of seizures using EEG signals. We will identify the gaps,
challenges, and pitfalls in the current research and recommend future
directions.

  We prove that Keimel and Lawson's K-completion Kc of the simple valuation
monad Vs defines a monad Kc o Vs on each K-category A. We also characterize the
Eilenberg-Moore algebras of Kc o Vs as the weakly locally convex K-cones, and
its algebra morphisms as the continuous linear maps. In addition, we explicitly
describe the distributive law of Vs over Kc, which allows us to show that the
K-completion of any locally convex (respectively, weakly locally convex,
locally linear) topological cone is a locally convex (respectively, weakly
locally convex, locally linear) K-cone. We also give an example - the Cantor
tree with a top - that shows the dcpo-completion of the simple valuations is
not the D-completion of the simple valuations in general, where D is the
category of monotone convergence spaces and continuous maps.

\\
  The `equation-free toolbox' empowers the computer-assisted analysis of
complex, multiscale systems. Its aim is to enable you to immediately use
microscopic simulators to perform macro-scale system level tasks and analysis,
because micro-scale simulations are often the best available description of a
system. The methodology bypasses the derivation of macroscopic evolution
equations by computing the micro-scale simulator only over short bursts in time
on small patches in space, with bursts and patches well-separated in time and
space respectively. We introduce the suite of coded equation-free functions in
an accessible way, link to more detailed descriptions, discuss their
mathematical support, and introduce a novel and efficient algorithm for
Projective Integration. Some facets of toolbox development of equation-free
functions are then detailed. Download the toolbox functions

Title: Compress-and-restart block Krylov subspace methods for Sylvester matrix

\\
  Block Krylov subspace methods (KSMs) comprise building blocks in many
state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale matrix equations as they arise, e.g.,
from the discretization of partial differential equations. While extended and
rational block Krylov subspace methods provide a major reduction in iteration
counts over polynomial block KSMs, they also require reliable solvers for the
coefficient matrices, and these solvers are often iterative methods themselves.
It is not hard to devise scenarios in which the available memory, and
consequently the dimension of the Krylov subspace, is limited. In such
scenarios for linear systems and eigenvalue problems, restarting is a well
explored technique for mitigating memory constraints. In this work, such
restarting techniques are applied to polynomial KSMs for matrix equations with
a compression step to control the growing rank of the residual. An error
analysis is also performed, leading to heuristics for dynamically adjusting the
basis size in each restart cycle. A panel of numerical experiments demonstrates
the effectiveness of the new method with respect to extended block KSMs.

and subsequently analysed in two earlier contributions of the authors to
propose a linear scaling in cost algorithm for the computation of the
approximate forces. We establish exponential convergence of the method and
derive error estimates for the approximate forces that do not explicitly depend
on the number of dielectric particles $N$. Consequently, the proposed method
requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ operations to compute the electrostatic forces
acting on $N$ dielectric particles up to any given and fixed average error.

Title: A probabilistic approach for exact solutions of determinist PDE's as
  well as their finite element approximations
Authors: Joel Chaskalovic
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 17 pages, 4 figures
MSC-class: 65N15, 65N30, 65N75
\\
  A probabilistic approach is developed for the exact solution $u$ to a
determinist partial differential equation as well as for its associated
approximation $u^{(k)}_{h}$ performed by $P_k$ Lagrange finite element. Two
limitations motivated our approach: on the one hand, the inability to determine
the exact solution $u$ to a given partial differential equation (which
initially motivates one to approximating it) and, on the other hand, the
existence of uncertainties associated with the numerical approximation
$u^{(k)}_{h}$. We thus fill this knowledge gap by considering the exact
solution $u$ together with its corresponding approximation $u^{(k)}_{h}$ as
random variables. By way of consequence, any function where $u$ and
$u_{h}^{(k)}$ are involved as well. In this paper, we focus our analysis to a
variational formulation defined on $W^{m,p}$ Sobolev spaces and the
corresponding a priori estimates of the exact solution $u$ and its
approximation $u^{(k)}_{h}$ to consider their respective $W^{m,p}-$norm as a
random variable, as well as the $W^{m,p}$ approximation error with regards to
$P_k$ finite elements. This will enable us to derive a new probability
distribution to evaluate the relative accuracy between two Lagrange finite
elements $P_{k_1}$ and $P_{k_2}, (k_1 < k_2)$.

\\
  Non divergence-free discretisations for the incompressible Stokes problem may
suffer from a lack of pressure-robustness characterised by large
discretisations errors due to irrotational forces in the momentum balance. This
paper argues that also divergence-free virtual element methods (VEM) on
polygonal meshes are not really pressure-robust as long as the right-hand side
is not discretised in a careful manner. To be able to evaluate the right-hand
side for the test functions, some explicit interpolation of the virtual test
functions is needed that can be evaluated pointwise everywhere. The standard
discretisation via an $L^2$-best approximation does not preserve the divergence
and so destroys the orthogonality between divergence-free test functions and
possibly eminent gradient forces in the right-hand side. To repair this
orthogonality and restore pressure-robustness another divergence-preserving
reconstruction is suggested based on Raviart-Thomas approximations on local
subtriangulations of the polygons. All findings are proven theoretically and
are demonstrated numerically in two dimensions. The construction is also
interesting for hybrid high-order methods on polygonal or polyhedral meshes.

  One of the central problems in massive Internet of Things (IoT) deployments

aggravated by the irregularity of the traffic transmitted over the link, as the
traffic intermittency can be disguised as a link failure and vice versa. In
this work we present a traffic model for IoT devices running quasi-periodic
applications and we present both supervised and unsupervised machine learning
methods for monitoring the network performance of IoT deployments with
quasi-periodic reporting, such as smart-metering, environmental monitoring and
agricultural monitoring. The unsupervised methods are based on the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram, an approach developed by astronomers for estimating the spectral

Title: EdgeDASH: Exploiting Network-Assisted Adaptive Video Streaming for Edge
  Caching
Authors: Suzan Bayhan and Setareh Maghsudi and Anatolij Zubow
Categories: cs.NI cs.MM
\\
  While edge video caching has great potential to decrease the core network
traffic as well as the users' experienced latency, it is often challenging to
exploit the caches in current client-driven video streaming solutions due to
two key reasons. First, even those clients interested in the same content might
request different quality levels as a video content is encoded into multiple
qualities to match a wide range of network conditions and device capabilities.
Second, the clients, who select the quality of the next chunk to request, are
unaware of the cached content at the network edge. Hence, it becomes imperative
to develop network-side solutions to exploit caching. This can also mitigate
some performance issues, in particular for the scenarios in which multiple
video clients compete for some bottleneck capacity. In this paper, we propose a
network-side control logic running at a WiFi AP to facilitate the use of cached
video content. In particular, an AP can assign a client station a different
video quality than its request, in case the alternative quality provides a
better utility. We formulate the quality assignment problem as an optimization
problem and develop several heuristics with polynomial complexity. Compared to
the baseline where the clients determine the quality adaptation, our proposals,
referred to as EdgeDASH, offer higher video quality, higher cache hits, and
lower stalling ratio which are essential for user's satisfaction. Our
simulations show that EdgeDASH facilitates significant cache hits and decreases
the buffer stalls only by changing the client's request by one quality level.
Moreover, from our analysis, we conclude that the network assistance provides
significant performance improvement, especially when the clients with identical
interests compete for a bottleneck link's capacity.

  Smart city technology is making cities more effective which is necessary for
the rapid growth in urban population. With the rapid increase in advanced
metering infrastructure and other digital technologies, Smart cities have
become smarter with efficient electronic devices and embedded sensors based on
the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper provides a comprehensive review of the
smart cities concept with its components and applications. Moreover,
technologies of IoT used in smart cities infrastructure and some practically
implemented smart cities in the world are mentioned as exemplary
implementations. Some open issues and future directions concluded the paper.

Title: Demystifying content-blockers: A large scale study of actual performance
  gains
Authors: Ismael Castell-Uroz, Josep Sol\'e-Pareta and Pere Barlet-Ros
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  With the evolution of the online advertisement and tracking ecosystem,
content-filtering has become the reference tool for improving the security,
privacy and browsing experience when surfing the Internet. It is also commonly
believed that using content-blockers to stop unsolicited content decreases the
time needed for loading websites. In this work, we perform a large scale study
with the 100K most popular websites on the actual performance improvements of
using content-blockers. We focus our study in the two most relevant metrics for
user experience; bandwidth and latency. Our results show that using such tools
results in small improvements in terms of bandwidth usage but, contrary to
popular belief, it has a negligible impact in terms of loading time. We also
find that, in the case of small and fast loading websites, the use of
content-blockers can even result in increased browsing latency.

Title: Age of Information in a Decentralized Network of Parallel Queues with
  Routing and Packets Losses
Authors: Josu Doncel and Mohamad Assaad
Categories: cs.PF math.OC
\\
  The paper deals with Age of Information in a network of multiple sources and
parallel servers/queues with buffering capabilities, preemption in service and
losses in served packets. The servers do not communicate between each other and
the packets are dispatched through the servers according to a predefined
probabilistic routing. By making use of the Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS)
method, we provide a derivation of the average Age of Information of a system
of two parallel servers (with and without buffer capabilities) and compare the
result with that of a single queue. We show known results of packets delay in
Queuing Theory do not hold for Age of Information. Unfortunately, the
complexity of computing the Age of Information using the SHS method increases
highly with the number of queues. We therefore provide an upper bound of the
average Age of Information in a parallel server system of an arbitrary number
of M/M/1/(N + 1) queues and its tightness in various regimes. This upper bound
allows providing a tight approximation of the Age of Information with a very
low complexity.

Title: Patterns for Name Analysis and Type Analysis with JastAdd
Authors: Uwe Meyer, Bj\"orn Pfarr
Categories: cs.PL
ACM-class: D.3
\\
  In the last two decades, tools have been implemented to more formally specify
the semantic analysis phase of a compiler instead of relying on handwritten
code. In this paper, we introduce patterns and a method to translate a formal
definition of a language's type system into a specification for JastAdd, which
is one of the aforementioned tools based on Reference Attribute Grammars. This
methodological approach will help language designers and compiler engineers to
more systematically use such tools for semantic analysis. As an example, we use
a simple, yet complete imperative language and provide an outlook on how the
method can be extended to cover further language constructs or even type
inference.

Title: Deep Differentiable Grasp Planner for High-DOF Grippers
Authors: Min Liu, Zherong Pan, Kai Xu, Kanishka Ganguly, Dinesh Manocha
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  We present an end-to-end algorithm for training deep neural networks to grasp
novel objects. Our algorithm builds all the essential components of a grasping
system using a forward-backward automatic differentiation approach, including
the forward kinematics of the gripper, the collision between the gripper and
the target object, and the metric of grasp poses. In particular, we show that a
generalized Q1 grasp metric is defined and differentiable for inexact grasps
generated by a neural network, and the derivatives of our generalized Q1 metric
can be computed from a sensitivity analysis of the induced optimization
problem. We show that the derivatives of the (self-)collision terms can be
efficiently computed from a watertight triangle mesh of low-quality. Put
together, our algorithm allows the computation of grasp poses for high-DOF
grippers in unsupervised mode with no ground truth data or improves the results
in supervised mode using a small dataset. Our new learning algorithm
significantly simplifies the data preparation for learning-based grasping
systems and leads to higher qualities of learned grasps on common 3D shape
datasets, achieving a 22% higher success rate on physical hardware and 0.12
higher value of the Q1 grasp quality metric.

Title: Deep Learning Tubes for Tube MPC
Authors: David D. Fan, Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi and Evangelos A. Theodorou
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY math.OC
\\
  Learning-based control aims to construct models of a system to use for
planning or trajectory optimization, e.g. in model-based reinforcement
learning. In order to obtain guarantees of safety in this context, uncertainty
must be accurately quantified. This uncertainty may come from errors in
learning (due to a lack of data, for example), or may be inherent to the
system. Propagating uncertainty in learned dynamics models is a difficult
problem. Common approaches rely on restrictive assumptions of how distributions
are parameterized or propagated in time. In contrast, in this work we propose
using deep learning to obtain expressive and flexible models of how these
distributions behave, which we then use for nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(MPC). First, we introduce a deep quantile regression framework for control
which enforces probabilistic quantile bounds and quantifies epistemic
uncertainty. Next, using our method we explore three different approaches for
learning tubes which contain the possible trajectories of the system, and
demonstrate how to use each of them in a Tube MPC scheme. Furthermore, we prove
these schemes are recursively feasible and satisfy constraints with a desired
margin of probability. Finally, we present experiments in simulation on a
nonlinear quadrotor system, demonstrating the practical efficacy of these
ideas.

\\
  For robotic arms to operate in arbitrary environments, especially near
people, it is critical to certify the safety of their motion planning
algorithms. However, there is often a trade-off between safety and real-time
performance; one can either carefully design safe plans, or rapidly generate
potentially-unsafe plans. This work presents a receding-horizon, real-time
trajectory planner with safety guarantees, called ARMTD (Autonomous
Reachability-based Manipulator Trajectory Design). The method first computes
(offline) a reachable set of parameterized trajectories for each joint of an
arm. Each trajectory includes a fail-safe maneuver (braking to a stop). At
runtime, in each receding-horizon planning iteration, ARMTD constructs a
reachable set of the entire arm in workspace and intersects it with obstacles
to generate sub-differentiable and provably-conservative collision-avoidance
constraints on the trajectory parameters. ARMTD then performs trajectory
optimization for an arbitrary cost function on the parameters, subject to these
constraints. On a 6 degree-of-freedom arm, ARMTD outperforms CHOMP in
simulation and completes a variety of real-time planning tasks on hardware, all
without collisions.

\\
  The most widely used methods for toolpath planning in fused deposition 3D
printing slice the input model into successive 2D layers in order to construct
the toolpath. Unfortunately slicing-based methods can incur a substantial
amount of wasted motion (i.e., the extruder is moving while not printing),
particularly when features of the model are spatially separated. In recent
years we have introduced a new paradigm that characterizes the space of
feasible toolpaths using a dependency graph on the input model, along with
several algorithms to search this space for toolpaths that optimize objective
functions such as wasted motion or print time. A natural question that arises
is, under what circumstances can we efficiently compute an optimal toolpath? In
this paper, we give an algorithm for computing fused deposition modeling (FDM)
toolpaths that utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a powerful
general-purpose method for navigating large search spaces that is guaranteed to
converge to the optimal solution. Under reasonable assumptions on printer
geometry that allow us to compress the dependency graph, our MCTS-based
algorithm converges to find the optimal toolpath. We validate our algorithm on
a dataset of 75 models and show it performs on par with our previous best local
search-based algorithm in terms of toolpath quality. In prior work we
speculated that the performance of local search was near optimal, and we
examine in detail the properties of the models and MCTS executions that lead to
better or worse results than local search.

Title: Investigation of Multimodal and Agential Interactions in Human-Robot
  Imitation, based on frameworks of Predictive Coding and Active Inference
Authors: Wataru Ohata and Jun Tani
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures
\\
  This study proposes a model for multimodal, imitative interaction of agents,
based on frameworks of predictive coding and active inference, using a
variational Bayes recurrent neural network. The model dynamically predicts
visual sensation and proprioception simultaneously through generative processes
by associating both modalities. It also updates the internal state and
generates actions by maximizing the lower bound. A key feature of the model is
that the complexity of each modality, as well as of the entire network can be
regulated independently. We hypothesize that regulation of complexity offers a
common perspective over two distinct properties of embodied agents:
coordination of multimodalities and strength of agent intention or belief in
social interactions. We evaluate the hypotheses by conducting experiments on
imitative human-robot interactions in two different scenarios using the model.
First, regulation of complexity was changed between the vision module and the
proprioception module during learning. The results showed that complexity of
the vision module should be more strongly regulated than that of proprioception
because of its greater randomness. Second, the strength of complexity
regulation of the whole network in the robot was varied during test imitation
after learning. We found that this affects human-robot interactions
significantly. With weaker regulation of complexity, the robot tends to move
more egocentrically, without adapting to the human counterpart. On the other
hand, with stronger regulation, the robot tends to follow its human counterpart
by adapting its internal state. Our study concludes that the strength with
which complexity is regulated significantly affects the nature of dynamic
interactions between different modalities and between individual agents in a
social setting.

\\
  Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
impaired social interaction and communication , and by restricted and
repetitive behavior. The problematic point concerning this neuro-developmental
disorder is its causes which are unknown till now, and therefore it cannot be
treated medically. Recently, robots have been involved in the development of
the social behavior of autistic children who showed a better interaction with
robots than with their peers. One of the striking social impairments that is
widely described in autism literature is the deficit of imitating the others.
Trying to make use of this point, therapists and robotic researchers have been
interested in designing triadic interactional (Human-Robot-Child) imitation
games, in which the therapists starts to perform a gesture then the robot
imitates it, and then the child tries to do the same, hoping that these games
will encourage the autistic child to repeat these new gestures in his daily
social life.

  Regulating contact forces with high precision is crucial for grasping and
manipulating fragile or deformable objects. We aim to utilize the dexterity of
human hands to regulate the contact forces for robotic hands and exploit human
sensory-motor synergies in a wearable and non-invasive way. We extracted force
information from the electric activities of skeletal muscles during their
voluntary contractions through surface electromyography (sEMG). We built a
regression model based on a Neural Network to predict the gripping force from
the preprocessed sEMG signals and achieved high accuracy (R2 = 0.982). Based on
the force command predicted from human muscles, we developed a force-guided
control framework, where force control was realized via an admittance
controller that tracked the predicted gripping force reference to grasp
delicate and deformable objects. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a set of representative fragile and deformable objects from
daily life, all of which were successfully grasped without any damage or
deformation.

  We present a probabilistic ego-lane estimation algorithm for highway-like
scenarios that is designed to increase the accuracy of the ego-lane estimate,
which can be obtained relying only on a noisy line detector and tracker. The
contribution relies on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a transient failure
model. The proposed algorithm exploits the OpenStreetMap (or other cartographic
services) road property lane number as the expected number of lanes and
leverages consecutive, possibly incomplete, observations. The algorithm
effectiveness is proven by employing different line detectors and showing we
could achieve much more usable, i.e. stable and reliable, ego-lane estimates
over more than 100 Km of highway scenarios, recorded both in Italy and Spain.
Moreover, as we could not find a suitable dataset for a quantitative comparison
with other approaches, we collected datasets and manually annotated the Ground
Truth about the vehicle ego-lane. Such datasets are made publicly available for
usage from the scientific community.

  While many datasets and approaches in ambient sound analysis use weakly
labeled data, the impact of weak labels on the performance in comparison to
strong labels remains unclear. Indeed, weakly labeled data is usually used
because it is too expensive to annotate every data with a strong label and for
some use cases strong labels are not sure to give better results. Moreover,
weak labels are usually mixed with various other challenges like multilabels,
unbalanced classes, overlapping events. In this paper, we formulate a
supervised problem which involves weak labels. We create a dataset that focuses
on difference between strong and weak labels. We investigate the impact of weak
labels when training an embedding or an end-to-end classifier. Different
experimental scenarios are discussed to give insights into which type of
applications are most sensitive to weakly labeled data.

Title: Component-aware Orchestration of Cloud-based Enterprise Applications,

Authors: Matteo Bogo, Jacopo Soldani, Davide Neri, Antonio Brogi
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Enterprise IT is currently facing the challenge of coordinating the
management of complex, multi-component applications across heterogeneous cloud
platforms. Containers and container orchestrators provide a valuable solution
to deploy multi-component applications over cloud platforms, by coupling the
lifecycle of each application component to that of its hosting container. We
hereby propose a solution for going beyond such a coupling, based on the OASIS
standard TOSCA and on Docker. We indeed propose a novel approach for deploying
multi-component applications on top of existing container orchestrators, which
allows to manage each component independently from the container used to run
it. We also present prototype tools implementing our approach, and we show how
we effectively exploited them to carry out two concrete case studies.

Title: Quality Assurance Technologies of Big Data Applications: A Systematic
  Literature Review
Authors: Pengcheng Zhang, Wennan Cao, Henry Muccini

Comments: 20 pages, 9 figures and 2 appendixes
\\
  Big data applications are currently used in many application domains, ranging
from statistical applications to prediction systems and smart cities. However,
the quality of these applications is far from perfect, leading to a large
amount of issues and problems. Consequently, assuring the overall quality for
big data applications plays an increasingly important role. This paper aims at
summarizing and assessing existing quality assurance (QA) technologies
addressing quality issues in big data applications. We have conducted a
systematic literature review (SLR) by searching major scientific databases,
resulting in 83 primary and relevant studies on QA technologies for big data
applications. The SLR results reveal the following main findings: 1) the impact
of the big data attributes of volume, velocity, and variety on the quality of
big data applications; 2) the quality attributes that determine the quality for
big data applications include correctness, performance, availability,
scalability, reliability and so on; 3) the existing QA technologies, including
analysis, specification, model-driven architecture (MDA), verification, fault
tolerance, testing, monitoring and fault & failure prediction; 4) existing
strengths and limitations of each kind of QA technology; 5) the existing
empirical evidence of each QA technology. This study provides a solid
foundation for research on QA technologies of big data applications. However,
many challenges of big data applications regarding quality still remain.

  The ecosystem in which mobile applications run is highly heterogeneous and
configurable. All layers upon which mobile apps are built offer wide
possibilities of variations, from the device and the hardware, to the operating
system and middleware, up to the user preferences and settings. Testing all
possible configurations exhaustively, before releasing the app, is
unaffordable. As a consequence, the app may exhibit different, including
faulty, behaviours when executed in the field, under specific configurations.
In this paper, we describe a framework that can be instantiated to support
in-vivo testing of a mobile app. The framework monitors the configuration in
the field and triggers in-vivo testing when an untested configuration is
recognized. Experimental results show that the overhead introduced by
monitoring is unnoticeable to negligible (i.e., 0-6%) depending on the device
being used (high- vs. low-end). In-vivo test execution required on average 3s:
if performed upon screen lock activation, it introduces just a slight delay
before locking the device.

  Finland is considered a country with a good track record in gender equality.
Whilst statistics support the notion that Finland is performing well compared
to many other countries in terms of workplace equality, there are still many
areas for improvement. This paper focuses on the problems that some women face
in obtaining software engineering roles. We report a preliminary analysis of
survey data from 252 respondents. These are mainly women who have shown an
interest in gaining programming roles by joining the Mimmit koodaa initiative,
which aims to increase equality and diversity within the software industry. The
survey sought to understand what early experiences may influence later career
choices and feelings of efficacy and confidence needed to pursue
technology-related careers. These initial findings reveal that women's feelings
of computing self-efficacy and attitudes towards software engineering are
shaped by early experiences. More negative experiences decrease the likelihood
of working in software engineering roles in the future, despite expressing an
interest in the field.

  Collecting traces from software running in the field is both useful and
challenging. Traces may indeed help revealing unexpected usage scenarios,
detecting and reproducing failures, and building behavioral models that reflect
how the software is actually used. On the other hand, recording traces is an
intrusive activity that may annoy users, negatively affecting the usability of
the applications, if not properly designed. In this paper we address field
monitoring by introducing Controlled Burst Recording, a monitoring solution
that can collect comprehensive runtime data without compromising the quality of
the user experience. The technique encodes the knowledge extracted from the
monitored application as a finite state model that both represents the
sequences of operations that can be executed by the users and the corresponding
internal computations that might be activated by each operation. Our initial
assessment with information extracted from ArgoUML shows that Controlled Burst
Recording can reconstruct behavioral information more effectively than
competing sampling techniques, with a low impact on the system response time.

\\
  The growing popularity of E-cigarettes, an alternative to cigarettes, has
motivated us to study trends of the brands, flavors and online market activity
using posts from Reddit and Twitter. The main motivation for this world-wide
study is to emphasize the difference that laws and regulations have on the
usage and availability of different flavors and brands of vapes in different
countries. Data has been obtained from subreddits belonging to e-cigarette
communities from Australia, Canada, Europe, and the UK. Extensive cleaning of
data, and rigorous text mining operations provide varying results for different
countries. Varying results have been obtained from Reddit and Twitter since
they provide different atmospheres to the users.

Title: MAGNN: Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network for Heterogeneous Graph
  Embedding

\\
  A large number of real-world graphs or networks are inherently heterogeneous,
involving a diversity of node types and relation types. Heterogeneous graph
embedding is to embed rich structural and semantic information of a
heterogeneous graph into low-dimensional node representations. Existing models
usually define multiple metapaths in a heterogeneous graph to capture the
composite relations and guide neighbor selection. However, these models either
omit node content features, discard intermediate nodes along the metapath, or
only consider one metapath. To address these three limitations, we propose a
new model named Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network (MAGNN) to boost the
final performance. Specifically, MAGNN employs three major components, i.e.,
the node content transformation to encapsulate input node attributes, the
intra-metapath aggregation to incorporate intermediate semantic nodes, and the
inter-metapath aggregation to combine messages from multiple metapaths.
Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets for node
classification, node clustering, and link prediction show that MAGNN achieves
more accurate prediction results than state-of-the-art baselines.

  Modular multilevel converters (MMCs) are widely used in the design of modern
high-voltage direct current (HVdc) transmission system. High-fidelity dynamic
models of MMCs-based HVdc system require small simulation time step and can be
accurately modeled in electro-magnetic transient (EMT) simulation programs. The
EMT program exhibits slow simulation speed and limitation on the size of the
model and brings certain challenges to test the high-fidelity HVdc model in
system-level simulations. This paper presents the design and implementation of
a hybrid simulation framework, which enables the co-simulation of the EMT model
of Atlanta-Orlando HVdc line and the transient stability (TS) model of the
entire Eastern Interconnection system. This paper also introduces the
implementation of two high-fidelity HVdc line models simulated at different
time steps and discusses a dedicated method for sizing the buffer areas on both
sides of the HVdc line. The simulation results of the two HVdc models with
different sizes of buffer areas are presented and compared.

Title: Storage Optimal Control under Net Metering Policies
Authors: Md Umar Hashmi, Arpan Mukhopadhyay, Ana Bu\v{s}i\'c, and Jocelyne
  Elias
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Electricity prices and the end user net load vary with time. Electricity
consumers equipped with energy storage devices can perform energy arbitrage,
i.e., buy when energy is cheap or when there is a deficit of energy, and sell
it when it is expensive or in excess, taking into account future variations in
price and net load. Net metering policies indicate that many of the utilities
apply a {customer selling} rate lower than or equal to the retail {customer
buying rate} in order to compensate excess energy generated by end users. In
this paper, we formulate the optimal control problem for an end user energy
storage device in presence of net metering. We propose a computationally
efficient algorithm, with worst case run time complexity of quadratic in terms
of number of samples in lookahead horizon, that computes the optimal energy
ramping rates in a time horizon. The proposed algorithm exploits the problem's
piecewise linear structure and convexity properties for the
\textit{discretization} of optimal Lagrange multipliers. The solution has a
\textit{threshold-based structure} in which optimal control decisions are
independent of past or future price as well as of net load values beyond a
certain time horizon, defined as a \textit{sub-horizon}. Numerical results show
the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Furthermore, we
investigate the impact of forecasting errors on the proposed technique. We
consider an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) based forecasting of net load
together with the Model Predictive Control (MPC). We numerically show that
adaptive forecasting and MPC significantly mitigate the effects of forecast
error on energy arbitrage gains.

\\
  In pick and place (P&P) process of surface mount technology (SMT) the placed
component can shift from its ideal (or designed) position on the wet solder
paste. The solder paste with some fluid properties could slump and the
unbalance between different sides of solder paste can lead to other forces on
the components as well. Though the shifts are usually considered to be
negligible and can be made up to some extent by the following self-alignment
during the process of soldering reflow, it should be attracted attention as its
importance for addressing the quality of the printed circuit board (PCB) in
SMT. To minimize or control the component shifts, whose relationship with the
characteristics of the solder paste (e.g., offset, volume) should be studied
initially. In this paper, we design a comprehensive experiment and collect the
data from a state-of-the-art SMT assembly line. Then we use support vector
regression (SVR) model to predict the component shifts based on different
situations of solder paste and placement settings. Also, two kernel functions,
linear (SVR-Linear) and radial basis function (SVR-RBF), are employed. The
achieved results indicate that the component shift in P&P process is
significant, and the SVR model is highly qualified for the forecast of the
component shifts. Particularly, the SVR-RBF model outperforms the SVR-Linear
model considering the prediction error.

Title: A family of virtual contraction based controllers for tracking of

\\
  In this work we present a constructive method to design a family of virtual
contraction based controllers that solve the standard trajectory tracking
problem of flexible-joint robots (FJRs) in the port-Hamiltonian (pH) framework.
The proposed design method, called virtual contraction based control (v-CBC),
combines the concepts of virtual control systems and contraction analysis. It
is shown that under potential energy matching conditions, the closed-loop
virtual system is contractive and exponential convergence to a predefined
trajectory is guaranteed. Moreover, the closed-loop virtual system exhibits
properties such as structure preservation, differential passivity and the
existence of (incrementally) passive maps.

Title: Optimal deception attack on networked vehicular cyber physical systems
Authors: Moulik Choraria, Arpan Chattopadhyay, Urbashi Mitra, Erik Strom
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  Herein, design of false data injection attack on a distributed cyber-physical
system is considered. A stochastic process with linear dynamics and Gaussian
noise is measured by multiple agent nodes, each equipped with multiple sensors.
The agent nodes form a multi-hop network among themselves. Each agent node
computes an estimate of the process by using its sensor observation and
messages obtained from neighboring nodes,via Kalman-consensus filtering. An
external attacker, capable of arbitrarily manipulating the sensor observations
of some or all agent nodes, injects errors into those sensor observations. The
goal of the attacker is to steer the estimates at the agent nodes as close as
possible to a pre-specified value, while respecting a constraint on the attack
detection probability. To this end,a constrained optimization problem is
formulated to find the optimal parameter values of a certain class of linear
attacks. The parameters of linear attack are learnt on-line via a combination
of stochastic approximation and online stochastic gradient descent.Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of the attack.

Title: The Vulnerability of Cyber-Physical System under Stealthy Attacks
Authors: Tianju Sui, Yilin Mo, Dami\'an Marelli, Ximing Sun and Minyue Fu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In this paper, we study the impact of stealthy attacks on the Cyber-Physical
System (CPS) modeled as a stochastic linear system. An attack is characterised
by a malicious injection into the system through input, output or both, and it
is called stealthy (resp.~strictly stealthy) if it produces bounded changes
(resp.~no changes) in the detection residue. Correspondingly, a CPS is called
vulnerable (resp.~strictly vulnerable) if it can be destabilized by a stealthy
attack (resp.~strictly stealthy attack). We provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for the vulnerability and strictly vulnerability. For the
invulnerable case, we also provide a performance bound for the difference
between healthy and attacked system. Numerical examples are provided to
illustrate the theoretical results.

Title: Rack Force Estimation for Driving on Uneven Roads

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Submitted to IFAC World Congress for possible publication
\\
  The force transmitted from the tires and tie rods to the steering rack of a
vehicle, called the rack force, significantly influences the torque experienced
by a driver at the steering wheel. As a result, estimates of rack force are
used in a wide variety of advanced driver assist systems. However, existing
methods for producing rack force estimates are either susceptible to the
steering system disturbances or are only applicable to driving on flat road
profiles. To overcome these limitations, we previously developed two models
that could produce disturbance-free estimates of rack force for driving on
uneven road profiles. However, our previous models were only suited to produce
estimates of rack force due to low frequency road profile variations such as
lateral and longitudinal road slopes. In this paper we present a model that can
also handle high frequency road profile variations such as road cleats, curbs,
and potholes. We validate the estimation accuracy of our model by showing
results from actual driving experiments that were performed on tracks with
known low and high frequency road profile variations. We further demonstrate
the merits of our model relative to the existing models by comparing the
various estimates to rack force measurements obtained using a sensor mounted in
the test vehicle.

Title: Scheduling networked control systems under jamming attacks
Authors: Atreyee Kundu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 14 pages, 7 figures
\\
  This paper deals with the design of scheduling policies for networked control
systems whose shared networks have limited communication capacity and the
controller to plant channels are vulnerable to jamming attacks. We assume that
among N plants, only M (< N) plants can communicate with their controllers at
any time instant, and the attack sequences follow an (m,k)-firm model, i.e., in
any k consecutive time instants, the control inputs sent to some or all of the
plants accessing the communication network, are deactivated at most at m (< k)
time instants. We devise a new algorithm to allocate the network to the plants
periodically such that stability of each plant is preserved under the
admissible attack signals. The main apparatus for our analysis is a switched
systems representation of the individual plants in an NCS. We rely on matrix
commutators (Lie brackets) between the stable and unstable modes of operation
of the plants to guarantee stability under our scheduling policies.

Title: Topology Identification in Distribution Networks using Harmonic
  Synchrophasor Measurements
Authors: Lei Chen, Mohammad Farajollahi, Mahdi Ghamkhari, Wei Zhao, Songling
  Huang, Hamed Mohsenian-Rad
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Topology identification (TI) in distribution networks is a challenging task
due to the limited measurement resources and therefore the inevitable need to
use pseudo-measurements that are often inaccurate. To address this issue, a new
method is proposed in this paper to integrate harmonic synchrophasors into the
TI problem in order to enhance TI accuracy in distribution networks. In this
method, topology identification is done jointly based on both fundamental
synchrophasor measurements and harmonic synchrophasor measurements. This is
done by formulating and then solving a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
problem. Furthermore, an analysis is provided to capture the number of and the
location of harmonic sources and sensors that are needed to ensure full
observability. The benefits of the proposed TI scheme are compared against
those of the traditional scheme that utilizes only the fundamental
measurements. Finally, through numerical simulations on the IEEE 33-Bus power
system, it is shown that the proposed scheme is considerably accurate compared
to the traditional scheme in topology identification.

Title: A Robust Sensorless Controller-Observer Strategy for PMSMs with Unknown
  Resistance and Mechanical Model
Authors: Alessandro Bosso, Andrea Tilli, Christian Conficoni
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: submitted to the 21st IFAC World Congress
\\
  In this work, we present a mixed sensorless strategy for Permanent Magnets
Synchronous Machines, combining a torque/current controller and an observer for
position, speed, flux and stator resistance. The proposed co-design is
motivated by the need of an appropriate signal injection technique, in order to
guarantee full state observability. Neither the typical constant or
slowly-varying speed assumptions, nor a priori mechanical model information are
used in the observer design. Instead, the rotor speed is modeled as an unknown
input disturbance with constant (unknown) sign and uniformly non-zero
magnitude. With the proposed architecture, it is shown that the torque tracking
and signal injection tasks can be achieved and asymptotically decoupled.
Because of these features, we refer to this strategy as a sensorless
controller-observer with no mechanical model. Employing a gradient descent
resistance/back-EMF estimation, combined with the unit circle formalism to
describe the rotor position, we rigorously prove regional practical asymptotic
stability of the overall structure, with a domain of attraction that can be
made arbitrarily large, not including a lower dimensional manifold. The
effectiveness of this design is further validated with numerical simulations,
related to a challenging application of UAV propellers control.

Title: A neural network model that learns differences in diagnosis strategies

\\
  Purpose: To construct a neural network model that can learn the different
diagnosing strategies of radiologists to better classify aneurysm status in
magnetic resonance angiography images. Materials and methods: This
retrospective study included 3423 time-of-flight brain magnetic resonance
angiography image series (subjects: male 1843 [mean age, 50.2 +/- 11.7 years],
female 1580 [50.8 +/- 11.3 years]) recorded from November 2017 through January
2019. The image series were read independently for aneurysm status by one of
four board-certified radiologists, who were assisted by an established deep
learning-based computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) system. The constructed neural
networks were trained to classify the aneurysm status of zero to five
aneurysm-suspicious areas suggested by the CAD system for each image series,
and any additional aneurysm areas added by the radiologists, and this
classification was compared with the judgment of the annotating radiologist.
Image series were randomly allocated to training and testing data in an 8:2
ratio. The accuracy of the classification was compared by receiver operating
characteristic analysis between the control model that accepted only image data
as input and the proposed model that additionally accepted the information of
who the annotating radiologist was. The DeLong test was used to compare areas
under the curves (P < 0.05 was considered significant). Results: The area under
the curve was larger in the proposed model (0.845) than in the control model
(0.793), and the difference was significant (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The
proposed model improved classification accuracy by learning the diagnosis
strategies of individual annotating radiologists.

  Traditional US rental housing data sources such as the American Community
Survey and the American Housing Survey report on the transacted market - what
existing renters pay each month. They do not explicitly tell us about the spot
market - i.e., the asking rents that current homeseekers must pay to acquire
housing - though they are routinely used as a proxy. This study compares
governmental data to millions of contemporaneous rental listings and finds that
asking rents diverge substantially from these most recent estimates.
Conventional housing data understate current market conditions and
affordability challenges, especially in cities with tight and expensive rental
markets.

Title: A Precise High-Dimensional Asymptotic Theory for Boosting and
  Min-L1-Norm Interpolated Classifiers
Authors: Tengyuan Liang and Pragya Sur
Categories: math.ST cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML stat.TH
Comments: 27 pages, 3 figures
\\
  This paper establishes a precise high-dimensional asymptotic theory for
Boosting on separable data, taking statistical and computational perspectives.
We consider the setting where the number of features (weak learners) p scales
with the sample size n, in an over-parametrized regime. On the statistical
front, we provide an exact analysis of the generalization error of Boosting,
when the algorithm interpolates the training data and maximizes an empirical L1
margin. The angle between the Boosting solution and the ground truth is
characterized explicitly. On the computational front, we provide a sharp
analysis of the stopping time when Boosting approximately maximizes the
empirical L1 margin. Furthermore, we discover that, the larger the margin, the
smaller the proportion of active features (with zero initialization). At the
heart of our theory lies a detailed study of the maximum L1 margin, using tools
from convex geometry. The maximum L1 margin can be precisely described by a new
system of non-linear equations, which we study using a novel uniform deviation
argument. Preliminary numerical results are presented to demonstrate the
accuracy of our theory.

Title: Revisit to the Inverse Exponential Radon Transform
Authors: Jason You
Categories: eess.IV cs.IT cs.LG cs.NA math.IT math.NA stat.ML
Comments: This review was first written in 2007
\\
  This revisit gives a survey on the analytical methods for the inverse
exponential Radon transform which has been investigated in the past three
decades from both mathematical interests and medical applications such as
nuclear medicine emission imaging. The derivation of the classical inversion
formula is through the recent argument developed for the inverse attenuated
Radon transform. That derivation allows the exponential parameter to be a
complex constant, which is useful to other applications such as magnetic
resonance imaging and tensor field imaging. The survey also includes the new
technique of using the finite Hilbert transform to handle the exact
reconstruction from 180 degree data. Special treatment has been paid on two
practically important subjects. One is the exact reconstruction from partial
measurements such as half-scan and truncated-scan data, and the other is the
reconstruction from diverging-beam data. The noise propagation in the
reconstruction is touched upon with more heuristic discussions than
mathematical inference. The numerical realizations of several classical
reconstruction algorithms are included. In the conclusion, several topics are
discussed for more investigations in the future.

sensing with generative models, where a generative modeling assumption replaces
the usual sparsity assumption, we study the problem of 1-bit compressive
sensing with generative models. We first consider noiseless 1-bit measurements,
and provide sample complexity bounds for approximate recovery under
i.i.d.~Gaussian measurements and a Lipschitz continuous generative prior, as
well as a near-matching algorithm-independent lower bound. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the Binary $\epsilon$-Stable Embedding property, which
characterizes the robustness of the reconstruction to measurement errors and
noise, also holds for 1-bit compressive sensing with Lipschitz continuous
generative models with sufficiently many Gaussian measurements. In addition, we
apply our results to neural network generative models, and provide a
proof-of-concept numerical experiment demonstrating significant improvements
over sparsity-based approaches.

Title: ADMM-Based One-Bit Quantized Signal Detection for Massive MIMO Systems
  with Hardware Impairments
Authors: \"Ozlem Tugfe Demir and Emil Bj\"ornson
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: To appear at the 45th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech,
  and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2020), 5 pages, 2 figures
\\
  This paper considers signal detection in massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems with general additive hardware impairments and
one-bit quantization. First, we present the quantization-unaware and Bussgang
decomposition-based linear receivers by generalizing them for the considered
hardware impairment model. We propose an optimization problem to estimate the
uplink data signals by choosing a suitable cost function that treats the
unquantized received signal at the base station as the variable. We exploit the
additional structure of the one-bit quantization and signal modulation by
including proper constraints. To solve the non-convex quadratically-constrained
quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, we propose an ADMM-based algorithm with
closed-form update equations. Then, we replace the harsh projectors in the
updates with their soft versions to improve the detection performance. We show
that the proposed ADMM-based algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art linear
receivers significantly in terms of bit error rate (BER) and the performance
gain increases with the number of antennas and users.

\\
  Within the framework of 5G, blockage effects occurring in the mmWave band are
critical. These blockages can be statistically modeled with mathematical tools
such as stochastic geometry and random shape theory. In the literature, there
are studies describing the effects of blockages in both isolated and multiple
links for simple blocking objects. Our study considers a scenario in which
there are N links and takes into account the possible correlation among them in
terms of blocking by extending previous works to more general blocking objects.
This paper also applies the formulation developed for the case of N links to
optimize the relay positioning in mmWave cells for coverage enhancement, that
is, to minimize in average the probability of blockage within the cell, which
is another contribution of this work. The paper includes numerical evaluations
that highlight the fact that considering independence among the blocking
elements of the links is a too brief simplification and does not describe
accurately the real scenario. We also show the effect of taking into account
more realistic blocking objects than those considered so far in the literature
and the impact of the positioning of the relays on the coverage.

Title: Pseudo-dimension of quantum circuits

\\
  We characterize the expressive power of quantum circuits with the
pseudo-dimension, a measure of complexity for probabilistic concept classes. We
prove pseudo-dimension bounds on the output probability distributions of
quantum circuits; the upper bounds are polynomial in circuit depth and number
of gates. Using these bounds, we exhibit a class of circuit output states out
of which at least one has exponential state complexity, and moreover
demonstrate that quantum circuits of known polynomial size and depth are
PAC-learnable.

Title: Discovery of Self-Assembling $\pi$-Conjugated Peptides by Active
  Learning-Directed Coarse-Grained Molecular Simulation

\\
  Electronically-active organic molecules have demonstrated great promise as
novel soft materials for energy harvesting and transport. Self-assembled
nanoaggregates formed from $\pi$-conjugated oligopeptides composed of an
aromatic core flanked by oligopeptide wings offer emergent optoelectronic
properties within a water soluble and biocompatible substrate. Nanoaggregate
properties can be controlled by tuning core chemistry and peptide composition,
but the sequence-structure-function relations remain poorly characterized. In
this work, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations within an
active learning protocol employing deep representational learning and Bayesian
optimization to efficiently identify molecules capable of assembling pseudo-1D
nanoaggregates with good stacking of the electronically-active $\pi$-cores. We
consider the DXXX-OPV3-XXXD oligopeptide family, where D is an Asp residue and
OPV3 is an oligophenylene vinylene oligomer (1,4-distyrylbenzene), to identify
the top performing XXX tripeptides within all 20$^3$ = 8,000 possible
sequences. By direct simulation of only 2.3% of this space, we identify
molecules predicted to exhibit superior assembly relative to those reported in
prior work. Spectral clustering of the top candidates reveals new design rules
governing assembly. This work establishes new understanding of DXXX-OPV3-XXXD
assembly, identifies promising new candidates for experimental testing, and
presents a computational design platform that can be generically extended to
other peptide-based and peptide-like systems.

  Neurovascular Reconstruction
Authors: Leila Saadatifard, Aryan Mobiny, Pavel Govyadinov, Hien Nguyen, David

Categories: eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Maps of brain microarchitecture are important for understanding neurological
function and behavior, including alterations caused by chronic conditions such
as neurodegenerative disease. Techniques such as knife-edge scanning microscopy
(KESM) provide the potential for whole organ imaging at sub-cellular
resolution. However, multi-terabyte data sizes make manual annotation
impractical and automatic segmentation challenging. Densely packed cells
combined with interconnected microvascular networks are a challenge for current
segmentation algorithms. The massive size of high-throughput microscopy data
necessitates fast and largely unsupervised algorithms. In this paper, we
investigate a fully-convolutional, deep, and densely-connected encoder-decoder
for pixel-wise semantic segmentation. The excessive memory complexity often
encountered with deep and dense networks is mitigated using skip connections,
resulting in fewer parameters and enabling a significant performance increase
over prior architectures. The proposed network provides superior performance
for semantic segmentation problems applied to open-source benchmarks. We
finally demonstrate our network for cellular and microvascular segmentation,
enabling quantitative metrics for organ-scale neurovascular analysis.

Title: Antifragility Predicts the Robustness and Evolvability of Biological
  Networks through Multi-class Classification with a Convolutional Neural
  Network
Authors: Hyobin Kim, Stalin Mu\~noz, Pamela Osuna, and Carlos Gershenson
Categories: nlin.AO cs.LG nlin.CG q-bio.MN
Comments: 18 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Robustness and evolvability are essential properties to the evolution of
biological networks. To determine if a biological network is robust and/or
evolvable, the comparison of its functions before and after mutations is
required. However, it has an increasing computational cost as network size
grows. Here we aim to develop a predictor to estimate the robustness and
evolvability of biological networks without an explicit comparison of
functions. We measure antifragility in Boolean network models of biological
systems and use this as the predictor. Antifragility is a property to improve
the capability of a system through external perturbations. By means of the
differences of antifragility between the original and mutated biological
networks, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and test it to classify
the properties of robustness and evolvability. We found that our CNN model
successfully classified the properties. Thus, we conclude that our
antifragility measure can be used as a significant predictor of the robustness
and evolvability of biological networks.

Title: Linearly Constrained Neural Networks
Authors: Johannes Hendriks, Carl Jidling, Adrian Wills and Thomas Sch\"on
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG physics.comp-ph
\\
  We present an approach to designing neural network based models that will
explicitly satisfy known linear constraints. To achieve this, the target
function is modelled as a linear transformation of an underlying function. This
transformation is chosen such that any prediction of the target function is
guaranteed to satisfy the constraints and can be determined from known physics
or, more generally, by following a constructive procedure that was previously
presented for Gaussian processes. The approach is demonstrated on simulated and
real-data examples.

Title: Fast and Robust Comparison of Probability Measures in Heterogeneous
  Spaces
Authors: Ryoma Sato, Marco Cuturi, Makoto Yamada, Hisashi Kashima
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  The problem of comparing distributions endowed with their own geometry
appears in various settings, e.g. when comparing graphs, high-dimensional point
clouds, shapes, and generative models. Although the Gromov Wasserstein (GW)
distance is usually presented as the natural geometry to handle such
comparisons, computing it involves solving a NP-hard problem. In this paper, we
propose the Anchor Energy (AE) and Anchor Wasserstein (AW) distances, simpler
alternatives to GW that build upon the representation of each point in each
distribution as the 1D distribution of its distances to all other points. We
propose a sweep line algorithm to compute AE \emph{exactly} in $O(n^2 \log n)$,
where $n$ is the size of each measure, compared to a naive implementation of AE
requires $O(n^3)$ efforts. This is quasi-linear w.r.t. the description of the
problem itself. AW can be pending a single $n^3$ effort, in addition to the
$O(n^2)$ cost of running the Sinkhorn algorithm. We also propose robust
versions of AE and AW using rank-based criteria rather than cost values. We
show in our experiments that the AE and AW distances perform well in 3D shape
comparison and graph matching, at a fraction of the computational cost of
popular GW approximations.

Title: Spatial and spectral deep attention fusion for multi-channel speech
  separation using deep embedding features
Authors: Cunhang Fan, Bin Liu, Jianhua Tao, Jiangyan Yi, and Zhengqi Wen
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD
\\
  Multi-channel deep clustering (MDC) has acquired a good performance for
speech separation. However, MDC only applies the spatial features as the
additional information. So it is difficult to learn mutual relationship between
spatial and spectral features. Besides, the training objective of MDC is
defined at embedding vectors, rather than real separated sources, which may
damage the separation performance. In this work, we propose a deep attention
fusion method to dynamically control the weights of the spectral and spatial
features and combine them deeply. In addition, to solve the training objective
problem of MDC, the real separated sources are used as the training objectives.
Specifically, we apply the deep clustering network to extract deep embedding
features. Instead of using the unsupervised K-means clustering to estimate
binary masks, another supervised network is utilized to learn soft masks from
these deep embedding features. Our experiments are conducted on a spatialized
reverberant version of WSJ0-2mix dataset. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms MDC baseline and even better than the oracle ideal
binary mask (IBM).

Title: Graph matching between bipartite and unipartite networks: to collapse,
  or not to collapse, that is the question
Authors: Jes\'us Arroyo, Carey E. Priebe, Vince Lyzinski
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME
\\
  Graph matching consists of aligning the vertices of two unlabeled graphs in
order to maximize the shared structure across networks; when the graphs are
unipartite, this is commonly formulated as minimizing their edge disagreements.
In this paper, we address the common setting in which one of the graphs to
match is a bipartite network and one is unipartite. Commonly, the bipartite
networks are collapsed or projected into a unipartite graph, and graph matching
proceeds as in the classical setting. This potentially leads to noisy edge
estimates and loss of information. We formulate the graph matching problem
between a bipartite and a unipartite graph using an undirected graphical model,
and introduce methods to find the alignment with this model without collapsing.
In simulations and real data examples, we show how our methods can result in a
more accurate matching than the naive approach of transforming the bipartite
networks into unipartite, and we demonstrate the performance gains achieved by
our method in simulated and real data networks, including a
co-authorship-citation network pair and brain structural and functional data.

Title: Does the Markov Decision Process Fit the Data: Testing for the Markov

Authors: Chengchun Shi, Runzhe Wan, Rui Song, Wenbin Lu, Ling Leng

\\
  The Markov assumption (MA) is fundamental to the empirical validity of
reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Forward-Backward
Learning procedure to test MA in sequential decision making. The proposed test
does not assume any parametric form on the joint distribution of the observed
data and plays an important role for identifying the optimal policy in
high-order Markov decision processes and partially observable MDPs. We apply
our test to both synthetic datasets and a real data example from mobile health
studies to illustrate its usefulness.

Title: Online Passive-Aggressive Total-Error-Rate Minimization
Authors: Se-In Jang
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We provide a new online learning algorithm which utilizes online
passive-aggressive learning (PA) and total-error-rate minimization (TER) for
binary classification. The PA learning establishes not only large margin
training but also the capacity to handle non-separable data. The TER learning
on the other hand minimizes an approximated classification error based
objective function. We propose an online PATER algorithm which combines those
useful properties. In addition, we also present a weighted PATER algorithm to
improve the ability to cope with data imbalance problems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed PATER algorithms achieves better performances in
terms of efficiency and effectiveness than the existing state-of-the-art online
learning algorithms in real-world data sets.

Title: Automated Deep Abstractions for Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks
Authors: Tatjana Petrov and Denis Repin
Categories: q-bio.MN cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Predicting stochastic cellular dynamics as emerging from the mechanistic
models of molecular interactions is a long-standing challenge in systems
biology: low-level chemical reaction network (CRN) models give raise to a
highly-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) which is computationally
demanding and often prohibitive to analyse in practice. A recently proposed
abstraction method uses deep learning to replace this CTMC with a discrete-time
continuous-space process, by training a mixture density deep neural network
with traces sampled at regular time intervals (which can obtained either by
simulating a given CRN or as time-series data from experiment). The major
advantage of such abstraction is that it produces a computational model that is
dramatically cheaper to execute, while preserving the statistical features of
the training data. In general, the abstraction accuracy improves with the
amount of training data. However, depending on a CRN, the overall quality of
the method -- the efficiency gain and abstraction accuracy -- will also depend
on the choice of neural network architecture given by hyper-parameters such as
the layer types and connections between them. As a consequence, in practice,
the modeller would have to take care of finding the suitable architecture
manually, for each given CRN, through a tedious and time-consuming
trial-and-error cycle. In this paper, we propose to further automatise deep
abstractions for stochastic CRNs, through learning the optimal neural network
architecture along with learning the transition kernel of the abstract process.
Automated search of the architecture makes the method applicable directly to
any given CRN, which is time-saving for deep learning experts and crucial for
non-specialists. We implement the method and demonstrate its performance on a
number of representative CRNs with multi-modal emergent phenotypes.

Title: Dynamic clustering of time series data
Authors: Victhor S. Sart\'orio and Tha\'is C. O. Fonseca
Categories: stat.AP cs.LG stat.CO stat.ML
Comments: 27 pages, 21 figures
\\
  We propose a new method for clustering multivariate time-series data based on
Dynamic Linear Models. Whereas usual time-series clustering methods obtain
static membership parameters, our proposal allows each time-series to
dynamically change their cluster memberships over time. In this context, a
mixture model is assumed for the time series and a flexible Dirichlet evolution
for mixture weights allows for smooth membership changes over time. Posterior
estimates and predictions can be obtained through Gibbs sampling, but a more
efficient method for obtaining point estimates is presented, based on
Stochastic Expectation-Maximization and Gradient Descent. Finally, two
applications illustrate the usefulness of our proposed model to model both
univariate and multivariate time-series: World Bank indicators for the
renewable energy consumption of EU nations and the famous Gapminder dataset
containing life-expectancy and GDP per capita for various countries.

Title: Fluid-structure interaction modeling of blood flow in the pulmonary
  arteries using the unified continuum and variational multiscale formulation
Authors: Ju Liu and Weiguang Yang and Ingrid S. Lan and Alison L. Marsden
Categories: physics.comp-ph cs.NA math.NA physics.flu-dyn
\\
  In this work, we present a computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
study for a healthy patient-specific pulmonary arterial tree using the unified
continuum and variational multiscale (VMS) formulation we previously developed.
The unified framework is particularly well-suited for FSI, as the fluid and
solid sub-problems are addressed in essentially the same manner and can thus be
uniformly integrated in time with the generalized-$\alpha$ method. In addition,
the VMS formulation provides a mechanism for large-eddy simulation in the fluid
sub-problem and pressure stabilization in the solid sub-problem. The FSI
problem is solved in a quasi-direct approach, in which the pressure and
velocity in the unified continuum body are first solved, and the solid
displacement is then obtained via a segregated algorithm and prescribed as a
boundary condition for the mesh motion. Results of the pulmonary arterial FSI
simulation are presented and compared against those of a rigid wall simulation.

\\
  There is a large number of data archives and web services offering free
access to multispectral satellite imagery. Images from multiple sources are
increasingly combined to improve the spatio-temporal coverage of measurements
while achieving more accurate results. Archives and web services differ in
their protocols, formats, and data standards, which are barriers to combine
datasets. Here, we present RGISTools, an R package to create time-series of
multispectral satellite images from multiple platforms in a harmonized and
standardized way. We first provide an overview of the package functionalities,
namely downloading, customizing, and processing multispectral satellite imagery
for a region and time period of interest as well as a recent statistical method
for gap-filling and smoothing series of images, called interpolation of the
mean anomalies. We further show the capabilities of the package through a case
study that combines Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite optical imagery to
estimate the level of a water reservoir in Northern Spain. We expect RGISTools
to foster research on data fusion and spatio-temporal modelling using satellite
images from multiple programs.

Title: Prediction of head motion from speech waveforms with a
  canonical-correlation-constrained autoencoder
Authors: JinHong Lu, Hiroshi Shimodaira
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: head motion synthesis, speech-driven animation, deep canonically
  correlated autoencoder
\\
  This study investigates the direct use of speech waveforms to predict head
motion for speech-driven head-motion synthesis, whereas the use of spectral
features such as MFCC as basic input features together with additional features
such as energy and F0 is common in the literature. We claim that, rather than
combining different features that originate from waveforms, it is more
effective to use waveforms directly predicting corresponding head motion. The
challenge with the waveform-based approach is that waveforms contain a large
amount of information irrelevant to predict head motion, which hinders the
training of neural networks. To overcome the problem, we propose a
canonical-correlation-constrained autoencoder (CCCAE), where hidden layers are
trained to not only minimise the error but also maximise the canonical
correlation with head motion. Compared with an MFCC-based system, the proposed
system shows comparable performance in objective evaluation, and better
performance in subject evaluation.
