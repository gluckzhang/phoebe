Title: A Critical Look at the Applicability of Markov Logic Networks for Music
  Signal Analysis
Authors: Johan Pauwels, Gy\"orgy Fazekas, Mark B. Sandler
Categories: cs.AI cs.IR cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: Accepted for presentation at the Ninth International Workshop on
  Statistical Relational AI (StarAI 2020) at the 34th AAAI Conference on
  Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) in New York, on February 7th 2020
\\
  In recent years, Markov logic networks (MLNs) have been proposed as a
potentially useful paradigm for music signal analysis. Because all hidden
Markov models can be reformulated as MLNs, the latter can provide an
all-encompassing framework that reuses and extends previous work in the field.
However, just because it is theoretically possible to reformulate previous work
as MLNs, does not mean that it is advantageous. In this paper, we analyse some
proposed examples of MLNs for musical analysis and consider their practical
disadvantages when compared to formulating the same musical dependence
relationships as (dynamic) Bayesian networks. We argue that a number of
practical hurdles such as the lack of support for sequences and for arbitrary
continuous probability distributions make MLNs less than ideal for the proposed
musical applications, both in terms of easy of formulation and computational
requirements due to their required inference algorithms. These conclusions are
not specific to music, but apply to other fields as well, especially when
sequential data with continuous observations is involved. Finally, we show that
the ideas underlying the proposed examples can be expressed perfectly well in
the more commonly used framework of (dynamic) Bayesian networks.

\\
  In this paper, we present a visual emulator of the emotions seen in
characters in stories. This system is based on a simplified view of the
cognitive structure of emotions proposed by Ortony, Clore and Collins (OCC
Model). The goal of this paper is to provide a visual platform that allows us
to observe changes in the characters' different emotions, and the intricate
interrelationships between: 1) each character's emotions, 2) their affective
relationships and actions, 3) The events that take place in the development of
a plot, and 4) the objects of desire that make up the emotional map of any
story. This tool was tested on stories with a contrasting variety of emotional
and affective environments: Othello, Twilight, and Harry Potter, behaving
sensibly and in keeping with the atmosphere in which the characters were
immersed.

Title: Fast Compliance Checking with General Vocabularies

\\
  We address the problem of complying with the GDPR while processing and
transferring personal data on the web. For this purpose we introduce an
extensible profile of OWL2 for representing data protection policies. With this
language, a company's data usage policy can be checked for compliance with data
subjects' consent and with a formalized fragment of the GDPR by means of
subsumption queries. The outer structure of the policies is restricted in order
to make compliance checking highly scalable, as required when processing
high-frequency data streams or large data volumes. However, the vocabularies
for specifying policy properties can be chosen rather freely from expressive
Horn fragments of OWL2. We exploit IBQ reasoning to integrate specialized
reasoners for the policy language and the vocabulary's language. Our
experiments show that this approach significantly improves performance.

Title: Rapid multi-component phase-split calculations using volume functions
  and reduction methods
Authors: Mohamad Fathi and Stefan Hickel
Categories: cs.CE physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn
\\
  We present a new family of fast and robust methods for the calculation of the
vapor-liquid equilibrium at isobaric-isothermal (PT-flash),
isochoric-isothermal (VT-flash), isenthalpic-isobaric (HP-flash), and
isoenergetic-isochoric (UV-flash) conditions. The framework is provided by
formulating phase-equilibrium conditions for multi-component mixtures in an
effectively reduced space based on the molar specific value of the recently
introduced volume function derived from the Helmholtz free energy. The proposed
algorithmic implementation can fully exploit the optimum quadratic convergence
of a Newton method with the analytical Jacobian matrix. This paper provides all
required exact analytic expressions for the general cubic equation of state.
Computational results demonstrate the effectivity and efficiency of the new
methods. Compared to conventional methods, the proposed reduced-space iteration
leads to a considerable speed-up as well as to improved robustness and better
convergence behavior near the spinodal and coexistence curves of
multi-component mixtures, where the preconditioning by the reduction method is
most effective.

Title: Lower bounds for the maximum number of runners that cause loneliness,
  and its application to Isolation
Authors: Deepak Ponvel Chermakani
Categories: cs.CG cs.CC
Comments: 6 pages, 8 Theorems
\\
  We consider (n+1) runners with given constant unique integer speeds running
along the circumference of a circle whose circumferential length is one, and
all runners starting from the same point. We define and give lower bounds to a
first problem PMAX of finding, for every runner r, the maximum number of
runners that can be simultaneously separated from runner r by a distance of
atleast d. For d=1/(2^(floor(lg(n)))), a lower bound for PMAX is ( n -
((n-1)/floor(lg(n))) ), which makes the fraction of simultaneously separated
runners tend to 1 as n tends to infinity. Next, we define and give upper bounds
to a second problem ISOLATE of finding, for every runner r, the minimum number
of steps needed to isolate r, assuming that the runners that can be
simultaneously separated from r by atleast d, are removed at each step. For
d=1/(2^(floor(lg(n)))), an upper bound for ISOLATE is ( lg(n -
1)/lg(floor(lg(n))) ).

Title: On Visibility Graphs of Convex Fans and Terrains
Authors: Andr\'e C. Silva
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  For two points in the closure of a simple polygon $P$, we say that they see
each other in $P$ if the line segment uniting them does not intersect the
exterior of $P$. The visibility graph of $P$ is the graph whose vertex set is
the vertex set of $P$ and two vertices are joined by an edge if they see each
other in $P$.
  The characterization of visibility graphs has been an open problem for
decades, and a significant effort has been made to characterize visibility
graphs of restricted polygon classes. Among them is the convex fan: a simple
polygon with a convex vertex (i.e. whose internal angle in less than 180
degrees) that sees every other point in the closure of the polygon (often
called kernel vertex). We show that visibility graphs of convex fans are
equivalent to visibility graphs of terrains with the addition of a universal
vertex, that is, a vertex that is adjacent to every other vertex.

Title: Multi-step Joint-Modality Attention Network for Scene-Aware Dialogue
  System
Authors: Yun-Wei Chu, Kuan-Yen Lin, Chao-Chun Hsu, Lun-Wei Ku
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: DSTC8 collocated with AAAI2020
\\
  Understanding dynamic scenes and dialogue contexts in order to converse with
users has been challenging for multimodal dialogue systems. The 8-th Dialog
System Technology Challenge (DSTC8) proposed an Audio Visual Scene-Aware Dialog
(AVSD) task, which contains multiple modalities including audio, vision, and
language, to evaluate how dialogue systems understand different modalities and
response to users. In this paper, we proposed a multi-step joint-modality
attention network (JMAN) based on recurrent neural network (RNN) to reason on
videos. Our model performs a multi-step attention mechanism and jointly
considers both visual and textual representations in each reasoning process to
better integrate information from the two different modalities. Compared to the
baseline released by AVSD organizers, our model achieves a relative 12.1% and
22.4% improvement over the baseline on ROUGE-L score and CIDEr score.

Title: RobBERT: a Dutch RoBERTa-based Language Model
Authors: Pieter Delobelle, Thomas Winters, Bettina Berendt
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 7 pages, 2 tables
\\
  Pre-trained language models have been dominating the field of natural
language processing in recent years, and have led to significant performance
gains for various complex natural language tasks. One of the most prominent
pre-trained language models is BERT (Bi-directional Encoders for Transformers),
which was released as an English as well as a multilingual version. Although
multilingual BERT performs well on many tasks, recent studies showed that BERT
models trained on a single language significantly outperform the multilingual
results. Training a Dutch BERT model thus has a lot of potential for a wide
range of Dutch NLP tasks. While previous approaches have used earlier
implementations of BERT to train their Dutch BERT, we used RoBERTa, a robustly
optimized BERT approach, to train a Dutch language model called RobBERT. We
show that RobBERT improves state of the art results in Dutch-specific language
tasks, and also outperforms other existing Dutch BERT-based models in sentiment
analysis. These results indicate that RobBERT is a powerful pre-trained model
for fine-tuning for a large variety of Dutch language tasks. We publicly
release this pre-trained model in hope of supporting further downstream Dutch
NLP applications.

\\
  To predict the next most likely participant to interact in a multi-party
conversation is a difficult problem. In a text-based chat group, the only
information available is the sender, the content of the text and the dialogue
history. In this paper we present our study on how these information can be
used on the prediction task through a corpus and architecture that integrates
turn-taking classifiers based on Maximum Likelihood Expectation (MLE),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Finite State Automata (FSA). The corpus
is a synthetic adaptation of the Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset (MultiWOZ)
to a multiple travel service-based bots scenario with dialogue errors and was
created to simulate user's interaction and evaluate the architecture. We
present experimental results which show that the CNN approach achieves better
performance than the baseline with an accuracy of 92.34%, but the integrated
solution with MLE, CNN and FSA achieves performance even better, with 95.65%.

Title: Modality-Balanced Models for Visual Dialogue
Authors: Hyounghun Kim, Hao Tan, Mohit Bansal
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: AAAI 2020 (11 pages)
\\
  The Visual Dialog task requires a model to exploit both image and
conversational context information to generate the next response to the
dialogue. However, via manual analysis, we find that a large number of
conversational questions can be answered by only looking at the image without
any access to the context history, while others still need the conversation
context to predict the correct answers. We demonstrate that due to this reason,
previous joint-modality (history and image) models over-rely on and are more
prone to memorizing the dialogue history (e.g., by extracting certain keywords
or patterns in the context information), whereas image-only models are more
generalizable (because they cannot memorize or extract keywords from history)
and perform substantially better at the primary normalized discounted
cumulative gain (NDCG) task metric which allows multiple correct answers.
Hence, this observation encourages us to explicitly maintain two models, i.e.,
an image-only model and an image-history joint model, and combine their
complementary abilities for a more balanced multimodal model. We present
multiple methods for this integration of the two models, via ensemble and
consensus dropout fusion with shared parameters. Empirically, our models
achieve strong results on the Visual Dialog challenge 2019 (rank 3 on NDCG and
high balance across metrics), and substantially outperform the winner of the
Visual Dialog challenge 2018 on most metrics.

Title: A Common Semantic Space for Monolingual and Cross-Lingual
  Meta-Embeddings
Authors: Iker Garc\'ia, Rodrigo Agerri, German Rigau
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  This paper presents a new technique for creating monolingual and
cross-lingual meta-embeddings. Our method integrates multiple word embeddings
created from complementary techniques, textual sources, knowledge bases and
languages. Existing word vectors are projected to a common semantic space using
linear transformations and averaging. With our method the resulting
meta-embeddings maintain the dimensionality of the original embeddings without
losing information while dealing with the out-of-vocabulary problem. An
extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our technique
with respect to previous work on various intrinsic and extrinsic multilingual
evaluations, obtaining competitive results for Semantic Textual Similarity and
state-of-the-art performance for word similarity and POS tagging (English and
Spanish). The resulting cross-lingual meta-embeddings also exhibit excellent
cross-lingual transfer learning capabilities. In other words, we can leverage
pre-trained source embeddings from a resource-rich language in order to improve
the word representations for under-resourced languages.

Title: Securing Wireless Sensor Networks Against Denial-of-Sleep Attacks Using

\\
  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been vastly employed in the collection
and transmission of data via wireless networks. This type of network is
nowadays used in many applications for surveillance activities in various
environments due to its low cost and easy communications. In these networks,
the sensors use a limited power source which after its depletion, since it is
non-renewable, network lifetime ends. Due to the weaknesses in sensor nodes,
they are vulnerable to many threats. One notable attack threating WSN is Denial
of Sleep (DoS). DoS attacks denotes the loss of energy in these sensors by
keeping the nodes from going into sleep and energy-saving mode. In this paper,
the Abnormal Sensor Detection Accuracy (ASDA-RSA) method is utilised to
counteract DoS attacks to reducing the amount of energy consumed. The ASDA-RSA
schema in this paper consists of two phases to enhancement security in the
WSNs. In the first phase, a clustering approach based on energy and distance is
used to select the proper cluster head and in the second phase, the RSA
cryptography algorithm and interlock protocol are used here along with an
authentication method, to prevent DoS attacks. Moreover, ASDA-RSA method is
evaluated here via extensive simulations carried out in NS-2. The simulation
results indicate that the WSN network performance metrics are improved in terms
of average throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), network lifetime, detection
ratio, and average residual energy.

Title: Performance Evaluation of Multiparty Authentication in 5G IIoT

Categories: cs.CR cs.PF
\\
  With the rapid development of various emerging technologies such as the
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), there is a need to secure communications
between such devices. Communication system delays are one of the factors that
adversely affect the performance of an authentication system. 5G networks
enable greater data throughput and lower latency, which presents new
opportunities for the secure authentication of business transactions between
IIoT devices. We evaluate an approach to developing a flexible and secure model
for authenticating IIoT components in dynamic 5G environments.

Title: Low-Cost Anti-Copying 2D Barcode by Exploiting Channel Noise
  Characteristics
Authors: Ning Xie (Senior Member, IEEE), Qiqi Zhang, Ji Hu, Gang Luo, and
  Changsheng Chen (Member, IEEE)
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  In this paper, for overcoming the drawbacks of the prior approaches, such as
low generality, high cost, and high overhead, we propose a Low-Cost
Anti-Copying (LCAC) 2D barcode by exploiting the difference between the noise
characteristics of legal and illegal channels. An embedding strategy is
proposed, and for a variant of it, we also make the corresponding analysis. For
accurately evaluating the performance of our approach, a theoretical model of
the noise in an illegal channel is established by using a generalized Gaussian
distribution. By comparing with the experimental results based on various
printers, scanners, and a mobile phone, it can be found that the sample
histogram and curve fitting of the theoretical model match well, so it can be
concluded that the theoretical model works well. For evaluating the security of
the proposed LCAC code, besides the direct-copying (DC) attack, the improved
version, which is the synthesized-copying (SC) attack, is also considered in
this paper. Based on the theoretical model, we build a prediction function to
optimize the parameters of our approach. The parameters optimization
incorporates the covertness requirement, the robustness requirement and a
tradeoff between the production cost and the cost of illegally-copying attacks
together. The experimental results show that the proposed LCAC code with two
printers and two scanners can detect the DC attack effectively and resist the
SC attack up to the access of 14 legal copies.

Title: Performance of Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques for Physical
  Layer Authentication
Authors: Linda Senigagliesi, Marco Baldi, and Ennio Gambi
Categories: cs.CR cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
Comments: 15 pages, 13 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Forensics and Security. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1909.07969
\\
  In this paper we consider authentication at the physical layer, in which the
authenticator aims at distinguishing a legitimate supplicant from an attacker
on the basis of the characteristics of the communication channel.
Authentication is performed over a set of parallel wireless channels affected
by time-varying fading at the presence of a malicious attacker, whose channel
has a spatial correlation with the supplicant's one. We first propose the use
of two different statistical decision methods, and we prove that using a large
number of references (in the form of channel estimates) affected by different
levels of time-varying fading is not beneficial from a security point of view.
We then propose to exploit classification methods based on machine learning. In
order to face the worst case of an authenticator provided with no forged
messages during training, we consider one-class classifiers. When instead the
training set includes some forged messages, we resort to more conventional
binary classifiers, considering the cases in which such messages are either
labelled or not. For the latter case, we exploit clustering algorithms to label
the training set. The performance of both nearest neighbor (NN) and support
vector machine (SVM) classification techniques is assessed. Through numerical
examples, we show that under the same probability of false alarm, one-class
classification (OCC) algorithms achieve the lowest probability of missed
detection when a small spatial correlation exists between the main channel and
the adversary one, while statistical methods are advantageous when the spatial
correlation between the two channels is large.

  In this paper, we introduce a Learning Assisted Side Channel delay Analysis

unlike the prior art, does not require a Golden IC. Instead, it trains a Neural

Title: Increasing the robustness of DNNs against image corruptions by playing
  the Game of Noise
Authors: Evgenia Rusak, Lukas Schott, Roland Zimmermann, Julian Bitterwolf,

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The human visual system is remarkably robust against a wide range of
naturally occurring variations and corruptions like rain or snow. In contrast,
the performance of modern image recognition models strongly degrades when
evaluated on previously unseen corruptions. Here, we demonstrate that a simple
but properly tuned training with additive Gaussian and Speckle noise
generalizes surprisingly well to unseen corruptions, easily reaching the
previous state of the art on the corruption benchmark ImageNet-C (with
ResNet50) and on MNIST-C. We build on top of these strong baseline results and
show that an adversarial training of the recognition model against uncorrelated
worst-case noise distributions leads to an additional increase in performance.
This regularization can be combined with previously proposed defense methods
for further improvement.

\\
  Micro unmanned aerial vehicles (mUAV) became very common in recent years. As
a result of their widespread usage, when they are flown by hobbyists illegally,
crucial risks are imposed and such mUAVs need to be sensed by security systems.
Furthermore, the sensing of mUAVs are essential for also swarm robotics
research where the individuals in a flock of robots require systems to sense
and localize each other for coordinated operation. In order to obtain such
systems, there are studies to detect mUAVs utilizing different sensing mediums,
such as vision, infrared and sound signals, and small-scale radars. However,
there are still challenges that awaits to be handled in this field such as
integrating tracking approaches to the vision-based detection systems to
enhance accuracy and computational complexity. For this reason, in this study,
we combine various tracking approaches to a vision-based mUAV detection system
available in the literature, in order to evaluate different tracking approaches
in terms of accuracy and as well as investigate the effect of such integration
to the computational cost.

  We propose a method to make mobile screenshots easily searchable. In this
paper, we present the workflow in which we: 1) preprocessed a collection of
screenshots, 2) identified script presentin image, 3) extracted unstructured
text from images, 4) identifiedlanguage of the extracted text, 5) extracted
keywords from the text, 6) identified tags based on image features, 7) expanded
tag set by identifying related keywords, 8) inserted image tags with relevant
images after ranking and indexed them to make it searchable on device. We made
the pipeline which supports multiple languages and executed it on-device, which
addressed privacy concerns. We developed novel architectures for components in
the pipeline, optimized performance and memory for on-device computation. We
observed from experimentation that the solution developed can reduce overall
user effort and improve end user experience while searching, whose results are
published.

Title: Automatic Discovery of Political Meme Genres with Diverse Appearances

Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Forms of human communication are not static --- we expect some evolution in
the way information is conveyed over time because of advances in technology.
One example of this phenomenon is the image-based meme, which has emerged as a
dominant form of political messaging in the past decade. While originally used
to spread jokes on social media, memes are now having an outsized impact on
public perception of world events. A significant challenge in automatic meme
analysis has been the development of a strategy to match memes from within a
single genre when the appearances of the images vary. Such variation is
especially common in memes exhibiting mimicry. For example, when voters perform
a common hand gesture to signal their support for a candidate. In this paper we
introduce a scalable automated visual recognition pipeline for discovering
political meme genres of diverse appearance. This pipeline can ingest meme
images from a social network, apply computer vision-based techniques to extract
local features and index new images into a database, and then organize the
memes into related genres. To validate this approach, we perform a large case
study on the 2019 Indonesian Presidential Election using a new dataset of over
two million images collected from Twitter and Instagram. Results show that this
approach can discover new meme genres with visually diverse images that share
common stylistic elements, paving the way forward for further work in semantic
analysis and content attribution.

Title: Spatio-Temporal Ranked-Attention Networks for Video Captioning
Authors: Anoop Cherian, Jue Wang, Chiori Hori, Tim K. Marks
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Generating video descriptions automatically is a challenging task that
involves a complex interplay between spatio-temporal visual features and
language models. Given that videos consist of spatial (frame-level) features
and their temporal evolutions, an effective captioning model should be able to
attend to these different cues selectively. To this end, we propose a
Spatio-Temporal and Temporo-Spatial (STaTS) attention model which, conditioned
on the language state, hierarchically combines spatial and temporal attention
to videos in two different orders: (i) a spatio-temporal (ST) sub-model, which
first attends to regions that have temporal evolution, then temporally pools
the features from these regions; and (ii) a temporo-spatial (TS) sub-model,
which first decides a single frame to attend to, then applies spatial attention
within that frame. We propose a novel LSTM-based temporal ranking function,
which we call ranked attention, for the ST model to capture action dynamics.
Our entire framework is trained end-to-end. We provide experiments on two
benchmark datasets: MSVD and MSR-VTT. Our results demonstrate the synergy
between the ST and TS modules, outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Learning to Augment Expressions for Few-shot Fine-grained Facial
  Expression Recognition

\\
  Affective computing and cognitive theory are widely used in modern
human-computer interaction scenarios. Human faces, as the most prominent and
easily accessible features, have attracted great attention from researchers.
Since humans have rich emotions and developed musculature, there exist a lot of
fine-grained expressions in real-world applications. However, it is extremely
time-consuming to collect and annotate a large number of facial images, of
which may even require psychologists to correctly categorize them. To the best
of our knowledge, the existing expression datasets are only limited to several
basic facial expressions, which are not sufficient to support our ambitions in
developing successful human-computer interaction systems. To this end, a novel
Fine-grained Facial Expression Database - F2ED is contributed in this paper,
and it includes more than 200k images with 54 facial expressions from 119
persons. Considering the phenomenon of uneven data distribution and lack of
samples is common in real-world scenarios, we further evaluate several tasks of
few-shot expression learning by virtue of our F2ED, which are to recognize the
facial expressions given only few training instances. These tasks mimic human
performance to learn robust and general representation from few examples. To
address such few-shot tasks, we propose a unified task-driven framework -
Compositional Generative Adversarial Network (Comp-GAN) learning to synthesize
facial images and thus augmenting the instances of few-shot expression classes.
Extensive experiments are conducted on F2ED and existing facial expression
datasets, i.e., JAFFE and FER2013, to validate the efficacy of our F2ED in
pre-training facial expression recognition network and the effectiveness of our
proposed approach Comp-GAN to improve the performance of few-shot recognition
tasks.

Title: Interpreting Galaxy Deblender GAN from the Discriminator's Perspective
Authors: Heyi Li, Yuewei Lin, Klaus Mueller, Wei Xu
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are well known for their unsupervised
learning capabilities. A recent success in the field of astronomy is deblending
two overlapping galaxy images via a branched GAN model. However, it remains a
significant challenge to comprehend how the network works, which is
particularly difficult for non-expert users. This research focuses on behaviors
of one of the network's major components, the Discriminator, which plays a
vital role but is often overlooked, Specifically, we enhance the Layer-wise
Relevance Propagation (LRP) scheme to generate a heatmap-based visualization.
We call this technique Polarized-LRP and it consists of two parts i.e. positive
contribution heatmaps for ground truth images and negative contribution
heatmaps for generated images. Using the Galaxy Zoo dataset we demonstrate that
our method clearly reveals attention areas of the Discriminator when
differentiating generated galaxy images from ground truth images. To connect
the Discriminator's impact on the Generator, we visualize the gradual changes
of the Generator across the training process. An interesting result we have
achieved there is the detection of a problematic data augmentation procedure
that would else have remained hidden. We find that our proposed method serves
as a useful visual analytical tool for a deeper understanding of GAN models.

Title: FPCR-Net: Feature Pyramidal Correlation and Residual Reconstruction for
  Semi-supervised Optical Flow Estimation
Authors: Xiaolin Song, Jingyu Yang, Cuiling Lan, and Wenjun Zeng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables
\\
  Optical flow estimation is an important yet challenging problem in the field
of video analytics. The features of different semantics levels/layers of a
convolutional neural network can provide information of different granularity.
To exploit such flexible and comprehensive information, we propose a
semi-supervised Feature Pyramidal Correlation and Residual Reconstruction
Network (FPCR-Net) for optical flow estimation from frame pairs. It consists of
two main modules: pyramid correlation mapping and residual reconstruction. The
pyramid correlation mapping module takes advantage of the multi-scale
correlations of global/local patches by aggregating features of different
scales to form a multi-level cost volume. The residual reconstruction module
aims to reconstruct the sub-band high-frequency residuals of finer optical flow
in each stage. Based on the pyramid correlation mapping, we further propose a
correlation-warping-normalization (CWN) module to efficiently exploit the
correlation dependency. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme
achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with improvement by 0.80, 1.15 and
0.10 in terms of average end-point error (AEE) against competing baseline
methods - FlowNet2, LiteFlowNet and PWC-Net on the Final pass of Sintel
dataset, respectively.

  In surgical navigation, finding correspondence between preoperative plan and
intraoperative anatomy, the so-called registration task, is imperative. One
promising approach is to intraoperatively digitize anatomy and register it with
the preoperative plan. State-of-the-art commercial navigation systems implement
such approaches for pedicle screw placement in spinal fusion surgery. Although
these systems improve surgical accuracy, they are not gold standard in clinical
practice. Besides economical reasons, this may be due to their difficult
integration into clinical workflows and unintuitive navigation feedback.
Augmented Reality has the potential to overcome these limitations.
Consequently, we propose a surgical navigation approach comprising
intraoperative surface digitization for registration and intuitive holographic
navigation for pedicle screw placement that runs entirely on the Microsoft
HoloLens. Preliminary results from phantom experiments suggest that the method
may meet clinical accuracy requirements.

Title: Two-Phase Object-Based Deep Learning for Multi-temporal SAR Image Change
  Detection
Authors: Xinzheng Zhang, Guo Liu, Ce Zhang, Peter M Atkinson, Xiaoheng Tan, Xin
  Jian, Xichuan Zhou, Yongming Li
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Change detection is one of the fundamental applications of synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) images. However, speckle noise presented in SAR images has a much
negative effect on change detection. In this research, a novel two-phase
object-based deep learning approach is proposed for multi-temporal SAR image
change detection. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed approach
brings two main innovations. One is to classify all pixels into three
categories rather than two categories: unchanged pixels, changed pixels caused
by strong speckle (false changes), and changed pixels formed by real terrain
variation (real changes). The other is to group neighboring pixels into
segmented into superpixel objects (from pixels) such as to exploit local
spatial context. Two phases are designed in the methodology: 1) Generate
objects based on the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm, and
discriminate these objects into changed and unchanged classes using fuzzy
c-means (FCM) clustering and a deep PCANet. The prediction of this Phase is the
set of changed and unchanged superpixels. 2) Deep learning on the pixel sets
over the changed superpixels only, obtained in the first phase, to discriminate
real changes from false changes. SLIC is employed again to achieve new
superpixels in the second phase. Low rank and sparse decomposition are applied
to these new superpixels to suppress speckle noise significantly. A further
clustering step is applied to these new superpixels via FCM. A new PCANet is
then trained to classify two kinds of changed superpixels to achieve the final
change maps. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared with benchmark
methods, the proposed approach can distinguish real changes from false changes
effectively with significantly reduced false alarm rates, and achieve up to
99.71% change detection accuracy using multi-temporal SAR imagery.

  Image-based virtual try-on for fashion has gained considerable attention
recently. The task requires trying on a clothing item on a target model image.
An efficient framework for this is composed of two stages: (1) warping
(transforming) the try-on cloth to align with the pose and shape of the target
model, and (2) a texture transfer module to seamlessly integrate the warped
try-on cloth onto the target model image. Existing methods suffer from
artifacts and distortions in their try-on output. In this work, we present
SieveNet, a framework for robust image-based virtual try-on. Firstly, we
introduce a multi-stage coarse-to-fine warping network to better model
fine-grained intricacies (while transforming the try-on cloth) and train it
with a novel perceptual geometric matching loss. Next, we introduce a try-on
cloth conditioned segmentation mask prior to improve the texture transfer
network. Finally, we also introduce a dueling triplet loss strategy for
training the texture translation network which further improves the quality of
the generated try-on results. We present extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations of each component of the proposed pipeline and show significant
performance improvements against the current state-of-the-art method.

Title: Compounding the Performance Improvements of Assembled Techniques in a
  Convolutional Neural Network
Authors: Jungkyu Lee, Taeryun Won, Kiho Hong

Comments: 11 pages, 3 figures, 16 tables
\\
  Recent studies in image classification have demonstrated a variety of
techniques for improving the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). However, attempts to combine existing techniques to create a practical
model are still uncommon. In this study, we carry out extensive experiments to
validate that carefully assembling these techniques and applying them to a
basic CNN model in combination can improve the accuracy and robustness of the
model while minimizing the loss of throughput. For example, our proposed
ResNet-50 shows an improvement in top-1 accuracy from 76.3% to 82.78%, and an
mCE improvement from 76.0% to 48.9%, on the ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validation set.
With these improvements, inference throughput only decreases from 536 to 312.
The resulting model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with
similar accuracy in terms of mCE and inference throughput. To verify the
performance improvement in transfer learning, fine grained classification and
image retrieval tasks were tested on several open datasets and showed that the
improvement to backbone network performance boosted transfer learning
performance significantly. Our approach achieved 1st place in the iFood
Competition Fine-Grained Visual Recognition at CVPR 2019, and the source code
and trained models are available at https://github.com/clovaai/assembled-cnn

Title: Review: deep learning on 3D point clouds
Authors: Saifullahi Aminu Bello, Shangshu Yu, Cheng Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Point cloud is point sets defined in 3D metric space. Point cloud has become
one of the most significant data format for 3D representation. Its gaining
increased popularity as a result of increased availability of acquisition
devices, such as LiDAR, as well as increased application in areas such as
robotics, autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality. Deep learning is
now the most powerful tool for data processing in computer vision, becoming the
most preferred technique for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and
detection. While deep learning techniques are mainly applied to data with a
structured grid, point cloud, on the other hand, is unstructured. The
unstructuredness of point clouds makes use of deep learning for its processing
directly very challenging. Earlier approaches overcome this challenge by
preprocessing the point cloud into a structured grid format at the cost of
increased computational cost or lost of depth information. Recently, however,
many state-of-the-arts deep learning techniques that directly operate on point
cloud are being developed. This paper contains a survey of the recent
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques that mainly focused on point cloud
data. We first briefly discussed the major challenges faced when using deep
learning directly on point cloud, we also briefly discussed earlier approaches
which overcome the challenges by preprocessing the point cloud into a
structured grid. We then give the review of the various state-of-the-art deep
learning approaches that directly process point cloud in its unstructured form.
We introduced the popular 3D point cloud benchmark datasets. And we also
further discussed the application of deep learning in popular 3D vision tasks
including classification, segmentation and detection.

  Machines that can predict the effect of physical interactions on the dynamics
of previously unseen object instances are important for creating better robots
and interactive virtual worlds. In this work, we focus on predicting the
dynamics of 3D objects on a plane that have just been subjected to an impulsive
force. In particular, we predict the changes in state - 3D position, rotation,
velocities, and stability. Different from previous work, our approach can
generalize dynamics predictions to object shapes and initial conditions that
were unseen during training. Our method takes the 3D object's shape as a point
cloud and its initial linear and angular velocities as input. We extract shape
features and use a recurrent neural network to predict the full change in state
at each time step. Our model can support training with data from both a physics
engine or the real world. Experiments show that we can accurately predict the
changes in state for unseen object geometries and initial conditions.

attracting more than 100 teams around the world. We provide a large-scale drone
captured dataset, VisDrone, which includes four tracks, i.e., (1) image object
detection, (2) video object detection, (3) single object tracking, and (4)
multi-object tracking. This paper first presents a thorough review of object
detection and tracking datasets and benchmarks, and discuss the challenges of
collecting large-scale drone-based object detection and tracking datasets with
fully manual annotations. After that, we describe our VisDrone dataset, which
is captured over various urban/suburban areas of $14$ different cities across
China from North to South. Being the largest such dataset ever published,
VisDrone enables extensive evaluation and investigation of visual analysis
algorithms on the drone platform. We provide a detailed analysis of the current
state of the field of large-scale object detection and tracking on drones, and
conclude the challenge as well as propose future directions and improvements.
We expect the benchmark largely boost the research and development in video

\\
  Ensemble methods, traditionally built with independently trained
de-correlated models, have proven to be efficient methods for reducing the
remaining residual generalization error, which results in robust and accurate
methods for real-world applications. In the context of deep learning, however,
training an ensemble of deep networks is costly and generates high redundancy
which is inefficient. In this paper, we present experiments on Ensembles with
Shared Representations (ESRs) based on convolutional networks to demonstrate,
quantitatively and qualitatively, their data processing efficiency and
scalability to large-scale datasets of facial expressions. We show that
redundancy and computational load can be dramatically reduced by varying the
branching level of the ESR without loss of diversity and generalization power,
which are both important for ensemble performance. Experiments on large-scale
datasets suggest that ESRs reduce the remaining residual generalization error
on the AffectNet and FER+ datasets, reach human-level performance, and
outperform state-of-the-art methods on facial expression recognition in the
wild using emotion and affect concepts.

  Success of deep neural networks in the framework of remote sensing (RS) image

BigEarthNet is a new large-scale Sentinel-2 benchmark archive that has been

are challenging to be accurately described by considering only (single-date)
Sentinel-2 images. To further increase the effectiveness of BigEarthNet, in
this paper we introduce an alternative class-nomenclature to allow DL models
for better learning and describing the complex spatial and spectral information
content of the Sentinel-2 images. This is achieved by interpreting and
arranging the CLC Level-3 nomenclature based on the properties of Sentinel-2
images in a new nomenclature of 19 classes. Then, the new class-nomenclature of
BigEarthNet is used within state-of-the-art DL models (namely VGG model at the
depth of 16 and 19 layers [VGG16 and VGG19] and ResNet model at the depth of
50, 101 and 152 layers [ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152] as well as K-Branch CNN
model) in the context of multi-label classification. Experimental results show
that the models trained from scratch on BigEarthNet outperform those
pre-trained on ImageNet, especially in relation to some complex classes
including agriculture and other vegetated and natural environments. All DL
models are made publicly available, offering an important resource to guide
future progress on content based image retrieval and scene classification
problems in RS.

Title: Latency-Aware Differentiable Neural Architecture Search
Authors: Yuhui Xu, Lingxi Xie, Xiaopeng Zhang, Xin Chen, Bowen Shi, Qi Tian,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Differentiable neural architecture search methods became popular in automated
machine learning, mainly due to their low search costs and flexibility in
designing the search space. However, these methods suffer the difficulty in
optimizing network, so that the searched network is often unfriendly to
hardware. This paper deals with this problem by adding a differentiable latency
loss term into optimization, so that the search process can tradeoff between
accuracy and latency with a balancing coefficient. The core of latency
prediction is to encode each network architecture and feed it into a
multi-layer regressor, with the training data being collected from randomly
sampling a number of architectures and evaluating them on the hardware. We
evaluate our approach on NVIDIA Tesla-P100 GPUs. With 100K sampled
architectures (requiring a few hours), the latency prediction module arrives at
a relative error of lower than 10\%. Equipped with this module, the search
method can reduce the latency by 20% meanwhile preserving the accuracy. Our
approach also enjoys the ability of being transplanted to a wide range of
hardware platforms with very few efforts, or being used to optimizing other
non-differentiable factors such as power consumption.

Title: GraphBGS: Background Subtraction via Recovery of Graph Signals
Authors: Jhony H. Giraldo, Thierry Bouwmans
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Graph-based algorithms have been successful approaching the problems of
unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Recently, the theory of graph signal
processing and semi-supervised learning have been combined leading to new
developments and insights in the field of machine learning. In this paper,
concepts of recovery of graph signals and semi-supervised learning are
introduced in the problem of background subtraction. We propose a new algorithm
named GraphBGS, this method uses a Mask R-CNN for instances segmentation;
temporal median filter for background initialization; motion, texture, color,
and structural features for representing the nodes of a graph; k-nearest
neighbors for the construction of the graph; and finally a semi-supervised
method inspired from the theory of recovery of graph signals to solve the
problem of background subtraction. The method is evaluated on the publicly
available change detection, and scene background initialization databases.
Experimental results show that GraphBGS outperforms unsupervised background
subtraction algorithms in some challenges of the change detection dataset. And
most significantly, this method outperforms generative adversarial networks in
unseen videos in some sequences of the scene background initialization
database.

Title: Subjective Annotation for a Frame Interpolation Benchmark using Artifact
  Amplification

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1901.05362
\\
  Current benchmarks for optical flow algorithms evaluate the estimation either
directly by comparing the predicted flow fields with the ground truth or
indirectly by using the predicted flow fields for frame interpolation and then
comparing the interpolated frames with the actual frames. In the latter case,
objective quality measures such as the mean squared error are typically
employed. However, it is well known that for image quality assessment, the
actual quality experienced by the user cannot be fully deduced from such simple
measures. Hence, we conducted a subjective quality assessment crowdscouring
study for the interpolated frames provided by one of the optical flow
benchmarks, the Middlebury benchmark. It contains interpolated frames from 155
methods applied to each of 8 contents. We collected forced choice paired
comparisons between interpolated images and corresponding ground truth. To
increase the sensitivity of observers when judging minute difference in paired
comparisons we introduced a new method to the field of full-reference quality
assessment, called artifact amplification. From the crowdsourcing data we
reconstructed absolute quality scale values according to Thurstone's model. As
a result, we obtained a re-ranking of the 155 participating algorithms w.r.t.
the visual quality of the interpolated frames. This re-ranking not only shows
the necessity of visual quality assessment as another evaluation metric for
optical flow and frame interpolation benchmarks, the results also provide the
ground truth for designing novel image quality assessment (IQA) methods
dedicated to perceptual quality of interpolated images. As a first step, we
proposed such a new full-reference method, called WAE-IQA. By weighing the
local differences between an interpolated image and its ground truth WAE-IQA
performed slightly better than the currently best FR-IQA approach from the
literature.

  Attribute editing has become an important and emerging topic of computer
vision. In this paper, we consider a task: given a reference garment image A
and another image B with target attribute (collar/sleeve), generate a
photo-realistic image which combines the texture from reference A and the new
attribute from reference B. The highly convoluted attributes and the lack of
paired data are the main challenges to the task. To overcome those limitations,
we propose a novel self-supervised model to synthesize garment images with
disentangled attributes (e.g., collar and sleeves) without paired data. Our
method consists of a reconstruction learning step and an adversarial learning
step. The model learns texture and location information through reconstruction
learning. And, the model's capability is generalized to achieve
single-attribute manipulation by adversarial learning. Meanwhile, we compose a
new dataset, named GarmentSet, with annotation of landmarks of collars and
sleeves on clean garment images. Extensive experiments on this dataset and
real-world samples demonstrate that our method can synthesize much better
results than the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative
comparisons.

Title: Combining PRNU and noiseprint for robust and efficient device source
  identification
Authors: Davide Cozzolino, Francesco Marra, Diego Gragnaniello, Giovanni Poggi,
  and Luisa Verdoliva
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  PRNU-based image processing is a key asset in digital multimedia forensics.
It allows for reliable device identification and effective detection and
localization of image forgeries, in very general conditions. However,
performance impairs significantly in challenging conditions involving low
quality and quantity of data. These include working on compressed and cropped
images, or estimating the camera PRNU pattern based on only a few images. To
boost the performance of PRNU-based analyses in such conditions we propose to
leverage the image noiseprint, a recently proposed camera-model fingerprint
that has proved effective for several forensic tasks. Numerical experiments on
datasets widely used for source identification prove that the proposed method
ensures a significant performance improvement in a wide range of challenging
situations.

Title: Unsupervised Learning of Camera Pose with Compositional Re-estimation
Authors: Seyed Shahabeddin Nabavi, Mehrdad Hosseinzadeh, Ramin Fahimi, Yang
  Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to WACV 2020
\\
  We consider the problem of unsupervised camera pose estimation. Given an
input video sequence, our goal is to estimate the camera pose (i.e. the camera
motion) between consecutive frames. Traditionally, this problem is tackled by
placing strict constraints on the transformation vector or by incorporating
optical flow through a complex pipeline. We propose an alternative approach
that utilizes a compositional re-estimation process for camera pose estimation.
Given an input, we first estimate a depth map. Our method then iteratively
estimates the camera motion based on the estimated depth map. Our approach
significantly improves the predicted camera motion both quantitatively and
visually. Furthermore, the re-estimation resolves the problem of
out-of-boundaries pixels in a novel and simple way. Another advantage of our
approach is that it is adaptable to other camera pose estimation approaches.
Experimental analysis on KITTI benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised camera
ego-motion estimation.

Title: Efficient Bitruss Decomposition for Large-scale Bipartite Graphs
Authors: Kai Wang, Xuemin Lin, Lu Qin, Wenjie Zhang, Ying Zhang
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  Cohesive subgraph mining in bipartite graphs becomes a popular research topic
recently. An important structure k-bitruss is the maximal cohesive subgraph
where each edge is contained in at least k butterflies (i.e., (2,
2)-bicliques). In this paper, we study the bitruss decomposition problem which
aims to find all the k-bitrusses for k >= 0. The existing bottom-up techniques
need to iteratively peel the edges with the lowest butterfly support. In this
peeling process, these techniques are time-consuming to enumerate all the
supporting butterflies for each edge. To relax this issue, we first propose a
novel online index -- the BE-Index which compresses butterflies into k-blooms
(i.e., (2, k)-bicliques). Based on the BE-Index, the new bitruss decomposition
algorithm BiT-BU is proposed, along with two batch-based optimizations, to
accomplish the butterfly enumeration of the peeling process in an efficient
way. Furthermore, the BiT-PC algorithm is devised which is more efficient
against handling the edges with high butterfly supports. We theoretically show
that our new algorithms significantly reduce the time complexities of the
existing algorithms. Also, we conduct extensive experiments on real datasets
and the result demonstrates that our new techniques can speed up the
state-of-the-art techniques by up to two orders of magnitude.

Title: Generative Datalog with Continuous Distributions

Categories: cs.DB cs.LO
\\
  Arguing for the need to combine declarative and probabilistic programming,
B\'ar\'any et al. (TODS 2017) recently introduced a probabilistic extension of
Datalog as a "purely declarative probabilistic programming language." We
revisit this language and propose a more principled approach towards defining
its semantics. It is based on standard notions from probability theory known as
stochastic kernels and Markov processes. This allows us to extend the semantics
to continuous probability distributions, thereby settling an open problem posed
by B\'ar\'any et al. We show that our semantics is fairly robust, allowing both
parallel execution and arbitrary chase orders when evaluating a program. We
cast our semantics in the framework of infinite probabilistic databases (Grohe
and Lindner, ICDT 2020), and we show that the semantics remains meaningful even
when the input of a probabilistic Datalog program is an arbitrary probabilistic
database.

Title: FRaZ: A Generic High-Fidelity Fixed-Ratio Lossy Compression Framework
  for Scientific Floating-point Data
Authors: Robert Underwood, Sheng Di, Jon C. Calhoun, and Franck Cappello
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 12 pages
\\
  With ever-increasing volumes of scientific floating-point data being produced
by high-performance computing applications, significantly reducing scientific
floating-point data size is critical, and error-controlled lossy compressors
have been developed for years. None of the existing scientific floating-point
lossy data compressors, however, support effective fixed-ratio lossy
compression. Yet fixed-ratio lossy compression for scientific floating-point
data not only compresses to the requested ratio but also respects a
user-specified error bound with higher fidelity. In this paper, we present
FRaZ: a generic fixed-ratio lossy compression framework respecting
user-specified error constraints. The contribution is twofold. (1) We develop
an efficient iterative approach to accurately determine the appropriate error
settings for different lossy compressors based on target compression ratios.
(2) We perform a thorough performance and accuracy evaluation for our proposed
fixed-ratio compression framework with multiple state-of-the-art
error-controlled lossy compressors, using several real-world scientific
floating-point datasets from different domains. Experiments show that FRaZ
effectively identifies the optimum error setting in the entire error setting
space of any given lossy compressor. While fixed-ratio lossy compression is
slower than fixed-error compression, it provides an important new lossy
compression technique for users of very large scientific floating-point
datasets.

Title: Dynamic Byzantine Reliable Broadcast [Technical Report]
Authors: Rachid Guerraoui and Jovan Komatovic and Dragos-Adrian Seredinschi

Comments: This work has been supported in part by a grant from Interchain
  Foundation
\\
  Reliable broadcast is a powerful primitive guaranteeing that, intuitively,
all processes in a distributed system deliver the same set of messages. There
is a twofold reason why this primitive is appealing: (i) we can implement it
deterministically in a completely asynchronous environment, unlike stronger
primitives like consensus and total-order broadcast, and yet (ii) it is
powerful enough to implement numerous useful applications like payment systems.
  The problem we tackle in this paper is that of dynamic reliable broadcast,
i.e., enabling processes to join or leave the system. This is desirable
property for long-lived applications supposed to be highly available, yet has
been precluded in previous asynchronous reliable broadcast protocols.
  We introduce the first specification of a dynamic Byzantine reliable
broadcast (DBRB) primitive that is amenable to an asynchronous implementation.
Indeed, we present an algorithm that implements this specification in an
asynchronous environment. Our algorithm ensures that if any correct process in
the system broadcasts (resp. delivers) a message, then every correct process in
the system delivers that message, or leaves the system. We assume that, at any
point in time, 2/3 of the processes in the system are correct, which is tight.
We also prove that even if only one process in the system can fail---and it can
fail by merely crashing---then it is impossible to implement a stronger
primitive, ensuring that if any correct process in the system broadcasts (resp.
delivers) a message, then every correct process in the system delivers that
message, including those that eventually leave.

Title: Consistency of Proof-of-Stake Blockchains with Concurrent Honest Slot
  Leaders

Categories: cs.DC cs.CR cs.DM
Comments: Initial submission. arXiv admin note: text overlap with
  arXiv:1911.10187
\\
  We improve the fundamental security threshold of Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
blockchain protocols, reflecting for the first time the positive effect of
rounds with multiple honest leaders. Current analyses of the longest-chain rule
in PoS blockchain protocols reduce consistency to the dynamics of an abstract,
round-based block creation process determined by three probabilities: $p_A$,
the probability that a round has at least one adversarial leader; $p_h$, the
probability that a round has a single honest leader; and $p_H$, the probability
that a round has multiple, but honest, leaders. We present a consistency
analysis that achieves the optimal threshold $p_h + p_H > p_A$. This is a first
in the literature and can be applied to both the simple synchronous setting and
the setting with bounded delays. We also achieve the optimal consistency error
$e^{-\Theta(k)}$, $k$ being the confirmation time.
  The consistency analyses in Ouroboros Praos (Eurocrypt 2018) and Genesis (CCS
2018) assume that $p_h - p_H > p_A$; the analyses in Sleepy Consensus
(Asiacrypt 2017) and Snow White (Fin. Crypto 2019) assume that $p_h > p_A$.
Thus existing analyses either incur a penalty for multiply-honest rounds, or
treat them neutrally. In addition, previous analyses completely break down when
$p_h < p_A$. Our new results can be directly applied to improve the consistency
of these existing protocols. We emphasize that these thresholds determine the
critical tradeoff between honest majority, network delays, and consistency
error.
  We complement our results with a consistency analysis in the setting where
uniquely honest slots are rare, event letting $p_h = 0$, under the added
assumption that honest players adopt a consistent chain selection rule. Our
analysis provides a direct connection between the Ouroboros analysis focusing
on "relative margin" and the Sleepy analysis focusing on "strong pivots."

  In the winter of 1976, Alexander Rinnooy Kan and Jan Karel Lenstra defended
their PhD theses at the University of Amsterdam. Gene Lawler was on their
committees. It was a natural idea to turn the theses into a textbook on
scheduling. They set out to compile a survey with Ron Graham (1979), but
progress on the book was hampered by the many research opportunities offered by
the field. After David Shmoys joined the team in the mid 1980's, several
chapters were drafted, and the survey was rewritten (1993). Gene passed away in
1994. Colleagues were asked to contribute chapters or to complete existing
drafts. However, by the turn of the century the project was losing its
momentum, and finite convergence to completion fell beyond our reach.
  Over the years, several chapters have been used in the classroom. We continue
to receive requests from colleagues who look for a text on the elements of
scheduling at an advanced undergraduate or early graduate level. This document
is a compilation of what currently exists. We have made a marginal effort in
patching it up at some places but is essentially what was written long ago. We
did make an attempt to include most of the citations in the bibliography.

Title: A New Fairness Model based on User's Objective for Multi-user
  Multi-processor Online Scheduling
Authors: Debasis Dwibedy, Rakesh Mohanty
Categories: cs.DS cs.OS
Comments: 11 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Resources of a multi-user system in multi-processor online scheduling are
shared by competing users in which fairness is a major performance criterion
for resource allocation. Fairness ensures equality in resource sharing among
the users. According to our knowledge, fairness based on the user's objective
has neither been comprehensively studied nor a formal fairness model has been
well defined in the literature. This motivates us to explore and define a new
model to ensure algorithmic fairness with quantitative performance measures
based on optimization of the user's objective. In this paper, we propose a new
model for fairness in Multi-user Multi-processor Online Scheduling
Problem(MUMPOSP). We introduce and formally define quantitative fairness
measures based on user's objective by optimizing makespan for individual user
in our proposed fairness model. We also define the unfairness of deprived users
and absolute fairness of an algorithm. We obtain lower bound results for the
absolute fairness for m identical machines with equal length jobs. We show that
our proposed fairness model can serve as a framework for measuring algorithmic
fairness by considering various optimality criteria such as flow time and sum
of completion times.

\\
  Rotation distance between rooted binary trees is the minimum number of simple
rotations needed to transform one tree into the other. Computing the rotation
distance between a pair of rooted trees can be quickly reduced in cases where
there is a common edge between the trees, or where a single rotation introduces
a common edge. Tree pairs which do not have such a reduction are difficult tree
pairs, where there is no generally known first step. Here, we describe efforts
to count and estimate the number of such difficult tree pairs, and find that
the fraction decreases exponentially fast toward zero. We also describe how
knowing the number of distinct instances of the rotation distance problem is a
helpful factor in making the computations more feasible.

  It is an open question whether there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for
computing the rotation distances between pairs of extended ordered binary
trees. The problem of computing the rotation distance between an arbitrary pair
of trees, (S, T), can be efficiently reduced to the problem of computing the
rotation distance between a difficult pair of trees (S', T'), where there is no
known first step which is guaranteed to be the beginning of a minimal length
path. Of interest, therefore, is how to sample such difficult pairs of trees of
a fixed size. We show that it is possible to do so efficiently, and present
such an algorithm that runs in time $O(n^4)$.

  Neuromorphic computing architectures enable the dense co-location of memory
and processing elements within a single circuit. This co-location removes the
communication bottleneck of transferring data between separate memory and
computing units as in standard von Neuman architectures for data-critical
applications including machine learning. The essential building blocks of
neuromorphic systems are non-volatile synaptic elements such as memristors. Key
memristor properties include a suitable non-volatile resistance range,
continuous linear resistance modulation and symmetric switching. In this work,
we demonstrate voltage-controlled, symmetric and analog potentiation and
depression of a ferroelectric Hf$_{57}$Zr$_{43}$O$_{2}$ (HZO) field effect
transistor (FeFET) with good linearity. Our FeFET operates with a low writing
energy (fJ) and fast programming time (40 ns). Retention measurements have been
done over 4-bits depth with low noise (1%) in the tungsten oxide (WO$_{x}$)
read out channel. By adjusting the channel thickness from 15nm to 8nm, the
on/off ratio of the FeFET can be engineered from 1% to 200% with an
on-resistance ideally >100 kOhm, depending on the channel geometry. The device
concept is using earth-abundant materials, and is compatible with a back end of
line (BEOL) integration into complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS)

Title: Why Do Competitive Markets Converge to First-Price Auctions?
Authors: Renato Paes Leme, Balasubramanian Sivan, Yifeng Teng
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: The Web Conference 2020 (WWW'20)
\\
  We consider a setting in which bidders participate in multiple auctions run
by different sellers, and optimize their bids for the \emph{aggregate} auction.
We analyze this setting by formulating a game between sellers, where a seller's
strategy is to pick an auction to run. Our analysis aims to shed light on the
recent change in the Display Ads market landscape: here, ad exchanges (sellers)
were mostly running second-price auctions earlier and over time they switched
to variants of the first-price auction, culminating in Google's Ad Exchange
moving to a first-price auction in 2019. Our model and results offer an
explanation for why the first-price auction occurs as a natural equilibrium in
such competitive markets.

Title: A Novel Methodology for designing Policies in Mobile Crowdsensing
  Systems

Categories: cs.GT cs.SI
\\
  Mobile crowdsensing is a people-centric sensing system based on users'
contributions and incentive mechanisms aim at stimulating them. In our work, we
have rethought the design of incentive mechanisms through a game-theoretic
methodology. Thus, we have introduced a multi-layer social sensing framework,
where humans as social sensors interact on multiple social layers and various
services. We have proposed to weigh these dynamic interactions by including the
concept of homophily, that is a human-related factor related to the similarity
and frequency of interactions on the multiplex network. We have modeled the
evolutionary dynamics of sensing behaviours by defining a mathematical
framework based on multiplex EGT, quantifying the impact of homophily, network
heterogeneity and various social dilemmas. We have detected the configurations
of social dilemmas and network structures that lead to the emergence and
sustainability of human cooperation. Moreover, we have defined and evaluated
local and global Nash equilibrium points in our structured population by
including the concepts of homophily and heterogeneity. We have analytically
defined and measured novel statistical measures of QoI and user reputation
scores based on the evolutionary dynamics. Measures are distinct for the
different configurations and higher for the most cooperative ones. Through the
proposed methodology we have defined the core of a DSS for designing novel
incentive mechanisms by operating on the policies in terms of QoI and user
reputation scores.

Title: User-in-the-loop Adaptive Intent Detection for Instructable Digital

DOI: 10.1145/3377325.3377490
\\
  People are becoming increasingly comfortable using Digital Assistants (DAs)
to interact with services or connected objects. However, for non-programming
users, the available possibilities for customizing their DA are limited and do
not include the possibility of teaching the assistant new tasks. To make the
most of the potential of DAs, users should be able to customize assistants by
instructing them through Natural Language (NL). To provide such
functionalities, NL interpretation in traditional assistants should be
improved: (1) The intent identification system should be able to recognize new
forms of known intents, and to acquire new intents as they are expressed by the
user. (2) In order to be adaptive to novel intents, the Natural Language
Understanding module should be sample efficient, and should not rely on a
pretrained model. Rather, the system should continuously collect the training
data as it learns new intents from the user. In this work, we propose AidMe
(Adaptive Intent Detection in Multi-Domain Environments), a user-in-the-loop
adaptive intent detection framework that allows the assistant to adapt to its
user by learning his intents as their interaction progresses. AidMe builds its
repertoire of intents and collects data to train a model of semantic similarity
evaluation that can discriminate between the learned intents and autonomously
discover new forms of known intents. AidMe addresses two major issues - intent
learning and user adaptation - for instructable digital assistants. We
demonstrate the capabilities of AidMe as a standalone system by comparing it
with a one-shot learning system and a pretrained NLU module through simulations
of interactions with a user. We also show how AidMe can smoothly integrate to
an existing instructable digital assistant.

DOI: 10.1145/3313831.3376218
\\
  In open-source software (OSS), the design of usability is often influenced by
the discussions among community members on platforms such as issue tracking
systems (ITSs). However, digesting the rich information embedded in issue
discussions can be a major challenge due to the vast number and diversity of
the comments. We propose and evaluate ArguLens, a conceptual framework and
automated technique leveraging an argumentation model to support effective
understanding and consolidation of community opinions in ITSs. Through content
analysis, we anatomized highly discussed usability issues from a large, active
OSS project, into their argumentation components and standpoints. We then
experimented with supervised machine learning techniques for automated argument
extraction. Finally, through a study with experienced ITS users, we show that
the information provided by ArguLens supported the digestion of
usability-related opinions and facilitated the review of lengthy issues.
ArguLens provides the direction of designing valuable tools for high-level
reasoning and effective discussion about usability.

Title: EEG Wheelchair for People of Determination
Authors: Mariam AlAbboudi, Maitha Majed, Fatima Hassan, Ali Bou Nassif
Categories: cs.HC eess.SP
Comments: Paper accepted at IEH-2020 ASET Conference
\\
  The aim of this paper is to design and construct an electroencephalograph
(EEG) based brain-controlled wheelchair to provide a communication bridge from
the nervous system to the external technical device for people of determination
or individuals suffering from partial or complete paralysis. EEG is a technique
that reads the activity of the brain by capturing brain signals non-invasively
using a special EEG headset. The signals acquired go through pre-processing,
feature extraction and classification. This technique allows human thoughts
alone to be converted to control the wheelchair. The commands used are moving
to the right, left, forward, and backward and stop. The brain signals are
acquired using the Emotiv Epoc headset. Discrete Wavelet Transform is used for
feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification.

Comments: To appear in ACM CHI 2020 Conference on Human Factors in Computing
  Systems; 13 pages (10 content + 3 references); 4 Figures, 1 Table
\\
  While tablet devices are a promising platform for data visualization,
supporting consistent interactions across different types of visualizations on
tablets remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present multimodal
interactions that function consistently across different visualizations,
supporting common operations during visual data analysis. By considering
standard interface elements (e.g., axes, marks) and grounding our design in a
set of core concepts including operations, parameters, targets, and
instruments, we systematically develop interactions applicable to different
visualization types. To exemplify how the proposed interactions collectively
facilitate data exploration, we employ them in a tablet-based system, InChorus
that supports pen, touch, and speech input. Based on a study with 12
participants performing replication and fact-checking tasks with InChorus, we
discuss how participants adapted to using multimodal input and highlight
considerations for future multimodal visualization systems.

Comments: IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium 2020
\\
  The visualization of a network influences the quality of the mental map that
the viewer develops to understand the network. In this study, we investigate
the effects of a 3D immersive visualization environment compared to a
traditional 2D desktop environment on the comprehension of a network's
structure. We compare the two visualization environments using three
tasks--interpreting network structure, memorizing a set of nodes, and
identifying the structural changes--commonly used for evaluating the quality of
a mental map in network visualization. The results show that participants were
able to interpret network structure more accurately when viewing the network in
an immersive environment, particularly for larger networks. However, we found
that 2D visualizations performed better than immersive visualization for tasks
that required spatial memory.

any kind of conversational agent architecture, from standard architectures to
architectures with jointly-trained components, single- or multi-party

Title: An Efficient Algorithm for Designing Optimal CRCs for Tail-Biting
  Convolutional Codes
Authors: Hengjie Yang, Linfang Wang, Vincent Lau, and Richard D. Wesel
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted to ISIT 2020; comments welcome!
\\
  This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for designing the
distance-spectrum-optimal (DSO) cyclic redundancy check (CRC) polynomial for a
given tail-biting convolutional code (TBCC). Lou et al. proposed DSO CRC design
methodology for a given zero-terminated convolutional code (ZTCC), in which the
fundamental design principle is to maximize the minimum distance at which an
undetectable error event of ZTCC first occurs. This paper applies the same
principle to design the DSO CRC for a given TBCC. Our algorithm is based on
partitioning the tail-biting trellis into several disjoint sets of tail-biting
paths that are closed under cyclic shifts. This paper shows that the
tail-biting path in each set can be constructed by concatenating the
irreducible error events and/or circularly shifting the resultant path. This
motivates an efficient collection algorithm that aims at gathering irreducible
error events, and a search algorithm that reconstructs the full list of error
events in the order of increasing distance, which can be used to find the DSO
CRC for a given TBCC.

Title: Low Complexity Algorithms for Transmission of Short Blocks over the BSC
  with Full Feedback
Authors: Amaael Antonini, Hengjie Yang, and Richard D. Wesel
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted to ISIT 2020; comments welcome!
\\
  Building on the work of Horstein, Shayevitz and Feder, and Naghshvar et al.,
this paper presents algorithms for low-complexity sequential transmission of a
$k$-bit message over the binary symmetric channel (BSC) with full, noiseless
feedback. To lower complexity, this paper shows that the initial $k$ binary
transmissions can be sent before any feedback is required and groups the
messages with equal posteriors to reduce the number of posterior updates from
exponential in $k$ to linear in $k$. Simulations results demonstrate the
achievable rates for this full, noiseless feedback system approach capacity
rapidly as a function of $k$, significantly faster than the achievable rate
curve of Polyanskiy et al. for a stop feedback system.

Title: Constrained Functional Value under General Convexity Conditions with
  Applications to Distributed Simulation
Authors: Yanjun Han
Categories: cs.IT math.FA math.IT
\\
  We show a general phenomenon of the constrained functional value for
densities satisfying general convexity conditions, which generalizes the
observation in Bobkov and Madiman (2011) that the entropy per coordinate in a
log-concave random vector in any dimension with given density at the mode has a
range of just 1. Specifically, for general functions $\phi$ and $\psi$, we
derive upper and lower bounds of density functionals taking the form $I_\phi(f)
= \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \phi(f(x))dx$ assuming the convexity of $\psi^{-1}(f(x))$
for the density, and establish the tightness of these bounds under mild
conditions satisfied by most examples. We apply this result to the distributed
simulation of continuous random variables, and establish an upper bound of the
exact common information for $\beta$-concave joint densities, which is a
generalization of the log-concave densities in Li and El Gamal (2017).

Title: Chebyshev Inertial Landweber Algorithm for Linear Inverse Problems
Authors: Tadashi Wadayama and Satoshi Takabe
Categories: cs.IT cs.NA math.IT math.NA
Comments: 5 pages
\\
  The Landweber algorithm defined on complex/real Hilbert spaces is a gradient
descent algorithm for linear inverse problems. Our contribution is to present a
novel method for accelerating convergence of the Landweber algorithm. In this
paper, we first extend the theory of the Chebyshev inertial iteration to the
Landweber algorithm on Hilbert spaces. An upper bound on the convergence rate
clarifies the speed of global convergence of the proposed method. The Chebyshev
inertial Landweber algorithm can be applied to wide class of signal recovery
problems on a Hilbert space including deconvolution for continuous signals. The
theoretical discussion developed in this paper naturally leads to a novel
practical signal recovery algorithm. As a demonstration, a MIMO detection
algorithm based on the projected Landweber algorithm is derived. The proposed
MIMO detection algorithm achieves much smaller symbol error rate compared with
the MMSE detector.

Title: Duplication with transposition distance to the root for $q$-ary strings
Authors: Nikita Polyanskii and Ilya Vorobyev
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 6 pages, 1 table, submitted to International Symposium on Information
  Theory (ISIT) 2020
\\
  We study the duplication with transposition distance between strings of
length $n$ over a $q$-ary alphabet and their roots. In other words, we
investigate the number of duplication operations of the form $x = (abcd) \to y
= (abcbd)$, where $x$ and $y$ are strings and $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are their
substrings, needed to get a $q$-ary string of length $n$ starting from the set
of strings without duplications. For exact duplication, we prove that the
maximal distance between a string of length at most $n$ and its root has the
asymptotic order $n/\log n$. For approximate duplication, where a
$\beta$-fraction of symbols may be duplicated incorrectly, we show that the
maximal distance has a sharp transition from the order $n/\log n$ to $\log n$
at $\beta=(q-1)/q$. The motivation for this problem comes from genomics, where
such duplications represent a special kind of mutation and the distance between
a given biological sequence and its root is the smallest number of
transposition mutations required to generate the sequence.

Title: Data-Driven Ensembles for Deep and Hard-Decision Hybrid Decoding
Authors: Tomer Raviv, Nir Raviv, Yair Be'ery
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Ensemble models are widely used to solve complex tasks by their decomposition
into multiple simpler tasks, each one solved locally by a single member of the
ensemble. Decoding of error-correction codes is a hard problem due to the curse
of dimensionality, leading one to consider ensembles-of-decoders as a possible
solution. Nonetheless, one must take complexity into account, especially in
decoding. We suggest a low-complexity scheme where a single member participates
in the decoding of each word. First, the distribution of feasible words is
partitioned into non-overlapping regions. Thereafter, specialized experts are
formed by independently training each member on a single region. A classical
hard-decision decoder (HDD) is employed to map every word to a single expert in
an injective manner. FER gains of up to 0.4dB at the waterfall region, and of
1.25dB at the error floor region are achieved for two BCH(63,36) and (63,45)
codes with cycle-reduced parity-check matrices, compared to the previous best
result of the paper "Active Deep Decoding of Linear Codes".

  Due to its longevity and enormous information density, DNA is an attractive
medium for archival storage. In this work, we study the fundamental limits and
trade-offs of DNA-based storage systems by introducing a new channel model,
which we call the noisy shuffling-sampling channel. Motivated by current
technological constraints on DNA synthesis and sequencing, this model captures
three key distinctive aspects of DNA storage systems: (1) the data is written
onto many short DNA molecules; (2) the molecules are corrupted by noise during
synthesis and sequencing and (3) the data is read by randomly sampling from the
DNA pool. We provide capacity results for this channel under specific noise and
sampling assumptions and show that, in many scenarios, a simple index-based
coding scheme is optimal.

Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Accepted for 2020 International Zurich Seminar on Information and

\\
  In this work, we consider private monomial computation (PMC) for replicated
noncolluding databases. In PMC, a user wishes to privately retrieve an
arbitrary multivariate monomial from a candidate set of monomials in $f$
messages over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$, where $q=p^k$ is a power of a prime
$p$ and $k \ge 1$, replicated over $n$ databases. We derive the PMC capacity
under a technical condition on $p$ and for asymptotically large $q$. The
condition on $p$ is satisfied, e.g., for large enough $p$. Also, we present a
novel PMC scheme for arbitrary $q$ that is capacity-achieving in the asymptotic
case above. Moreover, we present formulas for the entropy of a multivariate
monomial and for a set of monomials in uniformly distributed random variables
over a finite field, which are used in the derivation of the capacity
expression.

\\
  The aim of this work is to provide bounds connecting two probability measures
of the same event using R\'enyi $\alpha$-Divergences and Sibson's
$\alpha$-Mutual Information, a generalization of respectively the
Kullback-Leibler Divergence and Shannon's Mutual Information. A particular case
of interest can be found when the two probability measures considered are a
joint distribution and the corresponding product of marginals (representing the
statistically independent scenario). In this case, a bound using Sibson's
$\alpha-$Mutual Information is retrieved, extending a result involving Maximal
Leakage to general alphabets. These results have broad applications, from
bounding the generalization error of learning algorithms to the more general
framework of adaptive data analysis, provided that the divergences and/or
information measures used are amenable to such an analysis ({\it i.e.,} are
robust to post-processing and compose adaptively). The generalization error
bounds are derived with respect to high-probability events but a corresponding
bound on expected generalization error is also retrieved.

Title: Design and Analysis of Online Fountain Codes for Intermediate
  Performance
Authors: Jingxuan Huang, Zesong Fei, Congzhe Cao, and Ming Xiao
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  For the benefit of improved intermediate performance, recently online
fountain codes attract much research attention. However, there is a trade-off
between the intermediate performance and the full recovery overhead for online
fountain codes, which prevents them to be improved simultaneously. We analyze
this trade-off, and propose to improve both of these two performance. We first
propose a method called Online Fountain Codes without Build-up phase (OFCNB)
where the degree-1 coded symbols are transmitted at first and the build-up
phase is removed to improve the intermediate performance. Then we analyze the
performance of OFCNB theoretically. Motivated by the analysis results, we
propose Systematic Online Fountain Codes (SOFC) to further reduce the full
recovery overhead. Theoretical analysis shows that SOFC has better intermediate
performance, and it also requires lower full recovery overhead when the channel
erasure rate is lower than a constant. Simulation results verify the analyses
and demonstrate the superior performance of OFCNB and SOFC in comparison to
other online fountain codes.

Title: Curriculum Labeling: Self-paced Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised
  Learning
Authors: Paola Cascante-Bonilla, Fuwen Tan, Yanjun Qi, Vicente Ordonez
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Semi-supervised learning aims to take advantage of a large amount of
unlabeled data to improve the accuracy of a model that only has access to a
small number of labeled examples. We propose curriculum labeling, an approach
that exploits pseudo-labeling for propagating labels to unlabeled samples in an
iterative and self-paced fashion. This approach is surprisingly simple and
effective and surpasses or is comparable with the best methods proposed in the
recent literature across all the standard benchmarks for image classification.
Notably, we obtain 94.91% accuracy on CIFAR-10 using only 4,000 labeled
samples, and 88.56% top-5 accuracy on Imagenet-ILSVRC using 128,000 labeled
samples. In contrast to prior works, our approach shows improvements even in a
more realistic scenario that leverages out-of-distribution unlabeled data
samples.

  Recently many efforts have been made to incorporate persistence diagrams, one
of the major tools in topological data analysis (TDA), into machine learning
pipelines. To better understand the power and limitation of persistence
diagrams, we carry out a range of experiments on both graph data and shape
data, aiming to decouple and inspect the effects of different factors involved.
To this end, we also propose the so-called \emph{permutation test} for
persistence diagrams to delineate critical values and pairings of critical
values. For graph classification tasks, we note that while persistence pairing
yields consistent improvement over various benchmark datasets, it appears that
for various filtration functions tested, most discriminative power comes from
critical values. For shape segmentation and classification, however, we note
that persistence pairing shows significant power on most of the benchmark
datasets, and improves over both summaries based on merely critical values, and
those based on permutation tests. Our results help provide insights on when
persistence diagram based summaries could be more suitable.

Title: Fourier Transform Approach to Machine Learning III: Fourier
  Classification
Authors: Soheil Mehrabkhani
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose a Fourier-based learning algorithm for highly nonlinear multiclass
classification. The algorithm is based on a smoothing technique to calculate
the probability distribution of all classes. To obtain the probability
distribution, the density distribution of each class is smoothed by a low-pass
filter separately. The advantage of the Fourier representation is capturing the
nonlinearities of the data distribution without defining any kernel function.
Furthermore, contrary to the support vector machines, it makes a probabilistic
explanation for the classification possible. Moreover, it can treat overlapped
classes as well. Comparing to the logistic regression, it does not require
feature engineering. In general, its computational performance is also very
well for large data sets and in contrast to other algorithms, the typical
overfitting problem does not happen at all. The capability of the algorithm is
demonstrated for multiclass classification with overlapped classes and very
high nonlinearity of the class distributions.

Title: Fairness Measures for Regression via Probabilistic Classification
Authors: Daniel Steinberg, Alistair Reid and Simon O'Callaghan
Categories: cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML
\\
  Algorithmic fairness involves expressing notions such as equity, or
reasonable treatment, as quantifiable measures that a machine learning
algorithm can optimise. Most work in the literature to date has focused on
classification problems where the prediction is categorical, such as accepting
or rejecting a loan application. This is in part because classification
fairness measures are easily computed by comparing the rates of outcomes,
leading to behaviours such as ensuring that the same fraction of eligible men
are selected as eligible women. But such measures are computationally difficult
to generalise to the continuous regression setting for problems such as
pricing, or allocating payments. The difficulty arises from estimating
conditional densities (such as the probability density that a system will
over-charge by a certain amount). For the regression setting we introduce
tractable approximations of the independence, separation and sufficiency
criteria by observing that they factorise as ratios of different conditional
probabilities of the protected attributes. We introduce and train machine
learning classifiers, distinct from the predictor, as a mechanism to estimate
these probabilities from the data. This naturally leads to model agnostic,
tractable approximations of the criteria, which we explore experimentally.

\\
  In this paper, we propose Code-Bridged Classifier (CBC), a framework for
making a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) robust against adversarial attacks
without increasing or even by decreasing the overall models' computational
complexity. More specifically, we propose a stacked encoder-convolutional
model, in which the input image is first encoded by the encoder module of a
denoising auto-encoder, and then the resulting latent representation (without
being decoded) is fed to a reduced complexity CNN for image classification. We
illustrate that this network not only is more robust to adversarial examples
but also has a significantly lower computational complexity when compared to
the prior art defenses.

Title: An adversarial learning framework for preserving users' anonymity in
  face-based emotion recognition
Authors: Vansh Narula, Zhangyang (Atlas) Wang and Theodora Chaspari
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Image and video-capturing technologies have permeated our every-day life.
Such technologies can continuously monitor individuals' expressions in
real-life settings, affording us new insights into their emotional states and
transitions, thus paving the way to novel well-being and healthcare
applications. Yet, due to the strong privacy concerns, the use of such
technologies is met with strong skepticism, since current face-based emotion
recognition systems relying on deep learning techniques tend to preserve
substantial information related to the identity of the user, apart from the
emotion-specific information. This paper proposes an adversarial learning
framework which relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
trained through an iterative procedure for minimizing identity-specific
information and maximizing emotion-dependent information. The proposed approach
is evaluated through emotion classification and face identification metrics,
and is compared against two CNNs, one trained solely for emotion recognition
and the other trained solely for face identification. Experiments are performed
using the Yale Face Dataset and Japanese Female Facial Expression Database.
Results indicate that the proposed approach can learn a convolutional
transformation for preserving emotion recognition accuracy and degrading face
identity recognition, providing a foundation toward privacy-aware emotion
recognition technologies.

Title: Better Boosting with Bandits for Online Learning
Authors: Nikolaos Nikolaou, Joseph Mellor, Nikunj C. Oza, Gavin Brown
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 44 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Probability estimates generated by boosting ensembles are poorly calibrated
because of the margin maximization nature of the algorithm. The outputs of the
ensemble need to be properly calibrated before they can be used as probability
estimates. In this work, we demonstrate that online boosting is also prone to
producing distorted probability estimates. In batch learning, calibration is
achieved by reserving part of the training data for training the calibrator
function. In the online setting, a decision needs to be made on each round:
shall the new example(s) be used to update the parameters of the ensemble or
those of the calibrator. We proceed to resolve this decision with the aid of
bandit optimization algorithms. We demonstrate superior performance to
uncalibrated and naively-calibrated on-line boosting ensembles in terms of
probability estimation. Our proposed mechanism can be easily adapted to other
tasks(e.g. cost-sensitive classification) and is robust to the choice of
hyperparameters of both the calibrator and the ensemble.

Title: Learning Stable Deep Dynamics Models
Authors: Gaurav Manek, J. Zico Kolter
Categories: cs.LG math.DS stat.ML
Comments: NeurIPS 2019
\\
  Deep networks are commonly used to model dynamical systems, predicting how
the state of a system will evolve over time (either autonomously or in response
to control inputs). Despite the predictive power of these systems, it has been
difficult to make formal claims about the basic properties of the learned
systems. In this paper, we propose an approach for learning dynamical systems
that are guaranteed to be stable over the entire state space. The approach
works by jointly learning a dynamics model and Lyapunov function that
guarantees non-expansiveness of the dynamics under the learned Lyapunov
function. We show that such learning systems are able to model simple dynamical
systems and can be combined with additional deep generative models to learn
complex dynamics, such as video textures, in a fully end-to-end fashion.

Title: ADAMT: A Stochastic Optimization with Trend Correction Scheme
Authors: Bingxin Zhou, Xuebin Zheng, Junbin Gao
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Adam-type optimizers, as a class of adaptive moment estimation methods with
the exponential moving average scheme, have been successfully used in many
applications of deep learning. Such methods are appealing for capability on
large-scale sparse datasets with high computational efficiency. In this paper,
we present a new framework for adapting Adam-type methods, namely AdamT.
Instead of applying a simple exponential weighted average, AdamT also includes
the trend information when updating the parameters with the adaptive step size
and gradients. The additional terms promise an efficient movement on the
complex cost surface, and thus the loss would converge more rapidly. We show
empirically the importance of adding the trend component, where AdamT
outperforms the vanilla Adam method constantly with state-of-the-art models on
several classical real-world datasets.

Title: Graph Inference Learning for Semi-supervised Classification
Authors: Chunyan Xu, Zhen Cui, Xiaobin Hong, Tong Zhang, Jian Yang, and Wei Liu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages
Journal-ref: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2020
\\
  In this work, we address semi-supervised classification of graph data, where
the categories of those unlabeled nodes are inferred from labeled nodes as well
as graph structures. Recent works often solve this problem via advanced graph
convolution in a conventionally supervised manner, but the performance could
degrade significantly when labeled data is scarce. To this end, we propose a
Graph Inference Learning (GIL) framework to boost the performance of
semi-supervised node classification by learning the inference of node labels on
graph topology. To bridge the connection between two nodes, we formally define
a structure relation by encapsulating node attributes, between-node paths, and
local topological structures together, which can make the inference
conveniently deduced from one node to another node. For learning the inference
process, we further introduce meta-optimization on structure relations from
training nodes to validation nodes, such that the learnt graph inference
capability can be better self-adapted to testing nodes. Comprehensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets (including Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and
NELL) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GIL when compared against
state-of-the-art methods on the semi-supervised node classification task.

Title: A Derivative-Free Method for Solving Elliptic Partial Differential
  Equations with Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Jihun Han, Mihai Nica, Adam R Stinchcombe
Categories: cs.LG math.PR stat.ML
Comments: 25 pages, 4 figures
\\
  We introduce a deep neural network based method for solving a class of
elliptic partial differential equations. We approximate the solution of the PDE
with a deep neural network which is trained under the guidance of a
probabilistic representation of the PDE in the spirit of the Feynman-Kac
formula. The solution is given by an expectation of a martingale process driven
by a Brownian motion. As Brownian walkers explore the domain, the deep neural
network is iteratively trained using a form of reinforcement learning. Our
method is a 'Derivative-Free Loss Method' since it does not require the
explicit calculation of the derivatives of the neural network with respect to
the input neurons in order to compute the training loss. The advantages of our
method are showcased in a series of test problems: a corner singularity
problem, an interface problem, and an application to a chemotaxis population
model.

\\
  A robust theoretical framework that can describe and predict the
generalization ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in general circumstances
remains elusive. Classical attempts have produced complexity metrics that rely
heavily on global measures of compactness and capacity with little
investigation into the effects of sub-component collaboration. We demonstrate
intriguing regularities in the activation patterns of the hidden nodes within
fully-connected feedforward networks. By tracing the origin of these patterns,
we show how such networks can be viewed as the combination of two information
processing systems: one continuous and one discrete. We describe how these two
systems arise naturally from the gradient-based optimization process, and
demonstrate the classification ability of the two systems, individually and in
collaboration. This perspective on DNN classification offers a novel way to
think about generalization, in which different subsets of the training data are
used to train distinct classifiers; those classifiers are then combined to
perform the classification task, and their consistency is crucial for accurate
classification.

Title: FedVision: An Online Visual Object Detection Platform Powered by
  Federated Learning

Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Visual object detection is a computer vision-based artificial intelligence
(AI) technique which has many practical applications (e.g., fire hazard
monitoring). However, due to privacy concerns and the high cost of transmitting
video data, it is highly challenging to build object detection models on
centrally stored large training datasets following the current approach.
Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to resolve this challenge.
Nevertheless, there currently lacks an easy to use tool to enable computer
vision application developers who are not experts in federated learning to
conveniently leverage this technology and apply it in their systems. In this
paper, we report FedVision - a machine learning engineering platform to support
the development of federated learning powered computer vision applications. The
platform has been deployed through a collaboration between WeBank and Extreme
Vision to help customers develop computer vision-based safety monitoring
solutions in smart city applications. Over four months of usage, it has
achieved significant efficiency improvement and cost reduction while removing
the need to transmit sensitive data for three major corporate customers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first real application of FL in computer
vision-based tasks.

  Networks

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Graph structured data has wide applicability in various domains such as
physics, chemistry, biology, computer vision, and social networks, to name a
few. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) were shown to be successful in
effectively representing graph structured data because of their good
performance and generalization ability. GNN is a deep learning based method
that learns a node representation by combining specific nodes and the
structural/topological information of a graph. However, like other deep models,
explaining the effectiveness of GNN models is a challenging task because of the
complex nonlinear transformations made over the iterations. In this paper, we
propose GraphLIME, a local interpretable model explanation for graphs using the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) Lasso, which is a nonlinear
feature selection method. GraphLIME is a generic GNN-model explanation
framework that learns a nonlinear interpretable model locally in the subgraph
of the node being explained. More specifically, to explain a node, we generate
a nonlinear interpretable model from its $N$-hop neighborhood and then compute
the K most representative features as the explanations of its prediction using
HSIC Lasso. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, the explanations of
GraphLIME are found to be of extraordinary degree and more descriptive in
comparison to the existing explanation methods.

Title: Sideways: Depth-Parallel Training of Video Models
Authors: Mateusz Malinowski and Grzegorz Swirszcz and Joao Carreira and Viorica
  Patraucean
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  We propose Sideways, an approximate backpropagation scheme for training video
models. In standard backpropagation, the gradients and activations at every
computation step through the model are temporally synchronized. The forward
activations need to be stored until the backward pass is executed, preventing
inter-layer (depth) parallelization. However, can we leverage smooth, redundant
input streams such as videos to develop a more efficient training scheme? Here,
we explore an alternative to backpropagation; we overwrite network activations
whenever new ones, i.e., from new frames, become available. Such a more gradual
accumulation of information from both passes breaks the precise correspondence
between gradients and activations, leading to theoretically more noisy weight
updates. Counter-intuitively, we show that Sideways training of deep
convolutional video networks not only still converges, but can also potentially
exhibit better generalization compared to standard synchronized
backpropagation.

Comments: preprint for TII: SS on Applications of Artificial Intelligence in

\\
  Monitoring the magnet temperature in permanent magnet synchronous motors
(PMSMs) for automotive applications is a challenging task for several decades
now, as signal injection or sensor-based methods still prove unfeasible in a
commercial context. Overheating results in severe motor deterioration and is
thus of high concern for the machine's control strategy and its design. Lack of
precise temperature estimations leads to lesser device utilization and higher
material cost. In this work, several machine learning (ML) models are
empirically evaluated on their estimation accuracy for the task of predicting
latent high-dynamic magnet temperature profiles. The range of selected
algorithms covers as diverse approaches as possible with ordinary and weighted
least squares, support vector regression, $k$-nearest neighbors, randomized
trees and neural networks. Having test bench data available, it is shown that
ML approaches relying merely on collected data meet the estimation performance
of classical thermal models built on thermodynamic theory, yet not all kinds of
models render efficient use of large datasets or sufficient modeling
capacities. Especially linear regression and simple feed-forward neural
networks with optimized hyperparameters mark strong predictive quality at low
to moderate model sizes.

Title: Deep Neural Networks with Trainable Activations and Controlled Lipschitz
  Constant
Authors: Shayan Aziznejad, Harshit Gupta, Joaquim Campos, Michael Unser
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We introduce a variational framework to learn the activation functions of
deep neural networks. The main motivation is to control the Lipschitz
regularity of the input-output relation. To that end, we first establish a
global bound for the Lipschitz constant of neural networks. Based on the
obtained bound, we then formulate a variational problem for learning activation
functions. Our variational problem is infinite-dimensional and is not
computationally tractable. However, we prove that there always exists a
solution that has continuous and piecewise-linear (linear-spline) activations.
This reduces the original problem to a finite-dimensional minimization. We
numerically compare our scheme with standard ReLU network and its variations,
PReLU and LeakyReLU.

\\
  Cybersecurity attacks are growing both in frequency and sophistication over
the years. This increasing sophistication and complexity call for more
advancement and continuous innovation in defensive strategies. Traditional
methods of intrusion detection and deep packet inspection, while still largely
used and recommended, are no longer sufficient to meet the demands of growing
security threats. As computing power increases and cost drops, Machine Learning
is seen as an alternative method or an additional mechanism to defend against
malwares, botnets, and other attacks. This paper explores Machine Learning as a
viable solution by examining its capabilities to classify malicious traffic in
a network.
  First, a strong data analysis is performed resulting in 22 extracted features
from the initial Netflow datasets. All these features are then compared with
one another through a feature selection process. Then, our approach analyzes
five different machine learning algorithms against NetFlow dataset containing
common botnets. The Random Forest Classifier succeeds in detecting more than
95% of the botnets in 8 out of 13 scenarios and more than 55% in the most
difficult datasets. Finally, insight is given to improve and generalize the
results, especially through a bootstrapping technique.

Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1912.07160
\\
  Adversarial attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found for
several years. However, the existing adversarial attacks have high success
rates only when the information of the attacked DNN is well-known or could be
estimated by structure similarity or massive queries. In this paper, we propose
an \emph{Attack on Attention} (AoA), a semantic feature commonly shared by
DNNs. The transferability of AoA is quite high. With no more than 10 queries of
the decision only, AoA can achieve almost 100\% success rate when attacking on
many popular DNNs. Even without query, AoA could keep a surprisingly high
attack performance. We apply AoA to generate 96020 adversarial samples from
ImageNet to defeat many neural networks, and thus name the dataset as
\emph{DAmageNet}. 20 well-trained DNNs are tested on DAmageNet. Without
adversarial training, most of the tested DNNs have an error rate over 90\%.
DAmageNet is the first universal adversarial dataset and it could serve as a
benchmark for robustness testing and adversarial training.

  ReLU is widely seen as the default choice for activation functions in neural
networks. However, there are cases where more complicated functions are
required. In particular, recurrent neural networks (such as LSTMs) make
extensive use of both hyperbolic tangent and sigmoid functions. These functions
are expensive to compute. We used function approximation techniques to develop
replacements for these functions and evaluated them empirically on three
popular network configurations. We find safe approximations that yield a 10% to
37% improvement in training times on the CPU. These approximations were
suitable for all cases we considered and we believe are appropriate
replacements for all networks using these activation functions. We also develop
ranged approximations which only apply in some cases due to restrictions on
their input domain. Our ranged approximations yield a performance improvement
of 20% to 53% in network training time. Our functions also match or
considerably out perform the ad-hoc approximations used in Theano and the
implementation of Word2Vec.

Title: Exact Information Bottleneck with Invertible Neural Networks: Getting
  the Best of Discriminative and Generative Modeling
Authors: Lynton Ardizzone, Radek Mackowiak, Ullrich K\"othe, Carsten Rother
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
MSC-class: 68T01
\\
  The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a unified approach to many
learning and prediction problems. Although optimal in an information-theoretic
sense, practical applications of IB are hampered by a lack of accurate
high-dimensional estimators of mutual information, its main constituent. We
propose to combine IB with invertible neural networks (INNs), which for the
first time allows exact calculation of the required mutual information. Applied
to classification, our proposed method results in a generative classifier we
call IB-INN. It accurately models the class conditional likelihoods,
generalizes well to unseen data and reliably recognizes out-of-distribution
examples. In contrast to existing generative classifiers, these advantages
incur only minor reductions in classification accuracy in comparison to
corresponding discriminative methods such as feed-forward networks.
Furthermore, we provide insight into why IB-INNs are superior to other
generative architectures and training procedures and show experimentally that
our method outperforms alternative models of comparable complexity.

Title: Gradient descent with momentum --- to accelerate or to super-accelerate?
Authors: Goran Nakerst, John Brennan, Masudul Haque
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
Comments: 19 pages + references, 8 figures. A variant of Nesterov acceleration
  is proposed and studied
\\
  We consider gradient descent with `momentum', a widely used method for loss
function minimization in machine learning. This method is often used with
`Nesterov acceleration', meaning that the gradient is evaluated not at the
current position in parameter space, but at the estimated position after one
step. In this work, we show that the algorithm can be improved by extending
this `acceleration' --- by using the gradient at an estimated position several
steps ahead rather than just one step ahead. How far one looks ahead in this
`super-acceleration' algorithm is determined by a new hyperparameter.
Considering a one-parameter quadratic loss function, the optimal value of the
super-acceleration can be exactly calculated and analytically estimated. We
show explicitly that super-accelerating the momentum algorithm is beneficial,
not only for this idealized problem, but also for several synthetic loss
landscapes and for the MNIST classification task with neural networks.
Super-acceleration is also easy to incorporate into adaptive algorithms like
RMSProp or Adam, and is shown to improve these algorithms.

Title: Strong-Separation Logic
Authors: Jens Pagel, Florian Zuleger
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  Most automated verifiers for separation logic target the symbolic-heap
fragment, disallowing both the magic-wand operator and the application of
classical Boolean operators to spatial formulas. This is not surprising, as
support for the magic wand quickly leads to undecidability, especially when
combined with inductive predicates for reasoning about data structures. To
circumvent these undecidability results, we propose to assign a more
restrictive semantics to the separating conjunction. We argue that the
resulting logic, strong-separation logic, can be used for compositional program
verification and bi-abductive static analysis just like "standard" separation
logic, while remaining decidable even in the presence of both the magic wand
and the list-segment predicate---a combination of features that leads to
undecidability assuming the standard semantics.

  We present pumping lemmas for five classes of functions definable by
fragments of weighted automata over the min-plus semiring, the max-plus
semiring and the semiring of natural numbers. As a corollary we show that the
hierarchy of functions definable by unambiguous, finitely-ambiguous,
polynomially-ambiguous weighted automata, and the full class of weighted

Title: Preservation of Equations by Monoidal Monads
Authors: Louis Parlant, Jurriaan Rot, Alexandra Silva, Bas Westerbaan
Categories: cs.LO math.CT
\\
  If a monad $T$ is monoidal, then operations on a set $X$ can be lifted
canonically to operations on $TX$. In this paper we study structural properties
under which $T$ preserves equations between those operations. It has already
been shown that any monoidal monad preserves linear equations; affine monads
preserve drop equations (where some variable appears only on one side, such as
$x\cdot y = y$) and relevant monads preserve dup equations (where some variable
is duplicated, such as $x \cdot x = x$). We start the paper by showing a
converse: if the monad at hand preserves a drop equation, then it must be
affine. From this, we show that the problem whether a given (drop) equation is
preserved is undecidable. A converse for relevance turns out to be more subtle:
preservation of certain dup equations implies a weaker notion which we call
$n$-relevance. Finally, we identify the subclass of equations such that their
preservation is equivalent to relevance.

Title: Low Latency Volumetric Video Edge Cloud Streaming

Categories: cs.MM eess.IV
Comments: 13 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Volumetric video is an emerging key technology for immersive representation
of 3D spaces and objects. The enhanced immersion of volumetric videos leads to
new use cases such as streaming of six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) videos in
which the user can freely change his position and orientation. However,
rendering volumetric videos as 3D representations (mesh or point cloud)
requires lots of computational power and transmission of such volumetric data
requires lots of bandwidth. To mitigate this issue, rendering a 2D view from
the volumetric data at a cloud/edge server and streaming that as a 2D video is
a feasible solution. However, network-based processing brings additional
network and processing latency. In order to reduce the motion-to-photon
latency, prediction of the future user pose is necessary. We developed a 6DoF
user movement prediction model for very low latency streaming services and
investigated its potential to further reduce the motion-to-photon latency for
different prediction windows. Our results show that the developed prediction
model on average reduces the positional rendering errors caused by the
motion-to-photon latency compared to a baseline system in which no prediction
is performed.

  The Awkward Array library has been an important tool for physics analysis in
Python since September 2018. However, some interface and implementation issues
have been raised in Awkward Array's first year that argue for a
reimplementation in C++ and Numba. We describe those issues, the new
architecture, and present some examples of how the new interface will look to
users. Of particular importance is the separation of kernel functions from data
structure management, which allows a C++ implementation and a Numba
implementation to share kernel functions, and the algorithm that transforms
record-oriented data into columnar Awkward Arrays.

\\
  In this work, phase-field modeling of hydraulic fractures in porous media is
extended towards a global-local approach. Therein, the failure behavior is
solely analyzed in a (small) local domain. In the surrounding medium, a
simplified and linearized system of equations is solved. Both domains are
coupled by Robin-type interface conditions. The fracture(s) inside the local
domain are allowed to propagate and consequently both subdomains change within
time. Here, a predictor-corrector strategy is adopted in which the local domain
is dynamically adjusted to the current fracture pattern. The resulting
framework is algorithmically described in detail and substantiated with some
numerical tests.

Title: L1 data fitting for robust reconstruction in magnetic particle imaging:
  quantitative evaluation on Open MPI dataset
Authors: Tobias Kluth and Bangti Jin
Categories: math.NA cs.NA eess.IV
\\
  Magnetic particle imaging is an emerging quantitative imaging modality,
exploiting the unique nonlinear magnetization phenomenon of superparamagnetic
iron oxide nanoparticles for recovering the concentration. Traditionally the
reconstruction is formulated into a penalized least-squares problem with
nonnegativity constraint, and then solved using a variant of Kaczmarz method.
In order to achieve good performance, a preprocessing step of frequency
selection to remove the deleterious influences of highly noisy measurements is
often adopted. In this work, we propose a complementary approach to frequency
selection, by viewing highly noisy measurements as outliers, and employing the
l1 data fitting, one popular approach from robust statistics. When compared
with the standard approach, it is easy to implement with a comparable
computational complexity. Experiments with a public domain dataset, i.e., Open
MPI dataset, show that it can give accurate reconstructions, and is less prone
to noisy measurements, which is clearly illustrated by the quantitative (PSNR /
SSIM) and qualitative comparisons with the standard approach.

\\
  Multi-Energy Computed Tomography (ME-CT) is a medical imaging modality aiming
to reconstruct the spatial density of materials from the attenuation properties
of probing x-rays. For each line in two- or three-dimensional space, ME-CT
measurements may be written as a nonlinear mapping from the integrals of the
unknown densities of a finite number of materials along said line to an equal
or larger number of energy-weighted integrals corresponding to different x-ray
source energy spectra. ME-CT reconstructions may thus be decomposed as a
two-step process: (i) reconstruct line integrals of the material densities from
the available energy measurements; and (ii) reconstruct densities from their
line integrals. Step (ii) is the standard linear x-ray CT problem whose
invertibility is well-known, so this paper focuses on step (i). We show that
ME-CT admits stable, global inversion provided that (a well-chosen linear
transform of) the differential of the transform in step (i) satisfies
appropriate orientation constraints that makes it a P-matrix. We introduce a
notion of quantitative P-function that allows us to derive global stability
results for ME-CT in the determined as well as over-determined (with more
source energy spectra than the number of materials) cases. Numerical
simulations based on standard material properties in imaging applications (of
bone, water, contrast agents) and well accepted models of source energy spectra
show that ME-CT is often (always in our simulations) either (i) non-globally
injective because it is non-injective locally (differential not of full rank),
or (ii) globally injective as soon as it is locally injective (differentials
satisfy our proposed constraints).

Title: A high-order integral equation-based solver for the time-dependent
  Schrodinger equation
Authors: Jason Kaye, Alex Barnett, Leslie Greengard
Categories: math.NA cs.NA quant-ph
Comments: 38 pages, 11 figures
\\
  We introduce a numerical method for the solution of the time-dependent
Schrodinger equation with a smooth potential, based on its reformulation as a
Volterra integral equation. We present versions of the method both for periodic
boundary conditions, and for free space problems with compactly supported
initial data and potential. A spatially uniform electric field may be included,
making the solver applicable to simulations of light-matter interaction.
  The primary computational challenge in using the Volterra formulation is the
application of a space-time history dependent integral operator. This may be
accomplished by projecting the solution onto a set of Fourier modes, and
updating their coefficients from one time step to the next by a simple
recurrence. In the periodic case, the modes are those of the usual Fourier
series, and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to alternate between
physical and frequency domain grids. In the free space case, the oscillatory
behavior of the spectral Green's function leads us to use a set of
complex-frequency Fourier modes obtained by discretizing a contour deformation
of the inverse Fourier transform, and we develop a corresponding fast transform
based on the FFT.
  Our approach is related to pseudo-spectral methods, but applied to an
integral rather than the usual differential formulation. This has several
advantages: it avoids the need for artificial boundary conditions, admits
simple, inexpensive high-order implicit time marching schemes, and naturally
includes time-dependent potentials. We present examples in one and two
dimensions showing spectral accuracy in space and eighth-order accuracy in time
for both periodic and free space problems.

Title: Incomplete selected inversion for linear-scaling electronic structure
  calculations
Authors: Simon Etter
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 65F05, 65F50, 65Z05
\\
  Pole Expansion and Selected Inversion (PEXSI) is an efficient scheme for
evaluating selected entries of functions of large sparse matrices as required
e.g. in electronic structure algorithms. We show that the triangular
factorizations computed by the PEXSI scheme exhibit a localization property
similar to that of matrix functions, and we present a modified PEXSI algorithm
which exploits this observation to achieve linear scaling. To the best of our
knowledge, the resulting incomplete PEXSI (iPEXSI) algorithm is the first
linear-scaling algorithm which scales provably better than cubically even in
the absence of localization, and we hope that this will help to further lower
the critical system size where linear-scaling algorithms begin to outperform
the diagonalization algorithm.

Title: An elliptic local problem with exponential decay of the resonance error
  for numerical homogenization
Authors: Assyr Abdulle and Doghonay Arjmand and Edoardo Paganoni
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Numerical multiscale methods usually rely on some coupling between a
macroscopic and a microscopic model. The macroscopic model is incomplete as
effective quantities, such as the homogenized material coefficients or fluxes,
are missing in the model. These effective data need to be computed by running
local microscale simulations followed by a local averaging of the microscopic
information. Motivated by the classical homogenization theory, it is a common
practice to use local elliptic cell problems for computing the missing
homogenized coefficients in the macro model. Such a consideration results in a
first order error $O(\varepsilon/\delta)$, where $\varepsilon$ represents the
wavelength of the microscale variations and $\delta$ is the size of the
microscopic simulation boxes. This error, called "resonance error", originates
from the boundary conditions used in the micro-problem and typically dominates
all other errors in a multiscale numerical method. Optimal decay of the
resonance error remains an open problem, although several interesting
approaches reducing the effect of the boundary have been proposed over the last
two decades. In this paper, as an attempt to resolve this problem, we propose a
computationally efficient, fully elliptic approach with exponential decay of
the resonance error.

MSC-class: 65M50
\\
  Adaptive meshing is a fundamental component of adaptive finite element
methods. This includes refining and coarsening meshes locally. In this work, we
are concerned with the red-green-blue refinement strategy and its counterpart -
coarsening. In general, coarsening algorithms are mostly based on an explicitly
given refinement history. In this work, we present a coarsening algorithm on
adaptive red-green-blue meshes without explicitly knowing the refinement
history. To this end, we examine the local structure of these meshes, find an
easy-to-verify criterion to coarsen red-green-blue meshes and prove that this
criterion generates meshes with the desired properties. However, it does not
guarantee that the set of nodes admissible for coarsening is non-empty.
Therefore, we also present an additional algorithm that uses the main ideas of
this criterion to always allow for local coarsening. We present a MATLAB
implementation built on the red-green-blue refinement routine of the
ameshref-package.

Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Segment Routing is a form of loose source routing. It provides the ability to
include a list of instructions (called segments), in the packet headers. The
Segment Routing architecture has been first implemented with the MPLS dataplane
and then, quite recently, with the IPv6 dataplane (SRv6). IPv6 Segment Routing
(SRv6) is a promising solution to support advanced services such as Traffic
Engineering, Service Function Chaining, Virtual Private Networks, and Load
Balancing. The SRv6 data-plane is supported in many different software
forwarding engines including the Linux kernel and VPP software router, as well
as in hardware devices. In this paper, we present SRPerf, a performance
evaluation framework for software and hardware implementations of SRv6. SRPerf
is able to perform different benchmarking tests such as throughput and latency.
For throughput tests, we use the Partial Drop Rate (PDR) to characterize a
system under test. The architecture of SRPerf can be easily extended to support
new benchmarking methodologies as well as different SRv6 implementations. We
have used SRPerf to evaluate the performance of the SRv6 implementation in the
Linux kernel and in VPP. SRPerf is a valuable tool in the context of software
forwarding engines where new features can be added at fast pace, as it helps
experimenters to validate their work. In particular, we describe how we have
leveraged SRPerf to validate the implementation of some SRv6 behaviors that
were missing or wrongly implemented in the Linux kernel mainline.

  The advancements of cloud computing came as a radical transformation in the
way Information and Communication Technology (ICT) services are deployed and
maintained. Cloud computing provides ubiquitous on-demand access to an
Internet-based pool of processing, storage, and communication resources offered
to a large set of geographically distributed users. As the cloud computing
infrastructure grows and demand increases, the need for a new breed of
on-demand computing that can efficiently maintain Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements has increased. Fog computing was proposed to address the
limitations of cloud computing, in terms of delay and high bandwidth
requirements, by extending the on-demand resources of clouds to the edge of the
network bringing them closer to the users. The massive growth and wide use of
cloud-fog services have created serious power consumption concerns. This
article delves into the energy consumption of cloud-fog services by raising
headline questions related to; how significant the problem itself is, how
different conditions/scenarios affect the energy consumption of the
architecture, and how to orchestrate the use of the architecture in an
energy-efficient manner. We start by summarizing the cloud-fog architecture
including different communication and computing layers. Additionally, we give a
brief overview of the role of Virtual Machine (VM) placement in optimally using
cloud-fog resources in a dynamic manner. Then, we present the problem of energy
efficient VMs placement and provide numerical results.

\\
  We study the problem of wireless edge caching when file popularity is unknown
and possibly non-stationary. A bank of $J$ caches receives file requests and a
utility is accrued for each request depending on the serving cache. The network
decides dynamically which files to store at each cache and how to route them,
in order to maximize total utility. The request sequence is assumed to be drawn
from an arbitrary distribution, thus capturing time-variance, temporal, or
spatial locality of requests. For this challenging setting, we propose the
\emph{Bipartite Supergradient Caching Algorithm} (BSCA) which provably exhibits
no regret ($R_T/T \to 0$). That is, as the time horizon $T$ increases, BSCA
achieves the same performance with the cache configuration that we would have
chosen knowing all future requests. The learning rate of the algorithm is
characterized by its regret expression, found to be $R_T=O(\sqrt{JT})$, which
is independent of the content catalog size. For the single-cache case, we prove
that this is the lowest attainable bound. BSCA requires at each step $J$
projections on intersections of boxes and simplices, for which we propose a
tailored algorithm. Our model is the first that draws a connection between the
network caching problem and Online Convex Optimization, and we demonstrate its
generality by discussing various practical extensions and presenting a

  Online trackers personalize ads campaigns, exponentially increasing their
efficacy compared to traditional channels. The downside of this is that
thousands of mostly unknown systems own our profiles and violate our privacy
without our awareness. IPPO turns the table and re-empower users of their data,
through anonymised data publishing via a Blockchain-based Decentralized Data
Marketplace. We also propose a service based on machine learning and big data
analytics to automatically identify web trackers and build Privacy Labels
(PLs), based on the nutrition labels concept. This paper describes the
motivation, the vision, the architecture and the research challenges related to
IPPO.

  This EPTCS volume contains the proceedings of the 16th Workshop on
Quantitative Aspects of Programming Languages and Systems (QAPL 2019) held in
Prague, Czech Republic, on Sunday 7 April 2019. QAPL 2019 was a satellite event
of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS
2019).
  QAPL focuses on quantitative aspects of computations, which may refer to the
use of physical quantities (time, bandwidth, etc.) as well as mathematical
quantities (e.g., probabilities) for the characterisation of the behaviour and
for determining the properties of systems. Such quantities play a central role
in defining both the model of systems (architecture, language design,
semantics) and the methodologies and tools for the analysis and verification of
system properties. The aim of the QAPL workshop series is to discuss the
explicit use of time and probability and general quantities either directly in
the model or as a tool for the analysis or synthesis of systems.
  The 16th edition of QAPL also focuses on discussing the developments,
challenges and results in this area covered by our workshop in its nearly
20-year history.

Title: A Reliable Gravity Compensation Control Strategy for dVRK Robotic Arms
  With Nonlinear Disturbance Forces
Authors: Hongbin Lin, C. W. Vincent Hui, Yan Wang, Anton Deguet, Peter
  Kazanzides, and K. W. Samuel Au
Categories: cs.RO

\\
  External disturbance forces caused by nonlinear springy electrical cables in
the Master Tool Manipulator (MTM) of the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) limits
the usage of the existing gravity compensation methods. Significant motion
drifts at the MTM tip are often observed when the MTM is located far from its
identification trajectory, preventing the usage of these methods for the entire
workspace reliably. In this paper, we propose a general and systematic
framework to address the problems of the gravity compensation for the MTM of
the dVRK. Particularly, high order polynomial models were used to capture the
highly nonlinear disturbance forces and integrated with the Multi-step Least
Square Estimation (MLSE) framework. This method allows us to identify the
parameters of both the gravitational and disturbance forces for each link
sequentially, preventing residual error passing among the links of the MTM with
uneven mass distribution. A corresponding gravity compensation controller was
developed to compensate the gravitational and disturbance forces. The method
was validated with extensive experiments in the majority of the manipulator's
workspace, showing significant performance enhancements over existing methods.
Finally, a deliverable software package in MATLAB and C++ was integrated with
dVRK and published in the dVRK community for open-source research and
development.

\\
  The demand for multimodal sensing systems for robotics is growing due to the
increase in robustness, reliability and accuracy offered by these systems.
These systems also need to be spatially and temporally co-registered to be
effective. In this paper, we propose a targetless and structureless
spatiotemporal camera-LiDAR calibration method. Our method combines a
closed-form solution with a modified structureless bundle adjustment where the
coarse-to-fine approach does not {require} an initial guess on the
spatiotemporal parameters. Also, as 3D features (structure) are calculated from
triangulation only, there is no need to have a calibration target or to match
2D features with the 3D point cloud which provides flexibility in the
calibration process and sensor configuration. We demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of the proposed method through both simulation and real data
experiments using multiple sensor payload configurations mounted to hand-held,
aerial and legged robot systems. Also, qualitative results are given in the
form of a colorized point cloud visualization.

  Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are a kind of parallel robots that have
cables instead of rigid links. Implementing vision-based control on CDPRs leads
to a good final accuracy despite modeling errors and other perturbations in the
system. However, unlike final accuracy, the trajectory to the goal can be
affected by the perturbations in the system. This paper proposes the use of
trajectory tracking to improve the robustness of 2 1/2 D visual servoing
control of CDPRs. Lyapunov stability analysis is performed and, as a result, a
novel workspace, named control stability workspace, is defined. This workspace
defines the set of moving-platform poses where the robot is able to execute its
task while being stable. The improvement of robustness is clearly shown in
experimental validation.

Title: Tethered Aerial Visual Assistance
Authors: Xuesu Xiao, Jan Dufek, Robin R. Murphy
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV cs.HC
Comments: Submitted to special issue of "Field and Service Robotics" of the
  Journal of Field Robotics (JFR). arXiv admin note: text overlap with
  arXiv:1904.00078
\\
  In this paper, an autonomous tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is
developed into a visual assistant in a marsupial co-robots team, collaborating
with a tele-operated Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for robot operations in
unstructured or confined environments. These environments pose extreme
challenges to the remote tele-operator due to the lack of sufficient
situational awareness, mostly caused by the unstructuredness and confinement,
stationary and limited field-of-view and lack of depth perception from the
robot's onboard cameras. To overcome these problems, a secondary tele-operated
robot is used in current practices, who acts as a visual assistant and provides
external viewpoints to overcome the perceptual limitations of the primary
robot's onboard sensors. However, a second tele-operated robot requires extra
manpower and teamwork demand between primary and secondary operators. The
manually chosen viewpoints tend to be subjective and sub-optimal. Considering
these intricacies, we develop an autonomous tethered aerial visual assistant in
place of the secondary tele-operated robot and operator, to reduce human robot
ratio from 2:2 to 1:2. Using a fundamental viewpoint quality theory, a formal
risk reasoning framework, and a newly developed tethered motion suite, our
visual assistant is able to autonomously navigate to good-quality viewpoints in
a risk-aware manner through unstructured or confined spaces with a tether. The
developed marsupial co-robots team could improve tele-operation efficiency in
nuclear operations, bomb squad, disaster robots, and other domains with novel
tasks or highly occluded environments, by reducing manpower and teamwork
demand, and achieving better visual assistance quality with trustworthy
risk-aware motion.

Title: Supervised Speaker Embedding De-Mixing in Two-Speaker Environment
Authors: Yanpei Shi, Thomas Hain
Categories: cs.SD cs.CL cs.LG eess.AS
Comments: Submitted to Odyssey 2020
\\
  In this work, a speaker embedding de-mixing approach is proposed. Instead of
separating two-speaker signal in signal space like speech source separation,
the proposed approach separates different speaker properties from two-speaker
signal in embedding space. The proposed approach contains two steps. In step
one, the clean speaker embeddings are learned and collected by a residual TDNN
based network. In step two, the two-speaker signal and the embedding of one of
the speakers are input to a speaker embedding de-mixing network. The de-mixing
network is trained to generate the embedding of the other speaker of the by
reconstruction loss. Speaker identification accuracy on the de-mixed speaker
embeddings is used to evaluate the quality of the obtained embeddings.
Experiments are done in two kind of data: artificial augmented two-speaker data
(TIMIT) and real world recording of two-speaker data (MC-WSJ). Six diffident
speaker embedding de-mixing architectures are investigated. Comparing with the
speaker identification accuracy on the clean speaker embeddings (98.5%), the
obtained results show that one of the speaker embedding de-mixing architectures
obtain close performance, reaching 96.9% test accuracy on TIMIT when the SNR
between the target speaker and interfering speaker is 5 dB. More surprisingly,
we found choosing a simple subtraction as the embedding de-mixing function
could obtain the second best performance, reaching 95.2% test accuracy.

Title: Expecting the Unexpected: Developing Autonomous-System Design Principles
  for Reacting to Unpredicted Events and Conditions
Authors: Assaf Marron, Lior Limonad, Sarah Pollack, and David Harel
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG cs.RO
Comments: 6 pages; 1 figure
\\
  When developing autonomous systems, engineers and other stakeholders make
great effort to prepare the system for all foreseeable events and conditions.
However, these systems are still bound to encounter events and conditions that
were not considered at design time. For reasons like safety, cost, or ethics,
it is often highly desired that these new situations be handled correctly upon
first encounter. In this paper we first justify our position that there will
always exist unpredicted events and conditions, driven among others by: new
inventions in the real world; the diversity of world-wide system deployments
and uses; and, the non-negligible probability that multiple seemingly unlikely
events, which may be neglected at design time, will not only occur, but occur
together. We then argue that despite this unpredictability property, handling
these events and conditions is indeed possible. Hence, we offer and exemplify
design principles that when applied in advance, can enable systems to deal, in
the future, with unpredicted circumstances. We conclude with a discussion of
how this work and a broader theoretical study of the unexpected can contribute
toward a foundation of engineering principles for developing trustworthy
next-generation autonomous systems.

Categories: cs.SE
Comments: This is the author's version of ICSE 2020 paper
\\
  Developers are increasingly sharing images in social coding environments
alongside the growth in visual interactions within social networks. The
analysis of the ratio between the textual and visual content of Mozilla's
change requests and in Q/As of StackOverflow programming revealed a steady
increase in sharing images over the past five years. Developers' shared images
are meaningful and are providing complementary information compared to their
associated text. Often, the shared images are essential in understanding the
change requests, questions, or the responses submitted. Relying on these
observations, we delve into the potential of automatic completion of textual
software artifacts with visual content.

Title: Rumor Detection on Social Media with Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional
  Networks
Authors: Tian Bian, Xi Xiao, Tingyang Xu, Peilin Zhao, Wenbing Huang, Yu Rong,

\\
  Social media has been developing rapidly in public due to its nature of
spreading new information, which leads to rumors being circulated. Meanwhile,
detecting rumors from such massive information in social media is becoming an
arduous challenge. Therefore, some deep learning methods are applied to
discover rumors through the way they spread, such as Recursive Neural Network
(RvNN) and so on. However, these deep learning methods only take into account
the patterns of deep propagation but ignore the structures of wide dispersion
in rumor detection. Actually, propagation and dispersion are two crucial
characteristics of rumors. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional
graph model, named Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), to
explore both characteristics by operating on both top-down and bottom-up
propagation of rumors. It leverages a GCN with a top-down directed graph of
rumor spreading to learn the patterns of rumor propagation, and a GCN with an
opposite directed graph of rumor diffusion to capture the structures of rumor
dispersion. Moreover, the information from the source post is involved in each
layer of GCN to enhance the influences from the roots of rumors. Encouraging
empirical results on several benchmarks confirm the superiority of the proposed
method over the state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: Integrated Supervised Adaptive Control for the More Electric Aircraft
Authors: Alberto Cavallo, Giacomo Canciello, Antonio Russo
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 22 pages, 14 figures, journal
\\
  The innovative concept of Electric Aircraft is a challenging topic involving
different control objectives. For instance, it becomes possible to reduce the
size and the weight of the generator by using the battery as an auxiliary
generator in some operation phases. However, control strategies with different
objectives can be conflicting and they can produce undesirable effects, even
instability. For this reason an integrated design approach is needed, where
stability can be guaranteed in any configuration. In other words, the design of
the supervisory controller must be interlaced with that of low-level
controllers. Moreover, uncertainties and noisy signals require robust control
techniques and the use of adaptiveness in the control algorithm. In this paper,
an aeronautic application aiming at recharging batteries and to use the battery
to withstand generator overloads is addressed. Detailed and rigorous stability
proofs are given for any control configuration, including the switching phases
among different control objectives. Effectiveness of the proposed strategies is
shown by using a detailed simulator including switching electronic components.

Title: ESO architectures in the trajectory tracking ADR controller for a

\\
  Proper operation of the Active Disturbance Rejection \linebreak (ADR)
controller requires a precise determination of the so-called total disturbance
affecting the considered dynamical system, usually estimated by the Extended
State Observer (ESO). The observation quality of total disturbance has a
significant impact on the control error values, making room for a potential
improvement of control system performance using different structures of ESO. In
this article, we provide a quantitative comparison between the Luenberger and
Astolfi/Marconi (AM) observers designed for three different extended state
representations and utilized in the trajectory tracking ADR controller designed
for a mechanical system. Included results were obtained in the simple
simulation case, followed by the experimental validation on the main axis of a
telescope mount.

Title: Extending drawings of complete graphs into arrangements of pseudocircles
Authors: Alan Arroyo, R. Bruce Richter, Matthew Sunohara
Categories: math.CO cs.CG
\\
  Motivated by the successful application of geometry to proving the
Harary-Hill Conjecture for "pseudolinear" drawings of $K_n$, we introduce
"pseudospherical" drawings of graphs. A spherical drawing of a graph $G$ is a
drawing in the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ in which the vertices of $G$ are
represented as points---no three on a great circle---and the edges of $G$ are
shortest-arcs in $\mathbb{S}^2$ connecting pairs of vertices. Such a drawing
has three properties: every edge $e$ is contained in a simple closed curve
$\gamma_e$ such that the only vertices in $\gamma_e$ are the ends of $e$; if
$e\ne f$, then $\gamma_e\cap\gamma_f$ has precisely two crossings; and if $e\ne
f$, then $e$ intersects $\gamma_f$ at most once, either a crossing or an end of
$e$. We use these three properties to define a pseudospherical drawing of $G$.
  Our main result is that, for the complete graph, these three properties are
equivalent to the same three properties but with "exactly two crossings"
replaced by "at most two crossings".
  The proof requires a result in the geometric transversal theory of
arrangements of pseudocircles. This is proved using the surprising result that
the absence of special arcs (coherent spirals) in an arrangement of simple
closed curves characterizes the fact that any two curves in the arrangement
have at most two crossings.
  Our studies provide the necessary ideas for exhibiting a drawing of $K_{10}$
that has no extension to an arrangement of pseudocircles and a drawing of $K_9$
that does extend to an arrangement of pseudocircles, but no such extension has
all pairs of pseudocircles crossing twice.

Title: Detection Method Based on Automatic Visual Shape Clustering for
  Pin-Missing Defect in Transmission Lines
Authors: Zhenbing Zhao, Hongyu Qi, Yincheng Qi, Ke Zhang, Yongjie Zhai, Wenqing

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Bolts are the most numerous fasteners in transmission lines and are prone to
losing their split pins. How to realize the automatic pin-missing defect
detection for bolts in transmission lines so as to achieve timely and efficient
trouble shooting is a difficult problem and the long-term research target of
power systems. In this paper, an automatic detection model called Automatic
Visual Shape Clustering Network (AVSCNet) for pin-missing defect is
constructed. Firstly, an unsupervised clustering method for the visual shapes
of bolts is proposed and applied to construct a defect detection model which
can learn the difference of visual shape. Next, three deep convolutional neural
network optimization methods are used in the model: the feature enhancement,
feature fusion and region feature extraction. The defect detection results are
obtained by applying the regression calculation and classification to the
regional features. In this paper, the object detection model of different
networks is used to test the dataset of pin-missing defect constructed by the
aerial images of transmission lines from multiple locations, and it is
evaluated by various indicators and is fully verified. The results show that
our method can achieve considerably satisfactory detection effect.

improved performance over the state-of-the-art, which does not exploit

  Distributed statistical inference has recently attracted immense attention.
Herein, we study the asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimator
(MLE), the one-step MLE, and the aggregated estimating equation estimator for
generalized linear models with a diverging number of covariates. Then a novel
method is proposed to obtain an asymptotically efficient estimator for
large-scale distributed data by two rounds of communication between local
machines and the central server. The assumption on the number of machines in
this paper is more relaxed and thus practical for real-world applications.
Simulations and a case study demonstrate the satisfactory finite-sample
performance of the proposed estimators.

Comments: Parts of this paper have previously been reported in arXiv submission
  arXiv:1902.08223
\\
  We study covering numbers and local covering numbers with respect to
difference graphs and complete bipartite graphs. In particular we show that in
every cover of a Young diagram with $\binom{2k}{k}$ steps with generalized
rectangles there is a row or a column in the diagram that is used by at least
$k+1$ rectangles, and prove that this is best-possible. This answers two
questions by Kim, Martin, Masa{\v{r}}{\'\i}k, Shull, Smith, Uzzell, and Wang
(Europ. J. Comb. 2020), namely:
  - What is the local complete bipartite cover number of a difference graph? -
Is there a sequence of graphs with constant local difference graph cover number
and unbounded local complete bipartite cover number?
  We add to the study of these local covering numbers with a lower bound
construction and some examples. Following Kim \emph{et al.}, we use the results
on local covering numbers to provide lower and upper bounds for the local
dimension of partially ordered sets of height~2. We discuss the local dimension
of some posets related to Boolean lattices and show that the poset induced by
the first two layers of the Boolean lattice has local dimension $(1 +
o(1))\log_2\log_2 n$. We conclude with some remarks on covering numbers for
digraphs and Ferrers dimension.

Title: Globe-hopping
Authors: Dmitry Chistikov, Olga Goulko, Adrian Kent, Mike Paterson
Categories: quant-ph cs.DM math-ph math.CA math.MP
\\
  We consider versions of the grasshopper problem (Goulko and Kent, 2017) on
the circle and the sphere, which are relevant to Bell inequalities. For a
circle of circumference $2\pi$, we show that for unconstrained lawns of any
length and arbitrary jump lengths, the supremum of the probability for the
grasshopper's jump to stay on the lawn is one. For antipodal lawns, which by
definition contain precisely one of each pair of opposite points and have
length $\pi$, we show this is true except when the jump length $\phi$ is of the
form $\pi\frac{p}{q}$ with $p,q$ coprime and $p$ odd. For these jump lengths we
show the optimal probability is $1 - 1/q$ and construct optimal lawns. For a
pair of antipodal lawns, we show that the optimal probability of jumping from
one onto the other is $1 - 1/q$ for $p,q$ coprime, $p$ odd and $q$ even, and
one in all other cases. For an antipodal lawn on the sphere, it is known (Kent
and Pital\'ua-Garc\'ia, 2014) that if $\phi = \pi/q$, where $q \in \mathbb N$,
then the optimal retention probability of $1-1/q$ for the grasshopper's jump is
provided by a hemispherical lawn. We show that in all other cases where $0<\phi
< \pi/2$, hemispherical lawns are not optimal, disproving the hemispherical

  The fundamental problem of sampling from the limiting distribution of quantum
walks on networks, known as \emph{mixing}, finds widespread applications in
several areas of quantum information and computation. Of particular interest in
most of these applications, is the minimum time beyond which the instantaneous
probability distribution of the quantum walk remains close to this limiting
distribution, known as the \emph{quantum mixing time}. However this quantity is
only known for a handful of specific networks. In this letter, we prove an
upper bound on the quantum mixing time for \emph{almost all networks}, i.e.\
the fraction of networks for which our bound holds, goes to one in the
asymptotic limit. To this end, using several results in random matrix theory,
we find the quantum mixing time of Erd\"os-Renyi random networks: networks of
$n$ nodes where each edge exists with probability $p$ independently. For
example for dense random networks, where $p$ is a constant, we show that the
quantum mixing time is $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{3/2 + o(1)}\right)$. Besides
opening avenues for the analytical study of quantum dynamics on random
networks, our work could find applications beyond quantum information
processing. Owing to the universality of Wigner random matrices, our results on
the spectral properties of random graphs hold for general classes of random
matrices that are ubiquitous in several areas of physics. In particular, our
results could lead to novel insights into the equilibration times of isolated
quantum systems defined by random Hamiltonians, a foundational problem in
quantum statistical mechanics.

Title: Compactly Supported Quasi-tight Multiframelets with High Balancing
  Orders and Compact Framelet Transforms
Authors: Bin Han and Ran Lu

\\
  Framelets (a.k.a. wavelet frames) are of interest in both theory and
applications. Quite often, tight or dual framelets with high vanishing moments
are constructed through the popular oblique extension principle (OEP). Though
OEP can increase vanishing moments for improved sparsity, it has a serious
shortcoming for scalar framelets: the associated discrete framelet transform is
often not compact and deconvolution is unavoidable. Here we say that a framelet
transform is compact if it can be implemented by convolution using only
finitely supported filters. On the other hand, in sharp contrast to the
extensively studied scalar framelets, multiframelets (a.k.a. vector framelets)
derived through OEP from refinable vector functions are much less studied and
are far from well understood. Also, most constructed multiframelets often lack
balancing property which reduces sparsity. In this paper, we are particularly
interested in quasi-tight multiframelets, which are special dual multiframelets
but behave almost identically as tight multiframelets. From any compactly
supported \emph{refinable vector function having at least two entries}, we
prove that we can always construct through OEP a compactly supported
quasi-tight multiframelet such that (1) its associated discrete framelet
transform is compact and has the highest possible balancing order; (2) all
compactly supported framelet generators have the highest possible order of
vanishing moments, matching the approximation/accuracy order of its underlying
refinable vector function. This result demonstrates great advantages of OEP for
multiframelets (retaining all the desired properties) over scalar framelets.

Title: GSSMD: New metric for robust and interpretable assay quality assessment
  and hit selection
Authors: Seongyong Park and Shujaat Khan
Categories: stat.AP cs.IT math.IT q-bio.QM stat.ME
Comments: Submitted to Research Synthesis Methods
\\
  In the high-throughput screening (HTS) campaigns, the Z'-factor and strictly
standardized mean difference (SSMD) are commonly used to assess the quality of
assays and to select hits. However, these measures are vulnerable to outliers
and their performances are highly sensitive to background distributions. Here,
we propose an alternative measure for assay quality assessment and hit
selection. The proposed method is a non-parametric generalized variant of SSMD
(GSSMD). In this paper, we have shown that the proposed method provides more
robust and intuitive way of assay quality assessment and hit selection.

Title: Extracting more from boosted decision trees: A high energy physics case

\\
  Particle identification is one of the core tasks in the data analysis
pipeline at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Statistically, this entails the
identification of rare signal events buried in immense backgrounds that mimic
the properties of the former. In machine learning parlance, particle
identification represents a classification problem characterized by overlapping
and imbalanced classes. Boosted decision trees (BDTs) have had tremendous
success in the particle identification domain but more recently have been
overshadowed by deep learning (DNNs) approaches. This work proposes an
algorithm to extract more out of standard boosted decision trees by targeting
their main weakness, susceptibility to overfitting. This novel construction
harnesses the meta-learning techniques of boosting and bagging simultaneously
and performs remarkably well on the ATLAS Higgs (H) to tau-tau data set (ATLAS
et al., 2014) which was the subject of the 2014 Higgs ML Challenge
(Adam-Bourdarios et al., 2015). While the decay of Higgs to a pair of tau
leptons was established in 2018 (CMS collaboration et al., 2017) at the
4.9$\sigma$ significance based on the 2016 data taking period, the 2014 public
data set continues to serve as a benchmark data set to test the performance of
supervised classification schemes. We show that the score achieved by the
proposed algorithm is very close to the published winning score which leverages
an ensemble of deep neural networks (DNNs). Although this paper focuses on a
single application, it is expected that this simple and robust technique will
find wider applications in high energy physics.

Title: Bayesian inference of dynamics from partial and noisy observations using
  data assimilation and machine learning
Authors: Marc Bocquet, Julien Brajard, Alberto Carrassi, Laurent Bertino
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG physics.ao-ph
\\
  The reconstruction from observations of high-dimensional chaotic dynamics
such as geophysical flows is hampered by (i) the partial and noisy observations
that can realistically be obtained, (ii) the need to learn from long time
series of data, and (iii) the unstable nature of the dynamics. To achieve such
inference from the observations over long time series, it has been suggested to
combine data assimilation and machine learning in several ways. We show how to
unify these approaches from a Bayesian perspective using
expectation-maximization and coordinate descents. Implementations and
approximations of these methods are also discussed. Finally, we numerically and
successfully test the approach on two relevant low-order chaotic models with
distinct identifiability.

  Epilepsy affects nearly 1% of the global population, of which two thirds can
be treated by anti-epileptic drugs and a much lower percentage by surgery.
Diagnostic procedures for epilepsy and monitoring are highly specialized and
labour-intensive. The accuracy of the diagnosis is also complicated by
overlapping medical symptoms, varying levels of experience and inter-observer
variability among clinical professions. This paper proposes a novel hybrid
bilinear deep learning network with an application in the clinical procedures
of epilepsy classification diagnosis, where the use of surface
electroencephalogram (sEEG) and audiovisual monitoring is standard practice.
Hybrid bilinear models based on two types of feature extractors, namely
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are
trained using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of one-second sEEG. In the
proposed hybrid models, CNNs extract spatio-temporal patterns, while RNNs focus
on the characteristics of temporal dynamics in relatively longer intervals
given the same input data. Second-order features, based on interactions between
these spatio-temporal features are further explored by bilinear pooling and
used for epilepsy classification. Our proposed methods obtain an F1-score of
97.4% on the Temple University Hospital Seizure Corpus and 97.2% on the
EPILEPSIAE dataset, comparing favourably to existing benchmarks for sEEG-based
seizure type classification. The open-source implementation of this study is
available at https://github.com/NeuroSyd/Epileptic-Seizure-Classification

  Information extracted from electrohysterography recordings could potentially
prove to be an interesting additional source of information to estimate the
risk on preterm birth. Recently, a large number of studies have reported
near-perfect results to distinguish between recordings of patients that will
deliver term or preterm using a public resource, called the Term/Preterm
Electrohysterogram database. However, we argue that these results are overly
optimistic due to a methodological flaw being made. In this work, we focus on
one specific type of methodological flaw: applying over-sampling before
partitioning the data into mutually exclusive training and testing sets. We
show how this causes the results to be biased using two artificial datasets and
reproduce results of studies in which this flaw was identified. Moreover, we
evaluate the actual impact of over-sampling on predictive performance, when
applied prior to data partitioning, using the same methodologies of related
studies, to provide a realistic view of these methodologies' generalization
capabilities. We make our research reproducible by providing all the code under
an open license.

Title: Wine quality rapid detection using a compact electronic nose system:

\\
  It is crucial for the wine industry to have methods like electronic nose
systems (E-Noses) for real-time monitoring thresholds of acetic acid in wines,
preventing its spoilage or determining its quality. In this paper, we prove
that the portable and compact self-developed E-Nose, based on thin film
semiconductor (SnO2) sensors and trained with an approach that uses deep
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, can perform early detection of wine
spoilage thresholds in routine tasks of wine quality control. To obtain rapid
and online detection, we propose a method of rising-window focused on raw data
processing to find an early portion of the sensor signals with the best
recognition performance. Our approach was compared with the conventional
approach employed in E-Noses for gas recognition that involves feature
extraction and selection techniques for preprocessing data, succeeded by a
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The results evidence that is possible
to classify three wine spoilage levels in 2.7 seconds after the gas injection
point, implying in a methodology 63 times faster than the results obtained with
the conventional approach in our experimental setup.

Title: Learning Sparse Classifiers: Continuous and Mixed Integer Optimization
  Perspectives
Authors: Antoine Dedieu, Hussein Hazimeh, Rahul Mazumder
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.OC stat.CO
\\
  We consider a discrete optimization based approach for learning sparse
classifiers, where the outcome depends upon a linear combination of a small
subset of features. Recent work has shown that mixed integer programming (MIP)
can be used to solve (to optimality) $\ell_0$-regularized problems at scales
much larger than what was conventionally considered possible in the statistics
and machine learning communities. Despite their usefulness, MIP-based
approaches are significantly slower compared to relatively mature algorithms
based on $\ell_1$-regularization and relatives. We aim to bridge this
computational gap by developing new MIP-based algorithms for
$\ell_0$-regularized classification. We propose two classes of scalable
algorithms: an exact algorithm that can handle $p\approx 50,000$ features in a
few minutes, and approximate algorithms that can address instances with
$p\approx 10^6$ in times comparable to fast $\ell_1$-based algorithms. Our
exact algorithm is based on the novel idea of \textsl{integrality generation},
which solves the original problem (with $p$ binary variables) via a sequence of
mixed integer programs that involve a small number of binary variables. Our
approximate algorithms are based on coordinate descent and local combinatorial
search. In addition, we present new estimation error bounds for a class of
$\ell_0$-regularized estimators. Experiments on real and synthetic data
demonstrate that our approach leads to models with considerably improved
statistical performance (especially, variable selection) when compared to
competing toolkits.

Title: Frequency- and Time-Limited Balanced Truncation for Large-Scale
  Second-Order Systems
Authors: Peter Benner, Steffen W. R. Werner
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 30 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables
\\
  Considering the use of dynamical systems in practical applications, often
only limited regions in the time or frequency domain are of interest. Therefor,
it usually pays off to compute local approximations of the used dynamical
systems in the frequency and time domain. In this paper, we consider a
structure-preserving extension of the frequency- and time-limited balanced
truncation methods to second-order dynamical systems. We give a full overview
about the first-order limited balanced truncation methods and extend those
methods to second-order systems by using the different second-order balanced
truncation formulas from the literature. Also, we present numerical methods for
solving the arising large-scale sparse matrix equations and give numerical
modifications to deal with the problematic case of second-order systems. The
results are then illustrated on three numerical examples.

this conservation of energy in terms of a uniform decay of the so-called

initial data to validate our theory and to observe energy conservation in a

\\
  Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication and services have been garnering
significant interest from different stakeholders as part of future intelligent
transportation systems (ITSs). This is due to the many benefits they offer.
However, many of these services have stringent performance requirements,
particularly in terms of the delay/latency. Multi-access/mobile edge computing
(MEC) has been proposed as a potential solution for such services by bringing
them closer to vehicles. Yet, this introduces a new set of challenges such as
where to place these V2X services, especially given the limit computation
resources available at edge nodes. To that end, this work formulates the
problem of optimal V2X service placement (OVSP) in a hybrid core/edge
environment as a binary integer linear programming problem. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous work considered the V2X service placement problem while
taking into consideration the computational resource availability at the nodes.
Moreover, a low-complexity greedy-based heuristic algorithm named "Greedy V2X
Service Placement Algorithm" (G-VSPA) was developed to solve this problem.
Simulation results show that the OVSP model successfully guarantees and
maintains the QoS requirements of all the different V2X services. Additionally,
it is observed that the proposed G-VSPA algorithm achieves close to optimal
performance while having lower complexity.

Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.SI q-fin.TR
Comments: 38 pages, 20 figures
\\
  Community detection in a network plays a crucial role in the economic and
financial contexts, specifically when applied to the World Trade Network. We
provide a new perspective in which clusters of strongly interacting countries
are identified by means of a specific distance criterion. We refer to the
Estrada communicability distance and the vibrational communicability distance,
which turn out to be particularly suitable for catching the inner structure of
the economic network. The methodology is based on a varying distance threshold
and it is effective from a computational point of view. It also allows an
inspection of the intercluster and intracluster properties of the resulting
communities. The numerical analyses highlight peculiar relationships between
countries and provide a rich set of information that can hardly be achieved
within alternative clustering approaches.

Title: On the Well-Posedness of Dynamical Flow Networks With
  Feedback-Controlled Outflows
Authors: Giacomo Como and Gustav Nilsson
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  We study the well-posedness of a class of dynamical flow network systems
describing the dynamical mass balance among a finite number of cells exchanging
flow of a commodity between themselves and with the external environment.
Systems in the considered class are described as differential inclusions
whereby the routing matrix is constant and the outflow from each cell in the
network is limited by a control that is a Lipschitz continuous function of the
state of the network. In many applications, such as queueing systems and
traffic signal control, it is common that an empty queue can be allowed to have
more outflow than the mass in the queue. While models for this scenario have
previously been presented for open-loop outflow controls, this result ensures
the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the network flow dynamics in the
case Lipschitz continuous feedback controllers.

  Symbolic controller synthesis is a fully-automated and correct-by-design
synthesis scheme whose limitations are its immense memory and runtime
requirements. A current trend to compensate for this downside is to develop
techniques for parallel execution of the scheme both in mathematical foundation
and in software implementation. In this paper we present a generalized
Bellman-Ford algorithm to be used in the so-called symbolic optimal control,
which is an extension of the aforementioned synthesis scheme. Compared to the
widely used Dijkstra algorithm our algorithm has two advantages. It allows for
cost functions taking arbitrary (e.g. negative) values and for parallel
execution with the ability for trading processing speed for memory consumption.
We motivate the usefulness of negative cost values on a scenario of aerial
firefighting with unmanned aerial vehicles. In addition, this four-dimensional
numerical example, which is rich in detail, demonstrates the great performance
of our algorithm.
