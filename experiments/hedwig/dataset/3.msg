Title: A Logical Model for Supporting Social Commonsense Knowledge Acquisition
Authors: Zhenzhen Gu, Cungen Cao, Ya Wang and Yuefei Sui
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  To make machine exhibit human-like abilities in the domains like robotics and
conversation, social commonsense knowledge (SCK), i.e., common sense about
social contexts and social roles, is absolutely necessarily. Therefor, our
ultimate goal is to acquire large-scale SCK to support much more intelligent
applications. Before that, we need to know clearly what is SCK and how to
represent it, since automatic information processing requires data and
knowledge are organized in structured and semantically related ways. For this
reason, in this paper, we identify and formalize three basic types of SCK based
on first-order theory. Firstly, we identify and formalize the
interrelationships, such as having-role and having-social_relation, among
social contexts, roles and players from the perspective of considering both
contexts and roles as first-order citizens and not generating role instances.
Secondly, we provide a four level structure to identify and formalize the
intrinsic information, such as events and desires, of social contexts, roles
and players, and illustrate the way of harvesting the intrinsic information of
social contexts and roles from the exhibition of players in concrete contexts.
And thirdly, enlightened by some observations of actual contexts, we further
introduce and formalize the embedding of social contexts, and depict the way of
excavating the intrinsic information of social contexts and roles from the
embedded smaller and simpler contexts. The results of this paper lay the
foundation not only for formalizing much more complex SCK but also for
acquiring these three basic types of SCK.

Title: Learning to Answer Ambiguous Questions with Knowledge Graph
Authors: Yikai Zhu, Jianhao Shen, Ming Zhang
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  In the task of factoid question answering over knowledge base, many questions
have more than one plausible interpretation. Previous works on SimpleQuestions
assume only one interpretation as the ground truth for each question, so they
lack the ability to answer ambiguous questions correctly. In this paper, we
present a new way to utilize the dataset that takes into account the existence
of ambiguous questions. Then we introduce a simple and effective model which
combines local knowledge subgraph with attention mechanism. Our experimental
results show that our approach achieves outstanding performance in this task.

  We write down an explicit sequence of tensors in $C^m\otimes C^m\otimes C^m$,

Title: Make Lead Bias in Your Favor: A Simple and Effective Method for News
  Summarization
Authors: Chenguang Zhu, Ziyi Yang, Robert Gmyr, Michael Zeng, Xuedong Huang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Lead bias is a common phenomenon in news summarization, where early parts of
an article often contain the most salient information. While many algorithms
exploit this fact in summary generation, it has a detrimental effect on
teaching the model to discriminate and extract important information. We
propose that the lead bias can be leveraged in a simple and effective way in
our favor to pretrain abstractive news summarization models on large-scale
unlabeled corpus: predicting the leading sentences using the rest of an
article. Via careful data cleaning and filtering, our transformer-based
pretrained model without any finetuning achieves remarkable results over
various news summarization tasks. With further finetuning, our model
outperforms many competitive baseline models. For example, the pretrained model
without finetuning achieves state-of-the-art results on DUC-2003 and DUC-2004
datasets. The finetuned model obtains 3.2% higher ROUGE-1, 1.6% higher ROUGE-2
and 2.1% higher ROUGE-L scores than the best baseline model on XSum dataset.
Human evaluations further show the effectiveness of our method.

Title: N-gram Statistical Stemmer for Bangla Corpus
Authors: Rabeya Sadia, Md Ataur Rahman, Md Hanif Seddiqui
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
\\
  Stemming is a process that can be utilized to trim inflected words to stem or
root form. It is useful for enhancing the retrieval effectiveness, especially
for text search in order to solve the mismatch problems. Previous research on
Bangla stemming mostly relied on eliminating multiple suffixes from a solitary
word through a recursive rule based procedure to recover progressively
applicable relative root. Our proposed system has enhanced the aforementioned
exploration by actualizing one of the stemming algorithms called N-gram
stemming. By utilizing an affiliation measure called dice coefficient, related
sets of words are clustered depending on their character structure. The
smallest word in one cluster may be considered as the stem. We additionally
analyzed Affinity Propagation clustering algorithms with coefficient similarity
as well as with median similarity. Our result indicates N-gram stemming
techniques to be effective in general which gave us around 87% accurate
clusters.

Title: A Study of Multilingual Neural Machine Translation
Authors: Xu Tan, Yichong Leng, Jiale Chen, Yi Ren, Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) has recently been investigated
from different aspects (e.g., pivot translation, zero-shot translation,
fine-tuning, or training from scratch) and in different settings (e.g., rich
resource and low resource, one-to-many, and many-to-one translation). This
paper concentrates on a deep understanding of multilingual NMT and conducts a
comprehensive study on a multilingual dataset with more than 20 languages. Our
results show that (1) low-resource language pairs benefit much from
multilingual training, while rich-resource language pairs may get hurt under
limited model capacity and training with similar languages benefits more than
dissimilar languages; (2) fine-tuning performs better than training from
scratch in the one-to-many setting while training from scratch performs better
in the many-to-one setting; (3) the bottom layers of the encoder and top layers
of the decoder capture more language-specific information, and just fine-tuning
these parts can achieve good accuracy for low-resource language pairs; (4)
direct translation is better than pivot translation when the source language is
similar to the target language (e.g., in the same language branch), even when
the size of direct training data is much smaller; (5) given a fixed training
data budget, it is better to introduce more languages into multilingual
training for zero-shot translation.

Title: Explicit Sparse Transformer: Concentrated Attention Through Explicit
  Selection
Authors: Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin, Zhiyuan Zhang, Xuancheng Ren, Qi Su, Xu
  Sun
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Self-attention based Transformer has demonstrated the state-of-the-art
performances in a number of natural language processing tasks. Self-attention
is able to model long-term dependencies, but it may suffer from the extraction
of irrelevant information in the context. To tackle the problem, we propose a
novel model called \textbf{Explicit Sparse Transformer}. Explicit Sparse
Transformer is able to improve the concentration of attention on the global
context through an explicit selection of the most relevant segments. Extensive
experimental results on a series of natural language processing and computer
vision tasks, including neural machine translation, image captioning, and
language modeling, all demonstrate the advantages of Explicit Sparse
Transformer in model performance. We also show that our proposed sparse
attention method achieves comparable or better results than the previous sparse
attention method, but significantly reduces training and testing time. For
example, the inference speed is twice that of sparsemax in Transformer model.

\\
  Automated multi-document extractive text summarization is a widely studied
research problem in the field of natural language understanding. Such
extractive mechanisms compute in some form the worthiness of a sentence to be
included into the summary. While the conventional approaches rely on human
crafted document-independent features to generate a summary, we develop a
data-driven novel summary system called HNet, which exploits the various
semantic and compositional aspects latent in a sentence to capture document
independent features. The network learns sentence representation in a way that,
salient sentences are closer in the vector space than non-salient sentences.
This semantic and compositional feature vector is then concatenated with the
document-dependent features for sentence ranking. Experiments on the DUC
benchmark datasets (DUC-2001, DUC-2002 and DUC-2004) indicate that our model
shows significant performance gain of around 1.5-2 points in terms of ROUGE
score compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

  Extractive text summarization has been an extensive research problem in the
field of natural language understanding. While the conventional approaches rely
mostly on manually compiled features to generate the summary, few attempts have
been made in developing data-driven systems for extractive summarization. To
this end, we present a fully data-driven end-to-end deep network which we call
as Hybrid MemNet for single document summarization task. The network learns the
continuous unified representation of a document before generating its summary.
It jointly captures local and global sentential information along with the
notion of summary worthy sentences. Experimental results on two different
corpora confirm that our model shows significant performance gains compared
with the state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: Coursera Corpus Mining and Multistage Fine-Tuning for Improving Lectures
  Translation
Authors: Haiyue Song, Raj Dabre, Atsushi Fujita, Sadao Kurohashi

\\
  Lectures translation is a case of spoken language translation and there is a
lack of publicly available parallel corpora for this purpose. To address this,
we examine a language independent framework for parallel corpus mining which is
a quick and effective way to mine a parallel corpus from publicly available
lectures at Coursera. Our approach determines sentence alignments, relying on
machine translation and cosine similarity over continuous-space sentence
representations. We also show how to use the resulting corpora in a multistage
fine-tuning based domain adaptation for high-quality lectures translation. For
Japanese--English lectures translation, we extracted parallel data of
approximately 40,000 lines and created development and test sets through manual
filtering for benchmarking translation performance. We demonstrate that the
mined corpus greatly enhances the quality of translation when used in
conjunction with out-of-domain parallel corpora via multistage training. This
paper also suggests some guidelines to gather and clean corpora, mine parallel
sentences, address noise in the mined data, and create high-quality evaluation
splits. For the sake of reproducibility, we will release our code for parallel
data creation.

Title: Language Independent Sentiment Analysis
Authors: Muhammad Haroon Shakeel, Turki Alghamidi, Safi Faizullah, Imdadullah

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Social media platforms and online forums generate rapid and increasing amount
of textual data. Businesses, government agencies, and media organizations seek
to perform sentiment analysis on this rich text data. The results of these
analytics are used for adapting marketing strategies, customizing products,
security and various other decision makings. Sentiment analysis has been
extensively studied and various methods have been developed for it with great
success. These methods, however apply to texts written in a specific language.
This limits applicability to a limited demographic and a specific geographic
region. In this paper we propose a general approach for sentiment analysis on
data containing texts from multiple languages. This enables all the
applications to utilize the results of sentiment analysis in a language
oblivious or language-independent fashion.

Comments: Working in progress, part of this work is accepted in AAAI-2020
\\
  State-of-the-art Transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT) systems
still follow a standard encoder-decoder framework, in which source sentence
representation can be well done by an encoder with self-attention mechanism.
Though Transformer-based encoder may effectively capture general information in
its resulting source sentence representation, the backbone information, which
stands for the gist of a sentence, is not specifically focused on. In this
paper, we propose an explicit sentence compression method to enhance the source
sentence representation for NMT. In practice, an explicit sentence compression
goal used to learn the backbone information in a sentence. We propose three
ways, including backbone source-side fusion, target-side fusion, and both-side
fusion, to integrate the compressed sentence into NMT. Our empirical tests on
the WMT English-to-French and English-to-German translation tasks show that the
proposed sentence compression method significantly improves the translation
performances over strong baselines.

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  This paper presents a method that generates expressive singing voice of
Peking opera. The synthesis of expressive opera singing usually requires pitch
contours to be extracted as the training data, which relies on techniques and
is not able to be manually labeled. With the Duration Informed Attention
Network (DurIAN), this paper makes use of musical note instead of pitch
contours for expressive opera singing synthesis. The proposed method enables
human annotation being combined with automatic extracted features to be used as
training data thus the proposed method gives extra flexibility in data
collection for Peking opera singing synthesis. Comparing with the expressive
singing voice of Peking opera synthesised by pitch contour based system, the
proposed musical note based system produces comparable singing voice in Peking
opera with expressiveness in various aspects.

Title: Visual Agreement Regularized Training for Multi-Modal Machine
  Translation
Authors: Pengcheng Yang, Boxing Chen, Pei Zhang, Xu Sun
Categories: cs.CL cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by AAAI 2020
\\
  Multi-modal machine translation aims at translating the source sentence into
a different language in the presence of the paired image. Previous work
suggests that additional visual information only provides dispensable help to
translation, which is needed in several very special cases such as translating
ambiguous words. To make better use of visual information, this work presents
visual agreement regularized training. The proposed approach jointly trains the
source-to-target and target-to-source translation models and encourages them to
share the same focus on the visual information when generating semantically
equivalent visual words (e.g. "ball" in English and "ballon" in French).
Besides, a simple yet effective multi-head co-attention model is also
introduced to capture interactions between visual and textual features. The
results show that our approaches can outperform competitive baselines by a
large margin on the Multi30k dataset. Further analysis demonstrates that the
proposed regularized training can effectively improve the agreement of
attention on the image, leading to better use of visual information.

Title: A Multi-cascaded Model with Data Augmentation for Enhanced Paraphrase
  Detection in Short Texts
Authors: Muhammad Haroon Shakeel, Asim Karim, Imdadullah Khan
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Paraphrase detection is an important task in text analytics with numerous
applications such as plagiarism detection, duplicate question identification,
and enhanced customer support helpdesks. Deep models have been proposed for
representing and classifying paraphrases. These models, however, require large
quantities of human-labeled data, which is expensive to obtain. In this work,
we present a data augmentation strategy and a multi-cascaded model for improved
paraphrase detection in short texts. Our data augmentation strategy considers
the notions of paraphrases and non-paraphrases as binary relations over the set
of texts. Subsequently, it uses graph theoretic concepts to efficiently
generate additional paraphrase and non-paraphrase pairs in a sound manner. Our
multi-cascaded model employs three supervised feature learners (cascades) based
on CNN and LSTM networks with and without soft-attention. The learned features,
together with hand-crafted linguistic features, are then forwarded to a
discriminator network for final classification. Our model is both wide and deep
and provides greater robustness across clean and noisy short texts. We evaluate
our approach on three benchmark datasets and show that it produces a comparable
or state-of-the-art performance on all three.

  After years of development, FPGAs are finally making an appearance on
multi-tenant cloud servers. These heterogeneous FPGA-CPU architectures break
common assumptions about isolation and security boundaries. Since the FPGA and
CPU architectures share hardware resources, a new class of vulnerabilities
requires us to reassess the security and dependability of these platforms.
  In this work, we analyze the memory and cache subsystem and study Rowhammer
and cache attacks enabled on two proposed heterogeneous FPGA-CPU platforms by
Intel: the Arria 10 GX with an integrated FPGA-CPU platform, and the Arria 10
GX PAC expansion card which connects the FPGA to the CPU via the PCIe
interface. We show that while Intel PACs currently are immune to cache attacks
from FPGA to CPU, the integrated platform is indeed vulnerable to Prime and
Probe style attacks from the FPGA to the CPU's last level cache. Further, we
demonstrate JackHammer, a novel and efficient Rowhammer from the FPGA to the
host's main memory. Our results indicate that a malicious FPGA can perform
twice as fast as a typical Rowhammer attack from the CPU on the same system and
causes around four times as many bit flips as the CPU attack. We demonstrate
the efficacy of JackHammer from the FPGA through a realistic fault attack on
the WolfSSL RSA signing implementation that reliably causes a fault after an
average of fifty-eight RSA signatures, 25% faster than a CPU rowhammer attack.
In some scenarios our JackHammer attack produces faulty signatures more than
three times more often and almost three times faster than a conventional CPU
rowhammer attack.

Title: Pseudo Random Number Generation: a Reinforcement Learning approach
Authors: Luca Pasqualini, Maurizio Parton
Categories: cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 13 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Pseudo-Random Numbers Generators (PRNGs) are algorithms produced to generate
long sequences of statistically uncorrelated numbers, i.e. Pseudo-Random
Numbers (PRNs). These numbers are widely employed in mid-level cryptography and
in software applications. Test suites are used to evaluate PRNGs quality by
checking statistical properties of the generated sequences. Machine learning
techniques are often used to break these generators, for instance approximating
a certain generator or a certain sequence using a neural network. But what
about using machine learning to generate PRNs generators? This paper proposes a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to the task of generating PRNGs from
scratch by learning a policy to solve an N-dimensional navigation problem. In
this context, N is the length of the period of the generated sequence, and the
policy is iteratively improved using the average value of an appropriate test
suite run over that period. Aim of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility
of the proposed approach, to compare it with classical methods, and to lay the
foundation of a research path which combines RL and PRNGs.

Title: Characterizing Orphan Transactions in the Bitcoin Network
Authors: Muhammad Anas Imtiaz, David Starobinski, Ari Trachtenberg
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Orphan transactions are those whose parental income-sources are missing at
the time that they are processed. These transactions are not propagated to
other nodes until all of their missing parents are received, and they thus end
up languishing in a local buffer until evicted or their parents are found.
Although there has been little work in the literature on characterizing the
nature and impact of such orphans, it is intuitive that they may affect
throughput on the Bitcoin network. This work thus seeks to methodically
research such effects through a measurement campaign of orphan transactions on
live Bitcoin nodes. Our data show that, surprisingly, orphan transactions tend
to have fewer parents on average than non-orphan transactions. Moreover, the
salient features of their missing parents are a lower fee and larger size than
their non-orphan counterparts, resulting in a lower transaction fee per byte.
Finally, we note that the network overhead incurred by these orphan
transactions can be significant, exceeding 17% when using the default orphan
memory pool size (100 transactions). However, this overhead can be made
negligible, without significant computational or memory demands, if the pool
size is merely increased to 1000 transactions.

Title: Smooth Operator -- The Use of Smooth Integers in Fast Generation of RSA
  Keys
Authors: Vassil Dimitrov, Luigi Vigneri, Vidal Attias
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: This paper contains 10 pages and 2 tables
\\
  Primality generation is the cornerstone of several essential cryptographic
system, most notably, the RSA cryptosystem. The problem has been a subject of
deep investigations by the computational number theorists, but there is still
room for improvement. Typically, the algorithms used have two parts - trial
divisions aimed at eliminating numbers with small prime factors and primality
tests based on an easy-to-compute statement that is valid for primes and
invalid for composites. In this paper we will showcase a technique that will
eliminate the first phase of the primality testing algorithms. It is
particularly suitable for a decentralized RSA key generation. The computational
simulations show reduction of the primality generation time for about 30% in
the case of 1024-bit RSA private keys. We are also proposing one new one-way
function that can be used either as a hash function or as cryptographic puzzle
for mining purposes.

Title: Next-Generation Big Data Federation Access Control: A Reference Model
Authors: Feras M. Awaysheh, Mamoun Alazab, Maanak Gupta, Tom\'as F. Pena,
  Jos\'e C. Cabaleiro
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  This paper discusses one of the most significant challenges of
next-generation big data (BD) federation platforms, namely, Hadoop access
control. Privacy and security on a federation scale remain significant concerns
among practitioners. Hadoop's current primitive access control presents
security concerns and limitations, such as the complexity of deployment and the
consumption of resources. However, this major concern has not been a subject of
intensive study in the literature. This paper critically reviews and
investigates these security limitations and provides a framework called BD
federation access broker to address 8 main security limitations. This paper
proposes the federated access control reference model (FACRM) to formalize the
design of secure BD solutions within the Apache Hadoop stack. Furthermore, this
paper discusses the implementation of the access broker and its usefulness for
security breach detection and digital forensics investigations. The efficiency
of the proposed access broker has not sustainably affected the performance
overhead. The experimental results show only 1\% of each 100 MB read/write
operation in a WebHDFS. Overall, the findings of the paper pave the way for a
wide range of revolutionary and state-of-the-art enhancements and future trends
within Hadoop stack security and privacy.

\\
  A set of about 80 researchers, practitioners, and federal agency program
managers participated in the NSF-sponsored Grand Challenges in Resilience
Workshop held on Purdue campus on March 19-21, 2019. The workshop was divided
into three themes: resilience in cyber, cyber-physical, and socio-technical
systems. About 30 attendees in all participated in the discussions of cyber
resilience. This article brings out the substantive parts of the challenges and
solution approaches that were identified in the cyber resilience theme. In this
article, we put forward the substantial challenges in cyber resilience in a few
representative application domains and outline foundational solutions to
address these challenges. These solutions fall into two broad themes:
resilience-by-design and resilience-by-reaction. We use examples of autonomous
systems as the application drivers motivating cyber resilience. We focus on
some autonomous systems in the near horizon (autonomous ground and aerial
vehicles) and also a little more distant (autonomous rescue and relief).
  For resilience-by-design, we focus on design methods in software that are
needed for our cyber systems to be resilient. In contrast, for
resilience-by-reaction, we discuss how to make systems resilient by responding,
reconfiguring, or recovering at runtime when failures happen. We also discuss
the notion of adaptive execution to improve resilience, execution transparently
and adaptively among available execution platforms (mobile/embedded, edge, and
cloud). For each of the two themes, we survey the current state, and the
desired state and ways to get there. We conclude the paper by looking at the
research challenges we will have to solve in the short and the mid-term to make
the vision of resilient autonomous systems a reality.

Title: Efficient Algorithm for the Linear Complexity of Sequences and Some
  Related Consequences
Authors: Yeow Meng Chee, Johan Chrisnata, Tuvi Etzion, Han Mao Kiah
Categories: cs.CR cs.SC
\\
  The linear complexity of a sequence $s$ is one of the measures of its
predictability. It represents the smallest degree of a linear recursion which
the sequence satisfies. There are several algorithms to find the linear
complexity of a periodic sequence $s$ of length $N$ (where $N$ is of some given
form) over a finite field $F_q$ in $O(N)$ symbol field operations. The first
such algorithm is The Games-Chan Algorithm which considers binary sequences of
period $2^n$, and is known for its extreme simplicity. We generalize this
algorithm and apply it efficiently for several families of binary sequences.
Our algorithm is very simple, it requires $\beta N$ bit operations for a small
constant $\beta$, where $N$ is the period of the sequence. We make an analysis
on the number of bit operations required by the algorithm and compare it with
previous algorithms. In the process, the algorithm also finds the recursion for
the shortest linear feedback shift-register which generates the sequence. Some
other interesting properties related to shift-register sequences, which might
not be too surprising but generally unnoted, are also consequences of our
exposition.

Title: A Closer Look at Mobile App Usage as a Persistent Biometric: A Small
  Case Study
Authors: Md A. Noor, G. Kaptan, V. Cherukupally, P. Gera, T. Neal
Categories: cs.CR cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we explore mobile app use as a behavioral biometric
identifier. While several efforts have also taken on this challenge, many have
alluded to the inconsistency in human behavior, resulting in updating the
biometric template frequently and periodically. Here, we represent app usage as
simple images wherein each pixel value provides some information about the
user's app usage. Then, we feed use these images to train a deep learning
network (convolutional neural net) to classify the user's identity. Our
contribution lies in the random order in which the images are fed to the
classifier, thereby presenting novel evidence that there are some aspects of
app usage that are indeed persistent. Our results yield a 96.8% $F$-score
without any updates to the template data.

Title: Proof of Federated Learning: A Novel Energy-recycling Consensus
  Algorithm
Authors: Xidi Qu, Shengling Wang, Qin Hu, Xiuzhen Cheng
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Proof of work (PoW), the most popular consensus mechanism for Blockchain,
requires ridiculously large amounts of energy but without any useful outcome
beyond determining accounting rights among miners. To tackle the drawback of
PoW, we propose a novel energy-recycling consensus algorithm, namely proof of
federated learning (PoFL), where the energy originally wasted to solve
difficult but meaningless puzzles in PoW is reinvested to federated learning.
Federated learning and pooled-ming, a trend of PoW, have a natural fit in terms
of organization structure. However, the separation between the data usufruct
and ownership in Blockchain lead to data privacy leakage in model training and
verification, deviating from the original intention of federal learning. To
address the challenge, a reverse game-based data trading mechanism and a
privacy-preserving model verification mechanism are proposed. The former can
guard against training data leakage while the latter verifies the accuracy of a
trained model with privacy preservation of the task requester's test data as
well as the pool's submitted model. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is
the first work to employ federal learning as the proof of work for Blockchain.
Extensive simulations based on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanisms.

\\
  Nowadays, IoT devices have been widely deployed for enabling various smart
services, such as, smart home or e-healthcare. However, security remains as one
of the paramount concern as many IoT devices are vulnerable. Moreover, IoT
malware are constantly evolving and getting more sophisticated. IoT devices are
intended to perform very specific tasks, so their networking behavior is
expected to be reasonably stable and predictable. Any significant behavioral
deviation from the normal patterns would indicate anomalous events. In this
paper, we present a method to detect anomalous network communications in IoT
networks using a set of sparse autoencoders. The proposed approach allows us to
differentiate malicious communications from legitimate ones. So that, if a
device is compromised only malicious communications can be dropped while the
service provided by the device is not totally interrupted. To characterize
network behavior, bidirectional TCP flows are extracted and described using
statistics on the size of the first N packets sent and received, along with
statistics on the corresponding inter-arrival times between packets. A set of
sparse autoencoders is then trained to learn the profile of the legitimate
communications generated by an experimental smart home network. Depending on
the value of N, the developed model achieves attack detection rates ranging
from 86.9% to 91.2%, and false positive rates ranging from 0.1% to 0.5%.

Title: EVA: An Encrypted Vector Arithmetic Language and Compiler for Efficient
  Homomorphic Computation
Authors: Roshan Dathathri, Blagovesta Kostova, Olli Saarikivi, Wei Dai, Kim

\\
  Fully-Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) offers powerful capabilities by enabling
secure offloading of both storage and computation, and recent innovations in
schemes and implementation have made it all the more attractive. At the same
time, FHE is notoriously hard to use with a very constrained programming model,
a very unusual performance profile, and many cryptographic constraints.
Existing compilers for FHE either target simpler but less efficient FHE schemes
or only support specific domains where they can rely on expert provided
high-level runtimes to hide complications.
  This paper presents a new FHE language called Encrypted Vector Arithmetic
(EVA), which includes an optimizing compiler that generates correct and secure
FHE programs, while hiding all the complexities of the target FHE scheme.
Bolstered by our optimizing compiler, programmers can develop efficient general
purpose FHE applications directly in EVA. For example, we have developed image
processing applications using EVA, with very few lines of code.
  EVA is designed to also work as an intermediate representation that can be a
target for compiling higher-level domain-specific languages. To demonstrate
this we have re-targeted CHET, an existing domain-specific compiler for neural
network inference, onto EVA. Due to the novel optimizations in EVA, its
programs are on average 5.3x faster than those generated by CHET. We believe
EVA would enable a wider adoption of FHE by making it easier to develop FHE
applications and domain-specific FHE compilers.

  The problem of data security in IEEE 802.15.4 systems on Pololu Wixel devices
is solved, examples of hardware and software implementation of encryption and
decryption of different devices on the same platform are given. The proposed
approaches can be used in the development, implementation and operation of
wireless enterprise, industrial, and personal systems. Possible areas of
development for this work are related to research on improving encryption
algorithms (increasing key length, using asymmetric ciphers, etc.), comparing
their performance, and implementing a complete data exchange protocol. During
the work there were problems in the implementation of encryption algorithms on
low-power processors. During the work, a number of issues were resolved
regarding type reduction, addressing, memory space, buffer overflow, and more.
Issues resolved with reconciliation of receiver and transmitter operation.
Examples of hardware and software implementation of encryption and decryption
of different devices based on Pololu Wixel are given in the paper. The basic
task of building a secure communication channel by encrypting data in the
channel was solved and firmware and application software were obtained to fully
validate the devices. In addition, this work has great application potential,
since the implementation of encryption in existing systems will have a small
impact on implementation and will not affect the project budget, but will
dramatically improve the security of data transmission in these networks. The
proposed approaches can be used in the development, implementation and
operation of wireless enterprise, industrial, and personal systems. Continuing
this work may be to test the performance of other protocols on this and similar
hardware for systems that may be embedded in short-range wireless communication
projects of short-range standards.

Categories: cs.CR
\\
  With the development in the field of smartphones and ever growing base of
Internet, various softwares are left prone to many malicious activities like
pharming, phishing, ransomware, spam, spoofing, spyware, eavesdropping, etc.
These threats have not spared the smartphones which are equally prone to them.
In this work, we aim to detect these malwares with accuracy and efficiency.
This being essentially a classification problem, we use various machine
learning methods for this task. We observe that across models, Attention based
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), or broadly speaking, Deep Learning, are most
suitable for this problem. Attention based ANNs are an amalgamation of accuracy
and efficiency, the crux of our work. The accuracy achieved by our model is
around 96.75\%. Our model runs the test on Android Package Files (APKs) to
determine whether a particular application is malicious or not by doing
behavior analysis on android application under consideration.

Title: Defense against Lion Attack in Cognitive Radio Systems using the Markov

\\
  Cognitive Radio (CR) technology is a solution to solve the lack of spectrum
by allowing the secondary user to use licensed bands. There are several
potential security challenges for cognitive radio like Jamming, PUE and Lion
attack. Lion attack is multi layer attacks that has effected on two layers. The
Lion attack uses PUE or jamming attack in physical layer to disrupt TCP
protocol in transport layer. Since transport layer is unaware of physical layer
situation, when it occurs to an unacknowledged packet, there is no way to
distinguish between congestion and disconnection in the physical layer. So the
windows size of TCP would be decrease because of a wrong decision caused by
unawareness. To Mitigate the Lion attack the cross layer design is usually used
to freeze its windows size during frequency handoff. The main issue in this
solution is finding the best strategy for freezing. In this paper, we propose a
dynamic method for freezing and performing frequency handoff to counter Lion
attack. Also a learning model based on Markov decision process (MDP) is
applied. By using the proposed method, the secondary user can choose an optimal
strategy in both physical and transport layers to reduce the effect of Lion
attack.

  IEEE 802.22 standard utilizes cognitive radio (CR) techniques to allow
sharing unused spectrum band. The cognitive radio is vulnerable to various
attacks such as jamming attacks. This paper has focused on coordinated jamming
attacks. A simple strategy for secondary users is to change their bands and
switch to other appropriate bands when the jamming attack is occurred. Also,
the malicious users should switch to other bands in order to jam the secondary
users. To address this problem, a game theoretical method is proposed to
analyze coordinated jamming attacks in CR. Then, using Nash equilibrium on the
proposed game, the most appropriate bands have been found to switch as well as
the optimal switching probabilities for both secondary and malicious users.
Meanwhile, effects of different parameters like the number of malicious users
are investigated in changing the optimal switching probabilities by analysis on
the model.

  With the advancement of communication, the spectrum shortage problem becomes
a serious problem for future generations. The cognitive radio technology is
proposed to address this concern. In cognitive radio networks, the secondary
users can access spectrum that allocated to the primary users without
interference to the operation of primary users. Using cognitive radio network
raises security issues such as jamming attack. A straightforward strategy to
counter the jamming attack is to switch other bands. Finding the best strategy
for switching is complicated when the malicious user is unknown to the primary
users. This paper uses fictitious game for analysis the defense against such an
unknown jammer.

Title: Securing Cluster-heads in Wireless Sensor Networks by a Hybrid Intrusion
  Detection System Based on Data Mining
Authors: Mohammadreza Darabi
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 19 pages
\\
  Cluster-based Wireless Sensor Network (CWSN) is a kind of WSNs that because
of avoiding long distance communications, preserve the energy of nodes and so
is attractive for related applications. The criticality of most applications of
WSNs and also their unattended nature, makes sensor nodes often susceptible to
many types of attacks. Based on this fact, it is clear that cluster heads (CHs)
are the most attacked targets by attackers, and also according to their
critical operations in CWSNs, their compromise and control by an attacker will
disrupt the entire cluster and sometimes the entire network, so their security
needs more attentiveness and must be ensured. In this paper, we introduce a
hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) for securing CHs, to take advantages
of both anomaly-based and misuse-based detection methods, that is high
detection and low false alarm rate. Also by using a novel preprocessing model,
significantly reduces the computational and memory complexities of the proposed
IDS, and finally allows the use of the clustering algorithms for it. The
simulation results show that the proposed IDS in comparison to existing works,
which often have high computational and memory complexities, can be as an
effective and lightweight IDS for securing CHs.

Title: Performance Analysis of TLS for Quantum Robust Cryptography on a
  Constrained Device
Authors: Jon Barton, William J Buchanan, Will Abramson, Nikolaos Pitropakis
Categories: cs.CR cs.ET
\\
  Advances in quantum computing make Shor's algorithm for factorising numbers
ever more tractable. This threatens the security of any cryptographic system
which often relies on the difficulty of factorisation. It also threatens
methods based on discrete logarithms, such as with the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange method. For a cryptographic system to remain secure against a quantum
adversary, we need to build methods based on a hard mathematical problem, which
are not susceptible to Shor's algorithm and which create Post Quantum
Cryptography (PQC). While high-powered computing devices may be able to run
these new methods, we need to investigate how well these methods run on limited
powered devices. This paper outlines an evaluation framework for PQC within
constrained devices, and contributes to the area by providing benchmarks of the
front-running algorithms on a popular single-board low-power device.

Title: Focusing and Diffusion: Bidirectional Attentive Graph Convolutional
  Networks for Skeleton-based Action Recognition
Authors: Jialin Gao, Tong He, Xi Zhou, Shiming Ge
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  A collection of approaches based on graph convolutional networks have proven
success in skeleton-based action recognition by exploring neighborhood
information and dense dependencies between intra-frame joints. However, these
approaches usually ignore the spatial-temporal global context as well as the
local relation between inter-frame and intra-frame. In this paper, we propose a
focusing and diffusion mechanism to enhance graph convolutional networks by
paying attention to the kinematic dependence of articulated human pose in a
frame and their implicit dependencies over frames. In the focusing process, we
introduce an attention module to learn a latent node over the intra-frame
joints to convey spatial contextual information. In this way, the sparse
connections between joints in a frame can be well captured, while the global
context over the entire sequence is further captured by these hidden nodes with
a bidirectional LSTM. In the diffusing process, the learned spatial-temporal
contextual information is passed back to the spatial joints, leading to a
bidirectional attentive graph convolutional network (BAGCN) that can facilitate
skeleton-based action recognition. Extensive experiments on the challenging NTU
RGB+D and Skeleton-Kinetics benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach.

Title: Barycenters of Natural Images -- Constrained Wasserstein Barycenters for
  Image Morphing
Authors: Dror Simon and Aviad Aberdam
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Image interpolation, or image morphing, refers to a visual transition between
two (or more) input images. For such a transition to look visually appealing,
its desirable properties are (i) to be smooth; (ii) to apply the minimal
required change in the image; and (iii) to seem "real", avoiding unnatural
artifacts in each image in the transition. To obtain a smooth and
straightforward transition, one may adopt the well-known Wasserstein Barycenter
Problem (WBP). While this approach guarantees minimal changes under the
Wasserstein metric, the resulting images might seem unnatural. In this work, we
propose a novel approach for image morphing that possesses all three desired
properties. To this end, we define a constrained variant of the WBP that
enforces the intermediate images to satisfy an image prior. We describe an
algorithm that solves this problem and demonstrate it using the sparse prior
and generative adversarial networks.

Title: Boundary Cues for 3D Object Shape Recovery
Authors: Kevin Karsch, Zicheng Liao, Jason Rock, Jonathan T. Barron, Derek

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Early work in computer vision considered a host of geometric cues for both
shape reconstruction and recognition. However, since then, the vision community
has focused heavily on shading cues for reconstruction, and moved towards
data-driven approaches for recognition. In this paper, we reconsider these
perhaps overlooked "boundary" cues (such as self occlusions and folds in a
surface), as well as many other established constraints for shape
reconstruction. In a variety of user studies and quantitative tasks, we
evaluate how well these cues inform shape reconstruction (relative to each
other) in terms of both shape quality and shape recognition. Our findings
suggest many new directions for future research in shape reconstruction, such
as automatic boundary cue detection and relaxing assumptions in shape from
shading (e.g. orthographic projection, Lambertian surfaces).

Title: SketchTransfer: A Challenging New Task for Exploring Detail-Invariance
  and the Abstractions Learned by Deep Networks
Authors: Alex Lamb, Sherjil Ozair, Vikas Verma, David Ha
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted WACV 2020
\\
  Deep networks have achieved excellent results in perceptual tasks, yet their
ability to generalize to variations not seen during training has come under
increasing scrutiny. In this work we focus on their ability to have invariance
towards the presence or absence of details. For example, humans are able to
watch cartoons, which are missing many visual details, without being explicitly
trained to do so. As another example, 3D rendering software is a relatively
recent development, yet people are able to understand such rendered scenes even
though they are missing details (consider a film like Toy Story). The failure
of machine learning algorithms to do this indicates a significant gap in
generalization between human abilities and the abilities of deep networks. We
propose a dataset that will make it easier to study the detail-invariance
problem concretely. We produce a concrete task for this: SketchTransfer, and we
show that state-of-the-art domain transfer algorithms still struggle with this
task. The state-of-the-art technique which achieves over 95\% on MNIST
$\xrightarrow{}$ SVHN transfer only achieves 59\% accuracy on the
SketchTransfer task, which is much better than random (11\% accuracy) but falls
short of the 87\% accuracy of a classifier trained directly on labeled
sketches. This indicates that this task is approachable with today's best
methods but has substantial room for improvement.

Title: InSphereNet: a Concise Representation and Classification Method for 3D
  Object
Authors: Hui Cao, Haikuan Du, Siyu Zhang, and Shen Cai
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we present an InSphereNet method for the problem of 3D object
classification. Unlike previous methods that use points, voxels, or multi-view
images as inputs of deep neural network (DNN), the proposed method constructs a
class of more representative features named infilling spheres from signed
distance field (SDF). Because of the admirable spatial representation of
infilling spheres, we can not only utilize very fewer number of spheres to
accomplish classification task, but also design a lightweight InSphereNet with
less layers and parameters than previous methods. Experiments on ModelNet40
show that the proposed method leads to superior performance than PointNet in
accuracy. In particular, if there are only a few dozen sphere inputs or about
100000 DNN parameters, the accuracy of our method remains at a very high level.

Title: Concise and Effective Network for 3D Human Modeling from Orthogonal
  Silhouettes
Authors: Bin Liu, Xiuping Liu, Zhixin Yang, Charlie C.L. Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.GR eess.IV
\\
  In this paper, we revisit the problem of 3D human modeling from two
orthogonal silhouettes of individuals (i.e., front and side views). Different
from our prior work, a supervised learning approach based on
\textit{convolutional neural network} (CNN) is investigated to solve the
problem by establishing a mapping function that can effectively extract
features from two silhouettes and fuse them into coefficients in the shape
space of human bodies. A new CNN structure is proposed in our work to exact not
only the discriminative features of front and side views and also their mixed
features for the mapping function. 3D human models with high accuracy are
synthesized from coefficients generated by the mapping function. Existing CNN
approaches for 3D human modeling usually learn a large number of parameters
(from 8M to 350M) from two binary images. Differently, we investigate a new
network architecture and conduct the samples on silhouettes as input. As a
consequence, more accurate models can be generated by our network with only
2.5M coefficients. The training of our network is conducted on samples obtained
by augmenting a publicly accessible dataset. Learning transfer by using
datasets with a smaller number of scanned models is applied to our network to
enable the function of generating results with gender-oriented (or
geographical) patterns.

  Towards automated retinal screening, this paper makes an endeavor to
simultaneously achieve pixel-level retinal lesion segmentation and image-level
disease classification. Such a multi-task approach is crucial for accurate and
clinically interpretable disease diagnosis. Prior art is insufficient due to
three challenges, that is, lesions lacking objective boundaries, clinical
importance of lesions irrelevant to their size, and the lack of one-to-one
correspondence between lesion and disease classes. This paper attacks the three
challenges in the context of diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading. We propose
L-Net, a new variant of fully convolutional networks, with its expansive path
re-designed to tackle the first challenge. A dual loss that leverages both
semantic segmentation and image classification losses is devised to resolve the
second challenge. We propose Side-Attention Net (SiAN) as our multi-task
framework. Harnessing L-Net as a side-attention branch, SiAN simultaneously
improves DR grading and interprets the decision with lesion maps. A set of 12K
fundus images is manually segmented by 45 ophthalmologists for 8 DR-related
lesions, resulting in 290K manual segments in total. Extensive experiments on
this large-scale dataset show that our proposed approach surpasses the prior
art for multiple tasks including lesion segmentation, lesion classification and
DR grading.

\\
  Person re-identification has attracted many researchers' attention for its
wide application, but it is still a very challenging task because only part of
the image information can be used for personnel matching. Most of current
methods uses CNN to learn to embeddings that can capture semantic similarity
information among data points. Many of the state-of-the-arts methods use
complex network structures with multiple branches that fuse multiple features
while training or testing, using classification loss, Triplet loss or a
combination of the two as loss function. However, the method that using Triplet
loss as loss function converges slowly, and the method in which pull features
of the same class as close as possible in features space leads to poor feature
stability. This paper will combine the ranking motivated structured loss,
proposed a new metric learning loss function that make the features of the same
class are sparsely distributed into the range of small hyperspheres and the
features of different classes are uniformly distributed at a clearly angle. And
adopted a new single-branch network structure that only using global feature
can also get great performance. The validity of our method is verified on the
Market1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID person re-identification datasets. Finally
acquires 90.9% rank-1 accuracy and 80.8% mAP on DukeMTMC-reID, 95.3% rank-1

  The development of deep convolutional neural network architecture is critical
to the improvement of image classification task performance. Many image
classification studies use deep convolutional neural network and focus on
modifying the network structure to improve image classification performance.
Conversely, our study focuses on loss function design. Cross-entropy Loss (CEL)
has been widely used for training deep convolutional neural network for the
task of multi-class classification. Although CEL has been successfully
implemented in several image classification tasks, it only focuses on the
posterior probability of the correct class. For this reason, a negative log
likelihood ratio loss (NLLR) was proposed to better differentiate between the
correct class and the competing incorrect ones. However, during the training of
the deep convolutional neural network, the value of NLLR is not always positive
or negative, which severely affects the convergence of NLLR. Our proposed
competing ratio loss (CRL) calculates the posterior probability ratio between
the correct class and the competing incorrect classes to further enlarge the
probability difference between the correct and incorrect classes. We added
hyperparameters to CRL, thereby ensuring its value to be positive and that the
update size of backpropagation is suitable for the CRL's fast convergence. To
demonstrate the performance of CRL, we conducted experiments on general image
classification tasks (CIFAR10/100, SVHN, ImageNet), the fine-grained image
classification tasks (CUB200-2011 and Stanford Car), and the challenging face
age estimation task (using Adience). Experimental results show the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed loss function on different deep
convolutional neural network architectures and different image classification
tasks.

Title: Improving Visual Recognition using Ambient Sound for Supervision
Authors: Rohan Mahadev and Hongyu Lu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Our brains combine vision and hearing to create a more elaborate
interpretation of the world. When the visual input is insufficient, a rich
panoply of sounds can be used to describe our surroundings. Since more than
1,000 hours of videos are uploaded to the internet everyday, it is arduous, if
not impossible, to manually annotate these videos. Therefore, incorporating
audio along with visual data without annotations is crucial for leveraging this
explosion of data for recognizing and understanding objects and scenes.
Owens,et.al suggest that a rich representation of the physical world can be
learned by using a convolutional neural network to predict sound textures
associated with a given video frame. We attempt to reproduce the claims from
their experiments, of which the code is not publicly available. In addition, we
propose improvements in the pretext task that result in better performance in
other downstream computer vision tasks.

\\
  Unpaired image-to-image translation problem aims to model the mapping from
one domain to another with unpaired training data. Current works like the
well-acknowledged Cycle GAN provide a general solution for any two domains
through modeling injective mappings with a symmetric structure. While in
situations where two domains are asymmetric in complexity, i.e., the amount of
information between two domains is different, these approaches pose problems of
poor generation quality, mapping ambiguity, and model sensitivity. To address
these issues, we propose Asymmetric GAN (AsymGAN) to adapt the asymmetric
domains by introducing an auxiliary variable (aux) to learn the extra
information for transferring from the information-poor domain to the
information-rich domain, which improves the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the following ways. First, aux better balances the information
between two domains which benefits the quality of generation. Second, the
imbalance of information commonly leads to mapping ambiguity, where we are able
to model one-to-many mappings by tuning aux, and furthermore, our aux is
controllable. Third, the training of Cycle GAN can easily make the generator
pair sensitive to small disturbances and variations while our model decouples
the ill-conditioned relevance of generators by injecting aux during training.
We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method both qualitatively and
quantitatively on asymmetric situation, label-photo task, on Cityscapes and
Helen datasets, and show many applications of asymmetric image translations. In
conclusion, our AsymGAN provides a better solution for unpaired image-to-image
translation in asymmetric domains.

\\
  Behaviour prediction function of an autonomous vehicle predicts the future
states of the nearby vehicles based on the current and past observations of the
surrounding environment. This helps enhance their awareness of the imminent
hazards. However, conventional behaviour prediction solutions are applicable in
simple driving scenarios that require short prediction horizons. Most recently,
deep learning-based approaches have become popular due to their superior
performance in more complex environments compared to the conventional
approaches. Motivated by this increased popularity, we provide a comprehensive
review of the state-of-the-art of deep learning-based approaches for vehicle
behaviour prediction in this paper. We firstly give an overview of the generic
problem of vehicle behaviour prediction and discuss its challenges, followed by
classification and review of the most recent deep learning-based solutions
based on three criteria: input representation, output type, and prediction
method. The paper also discusses the performance of several well-known
solutions, identifies the research gaps in the literature and outlines
potential new research directions.

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  We propose a novel approach for image segmentation that combines Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the Level Set method. Our approach
parametrizes the evolution of an initial contour with a NODE that implicitly
learns from data a speed function describing the evolution. In addition, for
cases where an initial contour is not available and to alleviate the need for
careful choice or design of contour embedding functions, we propose a
NODE-based method that evolves an image embedding into a dense per-pixel
semantic label space. We evaluate our methods on kidney segmentation (KiTS19)
and on salient object detection (PASCAL-S, ECSSD and HKU-IS). In addition to
improving initial contours provided by deep learning models while using a
fraction of their number of parameters, our approach achieves F scores that are
higher than several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms.

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  A crucial aspect of mobile intelligent agents is their ability to integrate
the evidence from multiple sensory inputs in an environment and plan a sequence
of actions to achieve their goals. In this paper, we attempt to address the
problem of Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation, the task of planning the shortest
path from a random starting location in a scene to the sound source in an
indoor environment, given only raw egocentric visual and audio sensory data. To
accomplish this task, the agent is required to learn from various modalities,
i.e. relating the audio signal to the visual environment. Here we describe an
approach to the audio-visual embodied navigation that can take advantage of
both visual and audio pieces of evidence. Our solution is based on three key
ideas: a visual perception mapper module that can construct its spatial memory
of the environment, a sound perception module that infers the relative location
of the sound source from the agent, and a dynamic path planner that plans a
sequence of actions based on the visual-audio observations and the spatial
memory of the environment, and then navigates towards the goal. Experimental
results on a newly collected Visual-Audio-Room dataset using the simulated
multi-modal environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over
several competitive baselines.

Title: Multi-Modal Attention-based Fusion Model for Semantic Segmentation of
  RGB-Depth Images
Authors: Fahimeh Fooladgar and Shohreh Kasaei
Categories: cs.CV cs.MM
\\
  The 3D scene understanding is mainly considered as a crucial requirement in
computer vision and robotics applications. One of the high-level tasks in 3D
scene understanding is semantic segmentation of RGB-Depth images. With the
availability of RGB-D cameras, it is desired to improve the accuracy of the
scene understanding process by exploiting the depth features along with the
appearance features. As depth images are independent of illumination, they can
improve the quality of semantic labeling alongside RGB images. Consideration of
both common and specific features of these two modalities improves the
performance of semantic segmentation. One of the main problems in RGB-Depth
semantic segmentation is how to fuse or combine these two modalities to achieve
more advantages of each modality while being computationally efficient.
Recently, the methods that encounter deep convolutional neural networks have
reached the state-of-the-art results by early, late, and middle fusion
strategies. In this paper, an efficient encoder-decoder model with the
attention-based fusion block is proposed to integrate mutual influences between
feature maps of these two modalities. This block explicitly extracts the
interdependences among concatenated feature maps of these modalities to exploit
more powerful feature maps from RGB-Depth images. The extensive experimental
results on three main challenging datasets of NYU-V2, SUN RGB-D, and Stanford
2D-3D-Semantic show that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art
models with respect to computational cost as well as model size. Experimental
results also illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight
attention-based fusion model in terms of accuracy.

approach that is suitable for small-overlapping or non-overlapping scans and
can output multiple relative poses. Our method performs scene completion and
matches the completed scans. However, instead of using a fixed representation
for completion, the key idea is to utilize hybrid representations that combine
360-image, 2D image-based layout, and planar patches. This approach offers
adaptively feature representations for relative pose estimation. Besides, we
introduce a global-2-local matching procedure, which utilizes initial relative
poses obtained during the global phase to detect and then integrate geometric
relations for pose refinement. Experimental results justify the potential of
this approach across a wide range of benchmark datasets. For example, on
ScanNet, the rotation translation errors of the top-1/top-5 predictions of our
approach are 34.9/0.69m and 19.6/0.57m, respectively. Our approach also
considerably boosts the performance of multi-scan reconstruction in few-view
reconstruction settings.

Title: Controllable and Progressive Image Extrapolation
Authors: Yijun Li, Lu Jiang, Ming-Hsuan Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Image extrapolation aims at expanding the narrow field of view of a given
image patch. Existing models mainly deal with natural scene images of
homogeneous regions and have no control of the content generation process. In
this work, we study conditional image extrapolation to synthesize new images
guided by the input structured text. The text is represented as a graph to
specify the objects and their spatial relation to the unknown regions of the
image. Inspired by drawing techniques, we propose a progressive generative
model of three stages, i.e., generating a coarse bounding-boxes layout,
refining it to a finer segmentation layout, and mapping the layout to a
realistic output. Such a multi-stage design is shown to facilitate the training
process and generate more controllable results. We validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method on the face and human clothing dataset in terms of
visual results, quantitative evaluations and flexible controls.

Title: Planar Prior Assisted PatchMatch Multi-View Stereo
Authors: Qingshan Xu and Wenbing Tao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by AAAI-2020
\\
  The completeness of 3D models is still a challenging problem in multi-view
stereo (MVS) due to the unreliable photometric consistency in low-textured
areas. Since low-textured areas usually exhibit strong planarity, planar models
are advantageous to the depth estimation of low-textured areas. On the other
hand, PatchMatch multi-view stereo is very efficient for its sampling and
propagation scheme. By taking advantage of planar models and PatchMatch
multi-view stereo, we propose a planar prior assisted PatchMatch multi-view
stereo framework in this paper. In detail, we utilize a probabilistic graphical
model to embed planar models into PatchMatch multi-view stereo and contribute a
novel multi-view aggregated matching cost. This novel cost takes both
photometric consistency and planar compatibility into consideration, making it
suited for the depth estimation of both non-planar and planar regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can efficiently recover the
depth information of extremely low-textured areas, thus obtaining high complete
3D models and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Learning Inverse Depth Regression for Multi-View Stereo with Correlation
  Cost Volume
Authors: Qingshan Xu and Wenbing Tao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by AAAI-2020
\\
  Deep learning has shown to be effective for depth inference in multi-view
stereo (MVS). However, the scalability and accuracy still remain an open
problem in this domain. This can be attributed to the memory-consuming cost
volume representation and inappropriate depth inference. Inspired by the
group-wise correlation in stereo matching, we propose an average group-wise
correlation similarity measure to construct a lightweight cost volume. This can
not only reduce the memory consumption but also reduce the computational burden
in the cost volume filtering. Based on our effective cost volume
representation, we propose a cascade 3D U-Net module to regularize the cost
volume to further boost the performance. Unlike the previous methods that treat
multi-view depth inference as a depth regression problem or an inverse depth
classification problem, we recast multi-view depth inference as an inverse
depth regression task. This allows our network to achieve sub-pixel estimation
and be applicable to large-scale scenes. Through extensive experiments on DTU
dataset and Tanks and Temples dataset, we show that our proposed network with
Correlation cost volume and Inverse DEpth Regression (CIDER), achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its superior performance on scalability
and accuracy.

Title: SESS: Self-Ensembling Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection
Authors: Na Zhao, Tat-Seng Chua, Gim Hee Lee
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The performance of existing point cloud-based 3D object detection methods
heavily relies on large-scale high-quality 3D annotations. However, such
annotations are often tedious and expensive to collect. Semi-supervised
learning is a good alternative to mitigate the data annotation issue, but has
remained largely unexplored in 3D object detection. Inspired by the recent
success of self-ensembling technique in semi-supervised image classification
task, we propose SESS, a self-ensembling semi-supervised 3D object detection
framework. Specifically, we design a thorough perturbation scheme to enhance
generalization of the network on unlabeled and new unseen data. Furthermore, we
propose three consistency losses to enforce the consistency between two sets of
predicted 3D object proposals, to facilitate the learning of structure and
semantic invariances of objects. Extensive experiments conducted on SUN RGB-D
and ScanNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SESS in both inductive
and transductive semi-supervised 3D object detection. Our SESS achieves
competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art fully-supervised
method by using only 50% labeled data.

Title: An Ensemble Rate Adaptation Framework for Dynamic Adaptive Streaming
  Over HTTP
Authors: Hui Yuan, Xiaoqian Hu, Junhui Hou, Xuekai Wei, and Sam Kwong

Comments: This article has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting
\\
  Rate adaptation is one of the most important issues in dynamic adaptive
streaming over HTTP (DASH). Due to the frequent fluctuations of the network
bandwidth and complex variations of video content, it is difficult to deal with
the varying network conditions and video content perfectly by using a single
rate adaptation method. In this paper, we propose an ensemble rate adaptation
framework for DASH, which aims to leverage the advantages of multiple methods
involved in the framework to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of users.
The proposed framework is simple yet very effective. Specifically, the proposed
framework is composed of two modules, i.e., the method pool and method
controller. In the method pool, several rate adap tation methods are
integrated. At each decision time, only the method that can achieve the best
QoE is chosen to determine the bitrate of the requested video segment. Besides,
we also propose two strategies for switching methods, i.e., InstAnt Method
Switching, and InterMittent Method Switching, for the method controller to
determine which method can provide the best QoEs. Simulation results
demonstrate that, the proposed framework always achieves the highest QoE for
the change of channel environment and video complexity, compared with
state-of-the-art rate adaptation methods.

Title: History-based Anomaly Detector: an Adversarial Approach to Anomaly
  Detection
Authors: Pierrick Chatillon and Coloma Ballester
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Anomaly detection is a difficult problem in many areas and has recently been
subject to a lot of attention. Classifying unseen data as anomalous is a
challenging matter. Latest proposed methods rely on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) to estimate the normal data distribution, and produce an
anomaly score prediction for any given data. In this article, we propose a
simple yet new adversarial method to tackle this problem, denoted as
History-based anomaly detector (HistoryAD). It consists of a self-supervised
model, trained to recognize 'normal' samples by comparing them to samples based
on the training history of a previously trained GAN. Quantitative and
qualitative results are presented evaluating its performance. We also present a
comparison to several state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection showing
that our proposal achieves top-tier results on several datasets.

Title: Efficient Video Semantic Segmentation with Labels Propagation and
  Refinement
Authors: Matthieu Paul, Christoph Mayer, Luc Van Gool, Radu Timofte
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at WACV2020
\\
  This paper tackles the problem of real-time semantic segmentation of high
definition videos using a hybrid GPU / CPU approach. We propose an Efficient
Video Segmentation(EVS) pipeline that combines:
  (i) On the CPU, a very fast optical flow method, that is used to exploit the
temporal aspect of the video and propagate semantic information from one frame
to the next. It runs in parallel with the GPU.
  (ii) On the GPU, two Convolutional Neural Networks: A main segmentation
network that is used to predict dense semantic labels from scratch, and a
Refiner that is designed to improve predictions from previous frames with the
help of a fast Inconsistencies Attention Module (IAM). The latter can identify
regions that cannot be propagated accurately.
  We suggest several operating points depending on the desired frame rate and
accuracy. Our pipeline achieves accuracy levels competitive to the existing
real-time methods for semantic image segmentation(mIoU above 60%), while
achieving much higher frame rates. On the popular Cityscapes dataset with high
resolution frames (2048 x 1024), the proposed operating points range from 80 to
1000 Hz on a single GPU and CPU.

Comments: Code is available at https://github.com/amirmk89/gepc
\\
  We propose a new method for anomaly detection of human actions. Our method
works directly on human pose graphs that can be computed from an input video
sequence. This makes the analysis independent of nuisance parameters such as
viewpoint or illumination. We map these graphs to a latent space and cluster
them. Each action is then represented by its soft-assignment to each of the
clusters. This gives a kind of "bag of words" representation to the data, where
every action is represented by its similarity to a group of base action-words.
Then, we use a Dirichlet process based mixture, that is useful for handling
proportional data such as our soft-assignment vectors, to determine if an
action is normal or not.
  We evaluate our method on two types of data sets. The first is a fine-grained
anomaly detection data set (e.g. ShanghaiTech) where we wish to detect unusual
variations of some action. The second is a coarse-grained anomaly detection
data set (e.g.,\ a Kinetics-based data set) where few actions are considered
normal, and every other action should be considered abnormal.
  Extensive experiments on the benchmarks show that our method performs
considerably better than other state of the art methods.

  Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which becomes
one of the most important research problems in the development of deep

significance to perform correct and complete evaluations of the adversarial
attack and defense algorithms. In this paper, we establish a comprehensive,
rigorous, and coherent benchmark to evaluate adversarial robustness on image
classification tasks. After briefly reviewing plenty of representative attack
and defense methods, we perform large-scale experiments with two robustness
curves as the fair-minded evaluation criteria to fully understand the
performance of these methods. Based on the evaluation results, we draw several
important findings and provide insights for future research.

Title: Domain Adaptation Regularization for Spectral Pruning
Authors: Laurent Dillard, Yosuke Shinya, Taiji Suzuki
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art
performance on a variety of computer vision related tasks. However, their
computational cost limits their ability to be implemented in embedded systems
with restricted resources or strict latency constraints. Model compression has
therefore been an active field of research to overcome this issue. On the other
hand, DNNs typically require massive amounts of labeled data to be trained.
This represents a second limitation to their deployment. Domain Adaptation (DA)
addresses this issue by allowing to transfer knowledge learned on one labeled
source distribution to a target distribution, possibly unlabeled. In this
paper, we investigate on possible improvements of compression methods in DA
setting. We focus on a compression method that was previously developed in the
context of a single data distribution and show that, with a careful choice of
data to use during compression and additional regularization terms directly
related to DA objectives, it is possible to improve compression results. We
also show that our method outperforms an existing compression method studied in
the DA setting by a large margin for high compression rates. Although our work
is based on one specific compression method, we also outline some general
guidelines for improving compression in DA setting.

  spatial blurs -- Application to high dimensional infrared astronomical
  imaging
Authors: Claire Guilloteau, Thomas Oberlin, Olivier Bern\'e and Nicolas
  Dobigeon
Categories: cs.CV astro-ph.IM eess.IV
\\
  Hyperspectral imaging has become a significant source of valuable data for
astronomers over the past decades. Current instrumental and observing time
constraints allow direct acquisition of multispectral images, with high spatial
but low spectral resolution, and hyperspectral images, with low spatial but
high spectral resolution. To enhance scientific interpretation of the data, we
propose a data fusion method which combines the benefits of each image to
recover a high spatio-spectral resolution datacube. The proposed inverse
problem accounts for the specificities of astronomical instruments, such as
spectrally variant blurs. We provide a fast implementation by solving the
problem in the frequency domain and in a low-dimensional subspace to
efficiently handle the convolution operators as well as the high dimensionality
of the data. We conduct experiments on a realistic synthetic dataset of
simulated observation of the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, and we show
that our fusion algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods commonly used in
remote sensing for Earth observation.

Title: Vision and Language: from Visual Perception to Content Creation
Authors: Tao Mei, Wei Zhang, Ting Yao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Vision and language are two fundamental capabilities of human intelligence.
Humans routinely perform tasks through the interactions between vision and
language, supporting the uniquely human capacity to talk about what they see or
hallucinate a picture on a natural-language description. The valid question of
how language interacts with vision motivates us researchers to expand the
horizons of computer vision area. In particular, "vision to language" is
probably one of the most popular topics in the past five years, with a
significant growth in both volume of publications and extensive applications,
e.g., captioning, visual question answering, visual dialog, language
navigation, etc. Such tasks boost visual perception with more comprehensive
understanding and diverse linguistic representations. Going beyond the
progresses made in "vision to language," language can also contribute to vision
understanding and offer new possibilities of visual content creation, i.e.,
"language to vision." The process performs as a prism through which to create
visual content conditioning on the language inputs. This paper reviews the
recent advances along these two dimensions: "vision to language" and "language
to vision." More concretely, the former mainly focuses on the development of
image/video captioning, as well as typical encoder-decoder structures and
benchmarks, while the latter summarizes the technologies of visual content
creation. The real-world deployment or services of vision and language are
elaborated as well.

Title: W-PoseNet: Dense Correspondence Regularized Pixel Pair Pose Regression
Authors: Zelin Xu, Ke Chen and Kui Jia
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Solving 6D pose estimation is non-trivial to cope with intrinsic appearance
and shape variation and severe inter-object occlusion, and is made more
challenging in light of extrinsic large illumination changes and low quality of
the acquired data under an uncontrolled environment. This paper introduces a
novel pose estimation algorithm W-PoseNet, which densely regresses from input
data to 6D pose and also 3D coordinates in model space. In other words, local
features learned for pose regression in our deep network are regularized by
explicitly learning pixel-wise correspondence mapping onto 3D pose-sensitive
coordinates as an auxiliary task. Moreover, a sparse pair combination of
pixel-wise features and soft voting on pixel-pair pose predictions are designed
to improve robustness to inconsistent and sparse local features. Experiment
results on the popular YCB-Video and LineMOD benchmarks show that the proposed
W-PoseNet consistently achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art
algorithms.

  In this paper we propose an end-to-end swift 3D feature reductionist
framework (3DFR) for scene independent change detection. The 3DFR framework
consists of three feature streams: a swift 3D feature reductionist stream
(AvFeat), a contemporary feature stream (ConFeat) and a temporal median feature
map. These multilateral foreground/background features are further refined
through an encoder-decoder network. As a result, the proposed framework not
only detects temporal changes but also learns high-level appearance features.
Thus, it incorporates the object semantics for effective change detection.
Furthermore, the proposed framework is validated through a scene independent
evaluation scheme in order to demonstrate the robustness and generalization
capability of the network. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated
on the benchmark CDnet 2014 dataset. The experimental results show that the
proposed 3DFR network outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: A simple baseline for domain adaptation using rotation prediction

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recently, domain adaptation has become a hot research area with lots of
applications. The goal is to adapt a model trained in one domain to another
domain with scarce annotated data. We propose a simple yet effective method
based on self-supervised learning that outperforms or is on par with most
state-of-the-art algorithms, e.g. adversarial domain adaptation. Our method
involves two phases: predicting random rotations (self-supervised) on the
target domain along with correct labels for the source domain (supervised), and
then using self-distillation on the target domain. Our simple method achieves
state-of-the-art results on semi-supervised domain adaptation on DomainNet
dataset.
  Further, we observe that the unlabeled target datasets of popular domain
adaptation benchmarks do not contain any categories apart from testing
categories. We believe this introduces a bias that does not exist in many real
applications. We show that removing this bias from the unlabeled data results
in a large drop in performance of state-of-the-art methods, while our simple
method is relatively robust.

\\
  This paper addresses the task of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects from a single depth image. We present a novel
category-level approach that correctly accommodates object instances not
previously seen during training. A key aspect of the work is the new
Articulation-Aware Normalized Coordinate Space Hierarchy (A-NCSH), which
represents the different articulated objects for a given object category. This
approach not only provides the canonical representation of each rigid part, but
also normalizes the joint parameters and joint states. We developed a deep
network based on PointNet++ that is capable of predicting an A-NCSH
representation for unseen object instances from single depth input. The
predicted A-NCSH representation is then used for global pose optimization using
kinematic constraints. We demonstrate that constraints associated with joints
in the kinematic chain lead to improved performance in estimating pose and
relative scale for each part of the object. We also demonstrate that the
approach can tolerate cases of severe occlusion in the observed data. Project

Title: Apricot variety classification using image processing and machine

Authors: Seyed Vahid Mirnezami, Ali HamidiSepehr and Mahdi Ghaebi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Apricot which is a cultivated type of Zerdali (wild apricot) has an important
place in human nutrition and its medical properties are essential for human
health. The objective of this research was to obtain a model for apricot mass
and separate apricot variety with image processing technology using external
features of apricot fruit. In this study, five verities of apricot were used.
In order to determine the size of the fruits, three mutually perpendicular axes
were defined, length, width, and thickness. Measurements show that the effect
of variety on all properties was statistically significant at the 1%
probability level. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between the
estimated dimensions by image processing approach and the actual dimensions.
The developed system consists of a digital camera, a light diffusion chamber, a
distance adjustment pedestal, and a personal computer. Images taken by the
digital camera were stored as (RGB) for further analysis. The images were taken
for a number of 49 samples of each cultivar in three directions. A linear
equation is recommended to calculate the apricot mass based on the length and
the width with R 2 = 0.97. In addition, ANFIS model with C-means was the best
model for classifying the apricot varieties based on the physical features
including length, width, thickness, mass, and projected area of three
perpendicular surfaces. The accuracy of the model was 87.7.

  Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) has demonstrated to be an
emerging and promising multimedia streaming technique, owing to its capability
of dealing with the variability of networks. Rate adaptation mechanism, a
challenging and open issue, plays an important role in DASH based systems since
it affects Quality of Experience (QoE) of users, network utilization, etc. In
this paper, based on non-cooperative game theory, we propose a novel algorithm
to optimally allocate the limited export bandwidth of the server to multi-users
to maximize their QoE with fairness guaranteed. The proposed algorithm is
proxy-free. Specifically, a novel user QoE model is derived by taking a variety
of factors into account, like the received video quality, the reference buffer
length, and user accumulated buffer lengths, etc. Then, the bandwidth competing
problem is formulated as a non-cooperation game with the existence of Nash
Equilibrium that is theoretically proven. Finally, a distributed iterative
algorithm with stability analysis is proposed to find the Nash Equilibrium.
Compared with state-of-the-art methods, extensive experimental results in terms
of both simulated and realistic networking scenarios demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm can produce higher QoE, and the actual buffer lengths of all
users keep nearly optimal states, i.e., moving around the reference buffer all
the time. Besides, the proposed algorithm produces no playback interruption.

Title: A single target tracking algorithm based on Generative Adversarial
  Networks
Authors: Zhaofu Diao
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  In the single target tracking field, occlusion leads to the loss of tracking
targets is a ubiquitous and arduous problem. To solve this problem, we propose
a single target tracking algorithm with anti-occlusion capability. The main
content of our algorithm is to use the Region Proposal Network to obtain the
tracked target and potential interferences, and use the occlusion awareness
module to judge whether the interfering object occludes the target. If no
occlusion occurs, continue tracking. If occlusion occurs, the prediction module
is started, and the motion trajectory of the target in subsequent frames is
predicted according to the motion trajectory before occlusion. The result
obtained by the prediction module is used to replace the target position
feature obtained by the original tracking algorithm. So we solve the problem
that the occlusion causes the tracking algorithm to lose the target. In actual
performance, our algorithm can successfully track the target in the occluded
dataset. On the VOT2018 dataset, our algorithm has an EAO of 0.421, an Accuracy
of 0.67, and a Robustness of 0.186. Compared with SiamRPN ++, they increased by
1.69%, 11.67% and 9.3%, respectively.

Title: HoMM: Higher-order Moment Matching for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

\\
  Minimizing the discrepancy of feature distributions between different domains
is one of the most promising directions in unsupervised domain adaptation. From
the perspective of distribution matching, most existing discrepancy-based
methods are designed to match the second-order or lower statistics, which
however, have limited expression of statistical characteristic for non-Gaussian
distributions. In this work, we explore the benefits of using higher-order
statistics (mainly refer to third-order and fourth-order statistics) for domain
matching. We propose a Higher-order Moment Matching (HoMM) method, and further
extend the HoMM into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). In particular,
our proposed HoMM can perform arbitrary-order moment tensor matching, we show
that the first-order HoMM is equivalent to Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and
the second-order HoMM is equivalent to Correlation Alignment (CORAL). Moreover,
the third-order and the fourth-order moment tensor matching are expected to
perform comprehensive domain alignment as higher-order statistics can
approximate more complex, non-Gaussian distributions. Besides, we also exploit
the pseudo-labeled target samples to learn discriminative representations in
the target domain, which further improves the transfer performance. Extensive
experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed HoMM consistently
outperforms the existing moment matching methods by a large margin. Codes are

Title: Spotting Macro- and Micro-expression Intervals in Long Video Sequences
Authors: Ying He, Su-Jing Wang, Jingting Li, Moi Hoon Yap
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures and 3 tables
\\
  This paper presents baseline results for the Third Facial Micro-Expression
Grand Challenge (MEGC 2020). Both macro- and micro-expression intervals in
CAS(ME)$^2$ and SAMM Long Videos are spotted by employing the method of Main
Directional Maximal Difference Analysis (MDMD). The MDMD method uses the
magnitude maximal difference in the main direction of optical flow features to
spot facial movements. The single frame prediction results of the original MDMD
method are post processed into reasonable video intervals. The metric F1-scores
of baseline results are evaluated: for CAS(ME)$^2$, the F1-scores are 0.1196
and 0.0082 for macro- and micro-expressions respectively, and the overall
F1-score is 0.0376; for SAMM Long Videos, the F1-scores are 0.0629 and 0.0364
for macro- and micro-expressions respectively, and the overall F1-score is
0.0445. The baseline project codes is publicly available at

Title: Necessary and Sufficient Polynomial Constraints on Compatible Triplets
  of Essential Matrices
Authors: E.V. Martyushev
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 11 pages, 1 figure
\\
  The essential matrix incorporates relative rotation and translation
parameters of two calibrated cameras. The well-known algebraic characterization
of essential matrices, i.e. necessary and sufficient conditions under which an
arbitrary matrix (of rank two) becomes essential, consists of a unique matrix
equation of degree three. Based on this equation, a number of efficient
algorithmic solutions to different relative pose estimation problems have been
proposed. In three views, a possible way to describe the geometry of three
calibrated cameras comes from considering compatible triplets of essential
matrices. The compatibility is meant the correspondence of a triplet to a
certain configuration of calibrated cameras. The main goal of this paper is to
give an algebraic characterization of compatible triplets of essential
matrices. Specifically, we propose necessary and sufficient polynomial
constraints on a triplet of real rank-two essential matrices that ensure its
compatibility. The constraints are given in the form of six cubic matrix
equations, one quartic and one sextic scalar equations. An important advantage
of the proposed constraints is their sufficiency even in the case of cameras
with collinear centers. The applications of the constraints may include
relative camera pose estimation in three and more views, averaging of essential
matrices for incremental structure from motion, multiview camera
auto-calibration, etc.

Title: An Abstraction Model for Semantic Segmentation Algorithms

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 6 pages 2 figures
\\
  Semantic segmentation is a process of classifying each pixel in the image.
Due to its advantages, sematic segmentation is used in many tasks such as
cancer detection, robot-assisted surgery, satellite image analysis,
self-driving car control, etc. In this process, accuracy and efficiency are the
two crucial goals for this purpose, and there are several state of the art
neural networks. In each method, by employing different techniques, new
solutions have been presented for increasing efficiency, accuracy, and reducing
the costs. The diversity of the implemented approaches for semantic
segmentation makes it difficult for researches to achieve a comprehensive view
of the field. To offer a comprehensive view, in this paper, an abstraction
model for the task of semantic segmentation is offered. The proposed framework
consists of four general blocks that cover the majority of majority of methods
that have been proposed for semantic segmentation. We also compare different
approaches and consider the importance of each part in the overall performance
of a method.

\\
  Point cloud learning has lately attracted increasing attention due to its
wide applications in many areas, such as computer vision, autonomous driving,
and robotics. As a dominating technique in AI, deep learning has been
successfully used to solve various 2D vision problems. However, deep learning
on point clouds is still in its infancy due to the unique challenges faced by
the processing of point clouds with deep neural networks. Recently, deep
learning on point clouds has become even thriving, with numerous methods being
proposed to address different problems in this area. To stimulate future
research, this paper presents a comprehensive review of recent progress in deep
learning methods for point clouds. It covers three major tasks, including 3D
shape classification, 3D object detection and tracking, and 3D point cloud
segmentation. It also presents comparative results on several publicly

Title: A sparsity augmented probabilistic collaborative representation based
  classification method
Authors: Xiao-Yun Cai and He-Feng Yin
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: This manuscript has been accepted for publication by Journal of
  Algorithms and Computational Technology (JACT)
\\
  In order to enhance the performance of image recognition, a sparsity
augmented probabilistic collaborative representation based classification
(SA-ProCRC) method is presented. The proposed method obtains the dense
coefficient through ProCRC, then augments the dense coefficient with a sparse
one, and the sparse coefficient is attained by the orthogonal matching pursuit
(OMP) algorithm. In contrast to conventional methods which require explicit
computation of the reconstruction residuals for each class, the proposed method
employs the augmented coefficient and the label matrix of the training samples
to classify the test sample. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
method can achieve promising results for face and scene images. The source code
of our proposed SA-ProCRC is accessible at

\\
  With the rapid progress of deep convolutional neural networks, in almost all
robotic applications, the availability of 3D point clouds improves the accuracy
of 3D semantic segmentation methods. Rendering of these irregular,
unstructured, and unordered 3D points to 2D images from multiple viewpoints
imposes some issues such as loss of information due to 3D to 2D projection,
discretizing artifacts, and high computational costs. To efficiently deal with
a large number of points and incorporate more context of each point, a
pointwise attention-based atrous convolutional neural network architecture is
proposed. It focuses on salient 3D feature points among all feature maps while
considering outstanding contextual information via spatial channel-wise
attention modules. The proposed model has been evaluated on the two most
important 3D point cloud datasets for the 3D semantic segmentation task. It
achieves a reasonable performance compared to state-of-the-art models in terms
of accuracy, with a much smaller number of parameters.

Title: One Point, One Object: Simultaneous 3D Object Segmentation and 6-DOF
  Pose Estimation
Authors: Hongsen Liu, Yang Cong, Yandong Tang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose a single-shot method for simultaneous 3D object segmentation and
6-DOF pose estimation in pure 3D point clouds scenes based on a consensus that
\emph{one point only belongs to one object}, i.e., each point has the potential
power to predict the 6-DOF pose of its corresponding object. Unlike the
recently proposed methods of the similar task, which rely on 2D detectors to
predict the projection of 3D corners of the 3D bounding boxes and the 6-DOF
pose must be estimated by a PnP like spatial transformation method, ours is
concise enough not to require additional spatial transformation between
different dimensions. Due to the lack of training data for many objects, the
recently proposed 2D detection methods try to generate training data by using
rendering engine and achieve good results. However, rendering in 3D space along
with 6-DOF is relatively difficult. Therefore, we propose an augmented reality
technology to generate the training data in semi-virtual reality 3D space. The
key component of our method is a multi-task CNN architecture that can
simultaneously predicts the 3D object segmentation and 6-DOF pose estimation in
pure 3D point clouds.
  For experimental evaluation, we generate expanded training data for two
state-of-the-arts 3D object datasets \cite{PLCHF}\cite{TLINEMOD} by using
Augmented Reality technology (AR). We evaluate our proposed method on the two
datasets. The results show that our method can be well generalized into
multiple scenarios and provide performance comparable to or better than the
state-of-the-arts.

Title: A 3D-Deep-Learning-based Augmented Reality Calibration Method for
  Robotic Environments using Depth Sensor Data
Authors: Linh K\"astner, Vlad Catalin Frasineanu, Jens Lambrecht
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO
Comments: 7 Pages, 7 Figures
\\
  Augmented Reality and mobile robots are gaining much attention within
industries due to the high potential to make processes cost and time efficient.
To facilitate augmented reality, a calibration between the Augmented Reality
device and the environment is necessary. This is a challenge when dealing with
mobile robots due to the mobility of all entities making the environment
dynamic. On this account, we propose a novel approach to calibrate the
Augmented Reality device using 3D depth sensor data. We use the depth camera of
a cutting edge Augmented Reality Device - the Microsoft Hololens for deep
learning based calibration. Therefore, we modified a neural network based on
the recently published VoteNet architecture which works directly on the point
cloud input observed by the Hololens. We achieve satisfying results and
eliminate external tools like markers, thus enabling a more intuitive and
flexible work flow for Augmented Reality integration. The results are adaptable
to work with all depth cameras and are promising for further research.
Furthermore, we introduce an open source 3D point cloud labeling tool, which is
to our knowledge the first open source tool for labeling raw point cloud data.

Title: White Noise Analysis of Neural Networks
Authors: Ali Borji, Sikun Lin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  A white noise analysis of modern deep neural networks is presented to unveil
their biases at the whole network level or the single neuron level. Our
analysis is based on two popular and related methods in psychophysics and
neurophysiology namely classification images and spike triggered analysis.
These methods have been widely used to understand the underlying mechanisms of
sensory systems in humans and monkeys. We leverage them to investigate the
inherent biases of deep neural networks and to obtain a first-order
approximation of their functionality. We emphasize on CNNs since they are
currently the state of the art methods in computer vision and are a decent
model of human visual processing. In addition, we study multi-layer
perceptrons, logistic regression, and recurrent neural networks. Experiments
over four classic datasets, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, show
that the computed bias maps resemble the target classes and when used for
classification lead to an over twofold performance than the chance level.
Further, we show that classification images can be used to attack a black-box
classifier and to detect adversarial patch attacks. Finally, we utilize spike
triggered averaging to derive the filters of CNNs and explore how the behavior
of a network changes when neurons in different layers are modulated. Our effort
illustrates a successful example of borrowing from neurosciences to study ANNs
and highlights the importance of cross-fertilization and synergy across machine
learning, deep learning, and computational neuroscience.

\\
  Generative models have made immense progress in recent years, particularly in
their ability to generate high quality images. However, that quality has been
difficult to evaluate rigorously, with evaluation dominated by heuristic
approaches that do not correlate well with human judgment, such as the
Inception Score and Fr\'echet Inception Distance. Real human labels have also
been used in evaluation, but are inefficient and expensive to collect for each
image. Here, we present a novel method to automatically evaluate images based
on their quality as perceived by humans. By not only generating image
embeddings from Inception network activations and comparing them to the
activations for real images, of which other methods perform a variant, but also
regressing the activation statistics to match gold standard human labels, we
demonstrate 66% accuracy in predicting human scores of image realism, matching
the human inter-rater agreement rate. Our approach also generalizes across
generative models, suggesting the potential for capturing a model-agnostic
measure of image quality. We open source our dataset of human labels for the
advancement of research and techniques in this area.

Title: Bias Remediation in Driver Drowsiness Detection systems using Generative
  Adversarial Networks
Authors: Mkhuseli Ngxande, Jules-Raymond Tapamo, Michael Burke
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 9 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Datasets are crucial when training a deep neural network. When datasets are
unrepresentative, trained models are prone to bias because they are unable to
generalise to real world settings. This is particularly problematic for models
trained in specific cultural contexts, which may not represent a wide range of
races, and thus fail to generalise. This is a particular challenge for Driver
drowsiness detection, where many publicly available datasets are
unrepresentative as they cover only certain ethnicity groups. Traditional
augmentation methods are unable to improve a model's performance when tested on
other groups with different facial attributes, and it is often challenging to
build new, more representative datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel
framework that boosts the performance of detection of drowsiness for different
ethnicity groups. Our framework improves Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
trained for prediction by using Generative Adversarial networks (GAN) for
targeted data augmentation based on a population bias visualisation strategy
that groups faces with similar facial attributes and highlights where the model
is failing. A sampling method selects faces where the model is not performing
well, which are used to fine-tune the CNN. Experiments show the efficacy of our
approach in improving driver drowsiness detection for under represented
ethnicity groups. Here, models trained on publicly available datasets are
compared with a model trained using the proposed data augmentation strategy.
Although developed in the context of driver drowsiness detection, the proposed
framework is not limited to the driver drowsiness detection task, but can be
applied to other applications.

  Pattern Recognition Letters, 98, pp.117-122
\\
  This work proposes kernel transform learning. The idea of dictionary learning
is well known; it is a synthesis formulation where a basis is learnt along with
the coefficients so as to generate or synthesize the data. Transform learning
is its analysis equivalent; the transforms operates or analyses on the data to
generate the coefficients. The concept of kernel dictionary learning has been
introduced in the recent past, where the dictionary is represented as a linear
combination of non-linear version of the data. Its success has been showcased
in feature extraction. In this work we propose to kernelize transform learning
on line similar to kernel dictionary learning. An efficient solution for kernel
transform learning has been proposed especially for problems where the number
of samples is much larger than the dimensionality of the input samples making
the kernel matrix very high dimensional. Kernel transform learning has been
compared with other representation learning tools like autoencoder, restricted
Boltzmann machine as well as with dictionary learning (and its kernelized
version). Our proposed kernel transform learning yields better results than all
the aforesaid techniques; experiments have been carried out on benchmark
databases.

Authors: Anupriya Gogna and Angshul Majumdar
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: The final version has been accepted at Neural Processing Letters
\\
  Conventionally, autoencoders are unsupervised representation learning tools.
In this work, we propose a novel discriminative autoencoder. Use of supervised
discriminative learning ensures that the learned representation is robust to
variations commonly encountered in image datasets. Using the basic
discriminating autoencoder as a unit, we build a stacked architecture aimed at
extracting relevant representation from the training data. The efficiency of
our feature extraction algorithm ensures a high classification accuracy with
even simple classification schemes like KNN (K-nearest neighbor). We
demonstrate the superiority of our model for representation learning by
conducting experiments on standard datasets for character/image recognition and
subsequent comparison with existing supervised deep architectures like class
sparse stacked autoencoder and discriminative deep belief network.

Title: Large-scale Multi-modal Person Identification in Real Unconstrained
  Environments
Authors: Jiajie Ye, Yisheng Guan, Junfa Liu, Xinghong Huang and Hong Zhang

\\
  Person identification (P-ID) under real unconstrained noisy environments is a
huge challenge. In multiple-feature learning with Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks (DCNNs) or Machine Learning method for large-scale person
identification in the wild, the key is to design an appropriate strategy for
decision layer fusion or feature layer fusion which can enhance discriminative
power. It is necessary to extract different types of valid features and
establish a reasonable framework to fuse different types of information. In
traditional methods, different persons are identified based on single modal
features to identify, such as face feature, audio feature, and head feature.
These traditional methods cannot realize a highly accurate level of person
identification in real unconstrained environments. The study aims to propose a
fusion module to fuse multi-modal features for person identification in real
unconstrained environments.

Title: Deep-learning-based classification and retrieval of components of a
  process plant from segmented point clouds
Authors: Hyungki Kim and Duhwan Mun

\\
  Technology to recognize the type of component represented by a point cloud is
required in the reconstruction process of an as-built model of a process plant
based on laser scanning. The reconstruction process of a process plant through
laser scanning is divided into point cloud registration, point cloud
segmentation, and component type recognition and placement. Loss of shape data
or imbalance of point cloud density problems generally occur in the point cloud
data collected from large-scale facilities. In this study, we experimented with
the possibility of applying object recognition technology based on 3D deep
learning networks, which have been showing high performance recently, and
analyzed the results. For training data, we used a segmented point cloud
repository about components that we constructed by scanning a process plant.
For networks, we selected the multi-view convolutional neural network (MVCNN),
which is a view-based method, and PointNet, which is designed to allow the
direct input of point cloud data. In the case of the MVCNN, we also performed
an experiment on the generation method for two types of multi-view images that
can complement the shape occlusion of the segmented point cloud. In this
experiment, the MVCNN showed the highest retrieval accuracy of approximately
87%, whereas PointNet showed the highest retrieval mean average precision of
approximately 84%. Furthermore, both networks showed high recognition
performance for the segmented point cloud of plant components when there was
sufficient training data.

Title: Symmetric block-low-rank layers for fully reversible multilevel neural
  networks
Authors: Bas Peters, Eldad Haber, Keegan Lensink
Categories: cs.CV
MSC-class: 68T45
\\
  Factors that limit the size of the input and output of a neural network
include memory requirements for the network states/activations to compute
gradients, as well as memory for the convolutional kernels or other weights.
The memory restriction is especially limiting for applications where we want to
learn how to map volumetric data to the desired output, such as video-to-video.
Recently developed fully reversible neural networks enable gradient
computations using storage of the network states for a couple of layers only.
While this saves a tremendous amount of memory, it is the convolutional kernels
that take up most memory if fully reversible networks contain multiple
invertible pooling/coarsening layers. Invertible coarsening operators such as
the orthogonal wavelet transform cause the number of channels to grow
explosively. We address this issue by combining fully reversible networks with
layers that contain the convolutional kernels in a compressed form directly.
Specifically, we introduce a layer that has a symmetric block-low-rank
structure. In spirit, this layer is similar to bottleneck and
squeeze-and-expand structures. We contribute symmetry by construction, and a
combination of notation and flattening of tensors allows us to interpret these
network structures in linear algebraic fashion as a block-low-rank matrix in
factorized form and observe various properties. A video segmentation example
shows that we can train a network to segment the entire video in one go, which
would not be possible, in terms of memory requirements, using non-reversible
networks and previously proposed reversible networks.

Title: Convolutional Dictionary Pair Learning Network for Image Representation

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Dictionary Learning (DL) are
powerful image representation learning sys-tems based on different mechanisms
and principles, so whether we can integrate them to improve the performance is
notewor-thy exploring. To address this issue, we propose a novel general-ized
end-to-end representation learning architecture, dubbed Convolutional
Dictionary Pair Learning Network (CDPL-Net) in this paper, which seamlessly
integrates the learning schemes of CNN and dictionary pair learning into a
unified framework. Generally, the architecture of CDPL-Net includes two
convolu-tional/pooling layers and two dictionary pair learning (DPL) layers in
the representation learning module. Besides, it uses two fully-connected layers
as the multi-layer perception layer in the nonlinear classification module. In
particular, the DPL layer can jointly formulate the discriminative synthesis
and analysis representations driven by minimizing the batch based
recon-struction error over the flatted feature maps from the
convolu-tion/pooling layer. Moreover, DPL layer uses the l1-norm on the
analysis dictionary so that sparse representation can be delivered, and the
embedding process will also be robust to noise. To speed up the training
process of DPL layer, the efficient stochastic gradient descent is used.
Extensive simulations on public data-bases show that our CDPL-Net can deliver
enhanced perfor-mance over other state-of-the-art methods.

\\
  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are expected to replace human in hazardous
tasks of surface inspection due to their flexibility in operating space and
capability of collecting high quality visual data. In this study, we propose
enhanced hierarchical convolutional neural networks (HCNN) to detect cracks
from image data collected by UAVs. Unlike traditional HCNN, here a set of
branch networks is utilised to reduce the obscuration in the down-sampling
process. Moreover, the feature preserving blocks combine the current and
previous terms from the convolutional blocks to provide input to the loss
functions. As a result, the weights of resized images can be reduced to
minimise the information loss. Experiments on images of different crack
datasets have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed
HCNN.

Title: Evaluating Usage of Images for App Classification

\\
  App classification is useful in a number of applications such as adding apps
to an app store or building a user model based on the installed apps. Presently
there are a number of existing methods to classify apps based on a given
taxonomy on the basis of their text metadata. However, text based methods for
app classification may not work in all cases, such as when the text
descriptions are in a different language, or missing, or inadequate to classify
the app. One solution in such cases is to utilize the app images to supplement
the text description. In this paper, we evaluate a number of approaches in
which app images can be used to classify the apps. In one approach, we use
Optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from images, which is then
used to supplement the text description of the app. In another, we use pic2vec
to convert the app images into vectors, then train an SVM to classify the
vectors to the correct app label. In another, we use the captionbot.ai tool to
generate natural language descriptions from the app images. Finally, we use a
method to detect and label objects in the app images and use a voting technique
to determine the category of the app based on all the images. We compare the
performance of our image-based techniques to classify a number of apps in our
dataset. We use a text based SVM app classifier as our base and obtained an
improved classification accuracy of 96% for some classes when app images are
added.

Title: Cooperative Perception for 3D Object Detection in Driving Scenarios
  using Infrastructure Sensors
Authors: Eduardo Arnold, Mehrdad Dianati, Robert de Temple
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.MA cs.RO stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures
\\
  The perception system of an autonomous vehicle is responsible for mapping
sensor observations into a semantic description of the vehicle's environment.
3D object detection is a common function within this system and outputs a list
of 3D bounding boxes around objects of interest. Various 3D object detection
methods have relied on fusion of different sensor modalities to overcome
limitations of individual sensors. However, occlusion, limited field-of-view
and low-point density of the sensor data cannot be reliably and
cost-effectively addressed by multi-modal sensing from a single point of view.
Alternatively, cooperative perception incorporates information from spatially
diverse sensors distributed around the environment as a way to mitigate these
limitations. This paper proposes two schemes for cooperative 3D object
detection. The early fusion scheme combines point clouds from multiple
spatially diverse sensing points of view before detection. In contrast, the
late fusion scheme fuses the independently estimated bounding boxes from
multiple spatially diverse sensors. We evaluate the performance of both schemes
using a synthetic cooperative dataset created in two complex driving scenarios,
a T-junction and a roundabout. The evaluation show that the early fusion
approach outperforms late fusion by a significant margin at the cost of higher
communication bandwidth. The results demonstrate that cooperative perception
can recall more than 95% of the objects as opposed to 30% for single-point
sensing in the most challenging scenario. To provide practical insights into
the deployment of such system, we report how the number of sensors and their
configuration impact the detection performance of the system.

Title: DADA: A Large-scale Benchmark and Model for Driver Attention Prediction
  in Accidental Scenarios
Authors: Jianwu Fang, Dingxin Yan, Jiahuan Qiao, and Jianru Xue
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages, 13 figures, submitted to IEEE-TITS
\\
  Driver attention prediction has recently absorbed increasing attention in
traffic scene understanding and is prone to be an essential problem in
vision-centered and human-like driving systems. This work, different from other
attempts, makes an attempt to predict the driver attention in accidental
scenarios containing normal, critical and accidental situations simultaneously.
However, challenges tread on the heels of that because of the dynamic traffic
scene, intricate and imbalanced accident categories. With the hypothesis that
driver attention can provide a selective role of crash-object for assisting
driving accident detection or prediction, this paper designs a multi-path
semantic-guided attentive fusion network (MSAFNet) that learns the
spatio-temporal semantic and scene variation in prediction. For fulfilling
this, a large-scale benchmark with 2000 video sequences (named as DADA-2000) is
contributed with laborious annotation for driver attention (fixation, saccade,
focusing time), accident objects/intervals, as well as the accident categories,
and superior performance to state-of-the-arts are provided by thorough
evaluations. As far as we know, this is the first comprehensive and
quantitative study for the human-eye sensing exploration in accidental
scenarios. DADA-2000 is available at https://github.com/JWFangit/LOTVS-DADA.

Title: Metamorphic Testing for Object Detection Systems
Authors: Shuai Wang and Zhendong Su
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to object detectors
that can rapidly process pictures or videos, and recognize the objects that
they contain. Despite the promising progress by industrial manufacturers such
as Amazon and Google in commercializing deep learning-based object detection as
a standard computer vision service, object detection systems - similar to
traditional software - may still produce incorrect results. These errors, in
turn, can lead to severe negative outcomes for the users of these object
detection systems. For instance, an autonomous driving system that fails to
detect pedestrians can cause accidents or even fatalities. However, principled,
systematic methods for testing object detection systems do not yet exist,
despite their importance.
  To fill this critical gap, we introduce the design and realization of MetaOD,
the first metamorphic testing system for object detectors to effectively reveal
erroneous detection results by commercial object detectors. To this end, we (1)
synthesize natural-looking images by inserting extra object instances into
background images, and (2) design metamorphic conditions asserting the
equivalence of object detection results between the original and synthetic
images after excluding the prediction results on the inserted objects. MetaOD
is designed as a streamlined workflow that performs object extraction,
selection, and insertion. Evaluated on four commercial object detection
services and four pretrained models provided by the TensorFlow API, MetaOD
found tens of thousands of detection defects in these object detectors. To
further demonstrate the practical usage of MetaOD, we use the synthetic images
that cause erroneous detection results to retrain the model. Our results show
that the model performance is increased significantly, from an mAP score of 9.3
to an mAP score of 10.5.

Title: Unsupervised Adversarial Image Inpainting
Authors: Arthur Pajot, Emmanuel de Bezenac, Patrick Gallinari
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML
\\
  We consider inpainting in an unsupervised setting where there is neither
access to paired nor unpaired training data. The only available information is
provided by the uncomplete observations and the inpainting process statistics.
In this context, an observation should give rise to several plausible
reconstructions which amounts at learning a distribution over the space of
reconstructed images. We model the reconstruction process by using a
conditional GAN with constraints on the stochastic component that introduce an
explicit dependency between this component and the generated output. This
allows us sampling from the latent component in order to generate a
distribution of images associated to an observation. We demonstrate the
capacity of our model on several image datasets: faces (CelebA), food images
(Recipe-1M) and bedrooms (LSUN Bedrooms) with different types of imputation
masks. The approach yields comparable performance to model variants trained
with additional supervision.

Title: ResNetX: a more disordered and deeper network architecture
Authors: Wenfeng Feng, Xin Zhang, Guangpeng Zhao
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Designing efficient network structures has always been the core content of
neural network research.
  ResNet and its variants have proved to be efficient in architecture.
  However, how to theoretically character the influence of network structure on
performance is still vague.
  With the help of techniques in complex networks, We here provide a natural
yet efficient extension to ResNet by folding its backbone chain.
  Our architecture has two structural features when being mapped to directed
acyclic graphs:
  First is a higher degree of the disorder compared with ResNet, which let
ResNetX explore a larger number of feature maps with different sizes of
receptive fields.
  Second is a larger proportion of shorter paths compared to ResNet, which
improves the direct flow of information through the entire network.
  Our architecture exposes a new dimension, namely "fold depth", in addition to
existing dimensions of depth, width, and cardinality.
  Our architecture is a natural extension to ResNet, and can be integrated with
existing state-of-the-art methods with little effort. Image classification
results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 benchmarks suggested that our new network
architecture performs better than ResNet.

Title: Intra-Variable Handwriting Inspection Reinforced with Idiosyncrasy
  Analysis
Authors: Chandranath Adak, Bidyut B. Chaudhuri, Chin-Teng Lin, Michael
  Blumenstein
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we work on intra-variable handwriting, where the writing
samples of an individual can vary significantly. Such within-writer variation
throws a challenge for automatic writer inspection, where the state-of-the-art
methods do not perform well. To deal with intra-variability, we analyze the
idiosyncrasy in individual handwriting. We identify/verify the writer from
highly idiosyncratic text-patches. Such patches are detected using a deep
recurrent reinforcement learning-based architecture. An idiosyncratic score is
assigned to every patch, which is predicted by employing deep regression
analysis. For writer identification, we propose a deep neural architecture,
which makes the final decision by the idiosyncratic score-induced weighted sum
of patch-based decisions. For writer verification, we propose two algorithms
for deep feature aggregation, which assist in authentication using a triplet
network. The experiments were performed on two databases, where we obtained
encouraging results.

Title: Mitigating large adversarial perturbations on X-MAS (X minus Moving
  Averaged Samples)
Authors: Woohyung Chun, Sung-Min Hong, Junho Huh and Inyup Kang
Categories: cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG
Comments: X-MAS is the essential condition for the proposed mitigation as well
  as human beings
\\
  We propose the scheme that mitigates an adversarial perturbation $\epsilon$
on the adversarial example $X_{adv}$ ($=$ $X$ $\pm$ $\epsilon$) by subtracting
the estimated perturbation $\hat{\epsilon}$ from $X$ $+$ $\epsilon$ and adding
$\hat{\epsilon}$ to $X$ $-$ $\epsilon$. The estimated perturbation
$\hat{\epsilon}$ comes from the difference between $X_{adv}$ and its
moving-averaged outcome $W_{avg}*X_{adv}$ where $W_{avg}$ is $N \times N$
moving average kernel that all the coefficients are one. Usually, the adjacent
samples of an image are close to each other such that we can let $X$ $\approx$
$W_{avg}*X$ (naming this relation after X-MAS[X minus Moving Averaged Sample]).
Since the X-MAS relation is approximately zero, the estimated perturbation can
be less than the adversarial perturbation. The scheme is also extended to do
the multi-level mitigation by configuring the mitigated adversarial example
$X_{adv}$ $\pm$ $\hat{\epsilon}$ as a new adversarial example to be mitigated.
The multi-level mitigation gets $X_{adv}$ closer to $X$ with a smaller (i.e.
mitigated) perturbation than original unmitigated perturbation by setting
$W_{avg} * X_{adv}$ ($<$ $X$ $+$ $W_{avg}*\epsilon$ if $X$ $\approx$
$W_{avg}*X$) as the boundary condition that the multi-level mitigation cannot
cross over (i.e. decreasing $\epsilon$ cannot go below and increasing
$\epsilon$ cannot go beyond). With the multi-level mitigation, we can get high
prediction accuracies even in the adversarial example having a large
perturbation (i.e. $\epsilon$ $\geq$ $16$). The proposed scheme is evaluated
with adversarial examples crafted by the Iterative FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign
Method) on ResNet-50 trained with ImageNet dataset.

  Access to labeled reference data is one of the grand challenges in supervised
machine learning endeavors. This is especially true for an automated analysis
of remote sensing images on a global scale, which enables us to address global
challenges such as urbanization and climate change using state-of-the-art
machine learning techniques. To meet these pressing needs, especially in urban
research, we provide open access to a valuable benchmark dataset named "So2Sat
LCZ42," which consists of local climate zone (LCZ) labels of about half a
million Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches in 42 urban agglomerations
(plus 10 additional smaller areas) across the globe. This dataset was labeled
by 15 domain experts following a carefully designed labeling work flow and
evaluation process over a period of six months. As rarely done in other labeled
remote sensing dataset, we conducted rigorous quality assessment by domain
experts. The dataset achieved an overall confidence of 85%. We believe this LCZ
dataset is a first step towards an unbiased globallydistributed dataset for
urban growth monitoring using machine learning methods, because LCZ provide a
rather objective measure other than many other semantic land use and land cover
classifications. It provides measures of the morphology, compactness, and
height of urban areas, which are less dependent on human and culture. This
dataset can be accessed from http://doi.org/10.14459/2018mp1483140.

Title: Unsupervised Few-shot Learning via Self-supervised Training
Authors: Zilong Ji, Xiaolong Zou, Tiejun Huang, Si Wu

Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Learning from limited exemplars (few-shot learning) is a fundamental,
unsolved problem that has been laboriously explored in the machine learning
community. However, current few-shot learners are mostly supervised and rely
heavily on a large amount of labeled examples. Unsupervised learning is a more
natural procedure for cognitive mammals and has produced promising results in
many machine learning tasks. In the current study, we develop a method to learn
an unsupervised few-shot learner via self-supervised training (UFLST), which
can effectively generalize to novel but related classes. The proposed model
consists of two alternate processes, progressive clustering and episodic
training. The former generates pseudo-labeled training examples for
constructing episodic tasks; and the later trains the few-shot learner using
the generated episodic tasks which further optimizes the feature
representations of data. The two processes facilitate with each other, and
eventually produce a high quality few-shot learner. Using the benchmark dataset
Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet, we show that our model outperforms other
unsupervised few-shot learning methods. Using the benchmark dataset Market1501,
we further demonstrate the feasibility of our model to a real-world application
on person re-identification.

  In this work we study locality and compositionality in the context of
learning representations for Zero Shot Learning (ZSL). In order to well-isolate
the importance of these properties in learned representations, we impose the
additional constraint that, differently from most recent work in ZSL, no
pre-training on different datasets (e.g. ImageNet) is performed. The results of
our experiments show how locality, in terms of small parts of the input, and
compositionality, i.e. how well can the learned representations be expressed as
a function of a smaller vocabulary, are both deeply related to generalization
and motivate the focus on more local-aware models in future research directions
for representation learning.

Authors: Jonathan Ho, Nal Kalchbrenner, Dirk Weissenborn, Tim Salimans
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  We propose Axial Transformers, a self-attention-based autoregressive model
for images and other data organized as high dimensional tensors. Existing
autoregressive models either suffer from excessively large computational
resource requirements for high dimensional data, or make compromises in terms
of distribution expressiveness or ease of implementation in order to decrease
resource requirements. Our architecture, by contrast, maintains both full
expressiveness over joint distributions over data and ease of implementation
with standard deep learning frameworks, while requiring reasonable memory and
computation and achieving state-of-the-art results on standard generative
modeling benchmarks. Our models are based on axial attention, a simple
generalization of self-attention that naturally aligns with the multiple
dimensions of the tensors in both the encoding and the decoding settings.
Notably the proposed structure of the layers allows for the vast majority of
the context to be computed in parallel during decoding without introducing any
independence assumptions. This semi-parallel structure goes a long way to
making decoding from even a very large Axial Transformer broadly applicable. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results for the Axial Transformer on the
ImageNet-32 and ImageNet-64 image benchmarks as well as on the BAIR Robotic
Pushing video benchmark. We open source the implementation of Axial
Transformers.

Title: Detecting Deepfake-Forged Contents with Separable Convolutional Neural
  Network and Image Segmentation
Authors: Chia-Mu Yu, Ching-Tang Chang, Yen-Wu Ti
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent advances in AI technology have made the forgery of digital images and
videos easier, and it has become significantly more difficult to identify such
forgeries. These forgeries, if disseminated with malicious intent, can
negatively impact social and political stability, and pose significant ethical
and legal challenges as well. Deepfake is a variant of auto-encoders that use
deep learning techniques to identify and exchange images of a person's face in
a picture or film. Deepfake can result in an erosion of public trust in digital
images and videos, which has far-reaching effects on political and social
stability. This study therefore proposes a solution for facial forgery
detection to determine if a picture or film has ever been processed by
Deepfake. The proposed solution reaches detection efficiency by using the
recently proposed separable convolutional neural network (CNN) and image
segmentation. In addition, this study also examined how different image
segmentation methods affect detection results. Finally, the ensemble model is
used to improve detection capabilities. Experiment results demonstrated the
excellent performance of the proposed solution.

Title: Unsupervised Representation Learning by Predicting Random Distances
Authors: Hu Wang, Guansong Pang, Chunhua Shen, Congbo Ma
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep neural networks have gained tremendous success in a broad range of
machine learning tasks due to its remarkable capability to learn semantic-rich
features from high-dimensional data. However, they often require large-scale
labelled data to successfully learn such features, which significantly hinders
their adaption into unsupervised learning tasks, such as anomaly detection and
clustering, and limits their applications into critical domains where obtaining
massive labelled data is prohibitively expensive. To enable downstream
unsupervised learning on those domains, in this work we propose to learn
features without using any labelled data by training neural networks to predict
data distances in a randomly projected space. Random mapping is a theoretical
proven approach to obtain approximately preserved distances. To well predict
these random distances, the representation learner is optimised to learn
genuine class structures that are implicitly embedded in the randomly projected
space. Experimental results on 19 real-world datasets show our learned
representations substantially outperform state-of-the-art competing methods in
both anomaly detection and clustering tasks.

Title: Explain Your Move: Understanding Agent Actions Using Focused Feature

\\
  As deep reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to more tasks, there is a need
to visualize and understand the behavior of learned agents. Saliency maps
explain agent behavior by highlighting the features of the input state that are
most relevant for the agent in taking an action. Existing perturbation-based
approaches to compute saliency often highlight regions of the input that are
not relevant to the action taken by the agent. Our approach generates more
focused saliency maps by balancing two aspects (specificity and relevance) that
capture different desiderata of saliency. The first captures the impact of
perturbation on the relative expected reward of the action to be explained. The
second downweights irrelevant features that alter the relative expected rewards
of actions other than the action to be explained. We compare our approach with
existing approaches on agents trained to play board games (Chess and Go) and
Atari games (Breakout, Pong and Space Invaders). We show through illustrative
examples (Chess, Atari, Go), human studies (Chess), and automated evaluation
methods (Chess) that our approach generates saliency maps that are more
interpretable for humans than existing approaches.

Title: Local Class-Specific and Global Image-Level Generative Adversarial
  Networks for Semantic-Guided Scene Generation
Authors: Hao Tang, Dan Xu, Yan Yan, Philip H. S. Torr, Nicu Sebe
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: 11 pages, 11 figures
\\
  In this paper, we address the task of semantic-guided scene generation. One
open challenge in scene generation is the difficulty of the generation of small
objects and detailed local texture, which has been widely observed in global
image-level generation methods. To tackle this issue, in this work we consider
learning the scene generation in a local context, and correspondingly design a
local class-specific generative network with semantic maps as a guidance, which
separately constructs and learns sub-generators concentrating on the generation
of different classes, and is able to provide more scene details. To learn more
discriminative class-specific feature representations for the local generation,
a novel classification module is also proposed. To combine the advantage of
both the global image-level and the local class-specific generation, a joint
generation network is designed with an attention fusion module and a
dual-discriminator structure embedded. Extensive experiments on two scene image
generation tasks show superior generation performance of the proposed model.
The state-of-the-art results are established by large margins on both tasks and
on challenging public benchmarks. The source code and trained models are
available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/LGGAN.

\\
  Deep learning object detectors often return false positives with very high
confidence. Although they optimize generic detection performance, such as mean
average precision (mAP), they are not designed for reliability. For a reliable
detection system, if a high confidence detection is made, we would want high
certainty that the object has indeed been detected. To achieve this, we have
developed a set of verification tests which a proposed detection must pass to
be accepted. We develop a theoretical framework which proves that, under
certain assumptions, our verification tests will not accept any false
positives. Based on an approximation to this framework, we present a practical
detection system that can verify, with high precision, whether each detection
of a machine-learning based object detector is correct. We show that these
tests can improve the overall accuracy of a base detector and that accepted
examples are highly likely to be correct. This allows the detector to operate
in a high precision regime and can thus be used for robotic perception systems
as a reliable instance detection method.

Title: Seeing without Looking: Contextual Rescoring of Object Detections for AP
  Maximization
Authors: Louren\c{c}o V. Pato, Renato Negrinho, Pedro M. Q. Aguiar
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 12 figures
\\
  The majority of current object detectors lack context: class predictions are
made independently from other detections. We propose to incorporate context in
object detection by post-processing the output of an arbitrary detector to
rescore the confidences of its detections. Rescoring is done by conditioning on
contextual information from the entire set of detections: their confidences,
predicted classes, and positions. We show that AP can be improved by simply
reassigning the detection confidence values such that true positives that
survive longer (i.e., those with the correct class and large IoU) are scored
higher than false positives or detections with small IoU. In this setting, we
use a bidirectional RNN with attention for contextual rescoring and introduce a
training target that uses the IoU with ground truth to maximize AP for the
given set of detections. The fact that our approach does not require access to
visual features makes it computationally inexpensive and agnostic to the
detection architecture. In spite of this simplicity, our model consistently
improves AP over strong pre-trained baselines (Cascade R-CNN and Faster R-CNN
with several backbones), particularly by reducing the confidence of duplicate
detections (a learned form of non-maximum suppression) and removing
out-of-context objects by conditioning on the confidences, classes, positions,
and sizes of the co-occurrent detections (e.g., a high-confidence detection of
bird makes a detection of sports ball less likely).

Comments: Short version to be published in proceedings of AIES
\\
  As the transformative potential of AI has become increasingly salient as a
matter of public and political interest, there has been growing discussion
about the need to ensure that AI broadly benefits humanity. This in turn has
spurred debate on the social responsibilities of large technology companies to
serve the interests of society at large. In response, ethical principles and
codes of conduct have been proposed to meet the escalating demand for this
responsibility to be taken seriously. As yet, however, few institutional
innovations have been suggested to translate this responsibility into legal
commitments which apply to companies positioned to reap large financial gains
from the development and use of AI. This paper offers one potentially
attractive tool for addressing such issues: the Windfall Clause, which is an ex
ante commitment by AI firms to donate a significant amount of any eventual
extremely large profits. By this we mean an early commitment that profits that
a firm could not earn without achieving fundamental, economically
transformative breakthroughs in AI capabilities will be donated to benefit
humanity broadly, with particular attention towards mitigating any downsides
from deployment of windfall-generating AI.

Title: On the Morality of Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Alexandra Luccioni and Yoshua Bengio
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  Much of the existing research on the social and ethical impact of Artificial
Intelligence has been focused on defining ethical principles and guidelines
surrounding Machine Learning (ML) and other Artificial Intelligence (AI)
algorithms [IEEE, 2017, Jobin et al., 2019]. While this is extremely useful for
helping define the appropriate social norms of AI, we believe that it is
equally important to discuss both the potential and risks of ML and to inspire
the community to use ML for beneficial objectives. In the present article,
which is specifically aimed at ML practitioners, we thus focus more on the
latter, carrying out an overview of existing high-level ethical frameworks and
guidelines, but above all proposing both conceptual and practical principles
and guidelines for ML research and deployment, insisting on concrete actions
that can be taken by practitioners to pursue a more ethical and moral practice
of ML aimed at using AI for social good.

Title: Utility-Driven Mining of Trend Information for Intelligent System

  Useful knowledge, embedded in a database, is likely to change over time.
Identifying recent changes in temporal databases can provide valuable
up-to-date information to decision-makers. Nevertheless, techniques for mining
high-utility patterns (HUPs) seldom consider recency as a criterion to discover
patterns. Thus, the traditional utility mining framework is inadequate for
obtaining up-to-date insights about real world data. In this paper, we address
this issue by introducing a novel framework, named utility-driven mining of
Recent/trend high-Utility Patterns (RUP) in temporal databases for intelligent
systems, based on user-specified minimum recency and minimum utility
thresholds. The utility-driven RUP algorithm is based on novel global and
conditional downward closure properties, and a recency-utility tree. Moreover,
it adopts a vertical compact recency-utility list structure to store the
information required by the mining process. The developed RUP algorithm
recursively discovers recent HUPs. It is also fast and consumes a small amount
of memory due to its pattern discovery approach that does not generate
candidates. Two improved versions of the algorithm with additional pruning
strategies are also designed to speed up the discovery of patterns by reducing
the search space. Results of a substantial experimental evaluation show that
the proposed algorithm can efficiently identify all recent high-utility
patterns in large-scale databases, and that the improved algorithm performs
best.

Title: Discovering High Utility Episodes in Sequences
Authors: Wensheng Gan, Jerry Chun-Wei Lin, Han-Chieh Chao and Philip S. Yu
Categories: cs.DB
Comments: IEEE Transactions on Big Data, under review, 13 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Sequence data, e.g., complex event sequence, is more commonly seen than other
types of data (e.g., transaction data) in real-world applications. For the
mining task from sequence data, several problems have been formulated, such as
sequential pattern mining, episode mining, and sequential rule mining. As one
of the fundamental problems, episode mining has often been studied. The common
wisdom is that discovering frequent episodes is not useful enough. In this
paper, we propose an efficient utility mining approach namely UMEpi: Utility
Mining of high-utility Episodes from complex event sequence. We propose the
concept of remaining utility of episode, and achieve a tighter upper bound,
namely episode-weighted utilization (EWU), which will provide better pruning.
Thus, the optimized EWU-based pruning strategies can achieve better
improvements in mining efficiency. The search space of UMEpi w.r.t. a
prefix-based lexicographic sequence tree is spanned and determined recursively
for mining high-utility episodes, by prefix-spanning in a depth-first way.
Finally, extensive experiments on four real-life datasets demonstrate that
UMEpi can discover the complete high-utility episodes from complex event
sequence, while the state-of-the-art algorithms fail to return the correct
results. Furthermore, the improved variants of UMEpi significantly outperform
the baseline in terms of execution time, memory consumption, and scalability.

Comments: Accepted by ACM Trans. on Data Science, 29 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Utility-oriented pattern mining has become an emerging topic since it can
reveal high-utility patterns (e.g., itemsets, rules, sequences) from different
types of data, which provides more information than the traditional
frequent/confident-based pattern mining models. The utilities of various items
are not exactly equal in realistic situations; each item has its own utility or
importance. In general, user considers a uniform minimum utility (minutil)
threshold to identify the set of high-utility sequential patterns (HUSPs). This
is unable to find the interesting patterns while the minutil is set extremely
high or low. We first design a new utility mining framework namely USPT for
mining high-Utility Sequential Patterns across multi-sequences with
individualized Thresholds. Each item in the designed framework has its own
specified minimum utility threshold. Based on the lexicographic-sequential tree
and the utility-array structure, the USPT framework is presented to efficiently
discover the HUSPs. With the upper-bounds on utility, several pruning
strategies are developed to prune the unpromising candidates early in the
search space. Several experiments are conducted on both real-life and synthetic
datasets to show the performance of the designed USPT algorithm, and the
results showed that USPT could achieve good effectiveness and efficiency for
mining HUSPs with individualized minimum utility thresholds.

Title: Solving a Special Case of the Intensional vs Extensional Conjecture in
  Probabilistic Databases
Authors: Mika\"el Monet
Categories: cs.DB
Comments: 16 pages, including 12 pages of main text. Accepted at PODS'2020
\\
  We consider the problem of exact probabilistic inference for Union of
Conjunctive Queries (UCQs) on tuple-independent databases. For this problem,
two approaches currently coexist. In the extensional method, query evaluation
is performed by exploiting the structure of the query, and relies heavily on
the use of the inclusion-exclusion principle. In the intensional method, one
first builds a representation of the lineage of the query in a tractable
formalism of knowledge compilation. The chosen formalism should then ensure
that the probability can be efficiently computed using simple disjointness and
independence assumptions, without the need of performing inclusion-exclusion.
The extensional approach has long been thought to be strictly more powerful
than the intensional approach, the reason being that for some queries, the use
of inclusion-exclusion seemed unavoidable. In this paper we introduce a new
technique to construct lineage representations as deterministic decomposable
circuits in polynomial time. We prove that this technique applies to a class of
UCQs that had been conjectured to separate the complexity of the two
approaches. In essence, we show that relying on the inclusion-exclusion formula
can be avoided by using negation. This result brings back hope to prove that
the intensional approach can handle all tractable UCQs.

Title: Real Time Pattern Matching with Dynamic Normalization
Authors: Renzhi Wu, Sergey Sukhanov, Christian Debes
Categories: cs.DB cs.MM
\\
  Pattern matching in time series data streams is considered to be an essential
data mining problem that still stays challenging for many practical scenarios.
Different factors such as noise, varying amplitude scale or shift, signal
stretches or shrinks in time are all leading to performance degradation of many
existing pattern matching algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic
z-normalization mechanism allowing for proper signal scaling even under
significant time and amplitude distortions. Based on that, we further propose a
Dynamic Time Warping-based real-time pattern matching method to recover hidden
patterns that can be distorted in both time and amplitude. We evaluate our
proposed method on synthetic and real-world scenarios under realistic
conditions demonstrating its high operational characteristics comparing to
other state-of-the-art pattern matching methods.

\\
  The wide adoption of deep neural networks has been accompanied by
ever-increasing energy and performance demands due to the expensive nature of
training them. Numerous special-purpose architectures have been proposed to
accelerate training: both digital and hybrid digital-analog using resistive RAM
(ReRAM) crossbars. ReRAM-based accelerators have demonstrated the effectiveness
of ReRAM crossbars at performing matrix-vector multiplication operations that
are prevalent in training. However, they still suffer from inefficiency due to
the use of serial reads and writes for performing the weight gradient and
update step. A few works have demonstrated the possibility of performing outer
products in crossbars, which can be used to realize the weight gradient and
update step without the use of serial reads and writes. However, these works
have been limited to low precision operations which are not sufficient for
typical training workloads. Moreover, they have been confined to a limited set
of training algorithms for fully-connected layers only. To address these
limitations, we propose a bit-slicing technique for enhancing the precision of
ReRAM-based outer products, which is substantially different from bit-slicing
for matrix-vector multiplication only. We incorporate this technique into a
crossbar architecture with three variants catered to different training
algorithms. To evaluate our design on different types of layers in neural
networks (fully-connected, convolutional, etc.) and training algorithms, we
develop PANTHER, an ISA-programmable training accelerator with compiler
support. Our evaluation shows that PANTHER achieves up to $8.02\times$,
$54.21\times$, and $103\times$ energy reductions as well as $7.16\times$,
$4.02\times$, and $16\times$ execution time reductions compared to digital
accelerators, ReRAM-based accelerators, and GPUs, respectively.

Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Database platform-as-a-service (dbPaaS) is developing rapidly and a large
number of databases have been migrated to run on the Clouds for the low cost
and flexibility. Emerging Clouds rely on the tenants to provide the resource
specification for their database workloads. However, they tend to over-estimate
the resource requirement of their databases, resulting in the unnecessarily
high cost and low Cloud utilization. A methodology that automatically suggests
the "just-enough" resource specification that fulfills the performance
requirement of every database workload is profitable. To this end, we propose
URSA, a capacity planning and workload scheduling system for dbPaaS Clouds.
USRA is comprised by an online capacity planner, a performance interference
estimator, and a contention-aware scheduling engine. The capacity planner
identifies the most cost-efficient resource specification for a database
workload to achieve the required performance online. The interference estimator
quantifies the pressure on the shared resource and the sensitivity to the
shared resource contention of each database workload. The scheduling engine
schedules the workloads across Cloud nodes carefully to eliminate unfair
performance interference between the co-located workloads. Our real system
experimental results show that URSA reduces 27.5% of CPU usage and 53.4% of
memory usage for database workloads while satisfying their performance
requirements. Meanwhile, URSA reduces the performance unfairness between the
co-located workloads by 42.8% compared with the Kubernetes.

Title: A Two-Phase Scheme for Distributed TDMA Scheduling in WSNs with
  Flexibility to Trade-off between Schedule Length and Scheduling Time
Authors: Ashutosh Bhatia, R. C. Hansdah
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  The existing distributed TDMA-scheduling techniques can be classified as
either static or dynamic. The primary purpose of static TDMA-scheduling
algorithms is to improve the channel utilization by generating a schedule of
shorter length. But, they usually take a longer time to schedule, and hence,
are not suitable for WSNs, in which the network topology changes dynamically.
On the other hand, dynamic TDMA-scheduling algorithms generate a schedule
quickly, but they are not efficient in terms of generated schedule length. In
this paper, we propose a new approach to TDMA scheduling for WSNs, that bridges
the gap between the above two extreme types of TDMA-scheduling techniques, by
providing the flexibility to trade-off between the schedule length and the time
required to generate the schedule (scheduling time). The proposed TDMA
scheduling works in two phases. In the first phase, we generate a TDMA schedule
quickly, which need not have to be very efficient in terms of schedule length.
In the second phase, we iteratively reduce the schedule length in a manner,
such that the process of schedule length reduction can be terminated after the
execution of an arbitrary number of iterations, and still be left with a valid
schedule. This step provides the capability to trade-off between schedule
length and scheduling time. We have used Castalia network simulator to evaluate
the performance of proposed TDMA-scheduling scheme. The simulation result
together with theoretical analysis shows that in addition to the advantage of
trading-off the schedule length with scheduling time, the proposed TDMA

Title: Worst-Case Polynomial-Time Exact MAP Inference on Discrete Models with
  Global Dependencies
Authors: Alexander Bauer, Shinichi Nakajima
Categories: cs.DM cs.LG
\\
  Considering the worst-case scenario, junction tree algorithm remains the most
efficient and general solution for exact MAP inference on discrete graphical
models. Unfortunately, its main tractability assumption requires the treewidth
of a corresponding MRF to be bounded strongly limiting the range of admissible
applications. In fact, many practical problems in the area of structured
prediction require modelling of global dependencies by either directly
introducing global factors or enforcing global constraints on the prediction
variables. This, however, always results in a fully-connected graph making
exact inference by means of this algorithm intractable. Nevertheless, depending
on the structure of the global factors, we can further relax the conditions for
an efficient inference. In this paper we reformulate the work in [1] and
present a better way to establish the theory also extending the set of
handleable problem instances for free - since it requires only a simple
modification of the originally presented algorithm. To demonstrate that this
extension is not of a purely theoretical interest we identify one further use
case in the context of generalisation bounds for structured learning which
cannot be handled by the previous formulation. Finally, we accordingly adjust
the theoretical guarantees that the modified algorithm always finds an optimal
solution in polynomial time.

  Let $lct(G)$ be the minimum cardinality of a set of vertices that intersects
every longest cycle of a 2-connected graph $G$. We show that $lct(G)\leq k-1$
if $G$ is a partial $k$-tree and that $lct(G)\leq \max \{1, {\omega(G){-}3}\}$
if $G$ is chordal, where $\omega(G)$ is the cardinality of a maximum clique in
$G$. Those results imply that all longest cycles intersect in 2-connected
series parallel graphs and in 3-trees.

Title: Planar Diameter via Metric Compression
Authors: Jason Li and Merav Parter
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: Appeared in STOC 2019
\\
  We develop a new approach for distributed distance computation in planar
graphs that is based on a variant of the metric compression problem recently
introduced by Abboud et al. [SODA'18]. One of our key technical contributions
is in providing a compression scheme that encodes all $S \times T$ distances
using $\widetilde{O}(|S|\cdot poly(D)+|T|)$ bits for unweighted graphs with
diameter $D$. This significantly improves the state of the art of
$\widetilde{O}(|S|\cdot 2^{D}+|T| \cdot D)$ bits. We also consider an
approximate version of the problem for \emph{weighted} graphs, where the goal
is to encode $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation of the $S \times T$ distances. At the
heart of this compact compression scheme lies a VC-dimension type argument on
planar graphs. This efficient compression scheme leads to several improvements
and simplifications in the setting of diameter computation, most notably in the
distributed setting:
  - There is an $\widetilde{O}(D^5)$-round randomized distributed algorithm for
computing the diameter in planar graphs, w.h.p.
  - There is an $\widetilde{O}(D^3)+ poly(\log n/\epsilon)\cdot D^2$-round
randomized distributed algorithm for computing an $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation
of the diameter in weighted graphs with polynomially bounded weights, w.h.p.
  No sublinear round algorithms were known for these problems before. These
distributed constructions are based on a new recursive graph decomposition that
preserves the (unweighted) diameter of each of the subgraphs up to a
logarithmic term. Using this decomposition, we also get an \emph{exact} SSSP
tree computation within $\widetilde{O}(D^2)$ rounds.

  We present an optimized algorithm that performs automatic classification of
white matter fibers based on a multi-subject bundle atlas. We implemented a
parallel algorithm that improves upon its previous version in both execution
time and memory usage. Our new version uses the local memory of each processor,
which leads to a reduction in execution time. Hence, it allows the analysis of
bigger subject and/or atlas datasets. As a result, the segmentation of a
subject of 4,145,000 fibers is reduced from about 14 minutes in the previous
version to about 6 minutes, yielding an acceleration of 2.34. In addition, the
new algorithm reduces the memory consumption of the previous version by a
factor of 0.79.

Title: Twinless articulation points and some related problems
Authors: Raed Jaberi
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a twinless strongly connected graph. a vertex $v\in V$ is a
twinless articulation point if the subrgraph obtained from $G$ by removing the
vertex $v$ is not twinless strongly connected. An edge $e\in E$ is a twinless
bridge if the subgraph obtained from $G$ by deleting $e$ is not twiless
strongly connected graph. In this paper we study twinless articulation points
and twinless bridges. We also study the problem of finding a minimum
cardinality edge subset $E_{1} \subseteq E$ such that the subgraph $(V,E_{1})$
is twinless strongly connected. Moreover, we present an algorithm for computing
the $2$-vertex-twinless connected components of $G$.

  LiDAR devices obtain a 3D representation of a space. Due to the large size of
the resulting datasets, there already exist storage methods that use
compression and present some properties that resemble those of compact data
structures. Specifically, LAZ format allows accesses to a given datum or
portion of the data without having to decompress the whole dataset and provides
indexation of the stored data. However, LAZ format still have some drawbacks
that should be faced. In this work, we propose a new compact data structure for
the representation of a cloud of LiDAR points that supports efficient queries,
providing indexing capabilities that are superior to those of LAZ format.

  In this work, we propose a framework to store and manage spatial data, which
includes new efficient algorithms to perform operations accepting as input a
raster dataset and a vector dataset. More concretely, we present algorithms for
solving a spatial join between a raster and a vector dataset imposing a
restriction on the values of the cells of the raster; and an algorithm for
retrieving K objects of a vector dataset that overlap cells of a raster
dataset, such that the K objects are those overlapping the highest (or lowest)
cell values among all objects.
  The raster data is stored using a compact data structure, which can directly
manipulate compressed data without the need for prior decompression. This leads
to better running times and lower memory consumption. In our experimental
evaluation comparing our solution to other baselines, we obtain the best
space/time trade-offs.

to be easily replicated using various document collections. The corresponding
experimentation is carefully explained, providing precise details about the
parameters that can be tuned for each indexing solution. Finally, note that we
also provide uiHRDC as reproducibility package.

Title: Strong Coresets for Subspace Approximation and $k$-Median in Nearly
  Linear Time
Authors: Zhili Feng, Praneeth Kacham, David P. Woodruff
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Recently the first $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate strong coresets for $k$-median
and subspace approximation of size $\text{poly}(k/\epsilon)$ were obtained by
Sohler and Woodruff 2018. Importantly, given $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the
size of these coresets was the first that was independent of both $n$ and $d$.
Unfortunately their construction had a running time which was exponential in
$\text{poly}(k/\epsilon)$. Here we give the first polynomial time, and in fact
nearly linear time, algorithms for constructing such coresets. Our first
algorithm runs in $\text{nnz}(A)/\epsilon + (n+d) \text{poly}(k/\epsilon)$ time
and our second runs in $nd \log^2(nd) + (n+d) \text{poly}(k/\epsilon)$ time.

Title: A Water-Filling Primal-Dual Algorithm for Approximating Non-Linear
  Covering Problems
Authors: Andr\'es Fielbaum, Ignacio Morales, and Jos\'e Verschae
Categories: cs.DS math.OC
\\
  Obtaining strong linear relaxations of capacitated covering problems
constitute a major technical challenge even for simple settings. For one of the
most basic cases, the Knapsack-Cover (Min-Knapsack) problem, the relaxation
based on knapsack-cover inequalities achieves an integrality gap of 2. These
inequalities have been exploited in more general environments, many of which
admit primal-dual approximation algorithms.
  Inspired by problems from power and transport systems, we introduce a new
general setting in which items can be taken fractionally to cover a given
demand. The cost incurred by an item is given by an arbitrary non-decreasing
function of the chosen fraction. We generalize the knapsack-cover inequalities
to this setting an use them to obtain a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximate
primal-dual algorithm. Our procedure has a natural interpretation as a
bucket-filling algorithm, which effectively balances the difficulties given by
having different slopes in the cost functions: when some superior portion of an
item presents a low slope, it helps to increase the priority with which the
inferior portions may be taken. We also present a rounding algorithm with an
approximation guarantee of 2.
  We generalize our algorithm to the Unsplittable Flow-Cover problem on a line,
also for the setting where items can be taken fractionally. For this problem we
obtain a $(4+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm in polynomial time, almost
matching the $4$-approximation known for the classical setting.

\\
  The search for new computational machines beyond the traditional von Neumann
architecture has given rise to a modern area of nonlinear science --
development of unconventional computing -- requiring the efforts of
mathematicians, physicists and engineers. Many analogue physical systems
including nonlinear oscillator networks, lasers, and condensates were proposed
and realised to address hard computational problems from various areas of
social and physical sciences and technology. The analogue systems emulate spin
Hamiltonians with continuous or discrete degrees of freedom to which actual
optimisation problems can be mapped. Understanding the underlying physical
process by which the system finds the ground state often leads to new classes
of system-inspired or quantum-inspired algorithms for hard optimisation.
Together physical platforms and related algorithms can be combined to form a
hybrid architecture that may one day compete with conventional computing. In
this Chapter, we review some of the systems and physically-inspired algorithms
that show such promise.

that the backward propagating gradients required to train the network can be
approximated in a surprisingly simple pump-probe scheme that requires only
passive optical elements. Simulations show that, with readily obtainable
optical depths, our approach can achieve equivalent performance to
state-of-the-art computational networks on image classification benchmarks,
even in deep networks with multiple sequential gradient approximations. With
backpropagation through nonlinear units an outstanding challenge to the field,
this work provides a feasible path towards truly all-optical neural networks.

Comments: Ph.D. Thesis, Bo\u{g}azi\c{c}i University Computer Engineering
  Department, 2019
\\
  Many of the numerous automaton models proposed in the literature can be
regarded as a finite automaton equipped with an additional storage mechanism.
In this thesis, we focus on two such models, namely the finite automata over
groups and the homing vector automata.
  A finite automaton over a group $ G $ is a nondeterministic finite automaton
equipped with a register that holds an element of the group $ G $. The register
is initialized to the identity element of the group and a computation is
successful if the register is equal to the identity element at the end of the
computation after being multiplied with a group element at every step. We
investigate the language recognition power of finite automata over integer and
rational matrix groups and reveal new relationships between the language
classes corresponding to these models. We examine the effect of various
parameters on the language recognition power. We establish a link between the
decision problems of matrix semigroups and the corresponding automata. We
present some new results about valence pushdown automata and context-free
valence grammars.
  We also propose the new homing vector automaton model, which is a finite
automaton equipped with a vector that can be multiplied with a matrix at each
step. The vector can be checked for equivalence to the initial vector and the
acceptance criterion is ending up in an accept state with the value of the
vector being equal to the initial vector. We examine the effect of various
restrictions on the model by confining the matrices to a particular set and
allowing the equivalence test only at the end of the computation. We define the
different variants of the model and compare their language recognition power
with that of the classical models.

Title: Rendering Synthetic Objects into Legacy Photographs

Categories: cs.GR
\\
  We propose a method to realistically insert synthetic objects into existing
photographs without requiring access to the scene or any additional scene
measurements. With a single image and a small amount of annotation, our method
creates a physical model of the scene that is suitable for realistically
rendering synthetic objects with diffuse, specular, and even glowing materials
while accounting for lighting interactions between the objects and the scene.
We demonstrate in a user study that synthetic images produced by our method are
confusable with real scenes, even for people who believe they are good at
telling the difference. Further, our study shows that our method is competitive
with other insertion methods while requiring less scene information. We also
collected new illumination and reflectance datasets; renderings produced by our
system compare well to ground truth. Our system has applications in the movie
and gaming industry, as well as home decorating and user content creation,
among others.

Title: ConstructAide: Analyzing and Visualizing Construction Sites through

Categories: cs.GR
\\
  We describe a set of tools for analyzing, visualizing, and assessing
architectural/construction progress with unordered photo collections and 3D
building models. With our interface, a user guides the registration of the
model in one of the images, and our system automatically computes the alignment
for the rest of the photos using a novel Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technique;
images with nearby viewpoints are also brought into alignment with each other.
After aligning the photo(s) and model(s), our system allows a user, such as a
project manager or facility owner, to explore the construction site seamlessly
in time, monitor the progress of construction, assess errors and deviations,
and create photorealistic architectural visualizations. These interactions are
facilitated by automatic reasoning performed by our system: static and dynamic
occlusions are removed automatically, rendering information is collected, and
semantic selection tools help guide user input. We also demonstrate that our
user-assisted SfM method outperforms existing techniques on both real-world
construction data and established multi-view datasets.

Title: Blind Recovery of Spatially Varying Reflectance from a Single Image
Authors: Kevin Karsch, David Forsyth
Categories: cs.GR eess.IV
\\
  We propose a new technique for estimating spatially varying parametric
materials from a single image of an object with unknown shape in unknown
illumination. Our method uses a low-order parametric reflectance model, and
incorporates strong assumptions about lighting and shape. We develop new priors
about how materials mix over space, and jointly infer all of these properties
from a single image. This produces a decomposition of an image which
corresponds, in one sense, to microscopic features (material reflectance) and
macroscopic features (weights defining the mixing properties of materials over
space). We have built a large dataset of real objects rendered with different
material models under different illumination fields for training and ground
truth evaluation. Extensive experiments on both our synthetic dataset images as
well as real images show that (a) our method recovers parameters with
reasonable accuracy; (b) material parameters recovered by our method give
accurate predictions of new renderings of the object; and (c) our low-order
reflectance model still provides a good fit to many real-world reflectances.

Title: Skeleton Extraction from 3D Point Clouds by Decomposing the Object into
  Parts
Authors: Vijai Jayadevan, Edward Delp, and Zygmunt Pizlo
Categories: cs.GR cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Decomposing a point cloud into its components and extracting curve skeletons
from point clouds are two related problems. Decomposition of a shape into its
components is often obtained as a byproduct of skeleton extraction. In this
work, we propose to extract curve skeletons, from unorganized point clouds, by
decomposing the object into its parts, identifying part skeletons and then
linking these part skeletons together to obtain the complete skeleton. We
believe it is the most natural way to extract skeletons in the sense that this
would be the way a human would approach the problem. Our parts are generalized
cylinders (GCs). Since, the axis of a GC is an integral part of its definition,
the parts have natural skeletal representations. We use translational symmetry,
the fundamental property of GCs, to extract parts from point clouds. We
demonstrate how this method can handle a large variety of shapes. We compare
our method with state of the art methods and show how a part based approach can
deal with some of the limitations of other methods. We present an improved
version of an existing point set registration algorithm and demonstrate its
utility in extracting parts from point clouds. We also show how this method can
be used to extract skeletons from and identify parts of noisy point clouds. A
part based approach also provides a natural and intuitive interface for user
interaction. We demonstrate the ease with which mistakes, if any, can be fixed
with minimal user interaction with the help of a graphical user interface.

Title: Hopping-Proof and Fee-Free Pooled Mining in Blockchain
Authors: Hongwei Shi, Shengling Wang, Qin Hu, Xiuzhen Cheng, Junshan Zhang,
  Jiguo Yu
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  The pool-hopping attack casts down the expected profits of both the mining
pool and honest miners in Blockchain. The mainstream countermeasures, namely
PPS (pay-per-share) and PPLNS (pay-per-last-N-share), can hedge pool hopping,
but pose a risk to the pool as well as the cost to miners. In this study, we
apply the zero-determinant (ZD) theory to design a novel pooled mining which
offers an incentive mechanism for motivating non-memorial and memorial
evolutionary miners not to switch in pools strategically. In short, our
hopping-proof pooled mining has three unique features: 1) fee-free. No fee is
charged if the miner does not hop. 2) wide applicability. It can be employed in
both prepaid and postpaid mechanisms. 3) fairness. Even the pool can dominate
the game with any miner, he has to cooperate when the miner does not hop among
pools. The fairness of our scheme makes it have long-term sustainability. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a hopping-proof pooled
mining with the above three natures simultaneously. Both theoretical and
experimental analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.

Title: An Uncertainty- and Collusion-Proof Voting Consensus Mechanism in
  Blockchain
Authors: Shengling Wang, Xidi Qu, Qin Hu, Weifeng Lv
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  Though voting-based consensus algorithms in Blockchain outperform proof-based
ones in energy- and transaction-efficiency, they are prone to incur wrong
elections and bribery elections. The former originates from the uncertainties
of candidates' capability and availability; and the latter comes from the
egoism of voters and candidates. Hence, in this paper, we propose an
uncertainty- and collusion-proof voting consensus mechanism, including the
selection pressure-based voting consensus algorithm and the trustworthiness
evaluation algorithm. The first algorithm can decrease the side effects of
candidates' uncertainties, lowering wrong elections while trading off the
balance between efficiency and fairness in electing miners. The second
algorithm adopts an incentive compatible scoring rule to evaluate the
trustworthiness of voting, motivating voters to report true beliefs on
candidates by making egoism in consistent with altruism so as to avoid bribery
elections. A salient feature of our work is theoretically analyzing the
proposed voting consensus mechanism by the large deviation theory. Our analysis
provides not only the voting failure rate of a candidate but also its decay
speed, based on which the concepts of {\it the effective selection valve} and
{\it the effective expectation of merit} are introduced to help the system
designer to determine the optimal voting standard and guide a candidate to
behave in an optimal way for lowering the voting failure rate.

  Recipients
Authors: atoshi Hashizume, Ipp ei Suzuki, Kazuki Takazawa, Yoichi Ochiai
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  In order to reduce the burden on caregivers, we developed an intelligent
electric wheelchair. We held workshops with caregivers, asked then regarding
the problems in caregiving, and developed problem-solving methods. In the
workshop, caregivers' physical fitness and psychology of the older adults were
found to be problems and a solution was proposed. We implemented a cooperative
operation function for multiple electric wheelchairs based on the workshop and
demonstrated it at a nursing home. By listening to older adults, we obtained
feedback on the automatic driving electric wheelchair. From the results of this
study, we discovered the issues and solutions to be applied to the intelligent
electric wheelchair.

\\
  Urban air pollution has been linked to various human health concerns,
including cardiopulmonary diseases. Communities who suffer from poor air
quality often rely on experts to identify pollution sources due to the lack of
accessible tools. Taking this into account, we developed Smell Pittsburgh, a
system that enables community members to report odors and track where these
odors are frequently concentrated. All smell report data are publicly
accessible online. These reports are also sent to the local health department
and visualized on a map along with air quality data from monitoring stations.
This visualization provides a comprehensive overview of the local pollution
landscape. Additionally, with these reports and air quality data, we developed
a model to predict upcoming smell events and send push notifications to inform
communities. We also applied regression analysis to identify statistically
significant effects of push notifications on user engagement. Our evaluation of
this system demonstrates that engaging residents in documenting their
experiences with pollution odors can help identify local air pollution
patterns, and can empower communities to advocate for better air quality. All
citizen-contributed smell data are publicly accessible and can be downloaded
from https://smellpgh.org.

  In this paper, we analyze a large dataset of user-generated music listening
events from Last.fm, focusing on users aged 6 to 18 years. Our contribution is
two-fold. First, we study the music genre preferences of this young user group
and analyze these preferences for homogeneity within more fine-grained age
groups and with respect to gender and countries. Second, we investigate the
performance of a collaborative filtering recommender when tailoring music
recommendations to different age groups. We find that doing so improves
performance for all user groups up to 18 years, but decreases performance for
adult users aged 19 years and older.

Title: Convolutional Quantum-Like Language Model with Mutual-Attention for
  Product Rating Prediction
Authors: Qing Ping, Chaomei Chen
Categories: cs.IR cs.CL
Comments: Accepted at MAISON workshop at ICTIR 19'
\\
  Recommender systems are designed to help mitigate information overload users
experience during online shopping. Recent work explores neural language models
to learn user and item representations from user reviews and combines such
representations with rating information. Most existing convolutional-based
neural models take pooling immediately after convolution and loses the
interaction information between the latent dimension of convolutional feature
vectors along the way. Moreover, these models usually take all feature vectors
at higher levels as equal and do not take into consideration that some features
are more relevant to this specific user-item context. To bridge these gaps,
this paper proposes a convolutional quantum-like language model with
mutual-attention for rating prediction (ConQAR). By introducing a quantum-like
density matrix layer, interactions between latent dimensions of convolutional
feature vectors are well captured. With the attention weights learned from the
mutual-attention layer, final representations of a user and an item absorb
information from both itself and its counterparts for making rating prediction.
Experiments on two large datasets show that our model outperforms multiple
state-of-the-art CNN-based models. We also perform an ablation test to analyze
the independent effects of the two components of our model. Moreover, we
conduct a case study and present visualizations of the quantum probabilistic
distributions in one user and one item review document to show that the learned
distributions capture meaningful information about this user and item, and can
be potentially used as textual profiling of the user and item.

Title: Memory Augmented Graph Neural Networks for Sequential Recommendation

\\
  The chronological order of user-item interactions can reveal time-evolving
and sequential user behaviors in many recommender systems. The items that users
will interact with may depend on the items accessed in the past. However, the
substantial increase of users and items makes sequential recommender systems
still face non-trivial challenges: (1) the hardness of modeling the short-term
user interests; (2) the difficulty of capturing the long-term user interests;
(3) the effective modeling of item co-occurrence patterns. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a memory augmented graph neural network (MA-GNN) to
capture both the long- and short-term user interests. Specifically, we apply a
graph neural network to model the item contextual information within a
short-term period and utilize a shared memory network to capture the long-range
dependencies between items. In addition to the modeling of user interests, we
employ a bilinear function to capture the co-occurrence patterns of related
items. We extensively evaluate our model on five real-world datasets, comparing
with several state-of-the-art methods and using a variety of performance
metrics. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model
for the task of Top-K sequential recommendation.

Title: On the Coverage and Capacity of Ultra-Dense Networks with Directional
  Transmissions
Authors: Yining Xu, Sheng Zhou
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, accepted by IEEE Wireless Commuincations Letters
\\
  We investigate the performance of a downlink ultra-dense network (UDN) with
directional transmissions via stochastic geometry. Considering the dual-slope
path loss model and sectored beamforming pattern, we derive the expressions and
asymptotic characteristics of the coverage probability and constrained area
spectrum efficiency (ASE). Several special scenarios, namely the physically
feasible path loss model and adjustable beam pattern, are also analyzed.
Although signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio collapsing still exists when
the path loss exponent in the near-field is no larger than 2, using strategies
like beam pattern adaption, can avoid the decrease of the coverage probability
and constrained ASE even when the base station density approaches infinity.

\\
  Beamforming structures with fixed beam codebooks provide economical solutions
for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications due to the low hardware cost.
However, the training overhead to search for the optimal beamforming
configuration is proportional to the codebook size. To improve the efficiency
of beam tracking, we propose a beam tracking scheme based on the channel
fingerprint database, which comprises mappings between statistical beamforming
gains and user locations. The scheme tracks user movement by utilizing the
trained beam configurations and estimating the gains of beam configurations
that are not trained. Simulations show that the proposed scheme achieves
significant beamforming performance gains over existing beam tracking schemes.

Title: Channel Estimation and Hybrid Beamforming for Reconfigurable Intelligent
  Surfaces Assisted THz Communications
Authors: Boyu Ning, Zhi Chen, Wenrong Chen, Yiming Du and Jun Fang
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Terahertz (THz) communications are promising to be the next frontier for
wireless network but suffer from severe attenuation and poor diffraction. To
address these challenges, this paper integrates two state-of-the-art
technology, i.e., massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), into THz communication to stablish
effective and stable connection. Owing to the passivity of the RISs, channel
estimation remains an open problem, besides, traditional fully-digital
beamforming (FDB) can not be applied in massive MIMO due to its high hardware
cost. In sight of this, this paper develops a cooperative channel estimation
procedure for RIS-assisted MIMO system via beam training that exploits the
advantages of massive MIMO and poor scattering nature of THz channel. The whole
procedure is developed based on cost-efficient hybrid beamforming (HB)
architectures. Moreover, this paper designs two different codebooks for
efficiently realizing the proposed estimation procedure via 3-tree hierarchical
search. The two codebooks are referred to as tree dictionary (TD) codebook and
phase shifter deactivation (PSD) codebook, with different advantages catering
for various scenarios. Using the estimation information, this paper develops
two closed-form transmission designs, i.e., direct allocation (DA) design and
zero-forcing allocation (ZFA) design, for maximizing the overall spectral
efficiency.

Title: Joint Annotator-and-Spectrum Allocation in Wireless Networks for Crowd
  Labelling
Authors: Xiaoyang Li, Guangxu Zhu, Kaiming Shen, Wei Yu, Yi Gong, and Kaibin
  Huang
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  The massive sensing data generated by Internet-of-Things will provide fuel
for ubiquitous artificial intelligence (AI), automating the operations of our
society ranging from transportation to healthcare. The realistic adoption of
this technique however entails labelling of the enormous data prior to the
training of AI models via supervised learning. To tackle this challenge, we
explore a new perspective of wireless crowd labelling that is capable of
downloading data to many imperfect mobile annotators for repetition labelling
by exploiting multicasting in wireless networks. In this cross-disciplinary
area, the integration of the rate-distortion theory and the principle of
repetition labelling for accuracy improvement gives rise to a new tradeoff
between radio-and-annotator resources under a constraint on labelling accuracy.
Building on the tradeoff and aiming at maximizing the labelling throughput,
this work focuses on the joint optimization of encoding rate, annotator
clustering, and sub-channel allocation, which results in an NP-hard integer
programming problem. To devise an efficient solution approach, we establish an
optimal sequential annotator-clustering scheme based on the order of decreasing
signal-to-noise ratios. Thereby, the optimal solution can be found by an
efficient tree search. Next, the solution is simplified by applying truncated
channel inversion. Alternatively, the optimization problem can be recognized as
a knapsack problem, which can be efficiently solved in pseudo-polynomial time
by means of dynamic programming. In addition, exact polices are derived for the
annotators constrained and spectrum constrained cases. Last, simulation results
demonstrate the significant throughput gains based on the optimal solution
compared with decoupled allocation of the two types of resources.

Title: Multidimensional Variational Line Spectra Estimation
Authors: Qi Zhang, Jiang Zhu, Ning Zhang and Zhiwei Xu
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  The fundamental multidimensional line spectral estimation problem is
addressed utilizing the Bayesian methods. Motivated by the recently proposed
variational line spectral estimation (VALSE) algorithm, multidimensional VALSE
(MDVALSE) is developed. MDVALSE inherits the advantages of VALSE such as
automatically estimating the model order, noise variance and providing
uncertain degrees of frequency estimates. Compared to VALSE, the
multidimensional frequencies of a single component is treated as a whole, and
the probability density function is projected as independent univariate von
Mises distribution to perform tractable inference. Besides, for the
initialization, efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) is adopted to
significantly reduce the computation complexity of MDVALSE. Numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the MDVALSE, compared to state-of-art methods.

Title: Power Efficient IRS-Assisted NOMA
Authors: Jianyue Zhu, Yongming Huang, Jiaheng Wang, Keivan Navaie, Zhiguo Ding
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we propose a downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO)
transmission scheme, which is assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS) consisting of a large number of passive reflecting elements. In the
literature, it has been proved that nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can
achieve the capacity region when the channels are quasi-degraded. However, in a
conventional communication scenario, it is difficult to guarantee the
quasi-degradation, because the channels are determined by the propagation
environments and cannot be reconfigured. To overcome this difficulty, we focus
on an IRS-assisted MISO NOMA system, where the wireless channels can be
effectively tuned. We optimize the beamforming vectors and the IRS phase shift
matrix for minimizing transmission power. Furthermore, we propose an improved
quasi-degradation condition by using IRS, which can ensure that NOMA achieves
the capacity region with high possibility. For a comparison, we study
zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) as well, where the beamforming vectors and the
IRS phase shift matrix are also jointly optimized. Comparing NOMA with ZFBF, it
is shown that, with the same IRS phase shift matrix and the improved
quasi-degradation condition, NOMA always outperforms ZFBF. At the same time, we
identify the condition under which ZFBF outperforms NOMA, which motivates the
proposed hybrid NOMA transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed
IRS-assisted MISO system outperforms the MISO case without IRS, and the hybrid
NOMA transmission scheme always achieves better performance than orthogonal
multiple access.

Title: Channel Estimation for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Multiuser
  Communications: Framework, Algorithms, and Analysis

Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: submitted for possible journal publication. arXiv admin note:
  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1911.03084
\\
  In intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted communication systems, the
acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is a crucial impediment for
achieving the beamforming gain of IRS because of the considerable overhead
required for channel estimation. Specifically, under the current beamforming
design for IRS-assisted communications, $KMN+KM$ channel coefficients should be
estimated, where $K$, $N$ and $M$ denote the numbers of users, IRS reflecting
elements, and antennas at the base station (BS), respectively. To accurately
estimate such a large number of channel coefficients within a short time
interval, we propose a novel three-phase pilot-based channel estimation
framework in this paper for IRS-assisted uplink multiuser communications. Under
this framework, we analytically prove that a time duration consisting of
$K+N+\max(K-1,\lceil (K-1)N/M \rceil)$ pilot symbols is sufficient for the BS
to perfectly recover all the $KMN+KM$ channel coefficients for the case without
receiver noise at the BS. In contrast to the channel estimation for
conventional uplink communications without IRS where the minimum channel
estimation time is independent of the number of receive antennas at the BS, our
result reveals the crucial role of massive MIMO (multiple-input
multiple-output) in reducing the channel estimation time for IRS-assisted
communications. Further, for the case with receiver noise, the user pilot
sequences, IRS reflecting coefficients, and BS linear minimum mean-squared
error (LMMSE) channel estimators are characterized in closed-form, and the
corresponding estimation mean-squared error (MSE) is quantified.

Title: Part I: Improving Computational Efficiency of Communication for
  Omniscience
Authors: Ni Ding, Parastoo Sadeghi, Thierry Rakotoarivelo
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Communication for omniscience (CO) refers to the problem where the users in a
finite set $V$ observe a discrete multiple random source and want to exchange
data over broadcast channels to reach omniscience, the state where everyone
recovers the entire source. This paper studies how to improve the computational
complexity for the problem of minimizing the sum-rate for attaining omniscience
in $V$. While the existing algorithms rely on the submodular function
minimization (SFM) techniques and complete in $O(|V|^2 \cdot \text{SFM}(|V|)$
time, we prove the strict strong map property of the nesting SFM problem. We
propose a parametric (PAR) algorithm that utilizes the parametric SFM
techniques and reduce the the complexity to $O(|V| \cdot \text{SFM}(|V|)$. The
output of the PAR algorithm is in fact the segmented Dilworth truncation of the
residual entropy for all minimum sum-rate estimates $\alpha$, which
characterizes the principal sequence of partitions (PSP) and solves some
related problems: It not only determines the secret capacity, a dual problem to
CO, and the network strength of a graph, but also outlines the hierarchical
solution to a combinatorial clustering problem. \end{abstract}

Title: Part II: A Practical Approach for Successive Omniscience
Authors: Ni Ding, Parastoo Sadeghi, Thierry Rakotoarivelo
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures
\\
  In Part I, we studied the communication for omniscience (CO) problem and
proposed a parametric (PAR) algorithm to determine the minimum sum-rate at
which a set of users indexed by a finite set $V$ attain omniscience. The
omniscience in CO refers to the status that each user in $V$ recovers the
observations of a multiple random source. It is called the global omniscience
in this paper in contrast to the study of the successive omniscience (SO),
where the local omniscience is attained subsequently in user subsets. By
inputting a lower bound on the minimum sum-rate for CO, we apply the PAR
algorithm to search a complimentary subset $X_* \subsetneq V$ such that if the
local omniscience in $X_*$ is reached first, the global omniscience whereafter
can still be attained with the minimum sum-rate. We further utilize the outputs
of the PAR algorithm to outline a multi-stage SO approach that is characterized
by $K \leq |V| - 1$ complimentary subsets $X_*^{(k)}, \forall k \in
\{1,\dotsc,K\}$ forming a nesting sequence $X_*^{(1)} \subsetneq \dotsc
\subsetneq X_*^{(K)} = V$. Starting from stage $k = 1$, the local omniscience
in $X_*^{(k)}$ is attained at each stage $k$ until the final global omniscience
in $X_*^{(K)} = V$. A $|X_*{(k)}|$-dimensional local omniscience achievable
rate vector is also derived for each stage $k$ designating individual users
transmitting rates. The sum-rate of this rate vector in the last stage $K$
coincides with the minimized sum-rate for the global omniscience.

Title: Efficiency Maximization for UAV-Enabled Mobile Relaying Systems with
  Laser Charging
Authors: Ming-Min Zhao, Qingjiang Shi, and Min-Jian Zhao

Comments: 33 pages, 8 figures, submitted for possible journal publication
\\
  This work studies the joint problem of power and trajectory optimization in
an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile relaying system. In the
considered system, in order to provide convenient and sustainable energy supply
to the UAV relay, we consider the deployment of a power beacon (PB) which can
wirelessly charge the UAV and it is realized by a properly designed laser
charging system. To this end, we propose an efficiency (the weighted sum of the
energy efficiency during information transmission and wireless power
transmission efficiency) maximization problem by optimizing the source/UAV/PB
transmit powers along with the UAV's trajectory. This optimization problem is
also subject to practical mobility constraints, as well as the
information-causality constraint and energy-causality constraint at the UAV.
Different from the commonly used alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, two
joint design algorithms, namely: the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and
penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithms, are presented to address the
resulting non-convex problem, which features complex objective function with
multiple-ratio terms and coupling constraints. These two very different
algorithms are both able to achieve a stationary solution of the original
efficiency maximization problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Edge Caching with Real-Time Guarantees
Authors: Le Yang, Yi Zhong, Fu-Chun Zheng and Shi Jin
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In recent years, optimization of the success transmission probability in
wireless cache-enabled networks has been studied extensively. However, few
works have concerned about the real-time performance of the cache-enabled
networks. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the cache-enabled
with real-time guarantees by adopting the age of information (AoI) as the
metric to characterize the timeliness of the delivered information. We
establish a spatial-temporal model by utilizing the stochastic geometry and
queuing theory which captures both the temporal traffic dynamics and the
interferers' geographic distribution. Under the random caching framework, we
achieve the closed-form expression of AoI by adopting the maximum average
received power criterion for the user association. Finally, we formulate a
convex optimization problem for the minimization of the Peak AoI (PAoI) and
obtain the optimal caching probabilities by utilizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the random caching
strategy is a better choice rather than the most popular content and uniform
caching strategy to improve the real-time performance for the cached file as
well as maintaining the file diversity at a relatively high level.

Title: Study of Switched Max-Link Relay Selection for Cooperative
  Multiple-Antenna Systems
Authors: F. L. Duarte and R. C. de Lamare
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 15 pages, 13 figures
\\
  In this work, we present a switched relaying framework for multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems where a source node may transmit directly
to a destination node or aided by relays. We also investigate relay selection
techniques for the proposed switched relaying framework, whose relays are
equipped with buffers. In particular, we develop a novel relay selection
protocol based on switching and the selection of the best link, denoted as
Switched Max-Link. We then propose the Maximum Minimum Distance (MMD) relay
selection criterion for MIMO systems, which is based on the optimal Maximum
Likelihood (ML) principle and can provide significant performance gains over
other criteria, along with algorithms that are incorporated into the proposed
Switched Max-Link protocol. An analysis of the proposed Switched Max-Link
protocol and the MMD relay selection criterion in terms of computational cost,
pairwise error probability, sum-rate and average delay is carried out.
Simulations show that Switched Max-Link using the MMD criterion outperforms

Title: Two families of Entanglement-assisted quantum MDS codes from
  constacyclic codes
Authors: Liangdong Lu, Wenping Ma, Luobin Guo
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes (EAQECCs) can be derived
from arbitrary classical linear codes. However, it is a very difficult task to
determine the number of entangled states required. In this work, using the
method of the decomposition of the defining set of constacyclic codes, we
construct two families of q-ary entanglement-assisted quantum MDS (EAQMDS)
codes based on classical constacyclic MDS codes by exploiting less pre-shared
maximally entangled states. We show that a class of q-ary EAQMDS have minimum
distance upper bound greater than q. Some of them have much larger minimum
distance than the known quantum MDS (QMDS) codes of the same length. Most of
these q-ary EAQMDS codes are new in the sense that their parameters are not
covered by the codes available in the literature.

  We extend the techniques of H\"{u}gel, Rauhut and Strohmer (Found. Comput.
Math., 2014) to show that for every $\delta\in(0,1]$, there exists an explicit
random $m\times N$ partial Fourier matrix $A$ with
$m=s\operatorname{polylog}(N/\epsilon)$ and entropy
$s^\delta\operatorname{polylog}(N/\epsilon)$ such that for every $s$-sparse
signal $x\in\mathbb{C}^N$, there exists an event of probability at least
$1-\epsilon$ over which $x$ is the unique minimizer of $\|z\|_1$ subject to
$Az=Ax$. The bulk of our analysis uses tools from decoupling to estimate the
extreme singular values of the submatrix of $A$ whose columns correspond to the
support of $x$.

Title: An Efficient CSI Acquisition Method for Intelligent Reflecting
  Surface-assisted mmWave Networks
Authors: Yaoshen Cui and Haifan Yin
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted to ICC2020
\\
  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is one of the key enablers of the
fifth-generation cellular networks (5G). However, one of the fundamental
challenges of mmWave communication is the susceptibility to blockage effects.
One way to alleviate this effect is the use of Intelligent Reflecting Surface
(IRS). Nevertheless, due to the large number of the reflecting elements on IRS,
the channel estimation turns out to be a challenging problem. This paper
proposes a low-complexity channel information acquisition method for
IRS-assisted mmWave communication system. Our idea consists in exploiting the
sparsity of the mmWave channel and the topology of IRS itself. Compared to the
state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method requires much less time-frequency
resource in the acquisition of channel information. Large performance gains are
confirmed in simulation, which prove the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Title: Coverage Analysis of Relay Assisted Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks
  with Spatial Correlation
Authors: Simin Xu, Nan Yang, Biao He, and Hamid Jafarkhani
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  We propose a novel analytical framework for evaluating the coverage
performance of a millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular network where idle user
equipments (UEs) act as relays. In this network, the base station (BS) adopts
either the direct mode to transmit to the destination UE, or the relay mode if
the direct mode fails, where the BS transmits to the relay UE and then the
relay UE transmits to the destination UE. To address the drastic rotational
movements of destination UEs in practice, we propose to adopt selection
combining at destination UEs. New expression is derived for the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability of the
network. Using numerical results, we first demonstrate the accuracy of our new
expression. Then we show that ignoring spatial correlation, which has been
commonly adopted in the literature, leads to severe overestimation of the SINR
coverage probability. Furthermore, we show that introducing relays into a
mmWave cellular network vastly improves the coverage performance. In addition,
we show that the optimal BS density maximizing the SINR coverage probability
can be determined by using our analysis.

Title: Deep Transfer Learning Based Downlink Channel Prediction for FDD Massive
  MIMO Systems
Authors: Yuwen Yang, Feifei Gao, Zhimeng Zhong, Bo Ai and Ahmed Alkhateeb
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Artificial intelligence (AI) based downlink channel state information (CSI)
prediction for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems has attracted growing attention recently.
However, existing works focus on the downlink CSI prediction for the users
under a given environment and is hard to adapt to users in new environment
especially when labeled data is limited. To address this issue, we formulate
the downlink channel prediction as a deep transfer learning (DTL) problem,
where each learning task aims to predict the downlink CSI from the uplink CSI
for one single environment. Specifically, we develop the direct-transfer
algorithm based on the fully-connected neural network architecture, where the
network is trained on the data from all previous environments in the manner of
classical deep learning and is then fine-tuned for new environments. To further
improve the transfer efficiency, we propose the meta-learning algorithm that
trains the network by alternating inner-task and across-task updates and then
adapts to a new environment with a small number of labeled data. Simulation
results show that the direct-transfer algorithm achieves better performance
than the deep learning algorithm, which implies that the transfer learning
benefits the downlink channel prediction in new environments. Moreover, the
meta-learning algorithm significantly outperforms the direct-transfer algorithm
in terms of both prediction accuracy and stability, especially when the number
of samples is very small, which validates its effectiveness and superiority.

Title: Social Learning with Beliefs in a Parallel Network
Authors: Daewon Seo, Ravi Kiran Raman, and Lav R. Varshney
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Consider a social learning problem in a parallel network, where $N$
distributed agents make independent selfish binary decisions, and a central
agent aggregates them together with a private signal to make a final decision.
In particular, all agents have private beliefs for the true prior, based on
which they perform binary hypothesis testing. We focus on the Bayes risk of the
central agent, and counterintuitively find that a collection of agents with
incorrect beliefs could outperform a set of agents with correct beliefs. We
also consider many-agent asymptotics (i.e., $N$ is large) when distributed
agents all have identical beliefs, for which it is found that the central
agent's decision is polarized and beliefs determine the limit value of the
central agent's risk. Moreover, the risk converges to the limit value
exponentially fast in $N$.

Title: OCCER- One-Class Classification by Ensembles of Regression models
Authors: Amir Ahmad and Srikanth Bezawada
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  One-class classification (OCC) deals with the classification problem in which
the training data has data points belonging to target class only. In this
paper, we present a one-class classification algorithm; One-Class
Classification by Ensembles of Regression models (OCCER) that uses regression
methods to address OCC problems. The OCCEM algorithm coverts a OCC problem into
many regression problems in the original feature space such that each feature
of the original feature space is used as the target variable in one of the
regression problems. Other features are used as the variables on which the
dependent variable is depend upon. The errors of regression of a data point by
all the regression models are used to compute the outlier score of the data
point. An extensive comparison of the OCCER to the state-of-the-art OCC
algorithms on several datasets was carried out to show the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. We also show that OCCER algorithm can work well with the
latent feature space created by autoencoders for image datasets. The
implementation of OCCER is available at
https://github.com/srikanthBezawada/OCCER.

\\
  Clustering analysis, a classical issue in data mining, is widely used in
various research areas. This article aims at proposing a self-adaption grey
DBSCAN clustering (SAG-DBSCAN) algorithm. First, the grey relational matrix is
used to obtain the grey local density indicator, and then this indicator is
applied to make self-adapting noise identification for obtaining a dense subset
of clustering dataset, finally, the DBSCAN which automatically selects
parameters is utilized to cluster the dense subset. Several frequently-used
datasets were used to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the
proposed clustering algorithm and to compare the results with those of other
state-of-the-art algorithms. The comprehensive comparisons indicate that our
method has advantages over other compared methods.

Title: CProp: Adaptive Learning Rate Scaling from Past Gradient Conformity
Authors: Konpat Preechakul, Boonserm Kijsirikul
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Most optimizers including stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its adaptive
gradient derivatives face the same problem where an effective learning rate
during the training is vastly different. A learning rate scheduling, mostly
tuned by hand, is usually employed in practice. In this paper, we propose
CProp, a gradient scaling method, which acts as a second-level learning rate
adapting throughout the training process based on cues from past gradient
conformity. When the past gradients agree on direction, CProp keeps the
original learning rate. On the contrary, if the gradients do not agree on
direction, CProp scales down the gradient proportionally to its uncertainty.
Since it works by scaling, it could apply to any existing optimizer extending
its learning rate scheduling capability. We put CProp to a series of tests
showing significant gain in training speed on both SGD and adaptive gradient
method like Adam. Codes are available at https://github.com/phizaz/cprop .

Title: An Analysis of the Expressiveness of Deep Neural Network Architectures
  Based on Their Lipschitz Constants
Authors: SiQi Zhou and Angela P. Schoellig
Categories: cs.LG cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
Comments: L4DC
\\
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a popular mathematical tool for
function approximation due to their capability of modelling highly nonlinear
functions. Their applications range from image classification and natural
language processing to learning-based control. Despite their empirical
successes, there is still a lack of theoretical understanding of the
representative power of such deep architectures. In this work, we provide a
theoretical analysis of the expressiveness of fully-connected, feedforward DNNs
with 1-Lipschitz activation functions. In particular, we characterize the
expressiveness of a DNN by its Lipchitz constant. By leveraging random matrix
theory, we show that, given sufficiently large and randomly distributed
weights, the expected upper and lower bounds of the Lipschitz constant of a DNN
and hence their expressiveness increase exponentially with depth and
polynomially with width, which gives rise to the benefit of the depth of DNN
architectures for efficient function approximation. This observation is
consistent with established results based on alternative expressiveness
measures of DNNs. In contrast to most of the existing work, our analysis based
on the Lipschitz properties of DNNs is applicable to a wider range of
activation nonlinearities and potentially allows us to make sensible
comparisons between the complexity of a DNN and the function to be approximated
by the DNN. We consider this work to be a step towards understanding the
expressive power of DNNs and towards designing appropriate deep architectures
for practical applications such as system control.

Title: A Study of the Learnability of Relational Properties (Model Counting
  Meets Machine Learning)
Authors: Muhammad Usman, Wenxi Wang, Kaiyuan Wang, Marko Vasic, Haris Vikalo,
  Sarfraz Khurshid
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Relational properties, e.g., the connectivity structure of nodes in a
distributed system, have many applications in software design and analysis.
However, such properties often have to be written manually, which can be costly
and error-prone. This paper introduces the MCML approach for empirically
studying the learnability of a key class of such properties that can be
expressed in the well-known software design language Alloy. A key novelty of
MCML is quantification of the performance of and semantic differences among
trained machine learning (ML) models, specifically decision trees, with respect
to entire input spaces (up to a bound on the input size), and not just for
given training and test datasets (as is the common practice). MCML reduces the
quantification problems to the classic complexity theory problem of model
counting, and employs state-of-the-art approximate and exact model counters for
high efficiency. The results show that relatively simple ML models can achieve
surprisingly high performance (accuracy and F1 score) at learning relational
properties when evaluated in the common setting of using training and test
datasets -- even when the training dataset is much smaller than the test
dataset -- indicating the seeming simplicity of learning these properties.
However, the use of MCML metrics based on model counting shows that the
performance can degrade substantially when tested against the whole (bounded)
input space, indicating the high complexity of precisely learning these
properties, and the usefulness of model counting in quantifying the true
accuracy.

Title: Neural Subgraph Isomorphism Counting
Authors: Xin Liu, Haojie Pan, Mutian He, Yangqiu Song, Xin Jiang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we study a new graph learning problem: learning to count
subgraph isomorphisms. Although the learning based approach is inexact, we are
able to generalize to count large patterns and data graphs in polynomial time
compared to the exponential time of the original NP-complete problem. Different
from other traditional graph learning problems such as node classification and
link prediction, subgraph isomorphism counting requires more global inference
to oversee the whole graph. To tackle this problem, we propose a dynamic
intermedium attention memory network (DIAMNet) which augments different
representation learning architectures and iteratively attends pattern and
target data graphs to memorize different subgraph isomorphisms for the global
counting. We develop both small graphs (<= 1,024 subgraph isomorphisms in each)
and large graphs (<= 4,096 subgraph isomorphisms in each) sets to evaluate
different models. Experimental results show that learning based subgraph
isomorphism counting can help reduce the time complexity with acceptable
accuracy. Our DIAMNet can further improve existing representation learning
models for this more global problem.

learning. We propose a systematic taxonomy for the methods and applications.

Title: Learning Controllable Disentangled Representations with Decorrelation
  Regularization
Authors: Zengjie Song, Oluwasanmi Koyejo, Jiangshe Zhang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A crucial problem in learning disentangled image representations is
controlling the degree of disentanglement during image editing, while
preserving the identity of objects. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective model with the encoder-decoder architecture to address this
challenge. To encourage disentanglement, we devise a distance covariance based
decorrelation regularization. Further, for the reconstruction step, our model
leverages a soft target representation combined with the latent image code. By
exploiting the real-valued space of the soft target representations, we are
able to synthesize novel images with the designated properties. We also design
a classification based protocol to quantitatively evaluate the disentanglement
strength of our model. Experimental results show that the proposed model
competently disentangles factors of variation, and is able to manipulate face
images to synthesize the desired attributes.

Title: Scalable Gaussian Process Regression for Kernels with a Non-Stationary
  Phase
Authors: Jan Gra{\ss}hoff, Alexandra Jankowski and Philipp Rostalski
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The application of Gaussian processes (GPs) to large data sets is limited due
to heavy memory and computational requirements. A variety of methods has been
proposed to enable scalability, one of which is to exploit structure in the
kernel matrix. Previous methods, however, cannot easily deal with
non-stationary processes. This paper presents an efficient GP framework, that
extends structured kernel interpolation methods to GPs with a non-stationary
phase. We particularly treat mixtures of non-stationary processes, which are
commonly used in the context of separation problems e.g. in biomedical signal
processing. Our approach employs multiple sets of non-equidistant inducing
points to account for the non-stationarity and retrieve Toeplitz and Kronecker
structure in the kernel matrix allowing for efficient inference. Kernel
learning is done by optimizing the marginal likelihood, which can be
approximated efficiently using stochastic trace estimation methods. Our
approach is demonstrated on numerical examples and large biomedical datasets.

Title: Feature-Attention Graph Convolutional Networks for Noise Resilient
  Learning
Authors: Min Shi, Yufei Tang, Xingquan Zhu and Jianxun Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.SI
Comments: 11 pages
\\
  Noise and inconsistency commonly exist in real-world information networks,
due to inherent error-prone nature of human or user privacy concerns. To date,
tremendous efforts have been made to advance feature learning from networks,
including the most recent Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) or attention GCN,
by integrating node content and topology structures. However, all existing
methods consider networks as error-free sources and treat feature content in
each node as independent and equally important to model node relations. The
erroneous node content, combined with sparse features, provide essential
challenges for existing methods to be used on real-world noisy networks. In
this paper, we propose FA-GCN, a feature-attention graph convolution learning
framework, to handle networks with noisy and sparse node content. To tackle
noise and sparse content in each node, FA-GCN first employs a long short-term
memory (LSTM) network to learn dense representation for each feature. To model
interactions between neighboring nodes, a feature-attention mechanism is
introduced to allow neighboring nodes learn and vary feature importance, with
respect to their connections. By using spectral-based graph convolution
aggregation process, each node is allowed to concentrate more on the most
determining neighborhood features aligned with the corresponding learning task.
Experiments and validations, w.r.t. different noise levels, demonstrate that
FA-GCN achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods on both
noise-free and noisy networks.

Title: Multi-Label Graph Convolutional Network Representation Learning
Authors: Min Shi, Yufei Tang, Xingquan Zhu and Jianxun Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Knowledge representation of graph-based systems is fundamental across many
disciplines. To date, most existing methods for representation learning
primarily focus on networks with simplex labels, yet real-world objects (nodes)
are inherently complex in nature and often contain rich semantics or labels,
e.g., a user may belong to diverse interest groups of a social network,
resulting in multi-label networks for many applications. The multi-label
network nodes not only have multiple labels for each node, such labels are
often highly correlated making existing methods ineffective or fail to handle
such correlation for node representation learning. In this paper, we propose a
novel multi-label graph convolutional network (ML-GCN) for learning node
representation for multi-label networks. To fully explore label-label
correlation and network topology structures, we propose to model a multi-label
network as two Siamese GCNs: a node-node-label graph and a label-label-node
graph. The two GCNs each handle one aspect of representation learning for nodes
and labels, respectively, and they are seamlessly integrated under one
objective function. The learned label representations can effectively preserve
the inner-label interaction and node label properties, and are then aggregated
to enhance the node representation learning under a unified training framework.
Experiments and comparisons on multi-label node classification validate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  With online payment platforms being ubiquitous and important, fraud
transaction detection has become the key for such platforms, to ensure user
account safety and platform security. In this work, we present a novel method
for detecting fraud transactions by leveraging patterns from both users' static
profiles and users' dynamic behaviors in a unified framework. To address and
explore the information of users' behaviors in continuous time spaces, we
propose to use \emph{time attention based recurrent layers} to embed the
detailed information of the time interval, such as the durations of specific
actions, time differences between different actions and sequential behavior
patterns,etc., in the same latent space. We further combine the learned
embeddings and users' static profiles altogether in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods over
state-of-the-art methods on various evaluation metrics, especially on
\emph{recall at top percent} which is an important metric for measuring the
balance between service experiences and risk of potential losses.

Title: Learning Hybrid Representation by Robust Dictionary Learning in
  Factorized Compressed Space

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by IEEE TIP
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the robust dictionary learning (DL) to discover
the hybrid salient low-rank and sparse representation in a factorized
compressed space. A Joint Robust Factorization and Projective Dictionary
Learning (J-RFDL) model is presented. The setting of J-RFDL aims at improving
the data representations by enhancing the robustness to outliers and noise in
data, encoding the reconstruction error more accurately and obtaining hybrid
salient coefficients with accurate reconstruction ability. Specifically, J-RFDL
performs the robust representation by DL in a factorized compressed space to
eliminate the negative effects of noise and outliers on the results, which can
also make the DL process efficient. To make the encoding process robust to
noise in data, J-RFDL clearly uses sparse L2, 1-norm that can potentially
minimize the factorization and reconstruction errors jointly by forcing rows of
the reconstruction errors to be zeros. To deliver salient coefficients with
good structures to reconstruct given data well, J-RFDL imposes the joint
low-rank and sparse constraints on the embedded coefficients with a synthesis
dictionary. Based on the hybrid salient coefficients, we also extend J-RFDL for
the joint classification and propose a discriminative J-RFDL model, which can
improve the discriminating abilities of learnt coeffi-cients by minimizing the
classification error jointly. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that our formulations can deliver superior performance over other
state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Variational Metric Scaling for Metric-Based Meta-Learning
Authors: Jiaxin Chen, Li-Ming Zhan, Xiao-Ming Wu, Fu-lai Chung
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by AAAI2020
\\
  Metric-based meta-learning has attracted a lot of attention due to its
effectiveness and efficiency in few-shot learning. Recent studies show that
metric scaling plays a crucial role in the performance of metric-based
meta-learning algorithms. However, there still lacks a principled method for
learning the metric scaling parameter automatically. In this paper, we recast
metric-based meta-learning from a Bayesian perspective and develop a
variational metric scaling framework for learning a proper metric scaling
parameter. Firstly, we propose a stochastic variational method to learn a
single global scaling parameter. To better fit the embedding space to a given
data distribution, we extend our method to learn a dimensional scaling vector
to transform the embedding space. Furthermore, to learn task-specific
embeddings, we generate task-dependent dimensional scaling vectors with
amortized variational inference. Our method is end-to-end without any
pre-training and can be used as a simple plug-and-play module for existing
metric-based meta-algorithms. Experiments on mini-ImageNet show that our
methods can be used to consistently improve the performance of existing
metric-based meta-algorithms including prototypical networks and TADAM.

\\
  A comparison of the performance of various machine learning models to predict
the direction of a wall following robot is presented in this paper. The models
were trained using an open-source dataset that contains 24 ultrasound sensors
readings and the corresponding direction for each sample. This dataset was
captured using SCITOS G5 mobile robot by placing the sensors on the robot
waist. In addition to the full format with 24 sensors per record, the dataset
has two simplified formats with 4 and 2 input sensor readings per record.
Several control models were proposed previously for this dataset using all
three dataset formats. In this paper, two primary research contributions are
presented. First, presenting machine learning models with accuracies higher
than all previously proposed models for this dataset using all three formats. A
perfect solution for the 4 and 2 inputs sensors formats is presented using
Decision Tree Classifier by achieving a mean accuracy of 100%. On the other
hand, a mean accuracy of 99.82% was achieves using the 24 sensor inputs by
employing the Gradient Boost Classifier. Second, presenting a comparative study
on the performance of different machine learning and deep learning algorithms
on this dataset. Therefore, providing an overall insight on the performance of
these algorithms for similar sensor fusion problems. All the models in this
paper were evaluated using Monte-Carlo cross-validation.

Title: Efficient Training of Deep Classifiers for Wireless Source
  Identification using Test SNR Estimates
Authors: Xingchen Wang, Shengtai Ju, Xiwen Zhang, Sharan Ramjee, Aly El Gamal
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
Comments: 5 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables
\\
  We investigate the potential of training time reduction for deep learning
algorithms that process received wireless signals, if an accurate test Signal
to Noise Ratio (SNR) estimate is available. Our focus is on two tasks that
facilitate source identification: 1- Identifying the modulation type, 2-
Identifying the wireless technology and channel index in the 2.4 GHZ ISM band.
For benchmarking, we rely on a fast growing recent literature on testing deep
learning algorithms against two well-known synthetic datasets. We first
demonstrate that using training data corresponding only to the test SNR value
leads to dramatic reductions in training time - that can reach up to 35x -
while incurring a small loss in average test accuracy, as it improves the
accuracy for low test SNR values. Further, we show that an erroneous test SNR
estimate with a small positive offset is better for training than another
having the same error magnitude with a negative offset. Secondly, we introduce
a greedy training SNR Boosting algorithm that leads to uniform improvement in
test accuracy across all tested SNR values, while using only a small subset of
training SNR values at each test SNR. Finally, we discuss, with empirical
evidence, the potential of bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) based on training
SNR values to improve generalization at low test SNR

Title: Quasi-Newton Trust Region Policy Optimization
Authors: Devesh Jha, Arvind Raghunathan, Diego Romeres
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO stat.ML
Comments: 3rd Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2019)
\\
  We propose a trust region method for policy optimization that employs
Quasi-Newton approximation for the Hessian, called Quasi-Newton Trust Region
Policy Optimization QNTRPO. Gradient descent is the de facto algorithm for
reinforcement learning tasks with continuous controls. The algorithm has
achieved state-of-the-art performance when used in reinforcement learning
across a wide range of tasks. However, the algorithm suffers from a number of
drawbacks including: lack of stepsize selection criterion, and slow
convergence. We investigate the use of a trust region method using dogleg step
and a Quasi-Newton approximation for the Hessian for policy optimization. We
demonstrate through numerical experiments over a wide range of challenging
continuous control tasks that our particular choice is efficient in terms of
number of samples and improves performance

Title: Spurious Local Minima of Shallow ReLU Networks Conform with the Symmetry
  of the Target Model
Authors: Yossi Arjevani, Michael Field
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We consider the optimization problem associated with fitting two-layer ReLU
networks with respect to the squared loss, where labels are assumed to be
generated by a target network. Focusing first on standard Gaussian inputs, we
show that the structure of spurious local minima detected by stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) is, in a well-defined sense, the \emph{least loss of
symmetry} with respect to the target weights. A closer look at the analysis
indicates then that this principle of least symmetry breaking may apply to a
broader range of settings. Motivated by this, we conduct a series of
experiments which corroborate this hypothesis for different classes of
non-isotropic non-product distributions, smooth activation functions and
networks with a few layers.

Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures

\\
  The key to a Transformer model is the self-attention mechanism, which allows
the model to analyze an entire sequence in a computationally efficient manner.
Recent work has suggested the possibility that general attention mechanisms
used by RNNs could be replaced by active-memory mechanisms. In this work, we
evaluate whether various active-memory mechanisms could replace self-attention
in a Transformer. Our experiments suggest that active-memory alone achieves
comparable results to the self-attention mechanism for language modelling, but
optimal results are mostly achieved by using both active-memory and
self-attention mechanisms together. We also note that, for some specific
algorithmic tasks, active-memory mechanisms alone outperform both
self-attention and a combination of the two.

\\
  In this era of digital information explosion, an abundance of data from
numerous modalities is being generated as well as archived everyday. However,
most problems associated with training Deep Neural Networks still revolve
around lack of data that is rich enough for a given task. Data is required not
only for training an initial model, but also for future learning tasks such as
Model Compression and Incremental Learning. A diverse dataset may be used for
training an initial model, but it may not be feasible to store it throughout
the product life cycle due to data privacy issues or memory constraints. We
propose to bridge the gap between the abundance of available data and lack of
relevant data, for the future learning tasks of a given trained network. We use
the available data, that may be an imbalanced subset of the original training
dataset, or a related domain dataset, to retrieve representative samples from a
trained classifier, using a novel Data-enriching GAN (DeGAN) framework. We
demonstrate that data from a related domain can be leveraged to achieve
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of Data-free Knowledge Distillation
and Incremental Learning on benchmark datasets. We further demonstrate that our
proposed framework can enrich any data, even from unrelated domains, to make it
more useful for the future learning tasks of a given network.

Title: Efficient Adversarial Training with Transferable Adversarial Examples
Authors: Haizhong Zheng, Ziqi Zhang, Juncheng Gu, Honglak Lee, Atul Prakash
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Adversarial training is an effective defense method to protect classification
models against adversarial attacks. However, one limitation of this approach is
that it can require orders of magnitude additional training time due to high
cost of generating strong adversarial examples during training. In this paper,
we first show that there is high transferability between models from
neighboring epochs in the same training process, i.e., adversarial examples
from one epoch continue to be adversarial in subsequent epochs. Leveraging this
property, we propose a novel method, Adversarial Training with Transferable
Adversarial Examples (ATTA), that can enhance the robustness of trained models
and greatly improve the training efficiency by accumulating adversarial
perturbations through epochs. Compared to state-of-the-art adversarial training
methods, ATTA enhances adversarial accuracy by up to 7.2% on CIFAR10 and
requires 12~14x less training time on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets with
comparable model robustness.

Title: Evolutionary Clustering via Message Passing
Authors: Natalia M. Arzeno, Haris Vikalo
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE stat.ML
Comments: To be published in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data
  Engineering
\\
  We are often interested in clustering objects that evolve over time and
identifying solutions to the clustering problem for every time step.
Evolutionary clustering provides insight into cluster evolution and temporal
changes in cluster memberships while enabling performance superior to that
achieved by independently clustering data collected at different time points.
In this paper we introduce evolutionary affinity propagation (EAP), an
evolutionary clustering algorithm that groups data points by exchanging
messages on a factor graph. EAP promotes temporal smoothness of the solution to
clustering time-evolving data by linking the nodes of the factor graph that are
associated with adjacent data snapshots, and introduces consensus nodes to
enable cluster tracking and identification of cluster births and deaths. Unlike
existing evolutionary clustering methods that require additional processing to
approximate the number of clusters or match them across time, EAP determines
the number of clusters and tracks them automatically. A comparison with
existing methods on simulated and experimental data demonstrates effectiveness
of the proposed EAP algorithm.

Title: Short Isometric Shapelet Transform for Binary Time Series Classification
Authors: Weibo Shu, Yaqiang Yao, and Huanhuan Chen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In the research area of time series classification (TSC), ensemble shapelet
transform (ST) algorithm is one of state-of-the-art algorithms for
classification. However, the time complexity of it is often higher than other
algorithms. Hence, two strategies of reducing the high time complexity are
proposed in this paper. The first one is to only exploit shapelet candidates
whose length is a given small value, whereas the ensemble ST uses shapelet
candidates of all the feasible lengths. The second one is to train a single
linear classifier in the feature space, whereas the ensemble ST requires an
ensemble classifier trained in the feature space. This paper focuses on the
theoretical evidences and the empirical implementation of these two strategies.
The theoretical part guarantees a near-lossless accuracy under some
preconditions while reducing the time complexity. In the empirical part, an
algorithm is proposed as a model implementation of these two strategies. The
superior performance of the proposed algorithm on some experiments shows the
effectiveness of these two strategies.

Title: Fast Generalized Matrix Regression with Applications in Machine Learning
Authors: Haishan Ye, Shusen Wang, Zhihua Zhang, Tong Zhang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Fast matrix algorithms have become the fundamental tools of machine learning
in big data era.
  The generalized matrix regression problem is widely used in the matrix
approximation such as CUR decomposition, kernel matrix approximation, and
stream singular value decomposition (SVD), etc.
  In this paper, we propose a fast generalized matrix regression algorithm
(Fast GMR) which utilizes sketching technique to solve the GMR problem
efficiently.
  Given error parameter $0<\epsilon<1$, the Fast GMR algorithm can achieve a
$(1+\epsilon)$ relative error with the sketching sizes being of order
$\cO(\epsilon^{-1/2})$ for a large group of GMR problems.
  We apply the Fast GMR algorithm to the symmetric positive definite matrix
approximation and single pass singular value decomposition and they achieve a
better performance than conventional algorithms.
  Our empirical study also validates the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed algorithms.

Title: Graduate Employment Prediction with Bias

Categories: cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML
\\
  The failure of landing a job for college students could cause serious social
consequences such as drunkenness and suicide. In addition to academic
performance, unconscious biases can become one key obstacle for hunting jobs
for graduating students. Thus, it is necessary to understand these unconscious
biases so that we can help these students at an early stage with more
personalized intervention. In this paper, we develop a framework, i.e., MAYA
(Multi-mAjor emploYment stAtus) to predict students' employment status while
considering biases. The framework consists of four major components. Firstly,
we solve the heterogeneity of student courses by embedding academic performance
into a unified space. Then, we apply a generative adversarial network (GAN) to
overcome the class imbalance problem. Thirdly, we adopt Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) with a novel dropout mechanism to comprehensively capture sequential
information among semesters. Finally, we design a bias-based regularization to
capture the job market biases. We conduct extensive experiments on a
large-scale educational dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our prediction framework.

Title: Crowdfunding Dynamics Tracking: A Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Jun Wang, Hefu Zhang, Qi Liu, Zhen Pan, Hanqing Tao
Categories: cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML
\\
  Recent years have witnessed the increasing interests in research of
crowdfunding mechanism. In this area, dynamics tracking is a significant issue
but is still under exploration. Existing studies either fit the fluctuations of
time-series or employ regularization terms to constrain learned tendencies.
However, few of them take into account the inherent decision-making process
between investors and crowdfunding dynamics. To address the problem, in this
paper, we propose a Trajectory-based Continuous Control for Crowdfunding (TC3)
algorithm to predict the funding progress in crowdfunding. Specifically,
actor-critic frameworks are employed to model the relationship between
investors and campaigns, where all of the investors are viewed as an agent that
could interact with the environment derived from the real dynamics of
campaigns. Then, to further explore the in-depth implications of patterns
(i.e., typical characters) in funding series, we propose to subdivide them into
$\textit{fast-growing}$ and $\textit{slow-growing}$ ones. Moreover, for the
purpose of switching from different kinds of patterns, the actor component of
TC3 is extended with a structure of options, which comes to the TC3-Options.
Finally, extensive experiments on the Indiegogo dataset not only demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods, but also validate our assumption that the
entire pattern learned by TC3-Options is indeed the U-shaped one.

Title: Efficient Data Analytics on Augmented Similarity Triplets
Authors: Muhammad Ahmad, Muhammad Haroon Shakeel, Sarwan Ali, Imdadullah Khan,

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Many machine learning methods (classification, clustering, etc.) start with a
known kernel that provides similarity or distance measure between two objects.
Recent work has extended this to situations where the information about objects
is limited to comparisons of distances between three objects (triplets). Humans
find the comparison task much easier than the estimation of absolute
similarities, so this kind of data can be easily obtained using crowd-sourcing.
In this work, we give an efficient method of augmenting the triplets data, by
utilizing additional implicit information inferred from the existing data.
Triplets augmentation improves the quality of kernel-based and kernel-free data
analytics tasks. Secondly, we also propose a novel set of algorithms for common
supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks based on triplets. These
methods work directly with triplets, avoiding kernel evaluations. Experimental
evaluation on real and synthetic datasets shows that our methods are more
accurate than the current best-known techniques.

\\
  We present a 3D capsule architecture for processing of point clouds that is
equivariant with respect to the $SO(3)$ rotation group, translation and
permutation of the unordered input sets. The network operates on a sparse set
of local reference frames, computed from an input point cloud and establishes
end-to-end equivariance through a novel 3D quaternion group capsule layer,
including an equivariant dynamic routing procedure. The capsule layer enables
us to disentangle geometry from pose, paving the way for more informative
descriptions and a structured latent space. In the process, we theoretically
connect the process of dynamic routing between capsules to the well-known
Weiszfeld algorithm, a scheme for solving \emph{iterative re-weighted least
squares (IRLS)} problems with provable convergence properties, enabling robust
pose estimation between capsule layers. Due to the sparse equivariant
quaternion capsules, our architecture allows joint object classification and
orientation estimation, which we validate empirically on common benchmark
datasets.

  Shortage of labeled data has been holding the surge of deep learning in
healthcare back, as sample sizes are often small, patient information cannot be
shared openly, and multi-center collaborative studies are a burden to set up.
Distributed machine learning methods promise to mitigate these problems. We
argue for a split learning based approach and apply this distributed learning
method for the first time in the medical field to compare performance against
(1) centrally hosted and (2) non collaborative configurations for a range of
participants. Two medical deep learning tasks are used to compare split
learning to conventional single and multi center approaches: a binary
classification problem of a data set of 9000 fundus photos, and multi-label
classification problem of a data set of 156,535 chest X-rays. The several
distributed learning setups are compared for a range of 1-50 distributed
participants. Performance of the split learning configuration remained constant
for any number of clients compared to a single center study, showing a marked
difference compared to the non collaborative configuration after 2 clients (p <
0.001) for both sets. Our results affirm the benefits of collaborative training
of deep neural networks in health care. Our work proves the significant benefit
of distributed learning in healthcare, and paves the way for future real-world
implementations.

\\
  Patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea are mainly treated with
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Good compliance with this therapy
is broadly accepted as more than 4h of CPAP average use nightly. Although it is
a highly effective treatment, compliance with this therapy is problematic to
achieve with serious consequences for the patients' health. Previous works
already reported factors significantly related to compliance with the therapy.
However, further research is still required to support clinicians to early
anticipate patients' therapy compliance. This work intends to take a further
step in this direction by building compliance classifiers with CPAP therapy at
three different moments of the patient follow-up (i.e. before the therapy
starts and at months 1 and 3 after the baseline). Results of the clinical trial
confirmed that month 3 was the time-point with the most accurate classifier
reaching an f1-score of 87% and 84% in cross-validation and test. At month 1,
performances were almost as high as in month 3 with 82% and 84% of f1-score. At
baseline, where no information about patients' CPAP use was given yet, the best
classifier achieved 73% and 76% of f1-score in cross-validation and test set
respectively. Subsequent analyses carried out with the best classifiers of each
time point revealed that certain baseline factors (i.e. headaches,
psychological symptoms, arterial hypertension and EuroQol visual analogue
scale) were closely related to the prediction of compliance independently of
the time-point. In addition, among the variables taken only during the
follow-up of the patients, Epworth and the average nighttime hours were the
most important to predict compliance with CPAP.

network is learned natively from data alone. This is achieved by modelling the
activation function of each neuron as a small neural network whose weights are
shared by all neurons in the original network. We list our primary findings in

\\
  Many domain adaptation (DA) methods aim to project the source and target
domains into a common feature space, where the inter-domain distributional
differences are reduced and some intra-domain properties preserved. Recent
research obtains their respective new representations using some predefined
statistics. However, they usually formulate the class-wise statistics using the
pseudo hard labels due to no labeled target data, such as class-wise MMD and
class scatter matrice. The probabilities of data points belonging to each class
given by the hard labels are either 0 or 1, while the soft labels could relax
the strong constraint of hard labels and provide a random value between them.
Although existing work have noticed the advantage of soft labels, they either
deal with thoes class-wise statistics inadequately or introduce those small
irrelevant probabilities in soft labels. Therefore, we propose the filtered
soft labels to discard thoes confusing probabilities, then both of the
class-wise MMD and class scatter matrice are modeled in this way. In order to
obtain more accurate filtered soft labels, we take advantage of a well-designed
Graph-based Label Propagation (GLP) method, and incorporate it into the DA
procedure to formulate a unified framework.

Title: Nonlinear Markov Clustering by Minimum Curvilinear Sparse Similarity
Authors: C. Duran, A. Acevedo, S. Ciucci, A. Muscoloni, and CV. Cannistraci
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The development of algorithms for unsupervised pattern recognition by
nonlinear clustering is a notable problem in data science. Markov clustering
(MCL) is a renowned algorithm that simulates stochastic flows on a network of
sample similarities to detect the structural organization of clusters in the
data, but it has never been generalized to deal with data nonlinearity. Minimum
Curvilinearity (MC) is a principle that approximates nonlinear sample distances
in the high-dimensional feature space by curvilinear distances, which are
computed as transversal paths over their minimum spanning tree, and then stored
in a kernel. Here we propose MC-MCL, which is the first nonlinear kernel
extension of MCL and exploits Minimum Curvilinearity to enhance the performance
of MCL in real and synthetic data with underlying nonlinear patterns. MC-MCL is
compared with baseline clustering methods, including DBSCAN, K-means and
affinity propagation. We find that Minimum Curvilinearity provides a valuable
framework to estimate nonlinear distances also when its kernel is applied in
combination with MCL. Indeed, MC-MCL overcomes classical MCL and even baseline
clustering algorithms in different nonlinear datasets.

Title: Predicting Attributes of Nodes Using Network Structure
Authors: Sarwan Ali, Muhammad Haroon Shakeel, Imdadullah Khan, Safiullah
  Faizullah, Muhammad Asad Khan
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In many graphs such as social networks, nodes have associated attributes
representing their behavior. Predicting node attributes in such graphs is an
important problem with applications in many domains like recommendation
systems, privacy preservation, and targeted advertisement. Attributes values
can be predicted by analyzing patterns and correlations among attributes and
employing classification/regression algorithms. However, these approaches do
not utilize readily available network topology information. In this regard,
interconnections between different attributes of nodes can be exploited to
improve the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose an approach to
represent a node by a feature map with respect to an attribute $a_i$ (which is
used as input for machine learning algorithms) using all attributes of
neighbors to predict attributes values for $a_i$. We perform extensive
experimentation on ten real-world datasets and show that the proposed feature
map significantly improves the prediction accuracy as compared to baseline
approaches on these datasets.

Title: A Bi-Level Cooperative Driving Strategy Allowing Lane Changes
Authors: Huile Xu, Yi Zhang, Christos G. Cassandras, Li Li, Shuo Feng
Categories: cs.MA math.OC
\\
  This paper studies the cooperative driving of connected and automated
vehicles (CAVs) at conflict areas (e.g., non-signalized intersections and
ramping regions). Due to safety concerns, most existing studies prohibit lane
change since this may cause lateral collisions when coordination is not
appropriately performed. However, in many traffic scenarios (e.g., work zones),
vehicles must change lanes. To solve this problem, we categorize the potential
collision into two kinds and thus establish a bi-level planning problem. The
right-of-way of vehicles for the critical conflict zone is considered in the
upper-level, and the right-of-way of vehicles during lane changes is then
resolved in the lower-level. The solutions of the upper-level problem are
represented in tree space, and a near-optimal solution is searched for by
combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with some heuristic rules within a
very short planning time. The proposed strategy is suitable for not only the
shortest delay objective but also other objectives (e.g., energy-saving and
passenger comfort). Numerical examples show that the proposed strategy leads to
good traffic performance in real-time.

Title: Monotonicity-preserving finite element schemes with adaptive mesh
  refinement for hyperbolic problems
Authors: Jesus Bonilla and Santiago Badia
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1911.06792
\\
  This work is focused on the extension and assessment of the
monotonicity-preserving scheme in [3] and the local bounds preserving scheme in
[5] to hierarchical octree adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Whereas the former
can readily be used on this kind of meshes, the latter requires some
modifications. A key question that we want to answer in this work is whether to
move from a linear to a nonlinear stabilization mechanism pays the price when
combined with shock-adapted meshes. Whereas nonlinear (or shock-capturing)
stabilization leads to improved accuracy compared to linear schemes, it also
negatively hinders nonlinear convergence, increasing computational cost. We
compare linear and nonlinear schemes in terms of the required computational
time versus accuracy for several steady benchmark problems. Numerical results
indicate that, in general, nonlinear schemes can be cost-effective for
sufficiently refined meshes. Besides, it is also observed that it is better to
refine further around shocks rather than use sharper shock capturing terms,
which usually yield stiffer nonlinear problems. In addition, a new refinement
criterion has been proposed. The proposed criterion is based on the graph
Laplacian used in the definition of the stabilization method. Numerical results
show that this shock detector performs better than the well-known Kelly
estimator for problems with shocks or discontinuities.

Title: Enforcing strong stability of explicit Runge--Kutta methods with
  superviscosity
Authors: Zheng Sun and Chi-Wang Shu

MSC-class: 65L06, 65L20, 65M12, 65M20
\\
  A time discretization method is called strongly stable, if the norm of its
numerical solution is nonincreasing. It is known that, even for linear
semi-negative problems, many explicit Runge--Kutta (RK) methods fail to
preserve this property. In this paper, we enforce strong stability by modifying
the method with superviscosity, which is a numerical technique commonly used in
spectral methods. We propose two approaches, the modified method and the
filtering method for stabilization. The modified method is achieved by
modifying the semi-negative operator with a high order superviscosity term; the
filtering method is to post-process the solution by solving a diffusive or
dispersive problem with small superviscosity. For linear problems, most
explicit RK methods can be stabilized with either approach without accuracy
degeneration. Furthermore, we prove a sharp bound (up to an equal sign) on
diffusive superviscosity for ensuring strong stability. The bound we derived
for general dispersive-diffusive superviscosity is also verified to be sharp
numerically. For nonlinear problems, a filtering method is investigated for
stabilization. Numerical examples with linear non-normal ordinary differential
equation systems and for discontinuous Galerkin approximation of conservation
laws are performed to validate our analysis and to test the performance.

  This paper provides an a priori error analysis of a localized orthogonal
decomposition method (LOD) for the numerical stochastic homogenization of a
model random diffusion problem. If the uniformly elliptic and bounded random
coefficient field of the model problem is stationary and satisfies a
quantitative decorrelation assumption in form of the spectral gap inequality,
then the expected $L^2$ error of the method can be estimated, up to logarithmic
factors, by $H+(\varepsilon/H)^{d/2}$; $\varepsilon$ being the small
correlation length of the random coefficient and $H$ the width of the coarse
finite element mesh that determines the spatial resolution. The proof bridges
recent results of numerical homogenization and quantitative stochastic
homogenization.

  We propose a new spectral method, based on two classes of hat functions, for
solving systems of fractional differential equations. The fractional derivative
is considered in the Caputo sense. Properties of the basis functions, Caputo
derivatives, and Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals, are used to reduce the
main problem to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. By analyzing in
detail the resulting system, we show that the method needs few computational
efforts. Two test problems are considered to illustrate the efficiency and
accuracy of the proposed method. Finally, an application to a recent
mathematical model in epidemiology is given, precisely to a system of
fractional differential equations modeling the respiratory syncytial virus
infection.

Title: Strategies for the vectorized Block Conjugate Gradients method
Authors: Nils-Arne Dreier and Christian Engwer

\\
  Block Krylov methods have recently gained a lot of attraction. Due to their
increased arithmetic intensity they offer a promising way to improve
performance on modern hardware. Recently Frommer et al. presented a block
Krylov framework that combines the advantages of block Krylov methods and data
parallel methods. We review this framework and apply it on the Block Conjugate
Gradients method,to solve linear systems with multiple right hand sides. In
this course we consider challenges that occur on modern hardware, like a
limited memory bandwidth, the use of SIMD instructions and the communication
overhead. We present a performance model to predict the efficiency of different
Block CG variants and compare these with experimental numerical results.

Title: Monotonicity considerations for stabilized DG cut cell schemes for the
  unsteady advection equation
Authors: Florian Streitb\"urger and Christian Engwer and Sandra May and Andreas
  N\"u{\ss}ing
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  For solving unsteady hyperbolic conservation laws on cut cell meshes, the so
called small cell problem is a big issue: one would like to use a time step
that is chosen with respect to the background mesh and use the same time step
on the potentially arbitrarily small cut cells as well. For explicit time
stepping schemes this leads to instabilities. In a recent preprint
[arXiv:1906.05642], we propose penalty terms for stabilizing a DG space
discretization to overcome this issue for the unsteady linear advection
equation. The usage of the proposed stabilization terms results in stable
schemes of first and second order in one and two space dimensions. In one
dimension, for piecewise constant data in space and explicit Euler in time, the
stabilized scheme can even be shown to be monotone. In this contribution, we
will examine the conditions for monotonicity in more detail.

Title: BPX Preconditioners for Isogeometric Analysis Using (Truncated)
  Hierarchical B-splines
Authors: Cesare Bracco, Durkbin Cho, Carlotta Giannelli, Rafael Vazquez
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We present the construction of additive multilevel preconditioners, also
known as BPX preconditioners, for the solution of the linear system arising in
isogeometric adaptive schemes with (truncated) hierarchical B-splines. We show
that the locality of hierarchical spline functions, naturally defined on a
multilevel structure, can be suitably exploited to design and analyze efficient
multilevel decompositions. By obtaining smaller subspaces with respect to
standard tensor-product B-splines, the computational effort on each level is
reduced. We prove that, for suitably graded hierarchical meshes, the condition
number of the preconditioned system is bounded independently of the number of
levels. A selection of numerical examples validates the theoretical results and
the performance of the preconditioner.

Title: Improving the initial guess for the Newton-Raphson protocol in
  time-dependent simulations
Authors: Jasper Volmer, Tom W.J. de Geus, Ron H.J. Peerlings
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  A general linearisation procedure for the consistent tangent of a
small-strain visco-plastic material model is presented in this note. The
procedure is based on multi-variable linearisation around a so-called
'reference state'. In particular, the linerarisation of the time integration
scheme is found to yield an extra term compared to classical expressions, which
only appears because the material response is time-dependent. It has the effect
of yielding a very accurate initial guess for the Newton-Raphson protocol based
on the ongoing viscous flow. It is shown, using a modern variational FFT-based
solver, that the extra term reduces both the CPU time and the number of
Newton-Raphson iterations by around a factor two.

Title: Parameter estimation of temperature dependent material parameters in the

\\
  Accelerated cooling is a key technology in producing thermomechanically
controlled processed (TMCP) steel plates. In a TMCP process hot plates are
subjected to a strong cooling what results in a complex microstructure leading
to increased strength and fracture toughness. The microstructure is strongly
affected by the temperature evolution during the cooling process as well as
residual stresses and flatness deformations. Therefore, the full control
(quantification) of the temperature evolution is very important regarding plate
design and processing. It can only be achieved by a thermophysical
characterization of the material and the cooling system. In this paper, we
focus on the thermophysical characterization of the material parameters.
Mathematically, we consider a specific inverse heat conduction problem. The
temperature evolution of a heated steel plate passing through the cooling
device is modeled by a 1D nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) with
unknown temperature dependent material parameters, which describe the
characteristics of the underlying material. We present a numerical approach to
identify these material parameters up to some canonical ambiguity without any a
priori information.

\\
  This paper presents a complete theory of the relationship between the minimal
bases and indices of rational matrices and those of their strong
linearizations. Such theory is based on establishing first the relationships
between the minimal bases and indices of rational matrices and those of their
polynomial system matrices under the classical minimality condition and certain
additional conditions of properness. These first results extend under different
assumptions pioneer results obtained by Verghese, Van Dooren and Kailath in
1979-80, which have not been sufficiently recognized in the modern literature
in our opinion. Next, it is shown that the definitions of linearizations and
strong linearizations do not guarantee any relationship between the minimal
bases and indices of the linearizations and the rational matrices in general,
since only the total sums of the minimal indices are related to each other in
the strong case. In contrast, if the specific families of strong block minimal
bases linearizations and $\mathbb{M}_1$ and $\mathbb{M}_2$-strong
linearizations are considered, then simple relationships between the minimal
bases and indices of the linearizations and the rational matrices are obtained.
The relevant influence of the work of Paul Van Dooren and coworkers on these
topics is emphasized throughout this paper.

Title: Pruning Deep Neural Networks Architectures with Evolution Strategy
Authors: Francisco Erivaldo Fernandes Junior, Gary G. Yen
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics. Currently, under
  review
\\
  Currently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are used to solve all kinds of
problems in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence due to
their learning and adaptation capabilities. However, most of the successful DNN
models have a high computational complexity, which makes them difficult to
deploy on mobile or embedded platforms. This has prompted many researchers to
develop algorithms and approaches to help reduce the computational complexity
of such models. One of them is called filter pruning where convolution filters
are eliminated to reduce the number of parameters and, consequently, the
computational complexity of the given model. In the present work, we propose a
novel algorithm to perform filter pruning by using Multi-Objective Evolution
Strategy (ES) algorithm, called DeepPruningES. Our approach avoids the need for
using any knowledge during the pruning procedure and helps decision makers by
returning three pruned DNN models with different trade-offs between performance
and computational complexity. We show that DeepPruningES can significantly
reduce a model's computational complexity by testing it on three DNN
architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks, Residual Neural Networks, and
Densely Connected Neural Networks.

\\
  The classical approach of avoiding or ignoring interference in wireless
networks cannot accommodate the ambitious quality-of-service demands of
ultra-dense cellular networks (CNs). However, recent ground-breaking
information-theoretic advances changed our perception of interference from a
foe to a friend. This paper aims to shed light on harnessing the benefits of
integrating modern interference management (IM) schemes into future CNs. To
this end, we envision a hybrid multiple access (HMA) scheme that decomposes the
network into sub-topologies of potential IM schemes for more efficient
utilization of network resources. Preliminary results show that HMA can
multiply non-orthogonal multiple access performance, especially under dense
user deployment.

Title: Reusing Wireless Power Transfer for Backscatter-assisted Relaying in
  WPCNs
Authors: Yuan Zheng, Suzhi Bi, Xiaohui Lin, and Hui Wang
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: This paper has been submitted for potential journal publication
\\
  User cooperation is an effective technique to tackle the severe near-far user
unfairness problem in wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). In this
paper, we consider a WPCN where two collaborating wireless devices (WDs) first
harvest wireless energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then transmit
their information to the HAP. The WD with the stronger WD-to-HAP channel helps
relay the message of the other weaker user. In particular, we exploit the use
of ambient backscatter communication during the wireless energy transfer phase,
where the weaker user backscatters the received energy signal to transmit its
information to the relay user in a passive manner. By doing so, the relay user
can reuse the energy signal for simultaneous energy harvesting and information
decoding (e.g., using an energy detector). Compared to active information
transmission in conventional WPCNs, the proposed method effectively saves the
energy and time consumed by the weaker user on information transmission during
cooperation. With the proposed backscatter-assisted relaying scheme, we jointly
optimize the time and power allocations on wireless energy and information
transmissions to maximize the common throughput. Specifically, we derive the
semi-closed-form expressions of the optimal solution and propose a
low-complexity optimal algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem. By
comparing with some representative benchmark methods, we simulate under
extensive network setups and demonstrate that the proposed cooperation method
effectively improves the throughput performance in WPCNs.

Title: Make TCP Great (again?!) in Cellular Networks: A Deep Reinforcement
  Learning Approach
Authors: Soheil Abbasloo, Chen-Yu Yen, H. Jonathan Chao
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Can we instead of designing just another new TCP, design a TCP
\textit{plug-in} which can boost the performance of the existing/future TCP
designs in cellular networks? To answer this question, we introduce DeepCC
plug-in. DeepCC leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a modern
decision-making tool, to steer TCP toward achieving applications' desired delay
and high throughput in a highly dynamic network such as the cellular network.
The fact that DeepCC does not try to reinvent/replace TCP but aims to boost the
performance of it differentiates it from the most (if not all) of the existing
reinforcement learning (RL) systems where RL systems are considered clean-slate
alternative designs replacing the traditional ones.
  We used DeepCC plug-in to boost the performance of various old and new TCP
schemes including TCP Cubic, Google's BBR, TCP Westwood, and TCP Illinois in
cellular networks. Through both extensive trace-based evaluations and in-field
tests, we show that not only DeepCC can significantly improve the performance
of TCP, but also after accompanied by DeepCC, these schemes can outperform
state-of-the-art TCP protocols including Aurora, Sprout, Verus, C2TCP, Copa,
Indigo, Remy, PCC-Vivace, and LEDBAT in cellular networks.

Title: Temperature-Aware Virtual Data Center Embedding to Avoid Hot Spots in
  Data Centers
Authors: Chao Guo, Kai Xu, Gangxiang Shen, Moshe Zukerman
Categories: cs.NI cs.DC
Comments: 30 pages
\\
  Virtual Data Center (VDC) embedding has drawn significant attention recently
because of growing need for efficient and flexible means of Data Center (DC)
resource allocation. Existing studies on VDC embedding mainly focus on
improving DCs' resource utilization. However, an important problem that has not
been considered in VDC embedding solutions is the creation of hot spots by
excessive heat dissipation and hot air generation from racks in DCs, which have
significant adverse effect on energy consumption of the cooling system and IT
equipment lifespan. To address this issue, we propose a temperature-aware VDC
embedding scheme to avoid hot spots by minimizing the maximum temperature of
hot air emitted from each rack. Meanwhile, we also aim to reduce the total
power consumption of IT equipment in this scheme. A Mixed Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) model and a heuristic algorithm are developed to implement
the proposed VDC embedding scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed

load-balanced embedding scheme in terms of maximum rack temperature, total
power consumption of IT equipment, and VDC rejection ratio.

Title: Fault Tolerance in SDN Data Plane Considering Network and Application
  Based Metrics

\\
  Failures in networks result in service disruptions which may cause
deteriorated Quality of Service (QoS) for the end users. Since SDN is becoming
the mainstream paradigm for networks, implementation of a robust fault
tolerance scheme for SDN-based networks is crucial. Existing SDN data plane
fault tolerance approaches can be classified as reactive and proactive which
may or may not rely on the controller, respectively. However, none of them
qualifies as a complete solution, providing only partial remedies. In this
work, we propose Dynamic Protection with Quality of Alternative Paths (DPQoAP)
that considers not only the existing faults within the network but also the
quality of alternative paths. As a result, we can sustain the QoS throughout
the network after the recovery. We also investigate how application based
parameters are affected by link failures. To this end, we explore the change in
Quality of Experience (QoE) caused by link failures under different cases using
Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) for video streaming. On the other
hand, even though DASH is proposed as a solution to improve the QoE affected by
the dynamic conditions of the networks, it remains insufficient to handle the
congested links that show the symptoms of a link failure. Thus, we apply the
data plane fault tolerance approach in SDN to improve the QoE of DASH clients
in the case of congestion as well as the failure. The performance of the
proposed solutions are evaluated through various experiments considering the
QoS and QoE parameters. It is observed that DPQoAP enhances the efficiency of
the networking operations and adaptability of the applications.

Title: On Network Traffic Forecasting using Autoregressive Models
Authors: Do\u{g}analp Ergen\c{c} and Ertan Onur
Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
\\
  Various statistical analysis methods are studied for years to extract
accurate trends of network traffic and predict the future load mainly to
allocate required resources. Besides, many stochastic modeling techniques are
offered to represent fundamental characteristics of different types of network
traffic. In this study, we analyze autoregressive traffic forecasting
techniques considering their popularity and wide-use in the domain. In
comparison to similar works, we present important traffic characteristics and
discussions from the literature to create a self-consistent guidance along with
the survey. Then, we approach to techniques in the literature revealing which
network characteristics they can capture offering a characteristic-based
framework. Most importantly, we aim to fill the gap between the statistical
analysis of those methods and their relevance with networking by discussing
significant aspects and requirements for accurate forecasting from a
network-telemetric perspective.

\\
  A classic graph coloring problem is to assign colors to vertices of any graph
so that distinct colors are assigned to adjacent vertices. Optimal graph
coloring colors a graph with a minimum number of colors, which is its chromatic
number. Finding out the chromatic number is a combinatorial optimization
problem proven to be computationally intractable, which implies that no
algorithm that computes large instances of the problem in a reasonable time is
known. For this reason, approximate methods and metaheuristics form a set of
techniques that do not guarantee optimality but obtain good solutions in a
reasonable time. This paper reports a comparative study of the Hill-Climbing,
Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, and Iterated Local Search metaheuristics for
the classic graph coloring problem considering its time efficiency for
processing the DSJC125 and DSJC250 instances of the DIMACS benchmark.

Title: Performance benefits of Intel(R) OptaneTM DC persistent memory for the
  parallel processing of large neuroimaging data
Authors: Valerie Hayot-Sasson, Shawn T Brown and Tristan Glatard
Categories: cs.PF
\\
  Open-access neuroimaging datasets have reached petabyte scale, and continue
to grow. The ability to leverage the entirety of these datasets is limited to a
restricted number of labs with both the capacity and infrastructure to process
the data. Whereas Big Data engines have significantly reduced application
performance penalties with respect to data movement, their applied strategies
(e.g. data locality, in-memory computing and lazy evaluation) are not
necessarily practical within neuroimaging workflows where intermediary results
may need to be materialized to shared storage for post-processing analysis. In
this paper we evaluate the performance advantage brought by Intel(R) OptaneTM
DC persistent memory for the processing of large neuroimaging datasets using
the two available configurations modes: Memory mode and App Direct mode. We
employ a synthetic algorithm on the 76 GiB and 603 GiB BigBrain, as well as
apply a standard neuroimaging application on the Consortium for Reliability and
Reproducibility (CoRR) dataset using 25 and 96 parallel processes in both
cases. Our results show that the performance of applications leveraging
persistent memory is superior to that of other storage devices,with the
exception of DRAM. This is the case in both Memory and App Direct mode and
irrespective of the amount of data and parallelism. Furthermore, persistent
memory in App Direct mode is believed to benefit from the use of DRAM as a
cache for writing when output data is significantly smaller than available
memory. We believe the use of persistent memory will be beneficial to both
neuroimaging applications running on HPC or visualization of large,
high-resolution images.

Title: GASOL: Gas Analysis and Optimization for Ethereum Smart Contracts
Authors: Elvira Albert and Jes\'us Correas and Pablo Gordillo and Guillermo

Categories: cs.PL
\\
  We present the main concepts, components, and usage of GASOL, a Gas AnalysiS
and Optimization tooL for Ethereum smart contracts. GASOL offers a wide variety
of cost models that allow inferring the gas consumption associated to selected
types of EVM instructions and/or inferring the number of times that such types
of bytecode instructions are executed. Among others, we have cost models to
measure only storage opcodes, to measure a selected family of gas-consumption
opcodes following the Ethereum's classification, to estimate the cost of a
selected program line, etc. After choosing the desired cost model and the
function of interest, GASOL returns to the user an upper bound of the cost for
this function. As the gas consumption is often dominated by the instructions
that access the storage, GASOL uses the gas analysis to detect under-optimized
storage patterns, and includes an (optional) automatic optimization of the
selected function. Our tool can be used within an Eclipse plugin for Solidity
which displays the gas and instructions bounds and, when applicable, the
gas-optimized Solidity function.

Authors: Utpal Bora, Santanu Das, Pankaj Kureja, Saurabh Joshi, Ramakrishna

Categories: cs.PL cs.SE
\\
  In the era of Exascale computing, writing efficient parallel programs is
indispensable and at the same time, writing sound parallel programs is highly
difficult. While parallel programming is easier with frameworks such as OpenMP,
the possibility of data races in these programs still persists. In this paper,
we propose a fast, lightweight, language agnostic, and static data race checker
for OpenMP programs based on the LLVM compiler framework. We compare our tool
with other state-of-the-art data race checkers on a variety of well-established
benchmarks. We show that the precision, accuracy, and the F1 score of our tool
is comparable to other checkers while being orders of magnitude faster. To the
best of our knowledge, this work is the only tool among the state-of-the-art
data race checkers that can verify a FORTRAN program to be datarace free.

Title: Invariant Cubature Kalman Filter for Monocular Visual Inertial Odometry
  with Line Features
Authors: Deli Yan, Chunhui Wu, Weiming Wang, Yu Song and Shaohua Li
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  To achieve robust and accurate state estimation for robot navigation, we
propose a novel Visual Inertial Odometry(VIO) algorithm with line features upon
the theory of invariant Kalman filtering and Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In
contrast with conventional CKF, the state of the filter is constructed by a
high dimensional Matrix Lie group and the uncertainty is represented using Lie
algebra. To improve the robustness of system in challenging scenes, e.g.
low-texture or illumination changing environments, line features are brought
into the state variable. In the proposed algorithm, exponential mapping of Lie
algebra is used to construct the cubature points and the re-projection errors
of lines are built as observation function for updating the state. This method
accurately describes the system uncertainty in rotation and reduces the
linearization error of system, which extends traditional CKF from Euclidean
space to manifold. It not only inherits the advantages of invariant filtering
in consistency, but also avoids the complex Jacobian calculation of
high-dimensional matrix. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm, we compare it with the state-of-the-art filtering-based VIO
algorithms on Euroc datasets. And the results show that the proposed algorithm
is effective in improving accuracy and robustness of estimation.

Title: Autonomous Removal of Perspective Distortion for Robotic Elevator Button
  Recognition
Authors: Delong Zhu, Jianbang Liu, Nachuan Ma, Zhe Min, and Max Q.-H. Meng
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Elevator button recognition is considered an indispensable function for
enabling the autonomous elevator operation of mobile robots. However, due to
unfavorable image conditions and various image distortions, the recognition
accuracy remains to be improved. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm
that can autonomously correct perspective distortions of elevator panel images.
The algorithm first leverages the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to conduct a
grid fitting process based on button recognition results, then utilizes the
estimated grid centers as reference features to estimate camera motions for
correcting perspective distortions. The algorithm performs on a single image
autonomously and does not need explicit feature detection or feature matching
procedure, which is much more robust to noises and outliers than traditional
feature-based geometric approaches. To verify the effectiveness of the
algorithm, we collect an elevator panel dataset of 50 images captured from
different angles of view. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
can accurately estimate camera motions and effectively remove perspective
distortions.

Comments: 6 Pages, 7 Figures. CISRAM 2019 (9th IEEE Conference on Cybernetics
  and Intelligent Systems, Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics)
\\
  The demand for mobile robots has rapidly increased in recent years due to the
flexibility and high variety of application fields comparing to static robots.
To deal with complex tasks such as navigation, they work with high amounts of
different sensor data making it difficult to operate with for non-experts. To
enhance user understanding and human robot interaction, we propose an approach
to visualize the navigation stack within a cutting edge 3D Augmented Reality
device -- the Microsoft Hololens. Therefore, relevant navigation stack data
including laser scan, environment map and path planing data are visualized in
3D within the head mounted device. Based on that prototype, we evaluate the
Hololens in terms of computational capabilities and limitations for dealing
with huge amount of real-time data. Results show that the Hololens is capable
of a proper visualization of huge amounts of sensor data. We demonstrate a
proper visualization of navigation stack data in 3D within the Hololens.
However, there are limitations when transferring and displaying different kinds
of data simultaneously.

Title: Federated Imitation Learning: A Novel Framework for Cloud Robotic

Authors: Boyi Liu, Lujia Wang, Ming Liu, Cheng-Zhong Xu

Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1909.00895
\\
  Humans are capable of learning a new behavior by observing others to perform
the skill. Similarly, robots can also implement this by imitation learning.
Furthermore, if with external guidance, humans can master the new behavior more
efficiently. So, how can robots achieve this? To address the issue, we present
a novel framework named FIL. It provides a heterogeneous knowledge fusion
mechanism for cloud robotic systems. Then, a knowledge fusion algorithm in FIL
is proposed. It enables the cloud to fuse heterogeneous knowledge from local
robots and generate guide models for robots with service requests. After that,
we introduce a knowledge transfer scheme to facilitate local robots acquiring
knowledge from the cloud. With FIL, a robot is capable of utilizing knowledge
from other robots to increase its imitation learning in accuracy and
efficiency. Compared with transfer learning and meta-learning, FIL is more
suitable to be deployed in cloud robotic systems. Finally, we conduct
experiments of a self-driving task for robots (cars). The experimental results
demonstrate that the shared model generated by FIL increases imitation learning
efficiency of local robots in cloud robotic systems.

\\
  Vision-based urban driving is hard. The autonomous system needs to learn to
perceive the world and act in it. We show that this challenging learning
problem can be simplified by decomposing it into two stages. We first train an
agent that has access to privileged information. This privileged agent cheats
by observing the ground-truth layout of the environment and the positions of
all traffic participants. In the second stage, the privileged agent acts as a
teacher that trains a purely vision-based sensorimotor agent. The resulting
sensorimotor agent does not have access to any privileged information and does
not cheat. This two-stage training procedure is counter-intuitive at first, but
has a number of important advantages that we analyze and empirically
demonstrate. We use the presented approach to train a vision-based autonomous
driving system that substantially outperforms the state of the art on the CARLA
benchmark and the recent NoCrash benchmark. Our approach achieves, for the
first time, 100% success rate on all tasks in the original CARLA benchmark,
sets a new record on the NoCrash benchmark, and reduces the frequency of
infractions by an order of magnitude compared to the prior state of the art.

Title: Towards identification of explicit solutions to overdetermined systems
  of differential equations
Authors: Maxim Zaytsev, V'yacheslav Akkerman
Categories: cs.SC
\\
  The authors proposed a general way to find particular solutions for
overdetermined systems of PDEs previously, where the number of equations is
greater than the number of unknown functions. In this paper, we propose an
algorithm for finding solutions for overdetermined PDE systems, where we use a
method for finding an explicit solution for overdetermined algebraic
(polynomial) equations. Using this algorithm, the solution of some
overdetermined PDE systems can be obtained in explicit form. The main
difficulty of this algorithm is the huge number of polynomial equations that
arise, which need to be investigated and solved numerically or explicitly. For
example, the overdetermined hydrodynamic equations obtained earlier by the
authors give a minimum of 10 million such equations. However, if they are
solved explicitly, then we can write out the solution of the hydrodynamic
equations in a general form, which is of great scientific interest.

Authors: Jasdeep Singh Grover
Categories: cs.SC
Comments: 11 pages, 12 figures
MSC-class: 03E20, 00A06, 00A66
\\
  Basic principles of set theory have been applied in the context of
probability and binary computation. Applying the same principles on
inequalities is less common but can be extremely beneficial in a variety of
fields. This paper formulates a novel approach to directly apply set operations
on inequalities to produce resultant inequalities with differentiable
boundaries. The suggested approach uses inequalities of the form Ei:
fi(x1,x2,..,xn) and an expression of set operations in terms of Ei like, (E1
and E2) or E3, or can be in any standard form like the Conjunctive Normal Form
(CNF) to produce an inequality F(x1,x2,..,xn)<=1 which represents the resulting
bounded region from the expressions and has a differentiable boundary. To
ensure differentiability of the solution, a trade-off between representation
accuracy and curvature at borders (especially corners) is made. A set of
parameters is introduced which can be fine-tuned to improve the accuracy of
this approach. The various applications of the suggested approach have also
been discussed which range from computer graphics to modern machine learning
systems to fascinating demonstrations for educational purposes (current use). A
python script to parse such expressions is also provided.

\\
  Utterance-level permutation invariant training (uPIT) has achieved promising
progress on single-channel multi-talker speech separation task. Long short-term
memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) are widely used as the separation
networks of uPIT, i.e. uPIT-LSTM and uPIT-BLSTM. uPIT-LSTM has lower latency
but worse performance, while uPIT-BLSTM has better performance but higher
latency. In this paper, we propose using latency-controlled BLSTM (LC-BLSTM)
during inference to fulfill low-latency and good-performance speech separation.
To find a better training strategy for BLSTM-based separation network,
chunk-level PIT (cPIT) and uPIT are compared. The experimental results show
that uPIT outperforms cPIT when LC-BLSTM is used during inference. It is also
found that the inter-chunk speaker tracing (ST) can further improve the
separation performance of uPIT-LC-BLSTM. Evaluated on the WSJ0 two-talker
mixed-speech separation task, the absolute gap of signal-to-distortion ratio
(SDR) between uPIT-BLSTM and uPIT-LC-BLSTM is reduced to within 0.7 dB.

\\
  With the recent advancements of deep learning technologies, the performance
of voice conversion (VC) in terms of quality and similarity has been
significantly improved. However, heavy computations are generally required for
deep-learning-based VC systems, which can cause notable latency and thus
confine their deployments in real-world applications. Therefore, increasing
online computation efficiency has become an important task. In this study, we
propose a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE) based VC system. The MoE model uses a
gating mechanism to specify optimal weights to feature maps to increase VC
performance. In addition, assigning sparse constraints on the gating mechanism
can accelerate online computation by skipping the convolution process by
zeroing out redundant feature maps. Experimental results show that by
specifying suitable sparse constraints, we can effectively increase the online
computation efficiency with a notable 70% FLOPs (floating-point operations per
second) reduction while improving the VC performance in both objective
evaluations and human listening tests.

Title: Deep progressive multi-scale attention for acoustic event classification
Authors: Xugang Lu, Peng Shen, Sheng Li, Yu Tsao, Hisashi Kawai
Categories: cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS
\\
  Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an indispensable building block for
designing a state of the art system for acoustic event classification (AEC). By
stacking multiple CNN layers, the model could explore long-range dependency of
explored features in top layers with increasing of feature abstraction. However
it is also possible that the discriminative features with short-range
dependency which are distributed locally are smooth out in the final
representation. In this paper, we propose a progressive multi-scale attention
(MSA) model which explicitly integrates multi-scale features with short- and
long-range dependency in feature extraction. Based on mathematic formulations,
we revealed that the conventional residual CNN (ResCNN) model could be
explained as a special case of the proposed MSA model, and the MSA model could
use the ResCNN as a backbone with an attentive feature weighting in consecutive
scales. The discriminative features in multi-scales are progressively
propagated to top layers for the final representation. Therefore, the final
representation encodes multi-scale features with local and global
discriminative structures which are expected to improve the performance. We
tested the proposed model on two AEC data corpora, one is for urban acoustic
event classification task, the other is for acoustic event detection in smart
car environments. Our results showed that the proposed MSA model effectively
improved the performance on the current state-of-the-art deep learning
algorithms.

  Converting time domain waveforms to frequency domain spectrograms is

This approach, however, has several drawbacks. First, it takes a lot of hard
disk space to store different frequency domain representations. This is
especially true during the model development and tuning process, when exploring
various types of spectrograms for optimal performance. Second, if another
dataset is used, one must process all the audio clips again before the network
can be retrained. In this paper, we integrate the time domain to frequency
domain conversion as part of the model structure, and propose a neural network
based toolbox, nnAudio, which leverages 1D convolutional neural networks to
perform time domain to frequency domain conversion during feed-forward. It
allows on-the-fly spectrogram generation without the need to store any
spectrograms on the disk. This approach also allows back-propagation on the
waveforms-to-spectrograms transformation layer, which implies that this
transformation process can be made trainable, and hence further optimized by
gradient descent. nnAudio reduces the waveforms-to-spectrograms conversion time
for 1,770 waveforms (from the MAPS dataset) from $10.64$ seconds with librosa
to only $0.001$ seconds for Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), 18.3 seconds
to 0.015 seconds for Mel spectrogram, $103.4$ seconds to 0.258 for constant-Q
transform (CQT), when using GPU on our DGX work station with CPU: Intel(R)
Xeon(R) CPU E5-2698 v4 @ 2.20GHz Tesla v100 32Gb GPUs. (Only 1 GPU is being
used for all the experiments.) We also further optimize the existing CQT
algorithm, so that the CQT spectrogram can be obtained without aliasing in a
much faster computation time (from $0.258$ seconds to only 0.001 seconds).

Title: The Evolution of Empirical Methods in Software Engineering
Authors: Michael Felderer, Guilherme Horta Travassos
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Empirical methods like experimentation have become a powerful means to drive
the field of software engineering by creating scientific evidence on software
development, operation, and maintenance, but also by supporting practitioners
in their decision making and learning. Today empirical methods are fully
applied in software engineering. However, they have developed in several
iterations since the 1960s. In this chapter we tell the history of empirical
software engineering and present the evolution of empirical methods in software
engineering in five iterations, i.e., (1) mid-1960s to mid-1970s, (2) mid-1970s
to mid-1980s, (3) mid-1980s to end of the 1990s, (4) the 2000s, and (5) the
2010s. We present the five iterations of the development of empirical software
engineering mainly from a methodological perspective and additionally take key
papers, venues, and books, which are covered in chronological order in a
separate section on recommended further readings, into account. We complement
our presentation of the evolution of empirical software engineering by
presenting the current situation and an outlook in Sect. 4 and the available
books on empirical software engineering Furthermore, based on the chapters
covered in this book we discuss trends on contemporary empirical methods in
software engineering related to the plurality of research methods, human
factors, data collection and processing, aggregation and synthesis of evidence,
and impact of software engineering research.

Title: A taxonomy of risk-based testing
Authors: Michael Felderer, Ina Schieferdecker
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1801.06812
\\
  Software testing has often to be done under severe pressure due to limited
resources and a challenging time schedule facing the demand to assure the
fulfillment of the software requirements. In addition, testing should unveil
those software defects that harm the mission-critical functions of the
software. Risk-based testing uses risk (re-)assessments to steer all phases of
the test process in order to optimize testing efforts and limit risks of the
software-based system. Due to its importance and high practical relevance
several risk-based testing approaches were proposed in academia and industry.
This paper presents a taxonomy of risk-based testing providing a framework to
understand, categorize, assess, and compare risk-based testing approaches to
support their selection and tailoring for specific purposes. The taxonomy is
aligned with the consideration of risks in all phases of the test process and
consists of the top-level classes risk drivers, risk assessment, and risk-based
test process. The taxonomy of risk-based testing has been developed by
analyzing the work presented in available publications on risk-based testing.
Afterwards, it has been applied to the work on risk-based testing presented in
this special section of the International Journal on Software Tools for
Technology Transfer.

  Most important reason for project failure is poor effort estimation. Software
development effort estimation is needed for assigning appropriate team members
for development, allocating resources for software development, binding etc.
Inaccurate software estimation may lead to delay in project, over-budget or
cancellation of the project. But the effort estimation models are not very
efficient. In this paper, we are analyzing the new approach for estimation i.e.
Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS). It is a mixture model that consolidates
the components of artificial neural network with fuzzy logic for giving a
better estimation.

Title: Ranking Users in Social Networks with Motif-based PageRank
Authors: Huan Zhao, Xiaogang Xu, Yangqiu Song, Dik Lun Lee, Zhao Chen and Han

Categories: cs.SI
Comments: Accepted in TKDE 2019
\\
  PageRank has been widely used to measure the authority or the influence of a
user in social networks. However, conventional PageRank only makes use of
edge-based relations, which represent first-order relations between two
connected nodes. It ignores higher-order relations that may exist between
nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, motif-based PageRank (MPR),
to incorporate higher-order relations into the conventional PageRank
computation. Motifs are subgraphs consisting of a small number of nodes. We use
motifs to capture higher-order relations between nodes in a network and
introduce two methods, one linear and one non-linear, to combine PageRank with
higher-order relations. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world
networks, namely, DBLP, Epinions, and Ciao. We study different types of motifs,
including 3-node simple and anchor motifs, 4-node and 5-node motifs. Besides
using single motif, we also run MPR with ensemble of multiple motifs. We also
design a learning task to evaluate the abilities of authority prediction with
motif-based features. All experimental results demonstrate that MPR can
significantly improve the performance of user ranking in social networks
compared to the baseline methods.

Title: Analysis of Reference and Citation Copying in Evolving Bibliographic
  Networks

Categories: cs.SI cs.DL physics.soc-ph
Comments: Accepted in Journal of Informetrics
\\
  Extensive literature demonstrates how the copying of references (links) can
lead to the emergence of various structural properties (e.g., power-law degree
distribution and bipartite cores) in bibliographic and other similar directed
networks. However, it is also well known that the copying process is incapable
of mimicking the number of directed triangles in such networks; neither does it
have the power to explain the obsolescence of older papers. In this paper, we
propose RefOrCite, a new model that allows for copying of both the references
from (i.e., out-neighbors of) as well as the citations to (i.e., in-neighbors
of) an existing node. In contrast, the standard copying model (CP) only copies
references. While retaining its spirit, RefOrCite differs from the Forest Fire
(FF) model in ways that makes RefOrCite amenable to mean-field analysis for
degree distribution, triangle count, and densification. Empirically, RefOrCite
gives the best overall agreement with observed degree distribution, triangle
count, diameter, h-index, and the growth of citations to newer papers.

\\
  Bitcoin is by far the most popular crypto-currency solution enabling
peer-to-peer payments. Despite some studies highlighting the network does not
provide full anonymity, it is still being heavily used for a wide variety of
dubious financial activities such as money laundering, ponzi schemes, and
ransom-ware payments. In this paper, we explore the landscape of potential
money laundering activities occurring across the Bitcoin network. Using data
collected over three years, we create transaction graphs and provide an
in-depth analysis on various graph characteristics to differentiate money
laundering transactions from regular transactions. We found that the main
difference between laundering and regular transactions lies in their output
values and neighbourhood information. Then, we propose and evaluate a set of
classifiers based on four types of graph features: immediate neighbours,
curated features, deepwalk embeddings, and node2vec embeddings to classify
money laundering and regular transactions. Results show that the node2vec-based
classifier outperforms other classifiers in binary classification reaching an
average accuracy of 92.29% and an F1-measure of 0.93 and high robustness over a
2.5-year time span. Finally, we demonstrate how effective our classifiers are
in discovering unknown laundering services. The classifier performance dropped
compared to binary classification, however, the prediction can be improved with
simple ensemble techniques for some services.

Title: Combinatorial Trace Method for Network Immunization

Categories: cs.SI cs.DM
\\
  Immunizing a subset of nodes in a network - enabling them to identify and
withstand the spread of harmful content - is one of the most effective ways to
counter the spread of malicious content. It has applications in network
security, public health policy, and social media surveillance. Finding a subset
of nodes whose immunization results in the least vulnerability of the network
is a computationally challenging task. In this work, we establish a
relationship between a widely used network vulnerability measure and the
combinatorial properties of networks. Using this relationship and graph
summarization techniques, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm to
find a set of nodes to immunize. We provide theoretical justifications for the
proposed solution and analytical bounds on the runtime of our algorithm. We
empirically demonstrate on various real-world networks that the performance of
our algorithm is an order of magnitude better than the state of the art
solution. We also show that in practice the runtime of our algorithm is
significantly lower than that of the best-known solution.

\\
  Today, many companies take advantage of viral marketing to promote their new
products, and since there are several competing companies in many markets,
Competitive Influence Maximization has attracted much attention. Two categories
of studies exist in the literature. First, studies that focus on which nodes
from the network to select considering the existence of the opponents. Second,
studies that focus on the problem of budget allocation. In this work, we
integrate these two lines of research and propose a new scenario where
competition happens in two phases. First, parties identify the most influential
nodes of the network. Then they compete over only these influential nodes by
the amount of budget they allocate to each node. We provide a strong motivation
for this integration. Also, in previous budget allocation studies, any fraction
of the budget could be allocated to a node, which means that the action space
was continuous. However, in our scenario, we consider that the action space is
discrete. This consideration is far more realistic, and it significantly
changes the problem. We model the scenario as a game and propose a novel
framework for calculating the Nash equilibrium. Notably, building an efficient
framework for this problem with such a huge action space and also handling the
stochastic environment of influence maximization is very challenging. To tackle
these difficulties, we devise a new payoff estimation method and a novel best
response oracle to boost the efficiency of our framework. Also, we validate
each aspect of our work through extensive experiments.

  Most of nonlinear robust control methods just consider the affine nonlinear
nominal model. When the nominal model is assumed to be affine nonlinear,
available information about existing non-affine nonlinearities is ignored. For
non-affine nonlinear system, Li et al. (2019) proposes a new nonlinear control
method to solve the robust stabilization problem with estimation of the robust
closed-loop DOA (Domain of attraction). However, Li et al. (2019) assumes that
the Lyapunov function is given and does not consider the problem of finding a
good Lyapunov function to enlarge the estimate of the robust closed-loop DOA.
The motivation of this paper is to enlarge the estimate of the closed-loop DOA
by selecting an appropriate Lyapunov function. To achieve this goal, a solvable
optimization problem is formulated to select an appropriate Lyapunov function
from a parameterized positive-definite function set. The effectiveness of
proposed method is verified by numerical results.

Title: Compositional Abstraction-based Synthesis for Networks of Stochastic

\\
  In this paper, we provide a compositional approach for constructing finite
abstractions (a.k.a. finite Markov decision processes (MDPs)) of interconnected
discrete-time stochastic switched systems. The proposed framework is based on a
notion of stochastic simulation functions, using which one can employ an
abstract system as a substitution of the original one in the controller design
process with guaranteed error bounds on their output trajectories. To this end,
we first provide probabilistic closeness guarantees between the interconnection
of stochastic switched subsystems and that of their finite abstractions via
stochastic simulation functions. We then leverage sufficient small-gain type
conditions to show compositionality results of this work. Afterwards, we show
that under standard assumptions ensuring incremental input-to-state stability
of switched systems (i.e., existence of common incremental Lyapunov functions,
or multiple incremental Lyapunov functions with dwell-time), one can construct
finite MDPs for the general setting of nonlinear stochastic switched systems.
We also propose an approach to construct finite MDPs for a particular class of
nonlinear stochastic switched systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed results, we first apply our approaches to a road traffic network in a
circular cascade ring composed of 200 cells, and construct compositionally a
finite MDP of the network. We employ the constructed finite abstractions as
substitutes to compositionally synthesize policies keeping the density of the
traffic lower than 20 vehicles per cell. We then apply our proposed techniques
to a fully interconnected network of 500 nonlinear subsystems (totally 1000
dimensions), and construct their finite MDPs with guaranteed error bounds. We
compare our proposed results with those available in the literature.

Title: Exploration of the Applicability of Probabilistic Inference for Learning
  Control in Underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
Authors: Wilmer Ariza Ramirez, Zhi Q. Leong, Hung D. Nguyen, and S.G.

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Underwater vehicles are employed in the exploration of dynamic environments
where tuning of a specific controller for each task would be time-consuming and
unreliable as the controller depends on calculated mathematical coefficients in
idealised conditions. For such a case, learning task from experience can be a
useful alternative. This paper explores the capability of probabilistic
inference learning to control autonomous underwater vehicles that can be used
for different tasks without re-programming the controller. Probabilistic
inference learning uses a Gaussian process model of the real vehicle to learn
the correct policy with a small number of real field experiments. The use of
probabilistic reinforced learning looks for a simple implementation of
controllers without the burden of coefficients calculation, controller tuning
or system identification. A series of computational simulations were employed
to test the applicability of model-based reinforced learning in underwater
vehicles. Three simulation scenarios were evaluated: waypoint tracking, depth
control and 3D path tracking control. The 3D path tracking is done by coupling
together a line-of-sight law with probabilistic inference for learning control.
As a comparison study LOS-PILCO algorithm can perform better than a robust
LOS-PID. The results shows that probabilistic model based reinforced learning
is a possible solution to motion control of underactuated AUVs as can generate
capable policies with minimum quantity of episodes.

Title: Learning and Prediction Theory of Distributed Least Squares

MSC-class: 93E24, 93E35, 93E10
\\
  With the fast development of the sensor and network technology, distributed
estimation has attracted more and more attention, due to its capability in
securing communication, in sustaining scalability, and in enhancing safety and
privacy. In this paper, we consider a least-squares (LS)-based distributed
algorithm build on a sensor network to estimate an unknown parameter vector of
a dynamical system, where each sensor in the network has partial information
only but is allowed to communicate with its neighbors. Our main task is to
generalize the well-known theoretical results on the traditional LS to the
current distributed case by establishing both the upper bound of the
accumulated regrets of the adaptive predictor and the convergence of the
distributed LS estimator, with the following key features compared with the
existing literature on distributed estimation: Firstly, our theory does not
need the previously imposed independence, stationarity or Gaussian property on
the system signals, and hence is applicable to stochastic systems with feedback
control. Secondly, the cooperative excitation condition introduced and used in
this paper for the convergence of the distributed LS estimate is the weakest
possible one, which shows that even if any individual sensor cannot estimate
the unknown parameter by the traditional LS, the whole network can still
fulfill the estimation task by the distributed LS. Moreover, our theoretical
analysis is also different from the existing ones for distributed LS, because
it is an integration of several powerful techniques including stochastic
Lyapunov functions, martingale convergence theorems, and some inequalities on
convex combination of nonnegative definite matrices.

Comments: 13 Pages, 21 Figures
\\
  Smart buildings are the need of the day with increasing demand-supply ratios
and deficiency to generate considerably. In any modern non-industrial
infrastructure, these demands mainly comprise of thermostatically controlled
loads (TCLs), which can be manoeuvred. TCL loads like air-conditioner, heater,
refrigerator, are ubiquitous, and their operating times can be controlled to
achieve desired aggregate power. This power aggregation, in turn, helps achieve
load management targets and thereby serve as ancillary service (AS) to the
power grid. In this work, a distributed averaging protocol is used to achieve
the desired power aggregate set by the utility using steady-state
desynchronization. The results are verified using a computer program for a
homogeneous and heterogeneous population of TCLs. Further, load following
scenario has been implemented using the utility as a reference. Apart from
providing a significant AS to the power grid, the proposed idea also helps
reduce the amplitude of power system oscillations imparted by the TCLs.
Hardware-based results are obtained to verify its implementation feasibility in
real-time. Additionally, we extend this idea to data-driven paradigm and
provide comparisons therein.

\\
  In this paper, the stabilization problem with closed-loop domain of
attraction (DOA) enlargement for discrete-time general nonlinear plants is
solved. First, a sufficient condition for asymptotic stabilization and
estimation of the closed-loop DOA is given. It shows that, for a given Lyapunov
function, the negative-definite and invariant set in the state-control space is
a stabilizing controller set and its projection along the control space to the
state space can be an estimate of the closed-loop DOA. Then, an algorithm is
proposed to approximate the negative-definite and invariant set for the given
Lyapunov function, in which an interval analysis algorithm is used to find an
inner approximation of sets as precise as desired. Finally, a solvable
optimization problem is formulated to enlarge the estimate of the closed-loop
DOA by selecting an appropriate Lyapunov function from a positive-definite
function set. The proposed method try to find a unstructured controller set
(namely, the negative-definite and invariant set) in the state-control space
rather than design parameters of a structured controller in traditional
synthesis methods.

Title: Anytime Planning: A Motion Planner for Dynamic Environment
Authors: Trishant Roy, Anindya Harchowdhury, Leena Vachhani
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 8 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Motion planning in the presence of multiple dynamic obstacles is an important
research problem from the perspective of autonomous vehicles as well as
space-constrained multi-robot work environment. In this paper, we address the
motion planning problem for multiple dynamic obstacle rich environment and
propose a probabilistically, complete novel motion planning algorithm. Our
claim is that given a fixed path cost i.e. the Euclidean path length, the
proposed algorithm plans a path with the least computational time as compared
to the state-of-the-art techniques. At the same time, given the time duration
for planning, it plans the minimum cost path. Dynamic constraints have been
taken into consideration while designing the planner such that the optimal
planned path is feasible for implementation. The results of extensive
simulation experiments show that the proposed sequential BIT* outperforms the
DOVS both in the planned path length as well as the path generation time.

Title: Trajectory tracking control for nonholonomic mobile robots under
  arbitrary reference input
Authors: Xiaodong He and Zhiyong Geng
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper studies the tracking control problem for nonholonomic mobile
robots based on second order dynamics, with application to consensus tracking
and formation tracking. The greatest novelty in this paper is that the
reference trajectory can be arbitrarily chosen, in the sense that the condition
of persistency excitation and any other requirements are not imposed on the
leader. In this paper, at first, the tracking control of one leader with single
follower is taken into consideration, which is converted to the stabilization
of two relative subsystems by the design of an adjoint system. Then, the single
follower tracking controller is extended to the consensus tracking of multiple
nonholonomic mobile robots connected by a directed acyclic graph, in which the
convex combination in nonlinear manifolds is introduced to construct a virtual
leader for each follower. Next, the relationship between consensus control and
formation control is established for multiple nonholonomic mobile robots, with
the result that a new transformed system is constructed so as to obtain the
formation tracking control strategy from the consensus tracking result.
Finally, simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the control
laws.

Title: Controllability of Linear Dynamical Systems Under Input Sparsity
  Constraints
Authors: Geethu Joseph and Chandra R. Murthy
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
Comments: 11 pages
\\
  In this work, we consider the controllability of a discrete-time linear
dynamical system with sparse control inputs. Sparsity constraints on the input
arises naturally in networked systems, where activating each input variable
adds to the cost of control. We derive algebraic necessary and sufficient
conditions for ensuring controllability of a system with an arbitrary transfer
matrix. The derived conditions can be verified in polynomial time complexity,
unlike the more traditional Kalman-type rank tests. Further, we characterize
the minimum number of input vectors required to satisfy the derived conditions
for controllability. Finally, we present a generalized Kalman
decomposition-like procedure that separates the state-space into subspaces
corresponding to sparse-controllable and sparse-uncontrollable parts. These
results form a theoretical basis for designing networked linear control systems
with sparse inputs.

Title: A Machine-Learning Approach for Earthquake Magnitude Estimation
Authors: S.Mostafa Mousavi and Gregory C. Beroza
Categories: physics.geo-ph cs.AI cs.LG eess.SP
\\
  In this study we develop a single-station deep-learning approach for fast and
reliable estimation of earthquake magnitude directly from raw waveforms. We
design a regressor composed of convolutional and recurrent neural networks that
is not sensitive to the data normalization, hence waveform amplitude
information can be utilized during the training. Our network can predict
earthquake magnitudes with an average error close to zero and standard
deviation of ~0.2 based on single-station waveforms without instrument response
correction. We test the network for both local and duration magnitude scales
and show a station-based learning can be an effective approach for improving
the performance. The proposed approach has a variety of potential applications
from routine earthquake monitoring to early warning systems.

  NumPyro is a lightweight library that provides an alternate NumPy backend to
the Pyro probabilistic programming language with the same modeling interface,
language primitives and effect handling abstractions. Effect handlers allow
Pyro's modeling API to be extended to NumPyro despite its being built atop a
fundamentally different JAX-based functional backend. In this work, we
demonstrate the power of composing Pyro's effect handlers with the program
transformations that enable hardware acceleration, automatic differentiation,
and vectorization in JAX. In particular, NumPyro provides an iterative
formulation of the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) that can be end-to-end JIT
compiled, yielding an implementation that is much faster than existing
alternatives in both the small and large dataset regimes.

\\
  Model-free reinforcement learning attempts to find an optimal control action
for an unknown dynamical system by directly searching over the parameter space
of controllers. The convergence behavior and statistical properties of these
approaches are often poorly understood because of the nonconvex nature of the
underlying optimization problems as well as the lack of exact gradient
computation. In this paper, we take a step towards demystifying the performance
and efficiency of such methods by focusing on the standard infinite-horizon
linear quadratic regulator problem for continuous-time systems with unknown
state-space parameters. We establish exponential stability for the ordinary
differential equation (ODE) that governs the gradient-flow dynamics over the
set of stabilizing feedback gains and show that a similar result holds for the
gradient descent method that arises from the forward Euler discretization of
the corresponding ODE. We also provide theoretical bounds on the convergence
rate and sample complexity of a random search method. Our results demonstrate
that the required simulation time for achieving $\epsilon$-accuracy in a
model-free setup and the total number of function evaluations both scale as
$\log \, (1/\epsilon)$.

Title: Towards a quantum-inspired proof for IP = PSPACE
Authors: Ayal Green, Yupan Liu, Guy Kindler
Categories: quant-ph cs.CC
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  We explore quantum-inspired interactive proof systems where the prover is
limited. Namely, we improve on a result by [AG17] showing a quantum-inspired
interactive protocol ($\sf IP$) for $\sf PreciseBQP$ where the prover is only
assumed to be a $\sf PreciseBQP$ machine, and show that the result can be
strengthened to show an $\sf IP$ for $\sf NP^{PP}$ with a prover which is only
assumed to be an $\sf NP^{PP}$ machine - which was not known before. We also
show how the protocol can be used to directly verify $\sf QMA$ computations,
thus connecting the sum-check protocol by [AAV13] with the result of [AG17,
LFKN90]. Our results shed light on a quantum-inspired proof for ${\sf IP} =
{\sf PSPACE}$, as $\sf PreciseQMA$ captures the full $\sf PSPACE$ power.

Comments: 18 pages, 4 figures

\\
  We consider the problem of computing the strong rainbow connection number
$src(G)$ for cactus graphs $G$ in which all cycles have odd length. We present
a formula to calculate $src(G)$ for such odd cacti which can be evaluated in
linear time, as well as an algorithm for computing the corresponding optimal
strong rainbow edge coloring, with polynomial worst case run time complexity.
Although computing $src(G)$ is NP-hard in general, previous work has
demonstrated that it may be computed in polynomial time for certain classes of
graphs, including cycles, trees and block clique graphs. This work extends the
class of graphs for which $src(G)$ may be computed in polynomial time.

Title: A re-formulization of the transfer matrix method for calculating
  wave-functions in higher dimensional disordered open systems
Authors: Liang Chen, Cheng Lv, Xunya Jiang

DOI: 10.1016/j.cpc.2012.06.015
\\
  We present a numerically stable re-formulization of the transfer matrix
method (TMM). The iteration form of the traditional TMM is transformed into
solving a set of linear equations. Our method gains the new ability of
calculating accurate wave-functions of higher dimensional disordered systems.
It also shows higher efficiency than the traditional TMM when treating finite
systems. In contrast to the diagonalization method, our method not only
provides a new route for calculating the wave-function corresponding to the
boundary conditions of open systems in realistic transport experiments, but
also has advantages that the calculating wave energy/frequency can be tuned
continuously and the efficiency is much higher. Our new method is further used
to identify the necklace state in the two dimensional disordered Anderson
model, where it shows advantage in cooperating the wave-functions with the
continuous transmission spectrum of open systems. The new formulization is very
simple to implement and can be readily generalized to various systems such as
spin-orbit coupling systems or optical systems.

Title: A statistical test for correspondence of texts to the Zipf-Mandelbrot
  law
Authors: Anik Chakrabarty, Mikhail Chebunin, Artyom Kovalevskii, Ilya Pupyshev,
  Natalia Zakrevskaya, Qianqian Zhou
Categories: math.ST cs.CL stat.TH
\\
  We analyse correspondence of a text to a simple probabilistic model. The
model assumes that the words are selected independently from an infinite
dictionary. The probability distribution correspond to the Zipf---Mandelbrot
law. We count sequentially the numbers of different words in the text and get
the process of the numbers of different words. Then we estimate
Zipf---Mandelbrot law parameters using the same sequence and construct an
estimate of the expectation of the number of different words in the text. Then
we subtract the corresponding values of the estimate from the sequence and
normalize along the coordinate axes, obtaining a random process on a segment
from 0 to 1. We prove that this process (the empirical text bridge) converges
weakly in the uniform metric on $C (0,1)$ to a centered Gaussian process with
continuous a.s. paths. We develop and implement an algorithm for approximate
calculation of eigenvalues of the covariance function of the limit Gaussian
process, and then an algorithm for calculating the probability distribution of
the integral of the square of this process. We use the algorithm to analyze
uniformity of texts in English, French, Russian and Chinese.

Title: Digital filters with vanishing moments for shape analysis
Authors: Hugh L. Kennedy
Categories: eess.SP cs.CV
Comments: Revised Appendix (An introduction to recursive filtering for image
  processing). Added 2 worked examples
Journal-ref: H. L. Kennedy, Optimal digital design of steerable differentiators
  with the flatness of polynomial filters and the isotropy of Gaussian filters,
  SPIE Journal of Electronic Imaging, vol. 27, no. 5, 051219, May 2018
\\
  Shape- and scale-selective digital-filters, with steerable finite/infinite
impulse responses (FIR/IIRs) and non-recursive/recursive realizations, that are
separable in both spatial dimensions and adequately isotropic, are derived. The
filters are conveniently designed in the frequency domain via derivative
constraints at dc, which guarantees orthogonality and monomial selectivity in
the pixel domain (i.e. vanishing moments), unlike more commonly used FIR
filters derived from Gaussian functions. A two-stage low-pass/high-pass
architecture, for blur/derivative operations, is recommended. Expressions for
the coefficients of a low-order IIR blur filter with repeated poles are
provided, as a function of scale; discrete Butterworth (IIR), and colored
Savitzky-Golay (FIR), blurs are also examined. Parallel software
implementations on central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing
units (GPUs), for scale-selective blob-detection in aerial surveillance
imagery, are analyzed. It is shown that recursive IIR filters are significantly
faster than non-recursive FIR filters when detecting large objects at coarse
scales, i.e. using filters with long impulse responses; however, the margin of
outperformance decreases as the degree of parallelization increases.

Title: Fluid segmentation in Neutrosophic domain
Authors: Elyas Rashno, Abdolreza Rashno and Sadegh Fadaei
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) as retina imaging technology is currently
used by ophthalmologist as a non-invasive and non-contact method for diagnosis
of agerelated degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME) diseases.
Fluid regions in OCT images reveal the main signs of AMD and DME. In this
paper, an efficient and fast clustering in neutrosophic (NS) domain referred as
neutrosophic C-means is adapted for fluid segmentation. For this task, a NCM
cost function in NS domain is adapted for fluid segmentation and then optimized
by gradient descend methods which leads to binary segmentation of OCT Bscans to
fluid and tissue regions. The proposed method is evaluated in OCT datasets of
subjects with DME abnormalities. Results showed that the proposed method
outperforms existing fluid segmentation methods by 6% in dice coefficient and
sensitivity criteria.

Title: Effective Data Augmentation with Multi-Domain Learning GANs
Authors: Shin'ya Yamaguchi, Sekitoshi Kanai, Takeharu Eda
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: AAAI-2020
\\
  For deep learning applications, the massive data development (e.g.,
collecting, labeling), which is an essential process in building practical
applications, still incurs seriously high costs. In this work, we propose an
effective data augmentation method based on generative adversarial networks
(GANs), called Domain Fusion. Our key idea is to import the knowledge contained
in an outer dataset to a target model by using a multi-domain learning GAN. The
multi-domain learning GAN simultaneously learns the outer and target dataset
and generates new samples for the target tasks. The simultaneous learning
process makes GANs generate the target samples with high fidelity and variety.
As a result, we can obtain accurate models for the target tasks by using these
generated samples even if we only have an extremely low volume target dataset.
We experimentally evaluate the advantages of Domain Fusion in image
classification tasks on 3 target datasets: CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft, and Indoor
Scene Recognition. When trained on each target dataset reduced the samples to
5,000 images, Domain Fusion achieves better classification accuracy than the
data augmentation using fine-tuned GANs. Furthermore, we show that Domain
Fusion improves the quality of generated samples, and the improvements can
contribute to higher accuracy.

Title: Multiple Pretext-Task for Self-Supervised Learning via Mixing Multiple
  Image Transformations
Authors: Shin'ya Yamaguchi, Sekitoshi Kanai, Tetsuya Shioda, Shoichiro Takeda
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Self-supervised learning is one of the most promising approaches to learn
representations capturing semantic features in images without any manual
annotation cost. To learn useful representations, a self-supervised model
solves a pretext-task, which is defined by data itself. Among a number of
pretext-tasks, the rotation prediction task (Rotation) achieves better
representations for solving various target tasks despite its simplicity of the
implementation. However, we found that Rotation can fail to capture semantic
features related to image textures and colors. To tackle this problem, we
introduce a learning technique called multiple pretext-task for self-supervised
learning (MP-SSL), which solves multiple pretext-task in addition to Rotation
simultaneously. In order to capture features of textures and colors, we employ
the transformations of image enhancements (e.g., sharpening and solarizing) as
the additional pretext-tasks. MP-SSL efficiently trains a model by leveraging a
Frank-Wolfe based multi-task training algorithm. Our experimental results show
MP-SSL models outperform Rotation on multiple standard benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance on Places-205.

\\
  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and a
leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Colorectal polyps that
grow on the intima of the colon or rectum is an important precursor for CRC.
Currently, the most common way for colorectal polyp detection and precancerous
pathology is the colonoscopy. Therefore, accurate colorectal polyp segmentation
during the colonoscopy procedure has great clinical significance in CRC early
detection and prevention. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep
learning framework for the colorectal polyp segmentation. The model we design
consists of an encoder to extract multi-scale semantic features and a decoder
to expand the feature maps to a polyp segmentation map. We improve the feature
representation ability of the encoder by introducing the dilated convolution to
learn high-level semantic features without resolution reduction. We further
design a simplified decoder which combines multi-scale semantic features with
fewer parameters than the traditional architecture. Furthermore, we apply three
post processing techniques on the output segmentation map to improve colorectal
polyp detection performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on
CVC-ClinicDB and ETIS-Larib Polyp DB.

  The purpose was to assess the clinical value of a novel DropOut model for
detecting and segmenting brain metastases, in which a neural network is trained
on four distinct MRI sequences using an input dropout layer, thus simulating
the scenario of missing MRI data by training on the full set and all possible
subsets of the input data. This retrospective, multi-center study, evaluated
165 patients with brain metastases. A deep learning based segmentation model
for automatic segmentation of brain metastases, named DropOut, was trained on
multi-sequence MRI from 100 patients, and validated/tested on 10/55 patients.
The segmentation results were compared with the performance of a
state-of-the-art DeepLabV3 model. The MR sequences in the training set included
pre- and post-gadolinium (Gd) T1-weighted 3D fast spin echo, post-Gd
T1-weighted inversion recovery (IR) prepped fast spoiled gradient echo, and 3D
fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), whereas the test set did not
include the IR prepped image-series. The ground truth were established by
experienced neuroradiologists. The results were evaluated using precision,
recall, Dice score, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve
statistics, while the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the
performance of the two neural networks. The area under the ROC curve (AUC),
averaged across all test cases, was 0.989+-0.029 for the DropOut model and
0.989+-0.023 for the DeepLabV3 model (p=0.62). The DropOut model showed a
significantly higher Dice score compared to the DeepLabV3 model (0.795+-0.105
vs. 0.774+-0.104, p=0.017), and a significantly lower average false positive
rate of 3.6/patient vs. 7.0/patient (p<0.001) using a 10mm3 lesion-size limit.
The DropOut model may facilitate accurate detection and segmentation of brain
metastases on a multi-center basis, even when the test cohort is missing MRI
input data.

  Deep learning has achieved good success in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) reconstruction, in which convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learn the
mapping from undersampled k-space to fully sampled images. Although these deep
learning methods can improve reconstruction quality without complex parameter
selection or a lengthy reconstruction time compared with iterative methods, the
following issues still need to be addressed: 1) all of these methods are based
on big data and require a large amount of fully sampled MRI data, which is
always difficult for cardiac MRI; 2) All of these methods are only applicable
for single-channel images without exploring coil correlation. In this paper, we
propose an unsupervised deep learning method for parallel cardiac MRI via a
time-interleaved sampling strategy. Specifically, a time-interleaved
acquisition scheme is developed to build a set of fully encoded reference data
by directly merging the k-space data of adjacent time frames. Then these fully
encoded data can be used to train a parallel network for reconstructing images
of each coil separately. Finally, the images from each coil are combined
together via a CNN to implicitly explore the correlations between coils. The
comparisons with classic k-t FOCUSS, k-t SLR and L+S methods on in vivo
datasets show that our method can achieve improved reconstruction results in an
extremely short amount of time.

Authors: Erik P. DeBenedictis
Categories: quant-ph cs.ET
Report-no: ZF001 v1.05
\\
  Inspired by recent interest in quantum computing and recent studies of cryo
CMOS for control electronics, this paper presents a hybrid
semiconductor-superconductor approach for engineering scalable computing
systems that operate across the gradient between room temperature and the
temperature of a cryogenic payload. Such a hybrid computer architecture would
have unique suitability to quantum computers, scalable sensors, and the quantum
internet. The approach is enabled by Cryogenic Adiabatic Transistor Circuits
(CATCs), a novel way of using adiabatic circuits to substantially reduce
cooling requirements. In a hybrid chip of CATCs and a second technology, such
as Josephson junctions (JJs) or cryo CMOS, the CATCs complement the speed,
power, and density of the second technology as well as becoming a longsought
cryogenic memory. This paper describes higher-level design principles for CATC
hybrids with a quantum computer control system that includes CATC memory, an
FPGA-like logic module that uses CATC for dense configuration logic and JJs for
fast configured logic, and I/O subsystems including microwave modulators and
low frequency control signals.

enumerators and fifteen new self-dual codes of parameters [80, 40, 14].

Title: Achieving Arbitrary Throughput-Fairness Trade-offs in the Inter Cell
  Interference Coordination with Fixed Transmit Power Problem
Authors: Vaibhav Kumar Gupta, and Gaurav S. Kasbekar
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted to IEEE TVT, 15 pages
\\
  We study the problem of inter cell interference coordination (ICIC) with
fixed transmit power in OFDMA-based cellular networks, in which each base
station (BS) needs to decide as to which subchannel, if any, to allocate to
each of its associated mobile stations (MS) for data transmission. In general,
there exists a trade-off between the total throughput (sum of throughputs of
all the MSs) and fairness under the allocations found by resource allocation
schemes. We introduce the concept of $\tau-\alpha-$fairness by modifying the
concept of $\alpha-$fairness, which was earlier proposed in the context of
designing fair end-to-end window-based congestion control protocols for
packet-switched networks. The concept of $\tau-\alpha-$fairness allows us to
achieve arbitrary trade-offs between the total throughput and degree of
fairness by selecting an appropriate value of $\alpha$ in $[0,\infty)$. We show
that for every $\alpha \in [0,\infty)$ and every $\tau > 0$, the problem of
finding a $\tau-\alpha-$fair allocation is NP-Complete. Further, we show that
for every $\alpha \in [0, \infty)$, there exist thresholds such that if the
potential interference levels experienced by each MS on every subchannel are
above the threshold values, then the problem can be optimally solved in
polynomial time by reducing it to the bipartite graph matching problem. Also,
we propose a simple, distributed subchannel allocation algorithm for the ICIC
problem, which is flexible, requires a small amount of time to operate, and
requires information exchange among only neighboring BSs. We investigate via
simulations as to how the algorithm parameters should be selected so as to
achieve any desired trade-off between the total throughput and fairness.

  Emotion recognition from speech is one of the key steps towards emotional
intelligence in advanced human-machine interaction. Identifying emotions in
human speech requires learning features that are robust and discriminative
across diverse domains that differ in terms of language, spontaneity of speech,
recording conditions, and types of emotions. This corresponds to a learning
scenario in which the joint distributions of features and labels may change
substantially across domains. In this paper, we propose a deep architecture
that jointly exploits a convolutional network for extracting domain-shared
features and a long short-term memory network for classifying emotions using
domain-specific features. We use transferable features to enable model
adaptation from multiple source domains, given the sparseness of speech emotion
data and the fact that target domains are short of labeled data. A
comprehensive cross-corpora experiment with diverse speech emotion domains
reveals that transferable features provide gains ranging from 4.3% to 18.4% in
speech emotion recognition. We evaluate several domain adaptation approaches,
and we perform an ablation study to understand which source domains add the
most to the overall recognition effectiveness for a given target domain.

  Personalizing drug prescriptions in cancer care based on genomic information
requires associating genomic markers with treatment effects. This is an
unsolved challenge requiring genomic patient data in yet unavailable volumes as
well as appropriate quantitative methods. We attempt to solve this challenge
for an experimental proxy for which sufficient data is available: 42 drugs
tested on 1018 cancer cell lines. Our goal is to develop a method to identify
the drug that is most promising based on a cell line's genomic information. For
this, we need to identify for each drug the machine learning method, choice of
hyperparameters and genomic features for optimal predictive performance. We
extensively compare combinations of gene sets (both curated and random),
genetic features, and machine learning algorithms for all 42 drugs. For each
drug, the best performing combination (considering only the curated gene sets)
is selected. We use these top model parameters for each drug to build and
demonstrate a Drug Recommendation System (Dr.S). Insights resulting from this
analysis are formulated as best practices for developing drug recommendation
systems. The complete software system, called the Cell Line Analyzer, is
written in Python and available on github.

Title: Learning performance in inverse Ising problems with sparse teacher
  couplings
Authors: Alia Abbara, Yoshiyuki Kabashima, Tomoyuki Obuchi, Yingying Xu
Categories: cond-mat.dis-nn cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 27 pages, 7 figures
\\
  We investigate the learning performance of the pseudolikelihood maximization
method for inverse Ising problems. In the teacher-student scenario under the
assumption that the teacher's couplings are sparse and the student does not
know the graphical structure, the learning curve and order parameters are
assessed in the typical case using the replica and cavity methods from
statistical mechanics. Our formulation is also applicable to a certain class of
cost functions having locality; the standard likelihood does not belong to that
class. The derived analytical formulas indicate that the perfect inference of
the presence/absence of the teacher's couplings is possible in the
thermodynamic limit taking the number of spins $N$ as infinity while keeping
the dataset size $M$ proportional to $N$, as long as $\alpha=M/N > 2$.
Meanwhile, the formulas also show that the estimated coupling values
corresponding to the truly existing ones in the teacher tend to be
overestimated in the absolute value, manifesting the presence of estimation
bias. These results are considered to be exact in the thermodynamic limit on
locally tree-like networks, such as the regular random or Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi
graphs. Numerical simulation results fully support the theoretical predictions.
Additional biases in the estimators on loopy graphs are also discussed.

Title: Confounder Selection via Support Intersection
Authors: Shinyuu Lee and Yuru Zhu
Categories: math.ST cs.LG stat.AP stat.TH
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Confounding matters in almost all observational studies that focus on
causality. In order to eliminate bias caused by connfounders, oftentimes a
substantial number of features need to be collected in the analysis. In this
case, large p small n problem can arise and dimensional reduction technique is
required. However, the traditional variable selection methods which focus on
prediction are problematic in this setting. Throughout this paper, we analyze
this issue in detail and assume the sparsity of confounders which is different
from the previous works. Under this assumption we propose several variable
selection methods based on support intersection to pick out the confounders.
Also we discussed the different approaches for estimation of causal effect and
unconfoundedness test. To aid in our description, finally we provide numerical
simulations to support our claims and compare to common heuristic methods, as
well as applications on real dataset.

\\
  Due to their inherent variabilities, nanomaterial-based sensors are
challenging to translate into real-world applications, where
reliability/reproducibility is key. Recently we showed Bayesian inference can
be employed on engineered variability in layered nanomaterial-based optical
transmission filters to determine optical wavelengths with high
accuracy/precision. In many practical applications the sensing cost/speed and
long-term reliability can be equal or more important considerations. Though
various machine learning tools are frequently used on sensor/detector networks
to address these, nonetheless their effectiveness on nanomaterial-based sensors
has not been explored. Here we show the best choice of ML algorithm in a
cyber-nanomaterial detector is mainly determined by specific use
considerations, e.g., accuracy, computational cost, speed, and resilience
against drifts/ageing effects. When sufficient data/computing resources are
provided, highest sensing accuracy can be achieved by the kNN and Bayesian
inference algorithms, but but can be computationally expensive for real-time
applications. In contrast,artificial neural networks are computationally
expensive to train, but provide the fastest result under testing conditions and
remain reasonably accurate. When data is limited, SVMs perform well even with
small training sets,while other algorithms show considerable reduction in
accuracy if data is scarce, hence, setting a lower limit on the size of
required training data. We show by tracking/modeling the long-term drifts of
the detector performance over large (1 year) period, it is possible to improve
the predictive accuracy with no need for recalibration. Our research shows for
the first time if the ML algorithm is chosen specific to use-case, low-cost
solution-processed cyber-nanomaterial detectors can be practically implemented
under diverse operational requirements, despite their inherent variabilities.

\\
  In financial automatic feature construction task, genetic programming is the
state-of-the-art-technic. It uses reverse polish expression to represent
features and then uses genetic programming to simulate the evolution process.
With the development of deep learning, there are more powerful feature
extractors for option. And we think that comprehending the relationship between
different feature extractors and data shall be the key. In this work, we put
prior knowledge into alpha discovery neural network, combined with different
kinds of feature extractors to do this task. We find that in the same type of
network, simple network structure can produce more informative features than
sophisticated network structure, and it costs less training time. However,
complex network is good at providing more diversified features. In both
experiment and real business environment, fully-connected network and recurrent
network are good at extracting information from financial time series, but
convolution network structure can not effectively extract this information.

\\
  In this work, learning schemes for measure-valued data are proposed, i.e.
data that their structure can be more efficiently represented as probability
measures instead of points on $\R^d$, employing the concept of probability
barycenters as defined with respect to the Wasserstein metric. Such type of
learning approaches are highly appreciated in many fields where the
observational/experimental error is significant (e.g. astronomy, biology,
remote sensing, etc.) or the data nature is more complex and the traditional
learning algorithms are not applicable or effective to treat them (e.g. network
data, interval data, high frequency records, matrix data, etc.). Under this
perspective, each observation is identified by an appropriate probability
measure and the proposed statistical learning schemes rely on discrimination
criteria that utilize the geometric structure of the space of probability
measures through core techniques from the optimal transport theory. The
discussed approaches are implemented in two real world applications: (a)
clustering eurozone countries according to their observed government bond yield
curves and (b) classifying the areas of a satellite image to certain land uses
categories which is a standard task in remote sensing. In both case studies the
results are particularly interesting and meaningful while the accuracy obtained
is high.

Title: Parameter Free Clustering with Cluster Catch Digraphs (Technical Report)
Authors: Art\"ur Manukyan and Elvan Ceyhan
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We propose clustering algorithms based on a recently developed geometric
digraph family called cluster catch digraphs (CCDs). These digraphs are used to
devise clustering methods that are hybrids of density-based and graph-based
clustering methods. CCDs are appealing digraphs for clustering, since they
estimate the number of clusters; however, CCDs (and density-based methods in
general) require some information on a parameter representing the
\emph{intensity} of assumed clusters in the data set. We propose algorithms
that are parameter free versions of the CCD algorithm and does not require a
specification of the intensity parameter whose choice is often critical in
finding an optimal partitioning of the data set. We estimate the number of
convex clusters by borrowing a tool from spatial data analysis, namely Ripley's
$K$ function. We call our new digraphs utilizing the $K$ function as RK-CCDs.
We show that the minimum dominating sets of RK-CCDs estimate and distinguish
the clusters from noise clusters in a data set, and hence allow the estimation
of the correct number of clusters. Our robust clustering algorithms are
comprised of methods that estimate both the number of clusters and the
intensity parameter, making them completely parameter free. We conduct Monte
Carlo simulations and use real life data sets to compare RK-CCDs with some
commonly used density-based and prototype-based clustering methods.

Title: Sparse Optimization on General Atomic Sets: Greedy and Forward-Backward
  Algorithms
Authors: Thomas Zhang
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
\\
  We consider the problem of sparse atomic optimization, where the notion of
"sparsity" is generalized to meaning some linear combination of few atoms. The
definition of atomic set is very broad; popular examples include the standard
basis, low-rank matrices, overcomplete dictionaries, permutation matrices,
orthogonal matrices, etc. The model of sparse atomic optimization therefore
includes problems coming from many fields, including statistics, signal
processing, machine learning, computer vision and so on. Specifically, we
consider the problem of maximizing a restricted strongly convex (or concave),
smooth function restricted to a sparse linear combination of atoms. We extend
recent work that establish linear convergence rates of greedy algorithms on
restricted strongly concave, smooth functions on sparse vectors to the realm of
general atomic sets, where the convergence rate involves a novel quantity: the
"sparse atomic condition number". This leads to the strongest known
multiplicative approximation guarantees for various flavors of greedy
algorithms for sparse atomic optimization; in particular, we show that in many
settings of interest the greedy algorithm can attain strong approximation
guarantees while maintaining sparsity. Furthermore, we introduce a scheme for
forward-backward algorithms that achieves the same approximation guarantees.
Secondly, we define an alternate notion of weak submodularity, which we show is
tightly related to the more familiar version that has been used to prove
earlier linear convergence rates. We prove analogous multiplicative
approximation guarantees using this alternate weak submodularity, and establish
its distinct identity and applications.

\\
  Adaptive gradient algorithms perform gradient-based updates using the history
of gradients and are ubiquitous in training deep neural networks. While
adaptive gradient methods theory is well understood for minimization problems,
the underlying factors driving their empirical success in min-max problems such
as GANs remain unclear. In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap from both
theoretical and empirical perspectives. First, we analyze a variant of
Optimistic Stochastic Gradient (OSG) proposed in~\citep{daskalakis2017training}
for solving a class of non-convex non-concave min-max problem and establish
$O(\epsilon^{-4})$ complexity for finding $\epsilon$-first-order stationary
point, in which the algorithm only requires invoking one stochastic first-order
oracle while enjoying state-of-the-art iteration complexity achieved by
stochastic extragradient method by~\citep{iusem2017extragradient}. Then we
propose an adaptive variant of OSG named Optimistic Adagrad (OAdagrad) and
reveal an \emph{improved} adaptive complexity
$\widetilde{O}\left(\epsilon^{-\frac{2}{1-\alpha}}\right)$~\footnote{Here
$\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ compresses a logarithmic factor of $\epsilon$.}, where
$\alpha$ characterizes the growth rate of the cumulative stochastic gradient
and $0\leq \alpha\leq 1/2$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work for establishing adaptive complexity in non-convex non-concave min-max
optimization. Empirically, our experiments show that indeed adaptive gradient
algorithms outperform their non-adaptive counterparts in GAN training.
Moreover, this observation can be explained by the slow growth rate of the
cumulative stochastic gradient, as observed empirically.

Title: Quantum Logic Gate Synthesis as a Markov Decision Process
Authors: M. Sohaib Alam
Categories: quant-ph cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables. Comments and feedback welcome
\\
  Reinforcement learning has witnessed recent applications to a variety of
tasks in quantum programming. The underlying assumption is that those tasks
could be modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Here, we investigate the
feasibility of this assumption by exploring its consequences for two of the
simplest tasks in quantum programming: state preparation and gate compilation.
By forming discrete MDPs, focusing exclusively on the single-qubit case, we
solve for the optimal policy exactly through policy iteration. We find optimal
paths that correspond to the shortest possible sequence of gates to prepare a
state, or compile a gate, up to some target accuracy. As an example, we find
sequences of H and T gates with length as small as 11 producing ~99% fidelity
for states of the form (HT)^{n} |0> with values as large as n=10^{10}. This
work provides strong evidence that reinforcement learning can be used for
optimal state preparation and gate compilation for larger qubit spaces.

DOI: 10.1080/10618600.2019.1598871
\\
  We propose a projection pursuit (PP) algorithm based on Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs). The negentropy obtained from a multivariate density estimated by
GMMs is adopted as the PP index to be maximised. For a fixed dimension of the
projection subspace, the GMM-based density estimation is projected onto that
subspace, where an approximation of the negentropy for Gaussian mixtures is
computed. Then, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are used to find the optimal,
orthogonal projection basis by maximising the former approximation. We show
that this semi-parametric approach to PP is flexible and allows highly
informative structures to be detected, by projecting multivariate datasets onto
a subspace, where the data can be feasibly visualised. The performance of the
proposed approach is shown on both artificial and real datasets.

Title: Semi-supervised Stacked Label Consistent Autoencoder for Reconstruction
  and Analysis of Biomedical Signals
Authors: Anupriya Gogna, Angshul Majumdar and Rabab Ward
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
Comments: Final version accepted at IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering
\\
  In this work we propose an autoencoder based framework for simultaneous
reconstruction and classification of biomedical signals. Previously these two
tasks, reconstruction and classification were treated as separate problems.
This is the first work to propose a combined framework to address the issue in
a holistic fashion. Reconstruction techniques for biomedical signals for
tele-monitoring are largely based on compressed sensing (CS) based method,
these are designed techniques where the reconstruction formulation is based on
some assumption regarding the signal. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for reconstruction we learn to reconstruct. An autoencoder can be trained for
the same. But since the final goal is to analyze classify the signal we learn a
linear classification map inside the autoencoder. The ensuing optimization
problem is solved using the Split Bregman technique. Experiments have been
carried out on reconstruction and classification of ECG arrhythmia
classification and EEG seizure classification signals. Our proposed tool is
capable of operating in a semi-supervised fashion. We show that our proposed
method is better and more than an order magnitude faster in reconstruction than
CS based methods; it is capable of real-time operation. Our method is also
better than recently proposed classification methods. Significance: This is the
first work offering an alternative to CS based reconstruction. It also shows
that representation learning can yield better results than hand-crafted
features for signal analysis.

\\
  Energy disaggregation is the task of segregating the aggregate energy of the
entire building (as logged by the smartmeter) into the energy consumed by
individual appliances. This is a single channel (the only channel being the
smart-meter) blind source (different electrical appliances) separation problem.
The traditional way to address this is via stochastic finite state machines
(e.g. Factorial Hidden Markov Model). In recent times dictionary learning based
approaches have shown promise in addressing the disaggregation problem. The
usual technique is to learn a dictionary for every device and use the learnt
dictionaries as basis for blind source separation during disaggregation. Prior
studies in this area are shallow learning techniques, i.e. they learn a single
layer of dictionary for every device. In this work, we propose a deep learning
approach, instead of learning one level of dictionary, we learn multiple layers
of dictionaries for each device. These multi-level dictionaries are used as a
basis for source separation during disaggregation. Results on two benchmark
datasets and one actual implementation show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques.

fewer instrumented homes, or fewer days of instrumentation per home; in either

Title: The Chi-Square Test of Distance Correlation
Authors: Cencheng Shen and Joshua T. Vogelstein
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.ME stat.TH
Comments: 14 pages + 6 pages appendix, 3 figures
\\
  Distance correlation has gained much recent attention in the statistics and
machine learning community: the sample statistic is straightforward to compute,
works for any metric or kernel choice, and equals 0 asymptotically if and only
if independence. One major bottleneck is the testing process: the null
distribution of distance correlation depends on the metric choice and marginal
distributions, which cannot be readily estimated. To compute a p-value, the
standard approach is to estimate the null distribution via permutation, which
generally requires O(rn^2) time complexity for n samples and r permutations and
too costly for big data applications. In this paper, we propose a chi-square
distribution to approximate the null distribution of the unbiased distance
correlation. We prove that the chi-square distribution either equals or
well-approximates the null distribution, and always upper tail dominates the
null distribution. The resulting distance correlation chi-square test does not
require any permutation nor parameter estimation, is simple and fast to
implement, works with any strong negative type metric or characteristic kernel,
is valid and universally consistent for independence testing, and enjoys a
similar finite-sample testing power as the standard permutation test. When

Title: Interpretable Embeddings From Molecular Simulations Using Gaussian
  Mixture Variational Autoencoders
Authors: Yasemin Bozkurt Varolgunes, Tristan Bereau, and Joseph F. Rudzinski
Categories: physics.chem-ph cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Extracting insight from the enormous quantity of data generated from
molecular simulations requires the identification of a small number of
collective variables whose corresponding low-dimensional free-energy landscape
retains the essential features of the underlying system. Data-driven techniques
provide a systematic route to constructing this landscape, without the need for
extensive a priori intuition into the relevant driving forces. In particular,
autoencoders are powerful tools for dimensionality reduction, as they naturally
force an information bottleneck and, thereby, a low-dimensional embedding of
the essential features. While variational autoencoders ensure continuity of the
embedding by assuming a unimodal Gaussian prior, this is at odds with the
multi-basin free-energy landscapes that typically arise from the identification
of meaningful collective variables. In this work, we incorporate this physical
intuition into the prior by employing a Gaussian mixture variational
autoencoder (GMVAE), which encourages the separation of metastable states
within the embedding. The GMVAE performs dimensionality reduction and
clustering within a single unified framework, and is capable of identifying the
inherent dimensionality of the input data, in terms of the number of Gaussians
required to categorize the data. We illustrate our approach on two toy models,
alanine dipeptide, and a challenging disordered peptide ensemble, demonstrating
the enhanced clustering effect of the GMVAE prior compared to standard VAEs.
The resulting embeddings appear to be promising representations for
constructing Markov state models, highlighting the transferability of the
dimensionality reduction from static equilibrium properties to dynamics.

Title: Emergence of Network Motifs in Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Matteo Zambra, Alberto Testolin, Amos Maritan
Categories: nlin.AO cs.LG physics.bio-ph
\\
  Network science can offer fundamental insights into the structural and
functional properties of complex systems. For example, it is widely known that
neuronal circuits tend to organize into basic functional topological modules,
called "network motifs". In this article we show that network science tools can
be successfully applied also to the study of artificial neural networks
operating according to self-organizing (learning) principles. In particular, we
study the emergence of network motifs in multi-layer perceptrons, whose initial
connectivity is defined as a stack of fully-connected, bipartite graphs. Our
simulations show that the final network topology is primarily shaped by
learning dynamics, but can be strongly biased by choosing appropriate weight
initialization schemes. Overall, our results suggest that non-trivial
initialization strategies can make learning more effective by promoting the
development of useful network motifs, which are often surprisingly consistent
with those observed in general transduction networks.

Title: Statistical Agnostic Mapping: a Framework in Neuroimaging based on
  Concentration Inequalities
Authors: J M Gorriz, SiPBA Group, and CAM neuroscience
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG eess.IV stat.AP
Comments: 18 pages, 10 figures, prepared to be submitted to journal
\\
  In the 70s a novel branch of statistics emerged focusing its effort in
selecting a function in the pattern recognition problem, which fulfils a
definite relationship between the quality of the approximation and its
complexity. These data-driven approaches are mainly devoted to problems of
estimating dependencies with limited sample sizes and comprise all the
empirical out-of sample generalization approaches, e.g. cross validation (CV)
approaches. Although the latter are \emph{not designed for testing competing
hypothesis or comparing different models} in neuroimaging, there are a number
of theoretical developments within this theory which could be employed to
derive a Statistical Agnostic (non-parametric) Mapping (SAM) at voxel or
multi-voxel level. Moreover, SAMs could relieve i) the problem of instability
in limited sample sizes when estimating the actual risk via the CV approaches,
e.g. large error bars, and provide ii) an alternative way of Family-wise-error
(FWE) corrected p-value maps in inferential statistics for hypothesis testing.
In this sense, we propose a novel framework in neuroimaging based on
concentration inequalities, which results in (i) a rigorous development for
model validation with a small sample/dimension ratio, and (ii) a
less-conservative procedure than FWE p-value correction, to determine the brain
significance maps from the inferences made using small upper bounds of the
actual risk.

Title: Partition-Aware Adaptive Switching Neural Networks for Post-Processing
  in HEVC
Authors: Weiyao Lin, Xiaoyi He, Xintong Han, Dong Liu, John See, Junni Zou,
  Hongkai Xiong, and Feng Wu
Categories: eess.IV cs.MM
Comments: to appear in IEEE Transaction on Multimedia
DOI: 10.1109/TMM.2019.2962310
\\
  This paper addresses neural network based post-processing for the
state-of-the-art video coding standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). We
first propose a partition-aware Convolution Neural Network (CNN) that utilizes
the partition information produced by the encoder to assist in the
post-processing. In contrast to existing CNN-based approaches, which only take
the decoded frame as input, the proposed approach considers the coding unit
(CU) size information and combines it with the distorted decoded frame such
that the artifacts introduced by HEVC are efficiently reduced. We further
introduce an adaptive-switching neural network (ASN) that consists of multiple
independent CNNs to adaptively handle the variations in content and distortion
within compressed-video frames, providing further reduction in visual
artifacts. Additionally, an iterative training procedure is proposed to train
these independent CNNs attentively on different local patch-wise classes.
Experiments on benchmark sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of our
partition-aware and adaptive-switching neural networks. The source code can be
found at http://min.sjtu.edu.cn/lwydemo/HEVCpostprocessing.html.

Title: A connection between topological ligaments in shape optimization and
  thin tubular inhomogeneities
Authors: Charles Dapogny
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
\\
  In this note, we propose a formal framework accounting for the sensitivity of
a function of the domain with respect to the addition of a thin ligament. To
set ideas, we consider the model setting of elastic structures, and we
approximate this question by a thin tubular inhomogeneity problem: we look for
the sensitivity of the solution to a partial differential equation posed inside
a background medium, and that of a related quantity of interest, with respect
to the inclusion of a thin tube filled with a different material. A practical
formula for this sensitivity is derived, which lends itself to numerical
implementation. Two applications of this idea in structural optimization are
presented.

Title: Calculating the divided differences of the exponential function by
  addition and removal of inputs
Authors: Lalit Gupta, Lev Barash and Itay Hen
Categories: physics.comp-ph cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures
\\
  We introduce a method for calculating the divided differences of the
exponential function by means of addition and removal of items from the input
list to the function. Our technique exploits a new identity related to divided
differences recently derived by F. Zivcovich [Dolomites Research Notes on
Approximation 12, 28-42 (2019)]. We show that upon adding an item to or
removing an item from the input list of an already evaluated exponential, the
re-evaluation of the divided differences can be done with only $O(s n)$
floating point operations and $O(s n)$ bytes of memory, where $[z_0,\dots,z_n]$
are the inputs and $s \propto \max_{i,j} |z_i - z_j|$. We demonstrate our
algorithm's ability to deal with input lists that are orders-of-magnitude
longer than the maximal capacities of the current state-of-the-art. We discuss
in detail one practical application of our method: the efficient calculation of
weights in the off-diagonal series expansion quantum Monte Carlo algorithm.

Title: Structural plasticity on an accelerated analog neuromorphic hardware
  system
Authors: Sebastian Billaudelle, Benjamin Cramer, Mihai A. Petrovici, Korbinian
  Schreiber, David Kappel, Johannes Schemmel, Karlheinz Meier
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.NE
\\
  In computational neuroscience, as well as in machine learning, neuromorphic
devices promise an accelerated and scalable alternative to neural network
simulations. Their neural connectivity and synaptic capacity depends on their
specific design choices, but is always intrinsically limited. Here, we present
a strategy to achieve structural plasticity that optimizes resource allocation
under these constraints by constantly rewiring the pre- and postsynaptic
partners while keeping the neuronal fan-in constant and the connectome sparse.
In our implementation, the algorithm is executed on a custom embedded digital
processor that accompanies a mixed-signal substrate consisting of spiking
neurons and synapse circuits. We evaluated our proposed algorithm in a simple
supervised learning scenario, showing its ability to optimize the network
topology with respect to the nature of its training data, as well as its
overall computational efficiency.

Title: Large fork-join networks with nearly deterministic service times
Authors: Dennis Schol, Maria Vlasiou and Bert Zwart
Categories: math.PR cs.PF
\\
  In this paper, we study an $N$ server fork-join queueing network with nearly
deterministic arrivals and service times. Specifically, we aim to approximate
the length of the largest of the $N$ queues in the network. From a practical
point of view, this has interesting applications, such as modeling the delays
in a large supply chain. We present a fluid limit and a steady-state result for
the maximum queue length, as $N\to\infty$. These results have remarkable
differences. The steady-state result depends on two model parameters, while the
fluid limit only depends on one model parameter. In addition, the fluid limit
requires a different spatial scaling than the backlog in steady state. In order
to prove these results, we use extreme value theory and diffusion
approximations for the queue lengths.

\\
  The main goal of the Artap project is to provide an extensive infrastructure
for robust design optimization, where usually many different numerical solvers
have to be used together and the impact of the manufacturing uncertainties have
to be minimized. Artap is an open-source software platform, developed jointly
with the coupled numerical field solver, Agros Suite. Artap ensures interfaces
for a broad collection of optimization algorithms (genetic and evolutionary
algorithms, various interfaces to libraries such as Nlopt, Bayesopt, etc .),
tools for machine learning (neural networks, Gaussian processes, etc. ), finite
element solvers (Agros Suite, Comsol, Multiphysics, deal.II). The implemented
tools offers an easy and straightforward solution not only for robust design
optimization but parameter identification, model order reduction, and shape
optimization, as well. Moreover, Artap provides automatic parallelization of
the optimization process. The paper presents the structure of the framework and
technologies powering the project. The main features of Artap are demonstrated
on an induction brazing process design tasks.

Title: A design framework for all-digital mmWave massive MIMO with per-antenna
  nonlinearities
Authors: Mohammed Abdelghany, Ali A. Farid, Upamanyu Madhow, and Mark J. W.
  Rodwell
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Millimeter wave MIMO combines the benefits of compact antenna arrays with a
large number of elements and massive bandwidths, so that fully digital
beamforming has the potential of supporting a large number of simultaneous
users with {\it per user} data rates of multiple gigabits/sec (Gbps). In this
paper, we develop an analytical model for the impact of nonlinearities in such
a system, and illustrate its utility in providing hardware design guidelines
regarding two key challenges: the low available precision of analog-to-digital
conversion at high sampling rates, and nonlinearities in ultra-high speed radio
frequency (RF) and baseband circuits. We consider linear minimum mean square
error (LMMSE) reception for a multiuser MIMO uplink, and provide performance
guarantees based on two key concepts: (a) summarization of the impact of
per-antenna nonlinearities via a quantity that we term the "intrinsic SNR", (b)
using linear MMSE performance in an ideal system without nonlinearities to
bound that in our non-ideal system. For our numerical results, we employ
nominal parameters corresponding to outdoor picocells operating at a carrier
frequency of 140 GHz, with a data rate of 10 Gbps per user.

\\
  This paper is concerned with a risk-sensitive optimal control problem for a
feedback connection of a quantum plant with a measurement-based classical
controller. The plant is a multimode open quantum harmonic oscillator driven by
a multichannel quantum Wiener process, and the controller is a linear time
invariant system governed by a stochastic differential equation. The control
objective is to stabilize the closed-loop system and minimize the
infinite-horizon asymptotic growth rate of a quadratic-exponential functional
(QEF) which penalizes the plant variables and the controller output. We combine
a frequency-domain representation of the QEF growth rate, obtained recently,
with variational techniques and establish first-order necessary conditions of
optimality for the state-space matrices of the controller.
