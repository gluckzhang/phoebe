Title: Proxy Tasks and Subjective Measures Can Be Misleading in Evaluating
  Explainable AI Systems
Authors: Zana Bu\c{c}inca, Phoebe Lin, Krzysztof Z. Gajos, Elena L. Glassman
Categories: cs.AI cs.HC
DOI: 10.1145/3377325.3377498
\\
  Explainable artificially intelligent (XAI) systems form part of
sociotechnical systems, e.g., human+AI teams tasked with making decisions. Yet,
current XAI systems are rarely evaluated by measuring the performance of
human+AI teams on actual decision-making tasks. We conducted two online
experiments and one in-person think-aloud study to evaluate two currently
common techniques for evaluating XAI systems: (1) using proxy, artificial tasks
such as how well humans predict the AI's decision from the given explanations,
and (2) using subjective measures of trust and preference as predictors of
actual performance. The results of our experiments demonstrate that evaluations
with proxy tasks did not predict the results of the evaluations with the actual
decision-making tasks. Further, the subjective measures on evaluations with
actual decision-making tasks did not predict the objective performance on those
same tasks. Our results suggest that by employing misleading evaluation
methods, our field may be inadvertently slowing its progress toward developing
human+AI teams that can reliably perform better than humans or AIs alone.

Title: GLIB: Exploration via Goal-Literal Babbling for Lifted Operator Learning
Authors: Rohan Chitnis, Tom Silver, Joshua Tenenbaum, Leslie Pack Kaelbling,
  Tomas Lozano-Perez
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We address the problem of efficient exploration for learning lifted operators
in sequential decision-making problems without extrinsic goals or rewards.
Inspired by human curiosity, we propose goal-literal babbling (GLIB), a simple
and general method for exploration in such problems. GLIB samples goals that
are conjunctions of literals, which can be understood as specific, targeted
effects that the agent would like to achieve in the world, and plans to achieve
these goals using the operators being learned. We conduct a case study to
elucidate two key benefits of GLIB: robustness to overly general preconditions
and efficient exploration in domains with effects at long horizons. We also
provide theoretical guarantees and further empirical results, finding GLIB to
be effective on a range of benchmark planning tasks.

Title: Numerical Abstract Persuasion Argumentation for Expressing Concurrent
  Multi-Agent Negotiations
Authors: Ryuta Arisaka and Takayuki Ito
Categories: cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  A negotiation process by 2 agents e1 and e2 can be interleaved by another
negotiation process between, say, e1 and e3. The interleaving may alter the
resource allocation assumed at the inception of the first negotiation process.
Existing proposals for argumentation-based negotiations have focused primarily
on two-agent bilateral negotiations, but scarcely on the concurrency of
multi-agent negotiations. To fill the gap, we present a novel argumentation
theory, basing its development on abstract persuasion argumentation (which is
an abstract argumentation formalism with a dynamic relation). Incorporating
into it numerical information and a mechanism of handshakes among members of
the dynamic relation, we show that the extended theory adapts well to
concurrent multi-agent negotiations over scarce resources.

Title: Exploring Visual Patterns in Projected Human and Machine Decision-Making
  Paths
Authors: Andreas Hinterreiter and Christian Steinparz and Moritz Sch\"ofl and
  Holger Stitz and Marc Streit
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In problem solving, the paths towards solutions can be viewed as a sequence
of decisions. The decisions, made by humans or computers, describe a trajectory
through a high-dimensional representation space of the problem. Using
dimensionality reduction, these trajectories can be visualized in lower
dimensional space. Such embedded trajectories have previously been applied to a
wide variety of data, but so far, almost exclusively the self-similarity of
single trajectories has been analyzed. In contrast, we describe patterns
emerging from drawing many trajectories---for different initial conditions, end
states, or solution strategies---in the same embedding space. We argue that
general statements about the problem solving tasks and solving strategies can
be made by interpreting these patterns. We explore and characterize such
patterns in trajectories resulting from human and machine-made decisions in a
variety of application domains: logic puzzles (Rubik's cube), strategy games
(chess), and optimization problems (neural network training). In the context of
Rubik's cube, we present a physical interactive demonstrator that uses
trajectory visualization to provide immediate feedback to users regarding the
consequences of their decisions. We also discuss the importance of suitably
chosen representation spaces and similarity metrics for the embedding.

Title: Learning Distributional Programs for Relational Autocompletion
Authors: Kumar Nitesh, Kuzelka Ondrej and De Raedt Luc
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO
\\
  Relational autocompletion is the problem of automatically filling out some
missing fields in a relational database. We tackle this problem within the
probabilistic logic programming framework of Distributional Clauses (DC), which
supports both discrete and continuous probability distributions. Within this
framework, we introduce Dreaml -- an approach to learn both the structure and
the parameters of DC programs from databases that may contain missing
information. To realize this, Dreaml integrates statistical modeling,
distributional clauses with rule learning. The distinguishing features of
Dreaml are that it 1) tackles relational autocompletion, 2) learns
distributional clauses extended with statistical models, 3) deals with both
discrete and continuous distributions, 4) can exploit background knowledge, and
5) uses an expectation-maximization based algorithm to cope with missing data.

Title: I Feel I Feel You: A Theory of Mind Experiment in Games
Authors: David Melhart, Georgios N. Yannakakis, Antonios Liapis
Categories: cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG
Comments: Accepted manuscript for the KI-Kunstliche Intelligenz special issue
  on Artificial Intelligence in Games
\\
  In this study into the player's emotional theory of mind of gameplaying
agents, we investigate how an agent's behaviour and the player's own
performance and emotions shape the recognition of a frustrated behaviour. We
focus on the perception of frustration as it is a prevalent affective
experience in human-computer interaction. We present a testbed game tailored
towards this end, in which a player competes against an agent with a
frustration model based on theory. We collect gameplay data, an annotated
ground truth about the player's appraisal of the agent's frustration, and apply
face recognition to estimate the player's emotional state. We examine the
collected data through correlation analysis and predictive machine learning
models, and find that the player's observable emotions are not correlated
highly with the perceived frustration of the agent. This suggests that our
subject's theory of mind is a cognitive process based on the gameplay context.
Our predictive models---using ranking support vector machines---corroborate
these results, yielding moderately accurate predictors of players' theory of
mind.

Title: Model-theoretic Characterizations of Existential Rule Languages
Authors: Heng Zhang, Yan Zhang, Guifei Jiang
Categories: cs.AI cs.DB cs.LO
Comments: 17 pages, 2 figures, the full version of a paper submitted to IJCAI
  2020
\\
  Existential rules, a.k.a. dependencies in databases, and Datalog+/- in
knowledge representation and reasoning recently, are a family of important
logical languages widely used in computer science and artificial intelligence.
Towards a deep understanding of these languages in model theory, we establish
model-theoretic characterizations for a number of existential rule languages
such as (disjunctive) embedded dependencies, tuple-generating dependencies
(TGDs), (frontier-)guarded TGDs and linear TGDs. All these characterizations
hold for arbitrary structures, and most of them also work on the class of
finite structures. As a natural application of these characterizations,
complexity bounds for the rewritability of above languages are also identified.

Title: Arc-routing for winter road maintenance

Comments: 15 pages, no figure
\\
  The arc-routing problems are known to be notoriously hard. We study here a
natural arc-routing problem on trees and more generally on bounded tree-width
graphs and surprisingly show that it can be solved in a polynomial time. This
implies a sub-exponential algorithm for the planar graphs and small number of
maintaining cars, which is of practical relevance.

Title: On the computational power and complexity of Spiking Neural Networks
Authors: Johan Kwisthout, Nils Donselaar
Categories: cs.CC cs.NE
MSC-class: 68Q05
ACM-class: F.1.1; F.1.3
\\
  The last decade has seen the rise of neuromorphic architectures based on
artificial spiking neural networks, such as the SpiNNaker, TrueNorth, and Loihi
systems. The massive parallelism and co-locating of computation and memory in
these architectures potentially allows for an energy usage that is orders of
magnitude lower compared to traditional Von Neumann architectures. However, to
date a comparison with more traditional computational architectures
(particularly with respect to energy usage) is hampered by the lack of a formal
machine model and a computational complexity theory for neuromorphic
computation. In this paper we take the first steps towards such a theory. We
introduce spiking neural networks as a machine model where---in contrast to the
familiar Turing machine---information and the manipulation thereof are
co-located in the machine. We introduce canonical problems, define hierarchies
of complexity classes and provide some first completeness results.

Title: Arrangements of Approaching Pseudo-Lines
Authors: Stefan Felsner, Alexander Pilz, Patrick Schnider
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  We consider arrangements of $n$ pseudo-lines in the Euclidean plane where
each pseudo-line $\ell_i$ is represented by a bi-infinite connected
$x$-monotone curve $f_i(x)$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$, s.t.\ for any two pseudo-lines
$\ell_i$ and $\ell_j$ with $i < j$, the function $x \mapsto f_j(x) - f_i(x)$ is
monotonically decreasing and surjective (i.e., the pseudo-lines approach each
other until they cross, and then move away from each other). We show that such
\emph{arrangements of approaching pseudo-lines}, under some aspects, behave
similar to arrangements of lines, while for other aspects, they share the
freedom of general pseudo-line arrangements.
  For the former, we prove: 1. There are arrangements of pseudo-lines that are
not realizable with approaching pseudo-lines. 2. Every arrangement of
approaching pseudo-lines has a dual generalized configuration of points with an
underlying arrangement of approaching pseudo-lines.
  For the latter, we show: 1. There are $2^{\Theta(n^2)}$ isomorphism classes
of arrangements of approaching pseudo-lines (while there are only $2^{\Theta(n
\log n)}$ isomorphism classes of line arrangements). 2. It can be decided in
polynomial time whether an allowable sequence is realizable by an arrangement
of approaching pseudo-lines.
  Furthermore, arrangements of approaching pseudo-lines can be transformed into
each other by flipping triangular cells, i.e., they have a connected flip
graph, and every bichromatic arrangement of this type contains a bichromatic
triangular cell.

  Syntactic parsing using dependency structures has become a standard technique
in natural language processing with many different parsing models, in
particular data-driven models that can be trained on syntactically annotated
corpora. In this paper, we tackle transition-based dependency parsing using a
Perceptron Learner. Our proposed model, which adds more relevant features to
the Perceptron Learner, outperforms a baseline arc-standard parser. We beat the
UAS of the MALT and LSTM parsers. We also give possible ways to address parsing
of non-projective trees.

Title: Pre-training via Leveraging Assisting Languages and Data Selection for
  Neural Machine Translation
Authors: Haiyue Song, Raj Dabre, Zhuoyuan Mao, Fei Cheng, Sadao Kurohashi,
  Eiichiro Sumita
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Work in progress. Submitted to a conference
\\
  Sequence-to-sequence (S2S) pre-training using large monolingual data is known
to improve performance for various S2S NLP tasks in low-resource settings.
However, large monolingual corpora might not always be available for the
languages of interest (LOI). To this end, we propose to exploit monolingual
corpora of other languages to complement the scarcity of monolingual corpora
for the LOI. A case study of low-resource Japanese-English neural machine
translation (NMT) reveals that leveraging large Chinese and French monolingual
corpora can help overcome the shortage of Japanese and English monolingual
corpora, respectively, for S2S pre-training. We further show how to utilize
script mapping (Chinese to Japanese) to increase the similarity between the two
monolingual corpora leading to further improvements in translation quality.
Additionally, we propose simple data-selection techniques to be used prior to
pre-training that significantly impact the quality of S2S pre-training. An
empirical comparison of our proposed methods reveals that leveraging assisting
language monolingual corpora, data selection and script mapping are extremely
important for NMT pre-training in low-resource scenarios.

complementary tasks and a related task from previous lab editions, offered in
English, Arabic, and Spanish. Task 1 asks to predict which tweets in a Twitter
stream are worth fact-checking. Task 2 asks to determine whether a claim posted
in a tweet can be verified using a set of previously fact-checked claims. Task
3 asks to retrieve text snippets from a given set of Web pages that would be
useful for verifying a target tweet's claim. Task 4 asks to predict the
veracity of a target tweet's claim using a set of Web pages and potentially
useful snippets in them. Finally, the lab offers a fifth task that asks to
predict the check-worthiness of the claims made in English political debates
and speeches. CheckThat! features a full evaluation framework. The evaluation
is carried out using mean average precision or precision at rank k for ranking
tasks, and F1 for classification tasks.

Title: Variational Hierarchical Dialog Autoencoder for Dialogue State Tracking
  Data Augmentation
Authors: Kang Min Yoo, Hanbit Lee, Franck Dernoncourt, Trung Bui, Walter Chang,
  Sang-goo Lee
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Recent works have shown that generative data augmentation, where synthetic
samples generated from deep generative models are used to augment the training
dataset, benefit certain NLP tasks. In this work, we extend this approach to
the task of dialogue state tracking for goal-oriented dialogues, in which the
data naturally exhibits a hierarchical structure over utterances and related
annotations. Deep generative data augmentation for dialogue state tracking
requires the generative model to be aware of the hierarchically structured
data. We propose Variational Hierarchical Dialog Autoencoder (VHDA) for
modeling various aspects of goal-oriented dialogues, including linguistic and
underlying annotation structures. Our experiments show that our model is able
to generate realistic and novel samples that improve the robustness of
state-of-the-art dialogue state trackers, ultimately improving their final
dialogue state tracking performances on several datasets.

Title: Action Recognition and State Change Prediction in a Recipe Understanding
  Task Using a Lightweight Neural Network Model
Authors: Qing Wan, Yoonsuck Choe
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: AAAI-2020 Student Abstract and Poster Program (Accept)
\\
  Consider a natural language sentence describing a specific step in a food
recipe. In such instructions, recognizing actions (such as press, bake, etc.)
and the resulting changes in the state of the ingredients (shape molded,
custard cooked, temperature hot, etc.) is a challenging task. One way to cope
with this challenge is to explicitly model a simulator module that applies
actions to entities and predicts the resulting outcome (Bosselut et al. 2018).
However, such a model can be unnecessarily complex. In this paper, we propose a
simplified neural network model that separates action recognition and state
change prediction, while coupling the two through a novel loss function. This
allows learning to indirectly influence each other. Our model, although
simpler, achieves higher state change prediction performance (67% average
accuracy for ours vs. 55% in (Bosselut et al. 2018)) and takes fewer samples to
train (10K ours vs. 65K+ by (Bosselut et al. 2018)).

Title: Coordinated Reasoning for Cross-Lingual Knowledge Graph Alignment
Authors: Kun Xu, Linfeng Song, Yansong Feng, Yan Song, Dong Yu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: in AAAI 2020
\\
  Existing entity alignment methods mainly vary on the choices of encoding the
knowledge graph, but they typically use the same decoding method, which
independently chooses the local optimal match for each source entity. This
decoding method may not only cause the "many-to-one" problem but also neglect
the coordinated nature of this task, that is, each alignment decision may
highly correlate to the other decisions. In this paper, we introduce two
coordinated reasoning methods, i.e., the Easy-to-Hard decoding strategy and
joint entity alignment algorithm. Specifically, the Easy-to-Hard strategy first
retrieves the model-confident alignments from the predicted results and then
incorporates them as additional knowledge to resolve the remaining
model-uncertain alignments. To achieve this, we further propose an enhanced
alignment model that is built on the current state-of-the-art baseline. In
addition, to address the many-to-one problem, we propose to jointly predict
entity alignments so that the one-to-one constraint can be naturally
incorporated into the alignment prediction. Experimental results show that our
model achieves the state-of-the-art performance and our reasoning methods can
also significantly improve existing baselines.

Title: Nowhere to Hide: Cross-modal Identity Leakage between Biometrics and
  Devices
Authors: Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yang Li, Yuanbo Xiangli and Zhengxiong Li

Comments: 12 pages

\\
  Along with the benefits of Internet of Things (IoT) come potential privacy
risks, since billions of the connected devices are granted permission to track
information about their users and communicate it to other parties over the
Internet. Of particular interest to the adversary is the user identity which
constantly plays an important role in launching attacks. While the exposure of
a certain type of physical biometrics or device identity is extensively
studied, the compound effect of leakage from both sides remains unknown in
multi-modal sensing environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of
the compound identity leakage across cyber-physical spaces and unveil that
co-located smart device IDs (e.g., smartphone MAC addresses) and physical
biometrics (e.g., facial/vocal samples) are side channels to each other. It is
demonstrated that our method is robust to various observation noise in the wild
and an attacker can comprehensively profile victims in multi-dimension with
nearly zero analysis effort. Two real-world experiments on different biometrics
and device IDs show that the presented approach can compromise more than 70\%
of device IDs and harvests multiple biometric clusters with ~94% purity at the
same time.

Authors: Lin Chen, Lei Xu, Zhimin Gao, Keshav Kasichainula, Weidong Shi
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Recent advances in the blockchain research have been made in two important
directions. One is refined resilience analysis utilizing game theory to study
the consequences of selfish behaviors of users (miners), and the other is the
extension from a linear (chain) structure to a non-linear (graphical) structure
for performance improvements, such as IOTA and Graphcoin. The first question
that comes to people's minds is what improvements that a blockchain system
would see by leveraging these new advances. In this paper, we consider three
major metrics for a blockchain system: full verification, scalability, and
finality-duration. We { establish a formal framework and} prove that no
blockchain system can achieve full verification, high scalability, and low
finality-duration simultaneously. We observe that classical blockchain systems
like Bitcoin achieves full verification and low finality-duration, Harmony and
Ethereum 2.0 achieve low finality-duration and high scalability. As a
complementary, we design a non-linear blockchain system that achieves full
verification and scalability. We also establish, for the first time, the
trade-off between scalability and finality-duration.

Title: Talek: Private Group Messaging with Hidden Access Patterns
Authors: Raymond Cheng, William Scott, Elisaweta Masserova, Irene Zhang, Vipul

Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Talek is a private group messaging system that sends messages through
potentially untrustworthy servers, while hiding both data content and the
communication patterns among its users. Talek explores a new point in the
design space of private messaging; it guarantees access sequence
indistinguishability, which is among the strongest guarantees in the space,
while assuming an anytrust threat model, which is only slightly weaker than the
strongest threat model currently found in related work. Our results suggest
that this is a pragmatic point in the design space, since it supports strong
privacy and good performance: we demonstrate a 3-server Talek cluster that
achieves throughput of 9,433 messages/second for 32,000 active users with
1.7-second end-to-end latency. To achieve its security goals without
coordination between clients, Talek relies on information-theoretic private
information retrieval. To achieve good performance and minimize server-side
storage, Talek introduces new techniques and optimizations that may be of
independent interest, e.g., a novel use of blocked cuckoo hashing and support
for private notifications. The latter provide a private, efficient mechanism
for users to learn, without polling, which logs have new messages.

\\
  Information set decoding (ISD) algorithms are the best known procedures to
solve the decoding problem for general linear codes. These algorithms are hence
used for codes without a visible structure, or for which efficient decoders
exploiting the code structure are not known. Classically, ISD algorithms have
been studied for codes in the Hamming metric. In this paper we switch from the
Hamming metric to the Lee metric, and study ISD algorithms and their complexity
for codes measured with the Lee metric over finite rings.

Title: Sensor-based Continuous Authentication of Smartphones' Users Using
  Behavioral Biometrics: A Survey
Authors: Mohammed Abuhamad, Ahmed Abusnaina, DaeHun Nyang, and David Mohaisen

Comments: 17 pages
\\
  Mobile devices and technologies have become increasingly popular, offering
comparable storage and computational capabilities to desktop computers allowing
users to store and interact with sensitive and private information. The
security and protection of such personal information are becoming more and more
important since mobile devices are vulnerable to unauthorized access or theft.
User authentication is a task of paramount importance that grants access to
legitimate users at the point-of-entry and continuously through the usage
session. This task is made possible with today's smartphones' embedded sensors
that enable continuous and implicit user authentication by capturing behavioral
biometrics and traits. In this paper, we survey more than 140 recent behavioral
biometric-based approaches for continuous user authentication, including
motion-based methods (27 studies), gait-based methods (23 studies), keystroke
dynamics-based methods (20 studies), touch gesture-based methods (29 studies),
voice-based methods (16 studies), and multimodal-based methods (33 studies).
The survey provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art approaches for
continuous user authentication using behavioral biometrics captured by
smartphones' embedded sensors, including insights and open challenges for
adoption, usability, and performance.

Title: Active Perception with A Monocular Camera for Multiscopic Vision
Authors: Weihao Yuan, Rui Fan, Michael Yu Wang, and Qifeng Chen
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  We design a multiscopic vision system that utilizes a low-cost monocular RGB
camera to acquire accurate depth estimation for robotic applications. Unlike
multi-view stereo with images captured at unconstrained camera poses, the
proposed system actively controls a robot arm with a mounted camera to capture
a sequence of images in horizontally or vertically aligned positions with the
same parallax. In this system, we combine the cost volumes for stereo matching
between the reference image and the surrounding images to form a fused cost
volume that is robust to outliers. Experiments on the Middlebury dataset and
real robot experiments show that our obtained disparity maps are more accurate
than two-frame stereo matching: the average absolute error is reduced by 50.2%
in our experiments.

Title: PENet: Object Detection using Points Estimation in Aerial Images
Authors: Ziyang Tang, Xiang Liu, Guangyu Shen, and Baijian Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Aerial imagery has been increasingly adopted in mission-critical tasks, such
as traffic surveillance, smart cities, and disaster assistance. However,
identifying objects from aerial images faces the following challenges: 1)
objects of interests are often too small and too dense relative to the images;
2) objects of interests are often in different relative sizes; and 3) the
number of objects in each category is imbalanced. A novel network structure,
Points Estimated Network (PENet), is proposed in this work to answer these
challenges. PENet uses a Mask Resampling Module (MRM) to augment the imbalanced
datasets, a coarse anchor-free detector (CPEN) to effectively predict the
center points of the small object clusters, and a fine anchor-free detector
FPEN to locate the precise positions of the small objects. An adaptive merge
algorithm Non-maximum Merge (NMM) is implemented in CPEN to address the issue
of detecting dense small objects, and a hierarchical loss is defined in FPEN to
further improve the classification accuracy. Our extensive experiments on
aerial datasets visDrone and UAVDT showed that PENet achieved higher precision
results than existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our best model achieved 8.7%
improvement on visDrone and 20.3% on UAVDT.

Title: How Much Position Information Do Convolutional Neural Networks Encode?
Authors: Md Amirul Islam, Sen Jia, Neil D. B. Bruce
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Accepted to ICLR 2020
\\
  In contrast to fully connected networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
achieve efficiency by learning weights associated with local filters with a
finite spatial extent. An implication of this is that a filter may know what it
is looking at, but not where it is positioned in the image. Information
concerning absolute position is inherently useful, and it is reasonable to
assume that deep CNNs may implicitly learn to encode this information if there
is a means to do so. In this paper, we test this hypothesis revealing the
surprising degree of absolute position information that is encoded in commonly
used neural networks. A comprehensive set of experiments show the validity of
this hypothesis and shed light on how and where this information is represented
while offering clues to where positional information is derived from in deep
CNNs.

Title: Learning to adapt class-specific features across domains for semantic
  segmentation

  (Barcelona). 11 pages main article and 3 pages appendices. Code available
\\
  Recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have shown the
effectiveness of adversarial training to adapt features across domains,
endowing neural networks with the capability of being tested on a target domain
without requiring any training annotations in this domain. The great majority
of existing domain adaptation models rely on image translation networks, which
often contain a huge amount of domain-specific parameters. Additionally, the
feature adaptation step often happens globally, at a coarse level, hindering
its applicability to tasks such as semantic segmentation, where details are of
crucial importance to provide sharp results. In this thesis, we present a novel
architecture, which learns to adapt features across domains by taking into
account per class information. To that aim, we design a conditional pixel-wise
discriminator network, whose output is conditioned on the segmentation masks.
Moreover, following recent advances in image translation, we adopt the recently
introduced StarGAN architecture as image translation backbone, since it is able
to perform translations across multiple domains by means of a single generator
network. Preliminary results on a segmentation task designed to assess the
effectiveness of the proposed approach highlight the potential of the model,
improving upon strong baselines and alternative designs.

Title: Continual Local Replacement for Few-shot Image Recognition
Authors: Canyu Le, Zhonggui Chen, Xihan Wei, Biao Wang, Lei Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML
\\
  The goal of few-shot learning is to learn a model that can recognize novel
classes based on one or few training data. It is challenging mainly due to two
aspects: (1) it lacks good feature representation of novel classes; (2) a few
labeled data could not accurately represent the true data distribution. In this
work, we use a sophisticated network architecture to learn better feature
representation and focus on the second issue. A novel continual local
replacement strategy is proposed to address the data deficiency problem. It
takes advantage of the content in unlabeled images to continually enhance
labeled ones. Specifically, a pseudo labeling strategy is adopted to constantly
select semantic similar images on the fly. Original labeled images will be
locally replaced by the selected images for the next epoch training. In this
way, the model can directly learn new semantic information from unlabeled
images and the capacity of supervised signals in the embedding space can be
significantly enlarged. This allows the model to improve generalization and
learn a better decision boundary for classification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can achieve highly competitive results over
existing methods on various few-shot image recognition benchmarks.

Title: Adaptation of a deep learning malignancy model from full-field digital
  mammography to digital breast tomosynthesis

\\
  Mammography-based screening has helped reduce the breast cancer mortality
rate, but has also been associated with potential harms due to low specificity,
leading to unnecessary exams or procedures, and low sensitivity. Digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) improves on conventional mammography by increasing both
sensitivity and specificity and is becoming common in clinical settings.
However, deep learning (DL) models have been developed mainly on conventional
2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) or scanned film images. Due to a lack
of large annotated DBT datasets, it is difficult to train a model on DBT from
scratch. In this work, we present methods to generalize a model trained on FFDM
images to DBT images. In particular, we use average histogram matching (HM) and
DL fine-tuning methods to generalize a FFDM model to the 2D maximum intensity
projection (MIP) of DBT images. In the proposed approach, the differences
between the FFDM and DBT domains are reduced via HM and then the base model,
which was trained on abundant FFDM images, is fine-tuned. When evaluating on
image patches extracted around identified findings, we are able to achieve
similar areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of
$\sim 0.9$ for FFDM and $\sim 0.85$ for MIP images, as compared to a ROC AUC of
$\sim 0.75$ when tested directly on MIP images.

  Early detection of breast cancer through screening mammography yields a
20-35% increase in survival rate; however, there are not enough radiologists to
serve the growing population of women seeking screening mammography. Although
commercial computer aided detection (CADe) software has been available to
radiologists for decades, it has failed to improve the interpretation of
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images due to its low sensitivity over
the spectrum of findings. In this work, we leverage a large set of FFDM images
with loose bounding boxes of mammographically significant findings to train a
deep learning detector with extreme sensitivity. Building upon work from the
Hourglass architecture, we train a model that produces segmentation-like images
with high spatial resolution, with the aim of producing 2D Gaussian blobs
centered on ground-truth boxes. We replace the pixel-wise $L_2$ norm with a
weak-supervision loss designed to achieve high sensitivity, asymmetrically
penalizing false positives and false negatives while softening the noise of the
loose bounding boxes by permitting a tolerance in misaligned predictions. The
resulting system achieves a sensitivity for malignant findings of 0.99 with
only 4.8 false positive markers per image. When utilized in a CADe system, this
model could enable a novel workflow where radiologists can focus their
attention with trust on only the locations proposed by the model, expediting
the interpretation process and bringing attention to potential findings that
could otherwise have been missed. Due to its nearly perfect sensitivity, the
proposed detector can also be used as a high-performance proposal generator in
two-stage detection systems.

Title: Semi-DerainGAN: A New Semi-supervised Single Image Deraining Network
Authors: Yanyan Wei, Zhao Zhang, Haijun Zhang, Jie Qin, and Mingbo Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Removing the rain streaks from single image is still a challenging task,
since the shapes and direc-tions of rain streaks in the synthetic datasets are
very different from real images. Although super-vised deep deraining networks
have obtained im-pressive results on synthetic datasets, they still cannot
obtain satisfactory results on real images due to weak generalization of rain
removal capac-ity, i.e., the pre-trained models usually cannot handle new
shapes and directions that may lead to over-derained/under-derained results. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised GAN-based deraining network termed
Semi-DerainGAN, which can use both synthetic and real rainy images in a uniform
network using two supervised and unsupervised processes. Specifically, a
semi-supervised rain streak learner termed SSRML sharing the same parameters of
both processes is derived, which makes the real images contribute more rain
streak information. To deliver better deraining results, we design a paired
discriminator for distinguishing the real pairs from fake pairs. Note that we
also contribute a new real-world rainy image dataset Real200 to alleviate the
dif-ference between the synthetic and real image do-mains. Extensive results on
public datasets show that our model can obtain competitive perfor-mance,
especially on real images.

  We introduce the first very large detection dataset for event cameras. The

with a 304x240 ATIS sensor. It contains open roads and very diverse driving
scenarios, ranging from urban, highway, suburbs and countryside scenes, as well
as different weather and illumination conditions. Manual bounding box
annotations of cars and pedestrians contained in the recordings are also
provided at a frequency between 1 and 4Hz, yielding more than 255,000 labels in
total. We believe that the availability of a labeled dataset of this size will
contribute to major advances in event-based vision tasks such as object
detection and classification. We also expect benefits in other tasks such as
optical flow, structure from motion and tracking, where for example, the large
amount of data can be leveraged by self-supervised learning methods.

Title: Filter Sketch for Network Pruning

  Jianzhuang Liu, Qi Tian
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel network pruning approach by information
preserving of pre-trained network weights (filters). Our approach, referred to
as FilterSketch, encodes the second-order information of pre-trained weights,
through which the model performance is recovered by fine-tuning the pruned
network in an end-to-end manner. Network pruning with information preserving
can be approximated as a matrix sketch problem, which is efficiently solved by
the off-the-shelf Frequent Direction method. FilterSketch thereby requires
neither training from scratch nor data-driven iterative optimization, leading
to a magnitude-order reduction of time consumption in the optimization of
pruning. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that FilterSketch reduces 63.3% of FLOPs
and prunes 59.9% of network parameters with negligible accuracy cost overhead
for ResNet-110. On ILSVRC-2012, it achieves a reduction of 45.5% FLOPs and
removes 43.0% of parameters with only a small top-5 accuracy drop of 0.69% for
ResNet-50. Source codes of the proposed FilterSketch can be available at

\\
  This paper proposes a novel deep subspace clustering approach which uses
convolutional autoencoders to transform input images into new representations
lying on a union of linear subspaces. The first contribution of our work is to
insert multiple fully-connected linear layers between the encoder layers and
their corresponding decoder layers to promote learning more favorable
representations for subspace clustering. These connection layers facilitate the
feature learning procedure by combining low-level and high-level information
for generating multiple sets of self-expressive and informative representations
at different levels of the encoder. Moreover, we introduce a novel loss
minimization problem which leverages an initial clustering of the samples to
effectively fuse the multi-level representations and recover the underlying
subspaces more accurately. The loss function is then minimized through an
iterative scheme which alternatively updates the network parameters and
produces new clusterings of the samples. Experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate that our approach exhibits superior performance compared
to the state-of-the-art methods on most of the subspace clustering problems.

\\
  There has recently been great progress in automatic segmentation of medical
images with deep learning algorithms. In most works observer variation is
acknowledged to be a problem as it makes training data heterogeneous but so far
no attempts have been made to explicitly capture this variation. Here, we
propose an approach capable of mimicking different styles of segmentation,
which potentially can improve quality and clinical acceptance of automatic
segmentation methods. In this work, instead of training one neural network on
all available data, we train several neural networks on subgroups of data
belonging to different segmentation variations separately. Because a priori it
may be unclear what styles of segmentation exist in the data and because
different styles do not necessarily map one-on-one to different observers, the
subgroups should be automatically determined. We achieve this by searching for
the best data partition with a genetic algorithm. Therefore, each network can
learn a specific style of segmentation from grouped training data. We provide
proof of principle results for open-sourced prostate segmentation MRI data with
simulated observer variations. Our approach provides an improvement of up to
23% (depending on simulated variations) in terms of Dice and surface Dice
coefficients compared to one network trained on all data.

Title: Channel Pruning via Automatic Structure Search
Authors: Mingbao Lin, Rongrong Ji, Yuxin Zhang, Baochang Zhang, Yongjian Wu,
  Yonghong Tian
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Channel pruning is among the predominant approaches to compress deep neural
networks. To this end, most existing pruning methods focus on selecting
channels (filters) by importance/optimization or regularization based on
rule-of-thumb designs, which defects in sub-optimal pruning. In this paper, we
propose a new channel pruning method based on artificial bee colony algorithm
(ABC), dubbed as ABCPruner, which aims to efficiently find optimal pruned
structure, i.e., channel number in each layer, rather than selecting
"important" channels as previous works did. To solve the intractably huge
combinations of pruned structure for deep networks, we first propose to shrink
the combinations where the preserved channels are limited to a specific space,
thus the combinations of pruned structure can be significantly reduced. And
then, we formulate the search of optimal pruned structure as an optimization
problem and integrate the ABC algorithm to solve it in an automatic manner to
lessen human interference. ABCPruner has been demonstrated to be more
effective, which also enables the fine-tuning to be conducted efficiently in an
end-to-end manner. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that ABCPruner reduces 73.68\%
of FLOPs and 88.68\% of parameters with even 0.06\% accuracy improvement for

Title: Detecting Deficient Coverage in Colonoscopies

\\
  Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is a global health problem, resulting in 900K deaths
per year. Colonoscopy is the tool of choice for preventing CRC, by detecting
polyps before they become cancerous, and removing them. However, colonoscopy is
hampered by the fact that endoscopists routinely miss an average of 22-28% of
polyps. While some of these missed polyps appear in the endoscopist's field of
view, others are missed simply because of substandard coverage of the
procedure, i.e. not all of the colon is seen. This paper attempts to rectify
the problem of substandard coverage in colonoscopy through the introduction of
the C2D2 (Colonoscopy Coverage Deficiency via Depth) algorithm which detects
deficient coverage, and can thereby alert the endoscopist to revisit a given
area. More specifically, C2D2 consists of two separate algorithms: the first
performs depth estimation of the colon given an ordinary RGB video stream;
while the second computes coverage given these depth estimates. Rather than
compute coverage for the entire colon, our algorithm computes coverage locally,
on a segment-by-segment basis; C2D2 can then indicate in real-time whether a
particular area of the colon has suffered from deficient coverage, and if so
the endoscopist can return to that area. Our coverage algorithm is the first
such algorithm to be evaluated in a large-scale way; while our depth estimation
technique is the first calibration-free unsupervised method applied to
colonoscopies. The C2D2 algorithm achieves state of the art results in the
detection of deficient coverage: it is 2.4 times more accurate than human
experts.

Title: Weakly-Supervised Lesion Segmentation on CT Scans using Co-Segmentation
Authors: Vatsal Agarwal, Youbao Tang, Jing Xiao, Ronald M. Summers
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Lesion segmentation on computed tomography (CT) scans is an important step
for precisely monitoring changes in lesion/tumor growth. This task, however, is
very challenging since manual segmentation is prohibitively time-consuming,
expensive, and requires professional knowledge. Current practices rely on an
imprecise substitute called response evaluation criteria in solid tumors
(RECIST). Although these markers lack detailed information about the lesion
regions, they are commonly found in hospitals' picture archiving and
communication systems (PACS). Thus, these markers have the potential to serve
as a powerful source of weak-supervision for 2D lesion segmentation. To
approach this problem, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)
based weakly-supervised lesion segmentation method, which first generates the
initial lesion masks from the RECIST measurements and then utilizes
co-segmentation to leverage lesion similarities and refine the initial masks.
In this work, an attention-based co-segmentation model is adopted due to its
ability to learn more discriminative features from a pair of images.
Experimental results on the NIH DeepLesion dataset demonstrate that the
proposed co-segmentation approach significantly improves lesion segmentation
performance, e.g the Dice score increases about 4.0% (from 85.8% to 89.8%).

Title: Deformation-aware Unpaired Image Translation for Pose Estimation on
  Laboratory Animals
Authors: Siyuan Li, Semih G\"unel, Mirela Ostrek, Pavan Ramdya, Pascal Fua, and
  Helge Rhodin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Our goal is to capture the pose of neuroscience model organisms, without
using any manual supervision, to be able to study how neural circuits
orchestrate behaviour. Human pose estimation attains remarkable accuracy when
trained on real or simulated datasets consisting of millions of frames.
However, for many applications simulated models are unrealistic and real
training datasets with comprehensive annotations do not exist. We address this
problem with a new sim2real domain transfer method. Our key contribution is the
explicit and independent modeling of appearance, shape and poses in an unpaired
image translation framework. Our model lets us train a pose estimator on the
target domain by transferring readily available body keypoint locations from
the source domain to generated target images. We compare our approach with
existing domain transfer methods and demonstrate improved pose estimation
accuracy on Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Caenorhabditis elegans (worm)
and Danio rerio (zebrafish), without requiring any manual annotation on the
target domain and despite using simplistic off-the-shelf animal characters for
simulation, or simple geometric shapes as models. Our new datasets, code, and
trained models will be published to support future neuroscientific studies.

Title: Disassembling the Dataset: A Camera Alignment Mechanism for Multiple
  Tasks in Person Re-identification
Authors: Zijie Zhuang, Longhui Wei, Lingxi Xie, Hengheng Zhang, Tianyu Zhang,
  Haozhe Wu, Haizhou Ai, and Qi Tian
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In person re-identification (ReID), one of the main challenges is the
distribution inconsistency among different datasets. Previous researchers have
defined several seemingly individual topics, such as fully supervised learning,
direct transfer, domain adaptation, and incremental learning, each with
different settings of training and testing scenarios. These topics are designed
in a dataset-wise manner, i.e., images from the same dataset, even from
disjoint cameras, are presumed to follow the same distribution. However, such
distribution is coarse and training-set-specific, and the ReID knowledge
learned in such manner works well only on the corresponding scenarios. To
address this issue, we propose a fine-grained distribution alignment
formulation, which disassembles the dataset and aligns all training and testing
cameras. It connects all topics above and guarantees that ReID knowledge is
always learned, accumulated, and verified in the aligned distributions. In
practice, we devise the Camera-based Batch Normalization, which is easy for
integration and nearly cost-free for existing ReID methods. Extensive
experiments on the above four ReID tasks demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. The code will be publicly available.

Title: Lipreading using Temporal Convolutional Networks
Authors: Brais Martinez, Pingchuan Ma, Stavros Petridis, Maja Pantic
Categories: cs.CV cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  Lip-reading has attracted a lot of research attention lately thanks to
advances in deep learning. The current state-of-the-art model for recognition
of isolated words in-the-wild consists of a residual network and Bidirectional
Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU) layers. In this work, we address the limitations of
this model and we propose changes which further improve its performance.
Firstly, the BGRU layers are replaced with Temporal Convolutional Networks
(TCN). Secondly, we greatly simplify the training procedure, which allows us to
train the model in one single stage. Thirdly, we show that the current
state-of-the-art methodology produces models that do not generalize well to
variations on the sequence length, and we addresses this issue by proposing a
variable-length augmentation. We present results on the largest
publicly-available datasets for isolated word recognition in English and
Mandarin, LRW and LRW1000, respectively. Our proposed model results in an
absolute improvement of 1.2% and 3.2%, respectively, in these datasets which is
the new state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Ternary Feature Masks: continual learning without any forgetting
Authors: Marc Masana, Tinne Tuytelaars, Joost van de Weijer
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we propose an approach without any forgetting to continual
learning for the task-aware regime, where at inference the task-label is known.
By using ternary masks we can upgrade a model to new tasks, reusing knowledge
from previous tasks while not forgetting anything about them. Using masks
prevents both catastrophic forgetting and backward transfer. We argue -- and
show experimentally -- that avoiding the former largely compensates for the
lack of the latter, which is rarely observed in practice. In contrast to
earlier works, our masks are applied to the features (activations) of each
layer instead of the weights. This considerably reduces the number of mask
parameters to be added for each new task; with more than three orders of
magnitude for most networks. The encoding of the ternary masks into two bits
per feature creates very little overhead to the network, avoiding scalability
issues. Our masks do not permit any changes to features which are used by
previous tasks. As this may be too restrictive to allow learning of new tasks,
we add task-specific feature normalization. This way, already learned features
can adapt to the current task without changing the behavior of these features
for previous tasks. Extensive experiments on several finegrained datasets and
ImageNet show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art while
reducing memory overhead in comparison to weight-based approaches.

Title: Robust Explanations for Visual Question Answering
Authors: Badri N. Patro, Shivansh Pate, and Vinay P. Namboodiri
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG cs.MM
Comments: WACV-2020 (Accepted)
\\
  In this paper, we propose a method to obtain robust explanations for visual
question answering(VQA) that correlate well with the answers. Our model
explains the answers obtained through a VQA model by providing visual and
textual explanations. The main challenges that we address are i) Answers and
textual explanations obtained by current methods are not well correlated and
ii) Current methods for visual explanation do not focus on the right location
for explaining the answer. We address both these challenges by using a
collaborative correlated module which ensures that even if we do not train for
noise based attacks, the enhanced correlation ensures that the right
explanation and answer can be generated. We further show that this also aids in
improving the generated visual and textual explanations. The use of the
correlated module can be thought of as a robust method to verify if the answer
and explanations are coherent. We evaluate this model using VQA-X dataset. We
observe that the proposed method yields better textual and visual justification
that supports the decision. We showcase the robustness of the model against a
noise-based perturbation attack using corresponding visual and textual
explanations. A detailed empirical analysis is shown. Here we provide source
code link for our model \url{https://github.com/DelTA-Lab-IITK/CCM-WACV}.

Title: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification via Learned Feature-Wise

  https://github.com/hytseng0509/CrossDomainFewShot
\\
  Few-shot classification aims to recognize novel categories with only few
labeled images in each class. Existing metric-based few-shot classification
algorithms predict categories by comparing the feature embeddings of query
images with those from a few labeled images (support examples) using a learned
metric function. While promising performance has been demonstrated, these
methods often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to large discrepancy of
the feature distribution across domains. In this work, we address the problem
of few-shot classification under domain shifts for metric-based methods. Our
core idea is to use feature-wise transformation layers for augmenting the image
features using affine transforms to simulate various feature distributions
under different domains in the training stage. To capture variations of the
feature distributions under different domains, we further apply a
learning-to-learn approach to search for the hyper-parameters of the
feature-wise transformation layers. We conduct extensive experiments and
ablation studies under the domain generalization setting using five few-shot
classification datasets: mini-ImageNet, CUB, Cars, Places, and Plantae.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature-wise transformation
layer is applicable to various metric-based models, and provides consistent
improvements on the few-shot classification performance under domain shift.

  We present Audiovisual SlowFast Networks, an architecture for integrated
audiovisual perception. AVSlowFast extends SlowFast Networks with a Faster
Audio pathway that is deeply integrated with its visual counterparts. We fuse
audio and visual features at multiple layers, enabling audio to contribute to
the formation of hierarchical audiovisual concepts. To overcome training
difficulties that arise from different learning dynamics for audio and visual
modalities, we employ DropPathway that randomly drops the Audio pathway during
training as a simple and effective regularization technique. Inspired by prior
studies in neuroscience, we perform hierarchical audiovisual synchronization
and show that it leads to better audiovisual features. We report
state-of-the-art results on four video action classification and detection
datasets, perform detailed ablation studies, and show the generalization of
AVSlowFast to self-supervised tasks, where it improves over prior work. Code

Title: Understanding the Incel Community on YouTube

Categories: cs.CY
\\
  YouTube is by far the largest host of user-generated video content worldwide.
Alas, the platform also hosts inappropriate, toxic, and/or hateful content. One
community that has come into the spotlight for sharing and publishing hateful
content are the so-called Involuntary Celibates (Incels), a loosely defined
movement ostensibly focusing on men's issues, who have often been linked to
misogynistic views. In this paper, we set out to analyze the Incel community on
YouTube. We collect videos shared on Incel-related communities within Reddit,
and perform a data-driven characterization of the content posted on YouTube
along several axes. Among other things, we find that the Incel community on
YouTube is growing rapidly, that they post a substantial number of negative
comments, and that they discuss a broad range of topics ranging from ideology,
e.g., around the Men Going Their Own Way movement, to discussions filled with
racism and/or misogyny. Finally, we quantify the probability that a user will
encounter an Incel-related video by virtue of YouTube's recommendation
algorithm. Within five hops when starting from a non-Incel-related video, this
probability is 1 in 5, which is alarmingly high given the toxicity of said
content.

Title: Quantifying Engagement with Citations on Wikipedia

Comments: The Web Conference WWW 2020, 10 pages
\\
  Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, is one of the
most visited sites on the Web and a common source of information for many
users. As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia is not a source of original information,
but was conceived as a gateway to secondary sources: according to Wikipedia's
guidelines, facts must be backed up by reliable sources that reflect the full
spectrum of views on the topic. Although citations lie at the very heart of
Wikipedia, little is known about how users interact with them. To close this
gap, we built client-side instrumentation for logging all interactions with
links leading from English Wikipedia articles to cited references during one
month, and conducted the first analysis of readers' interaction with citations
on Wikipedia. We find that overall engagement with citations is low: about one
in 300 page views results in a reference click (0.29% overall; 0.56% on
desktop; 0.13% on mobile). Matched observational studies of the factors
associated with reference clicking reveal that clicks occur more frequently on
shorter pages and on pages of lower quality, suggesting that references are
consulted more commonly when Wikipedia itself does not contain the information
sought by the user. Moreover, we observe that recent content, open access
sources and references about life events (births, deaths, marriages, etc) are
particularly popular. Taken together, our findings open the door to a deeper
understanding of Wikipedia's role in a global information economy where
reliability is ever less certain, and source attribution ever more vital.

Comments: First draft
\\
  The 2019 UK general election took place against a background of rising online
hostility levels toward politicians and concerns about polarisation. We
collected 4.2 million tweets sent to or from election candidates in the six
week period spanning from the start of November until shortly after the
December 12th election. We found abuse in 4.46% of replies received by
candidates, up from 3.27% in the matching period for the 2017 UK general
election. Abuse levels have also been climbing month on month throughout 2019.
The topic of UK withdrawal from the European Union drew an elevated level of
abuse for candidates regardless of political party. Attention (and abuse)
focused mainly on a small number of high profile politicians. Abuse is "spiky",
triggered by external events such as debates, or controversial tweets. Abuse
escalated throughout the campaign period. Men received more abuse overall;
women received more sexist abuse. MPs choosing not to stand again had received
more abuse during 2019.

Title: Towards context in large scale biomedical knowledge graphs

Comments: 26 pages, 14 figures
\\
  Contextual information is widely considered for NLP and knowledge discovery
in life sciences since it highly influences the exact meaning of natural
language. The scientific challenge is not only to extract such context data,
but also to store this data for further query and discovery approaches. Here,
we propose a multiple step knowledge graph approach using labeled property
graphs based on polyglot persistence systems to utilize context data for
context mining, graph queries, knowledge discovery and extraction. We introduce
the graph-theoretic foundation for a general context concept within semantic
networks and show a proof-of-concept based on biomedical literature and text
mining. Our test system contains a knowledge graph derived from the entirety of
PubMed and SCAIView data and is enriched with text mining data and domain
specific language data using BEL. Here, context is a more general concept than
annotations. This dense graph has more than 71M nodes and 850M relationships.
We discuss the impact of this novel approach with 27 real world use cases
represented by graph queries.

Title: Leveraging Blockchain for Immutable Logging and Querying Across Multiple
  Sites
Authors: Mustafa Safa Ozdayi, Murat Kantarcioglu, and Bradley Malin
Categories: cs.DB cs.DC
\\
  Blockchain has emerged as a decentralized and distributed framework that
enables tamper-resilience and, thus, practical immutability for stored data.
This immutability property is important in scenarios where auditability is
desired, such as in maintaining access logs for sensitive healthcare and
biomedical data.However, the underlying data structure of blockchain, by
default, does not provide capabilities to efficiently query the stored data. In
this investigation, we show that it is possible to efficiently run complex
audit queries over the access log data stored on blockchains by using
additional key-value stores. This paper specifically reports on the approach we
designed for the blockchain track of iDASH Privacy & Security Workshop 2018
competition.Particularly, we implemented our solution and compared its loading
and query-response performance with SQLite, a commonly used relational
database, using the data provided by the iDASH 2018 organizers. Depending on
the query type and the data size, the run time difference between blockchain
based query-response and SQLite based query-response ranged from 0.2 seconds to
6 seconds. A deeper inspection revealed that range queries were the bottleneck
of our solution which, nevertheless, scales up linearly. Concretely, this
investigation demonstrates that blockchain-based systems can provide reasonable
query-response times to complex queries even if they only use simple key-value
stores to manage their data. Consequently, we show that blockchains may be
useful for maintaining data with auditability and immutability requirements
across multiple sites.

\\
  Internet of Things (IoT), the emerging computing infrastructure that refers
to the networked interconnection of physical objects, incorporates a plethora
of digital systems that are being developed by means of a large number of
applications. Many of these applications administer data collection on the edge
and offer data storage and analytics capabilities in the cloud. This raises the
following problems: (i) the processing stages in IoT applications need to have
separate implementations for both the edge and the cloud, (ii) the placement of
computation is inflexible with separate software stacks, as the optimal
deployment decisions need to be made at runtime, and (iii) unified fault
tolerance is essential in case of intermittent long-distance network
connectivity problems, malicious harming of edge devices, or harsh
environments. This paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant architecture CEFIoT
for IoT applications by adopting state-of-the-art cloud technologies and
deploying them also for edge computing. We solve the data fault tolerance issue
by exploiting the Apache Kafka publish/subscribe platform as the unified
high-performance data replication solution offering a common software stack for
both the edge and the cloud. We also deploy Kubernetes for fault-tolerant
management and the advanced functionality allowing on-the-fly automatic
reconfiguration of the processing pipeline to handle both hardware and network
connectivity based failures.

Title: A Closer Look at Lightweight Graph Reordering
Authors: Priyank Faldu and Jeff Diamond and Boris Grot
Categories: cs.DC cs.PF
Journal-ref: In Proceedings of the International Symposium on Workload
  Characterization (IISWC). Nov., 2019
\\
  Graph analytics power a range of applications in areas as diverse as finance,
networking and business logistics. A common property of graphs used in the
domain of graph analytics is a power-law distribution of vertex connectivity,
wherein a small number of vertices are responsible for a high fraction of all
connections in the graph. These richly-connected (hot) vertices inherently
exhibit high reuse. However, their sparse distribution in memory leads to a
severe underutilization of on-chip cache capacity. Prior works have proposed
lightweight skew-aware vertex reordering that places hot vertices adjacent to
each other in memory, reducing the cache footprint of hot vertices. However, in
doing so, they may inadvertently destroy the inherent community structure
within the graph, which may negate the performance gains achieved from the
reduced footprint of hot vertices. In this work, we study existing reordering
techniques and demonstrate the inherent tension between reducing the cache
footprint of hot vertices and preserving original graph structure. We quantify
the potential performance loss due to disruption in graph structure for
different graph datasets. We further show that reordering techniques that
employ fine-grain reordering significantly increase misses in the higher level
caches, even when they reduce misses in the last-level cache. To overcome the
limitations of existing reordering techniques, we propose Degree-Based Grouping
(DBG), a novel lightweight reordering technique that employs a coarse-grain
reordering to largely preserve graph structure while reducing the cache
footprint of hot vertices. Our evaluation on 40 combinations of various graph
applications and datasets shows that, compared to a baseline with no
reordering, DBG yields an average application speed-up of 16.8% vs 11.6% for
the best-performing existing lightweight technique.

problem based on the multi-way merging principle. These algorithms inspect only
characters that are needed to determine the sorting order. Moreover,
communication volume is reduced by also communicating (roughly) only those
characters and by communicating repetitions of the same prefixes only once.
Experiments on up to 1280 cores reveal that these algorithm are often more than
five times faster than previous algorithms.

Title: Coded Computing for Boolean Functions
Authors: Chien-Sheng Yang and A. Salman Avestimehr
Categories: cs.DC cs.IT math.IT
\\
  The growing size of modern datasets necessitates a massive computation into
smaller computations and operate in a distributed manner for improving overall
performance. However, the adversarial servers in the distributed computing
system deliberately send erroneous data in order to affect the computation for
their benefit. Computing Boolean functions is the key component of many
applications of interest, e.g., the classification problem, verification
functions in the blockchain and the design of cryptographic algorithm. In this
paper, we consider the problem of computing the Boolean function in which the
computation is carried out distributively across several workers with
particular focus on security against Byzantine workers. We note that any
Boolean function can be modeled as a multivariate polynomial which have high
degree in general. Hence, the recent proposed Lagrange Coded Computing (LCC)
can be used to simultaneously provide resiliency, security, and privacy.
However, the security threshold (i.e., the maximum number of adversarial
workers can be tolerated) provided by LCC can be extremely low if the degree of
polynomial is high. Our goal is to design an efficient coding scheme which
achieves the optimal security threshold with low decoding overhead. We propose
three different schemes called coded Algebraic normal form (ANF), coded
Disjunctive normal form (DNF) and coded polynomial threshold function (PTF).
Instead of modeling the Boolean function as a general polynomial, the key idea
of the proposed schemes is to model it as the concatenation of some low-degree
polynomials and the threshold functions.

  Among the entities involved in software citation, software source code
requires special attention, due to the role it plays in ensuring scientific
reproducibility. To reference source code we need identifiers that are not only
unique and persistent, but also support \emph{integrity} checking
intrinsically. Suitable identifiers must guarantee that denotedobjects will
always stay the same, without relying on external third parties and
administrative processes. We analyze the role of identifiers for digital
objects (IDOs), whose properties are different from, and complementary to,
those of the various digital identifiers of objects (DIOs) that are today
popular building blocks of software and data citation toolchains.We argue that
both kinds of identifiers are needed and detail the syntax, semantics, and
practical implementation of the persistent identifiers (PIDs) adopted by the
Software Heritage project to reference billions of softwaresource code
artifacts such as source code files, directories, and commits.

Title: A Greedy algorithm for local heating
Authors: Ji\v{r}\'i Fink, Johann L. Hurink
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 11 pages, no picture
\\
  This paper studies a planning problem for supplying hot water in domestic
environment. Hereby, boilers (e.g. gas or electric boilers, heat pumps or
microCHPs) are used to heat water and store it for domestic demands. We
consider a simple boiler which is either turned on or turned off and is
connected to a buffer of limited capacity. The energy needed to run the boiler
has to be bought e.g. on a day-ahead market, so we are interested in a planning
which minimizes the cost to supply the boiler with energy in order to fulfill
the given heat demand. We present a greedy algorithm for this heating problem
whose time complexity is O(T {\alpha}(T )) where T is the number of time
intervals and {\alpha} is the inverse of Ackermann function.

Title: Sorting Permutations with Fixed Pinnacle Set
Authors: Irena Rusu
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 18 pages, 1 figure
ACM-class: F.2; G.2.1
\\
  We give a positive answer to a question raised by Davis et al. ({\em Discrete
Mathematics} 341, 2018), concerning permutations with the same pinnacle set.
Given $\pi\in S_n$, a {\em pinnacle} of $\pi$ is an element $\pi_i$ ($i\neq
1,n$) such that $\pi_{i-1}<\pi_i>\pi_{i+1}$. The question is: given
$\pi,\pi'\in S_n$ with the same pinnacle set $S$, is there a sequence of
operations that transforms $\pi$ into $\pi'$ such that all the intermediate
permutations have pinnacle set $S$? We introduce {\em balanced reversals},
defined as reversals that do not modify the pinnacle set of the permutation to
which they are applied. Then we show that $\pi$ may be sorted by balanced
reversals (i.e. transformed into a standard permutation $\Id_S$), implying that
$\pi$ may be transformed into $\pi'$ using at most $4n-2\min\{p,3\}$ balanced
reversals, where $p=|S|\geq 1$. In case $p=0$, at most $2n-1$ balanced
reversals are needed.

Title: Strongly Stable and Maximum Weakly Stable Noncrossing Matchings
Authors: Koki Hamada, Shuichi Miyazaki, Kazuya Okamoto
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  In IWOCA 2019, Ruangwises and Itoh introduced stable noncrossing matchings,
where participants of each side are aligned on each of two parallel lines, and
no two matching edges are allowed to cross each other. They defined two
stability notions, strongly stable noncrossing matching (SSNM) and weakly
stable noncrossing matching (WSNM), depending on the strength of blocking
pairs. They proved that a WSNM always exists and presented an O(n^{2})-time
algorithm to find one for an instance with n men and n women. They also posed
open questions of the complexities of determining existence of an SSNM and
finding a largest WSNM. In this paper, we show that both problems are solvable
in polynomial time. Our algorithms are applicable to extensions where
preference lists may include ties, except for one case which we show to be
NP-complete.

in the classic setting of bounded degree. We call these classes
\emph{structurally sparse} which means that they are sparse because of their

Title: Approximation algorithms for scheduling a group of heat pumps
Authors: Ji\v{r}\'i Fink
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 15 pages, 1 figure
\\
  This paper studies planning problems for a group of heating systems which
supply the hot water demand for domestic use in houses. These systems (e.g. gas
or electric boilers, heat pumps or microCHPs) use an external energy source to
heat up water and store this hot water for supplying the domestic demands. The
latter allows to some extent a decoupling of the heat production from the heat
demand. We focus on the situation where each heating system has its own demand
and buffer and the supply of the heating systems is coming from a common
source. In practice, the common source may lead to a coupling of the planning
for the group of heating systems. The bottleneck to supply the energy may be
the capacity of the distribution system (e.g. the electricity networks or the
gas network). As this has to be dimensioned for the maximal consumption, it is
important to minimize the maximal peak. This planning problem is known to be
\NP-hard. We present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for four variants
of peak minimization problems, and we determine the worst-case approximation
error.

Title: Signalling Acts of Punishment Promotes the Emergence of Cooperation and
  Enhanced Social Welfare in Evolutionary Games
Authors: Theodor Cimpeanu and The Anh Han
Categories: cs.GT cs.MA
Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures, preprint
\\
  Social punishment has been suggested as a key approach to ensuring high
levels of cooperation and norm compliance in one-shot (i.e. non-repeated)
interactions. However, it has been shown that it only works when punishment is
highly cost-efficient. On the other hand, signalling retribution hearkens back
to medieval sovereignty, insofar as the very word for gallows in French stems
from the Latin word for power and serves as a grim symbol of the ruthlessness
of high justice. Here we introduce the mechanism of signalling an act of
punishment and a special type of defector emerges, one who can recognise this
signal and avoid punishment by way of fear. We describe the analytical
conditions under which threat signalling can maintain high levels of
cooperation. Moreover, we perform extensive agent-based simulations so as to
confirm and expand our understanding of the external factors that influence the
success of social punishment. We show that our suggested mechanism serves as a
catalyst for cooperation, even when signalling is costly or when punishment
would be impractical. We observe the preventive nature of advertising
retributive acts and we contend that the resulting social prosperity is a
desirable outcome in the contexts of AI and multi-agent systems. To conclude,
we argue that fear acts as an effective stimulus to pro-social behaviour.

Title: How to Support Users in Understanding Intelligent Systems? Structuring
  the Discussion
Authors: Malin Eiband, Daniel Buschek, Heinrich Hussmann
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 22 pages, 1 figure
ACM-class: A.1
\\
  The opaque nature of many intelligent systems violates established usability
principles and thus presents a challenge for human-computer interaction.
Research in the field therefore highlights the need for transparency,
scrutability, intelligibility, interpretability and explainability, among
others. While all of these terms carry a vision of supporting users in
understanding intelligent systems, the underlying notions and assumptions about
users and their interaction with the system often remain unclear. We review the
literature in HCI through the lens of implied user questions to synthesise a
conceptual framework integrating user mindsets, user involvement, and knowledge
outcomes to reveal, differentiate and classify current notions in prior work.
This framework aims to resolve conceptual ambiguity in the field and provides
researchers with a thinking tool to clarify their assumptions and become aware
of those made in prior work. We thus hope to advance and structure the dialogue
in the HCI research community on supporting users in understanding intelligent
systems.

Title: Facial Feedback for Reinforcement Learning: A Case Study and Offline
  Analysis Using the TAMER Framework
Authors: Guangliang Li, Hamdi Dibeklio\u{g}lu, Shimon Whiteson and Hayley Hung
Categories: cs.HC cs.LG
\\
  Interactive reinforcement learning provides a way for agents to learn to
solve tasks from evaluative feedback provided by a human user. Previous
research showed that humans give copious feedback early in training but very
sparsely thereafter. In this article, we investigate the potential of agent
learning from trainers' facial expressions via interpreting them as evaluative
feedback. To do so, we implemented TAMER which is a popular interactive
reinforcement learning method in a reinforcement-learning benchmark problem ---
Infinite Mario, and conducted the first large-scale study of TAMER involving
561 participants. With designed CNN-RNN model, our analysis shows that telling
trainers to use facial expressions and competition can improve the accuracies
for estimating positive and negative feedback using facial expressions. In
addition, our results with a simulation experiment show that learning solely
from predicted feedback based on facial expressions is possible and using
strong/effective prediction models or a regression method, facial responses
would significantly improve the performance of agents. Furthermore, our
experiment supports previous studies demonstrating the importance of
bi-directional feedback and competitive elements in the training interface.

Title: Knowledge Graphs for Innovation Ecosystems

  Innovation ecosystems can be naturally described as a collection of networked
entities, such as experts, institutions, projects, technologies and products.
Representing in a machine-readable form these entities and their relations is
not entirely attainable, due to the existence of abstract concepts such as
knowledge and due to the confidential, non-public nature of this information,
but even its partial depiction is of strong interest. The representation of
innovation ecosystems incarnated as knowledge graphs would enable the
generation of reports with new insights, the execution of advanced data
analysis tasks. An ontology to capture the essential entities and relations is
presented, as well as the description of data sources, which can be used to
populate innovation knowledge graphs. Finally, the application case of the
Universidad Politecnica de Madrid is presented, as well as an insight of future
applications.

Title: Navigation-Based Candidate Expansion and Pretrained Language Models for

Categories: cs.IR cs.DL
\\
  Citation recommendation systems for the scientific literature, to help
authors find papers that should be cited, have the potential to speed up
discoveries and uncover new routes for scientific exploration. We treat this
task as a ranking problem, which we tackle with a two-stage approach: candidate
generation followed by re-ranking. Within this framework, we adapt to the
scientific domain a proven combination based on "bag of words" retrieval
followed by re-scoring with a BERT model. We experimentally show the effects of
domain adaptation, both in terms of pretraining on in-domain data and
exploiting in-domain vocabulary. In addition, we introduce a novel
navigation-based document expansion strategy to enrich the candidate documents
processed by our neural models. On three different collections from different
scientific disciplines, we achieve the best-reported results in the citation
recommendation task.

Title: EventMapper: Detecting Real-World Physical Events Using Corroborative
  and Probabilistic Sources
Authors: Abhijit Suprem and Calton Pu
Categories: cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  The ubiquity of social media makes it a rich source for physical event
detection, such as disasters, and as a potential resource for crisis management
resource allocation. There have been some recent works on leveraging social
media sources for retrospective, after-the-fact event detection of large events
such as earthquakes or hurricanes. Similarly, there is a long history of using
traditional physical sensors such as climate satellites to perform regional
event detection. However, combining social media with corroborative physical
sensors for real-time, accurate, and global physical detection has remained
unexplored.
  This paper presents EventMapper, a framework to support event recognition of
small yet equally costly events (landslides, flooding, wildfires). EventMapper
integrates high-latency, high-accuracy corroborative sources such as physical
sensors with low-latency, noisy probabilistic sources such as social media
streams to deliver real-time, global event recognition. Furthermore,
EventMapper is resilient to the concept drift phenomenon, where machine
learning models require continuous fine-tuning to maintain high performance.
  By exploiting the common features of probabilistic and corroborative sources,
EventMapper automates machine learning model updates, maintenance, and
fine-tuning. We describe three applications built on EventMapper for landslide,
wildfire, and flooding detection.

Title: Receive Antenna Selection for Secure Pre-coding Aided Spatial Modulation
Authors: Lin Liu, Guiyang Xia, Jun Zou, Weibin Zhang, Feng Shu and Jiangzhou
  Wang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we make an investigation of receive antenna selection (RAS)
strategies in the secure pre-coding aided spatial modulation (PSM) system with
the aid of artificial noise. Due to a lack of the closed-form expression for
secrecy rate (SR) in secure PSM systems, it is hard to optimize the RAS. To
address this issue, the cut-off rate is used as an approximation of the SR.
Further, two low-complexity RAS schemes for maximizing SR, called Max-SR-L and
Max-SR-H, are derived in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions,
respectively. Due to the fact that the former works well in the low SNR region
but becomes worse in the medium and high SNR regions while the latter also has
the similar problem, a novel RAS strategy Max-SR-A is proposed to cover all SNR
regions. Simulation results show that the proposed Max-SR-H and Max-SR-L
schemes approach the optimal SR performances of the exhaustive search (ES) in
the high and low SNR regions, respectively. In particular, the SR performance
of the proposed Max-SR-A is close to that of the optimal ES and better than
that of the random method in almost all SNR regions.

Title: A Signal-Space Distance Measure for Nondispersive Optical Fiber
Authors: Reza Rafie Borujeny and Frank R. Kschischang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT math.OC
\\
  The nondispersive per-sample channel model for the optical fiber channel is
considered. Under certain smoothness assumptions, the problem of finding the
minimum amount of noise energy that can render two different input points
indistinguishable is formulated. Using the machinery of optimal control theory,
necessary conditions that describe the minimum-energy noise trajectories are
stated as a system of nonlinear differential equations. This minimum energy is
taken as a distance measure. The problem of designing signal constellations
with the largest minimum distance subject to a peak power constraint is
formulated as a clique finding problem. As an example, a 16-point
constellations is designed and compared with the conventional quadrature
amplitude modulation. Based on the control-theoretic viewpoint of this paper, a
new decoding scheme for such nonlinear channels is proposed.

Title: $O(\log \log n)$ Worst-Case Local Decoding and Update Efficiency for
  Data Compression
Authors: Shashank Vatedka and Venkat Chandar and Aslan Tchamkerten
Categories: cs.IT cs.DS math.IT
\\
  This paper addresses the problem of data compression with local decoding and
local update. A compression scheme has worst-case local decoding $d_{wc}$ if
any bit of the raw file can be recovered by probing at most $d_{wc}$ bits of
the compressed sequence, and has update efficiency of $u_{wc}$ if a single bit
of the raw file can be updated by modifying at most $u_{wc}$ bits of the
compressed sequence. This article provides an entropy-achieving compression
scheme for memoryless sources that simultaneously achieves $ O(\log\log n) $
local decoding and update efficiency. Key to this achievability result is a
novel succinct data structure for sparse sequences which allows efficient local
decoding and local update. Under general assumptions on the local decoder and
update algorithms, a converse result shows that $d_{wc}$ and $u_{wc}$ must grow
as $ \Omega(\log\log n) $.

\\
  A private information retrieval (PIR) protocol guarantees that a user can
privately retrieve files stored in database without revealing any information
about the identity of the requested file. Existing information-theoretic PIR
protocols ensure strong privacy, i.e., zero information leakage to the server,
but at the cost of high download. In this work, we present weakly-private
information retrieval (WPIR) schemes that trade off strong privacy to improve
the download cost when the database is stored on a single server, i.e., for the
single server scenario. We study the tradeoff between the download cost and
information leakage in terms of mutual information (MI) and maximal leakage
(MaxL) privacy metrics. By relating the WPIR problem to rate-distortion theory,
the download-leakage function, which is defined as the minimum required
download cost of all single-server WPIR schemes for a given level of
information leakage, is introduced. By characterizing the download-leakage
function for the MI and MaxL metrics, the capacity of single-server WPIR can be
fully characterized.

Title: Communication Efficient Federated Learning over Multiple Access Channels
Authors: Wei-Ting Chang, Ravi Tandon
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
\\
  In this work, we study the problem of federated learning (FL), where
distributed users aim to jointly train a machine learning model with the help
of a parameter server (PS). In each iteration of FL, users compute local
gradients, followed by transmission of the quantized gradients for subsequent
aggregation and model updates at PS. One of the challenges of FL is that of
communication overhead due to FL's iterative nature and large model sizes. One
recent direction to alleviate communication bottleneck in FL is to let users
communicate simultaneously over a multiple access channel (MAC), possibly
making better use of the communication resources.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of FL learning over a MAC. In
particular, we focus on the design of digital gradient transmission schemes
over a MAC, where gradients at each user are first quantized, and then
transmitted over a MAC to be decoded individually at the PS. When designing
digital FL schemes over MACs, there are new opportunities to assign different
amount of resources (such as rate or bandwidth) to different users based on a)
the informativeness of the gradients at each user, and b) the underlying
channel conditions. We propose a stochastic gradient quantization scheme, where
the quantization parameters are optimized based on the capacity region of the
MAC. We show that such channel aware quantization for FL outperforms uniform
quantization, particularly when users experience different channel conditions,
and when have gradients with varying levels of informativeness.

Title: Intermittent Pulling with Local Compensation for Communication-Efficient
  Federated Learning
Authors: Haozhao Wang, Zhihao Qu, Song Guo, Xin Gao, Ruixuan Li, and Baoliu Ye
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Federated Learning is a powerful machine learning paradigm to cooperatively
train a global model with highly distributed data. A major bottleneck on the
performance of distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for
large-scale Federated Learning is the communication overhead on pushing local
gradients and pulling global model. In this paper, to reduce the communication
complexity of Federated Learning, a novel approach named Pulling Reduction with
Local Compensation (PRLC) is proposed. Specifically, each training node
intermittently pulls the global model from the server in SGD iterations,
resulting in that it is sometimes unsynchronized with the server. In such a
case, it will use its local update to compensate the gap between the local
model and the global model. Our rigorous theoretical analysis of PRLC achieves
two important findings. First, we prove that the convergence rate of PRLC
preserves the same order as the classical synchronous SGD for both
strongly-convex and non-convex cases with good scalability due to the linear
speedup with respect to the number of training nodes. Second, we show that PRLC
admits lower pulling frequency than the existing pulling reduction method
without local compensation. We also conduct extensive experiments on various
machine learning models to validate our theoretical results. Experimental
results show that our approach achieves a significant pulling reduction over
the state-of-the-art methods, e.g., PRLC requiring only half of the pulling
operations of LAG.

Title: Data Selection for Federated Learning with Relevant and Irrelevant Data
  at Clients
Authors: Tiffany Tuor, Shiqiang Wang, Bong Jun Ko, Changchang Liu, Kin K. Leung
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC stat.ML
\\
  Federated learning is an effective way of training a machine learning model
from data collected by client devices. A challenge is that among the large
variety of data collected at each client, it is likely that only a subset is
relevant for a learning task while the rest of data has a negative impact on
model training. Therefore, before starting the learning process, it is
important to select the subset of data that is relevant to the given federated
learning task. In this paper, we propose a method for distributedly selecting
relevant data, where we use a benchmark model trained on a small benchmark
dataset that is task-specific, to evaluate the relevance of individual data
samples at each client and select the data with sufficiently high relevance.
Then, each client only uses the selected subset of its data in the federated
learning process. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is evaluated on
multiple real-world datasets in a simulated system with a large number of
clients, showing up to $25\%$ improvement in model accuracy compared to
training with all data.

Title: Deep Transformer Models for Time Series Forecasting: The Influenza
  Prevalence Case
Authors: Neo Wu, Bradley Green, Xue Ben, Shawn O'Banion
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures
\\
  In this paper, we present a new approach to time series forecasting. Time
series data are prevalent in many scientific and engineering disciplines. Time
series forecasting is a crucial task in modeling time series data, and is an
important area of machine learning. In this work we developed a novel method
that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast time series
data. This approach works by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to learn
complex patterns and dynamics from time series data. Moreover, it is a generic
framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series data,
as well as time series embeddings. Using influenza-like illness (ILI)
forecasting as a case study, we show that the forecasting results produced by
our approach are favorably comparable to the state-of-the-art.

Title: FsNet: Feature Selection Network on High-dimensional Biological Data
Authors: Dinesh Singh and Makoto Yamada
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Biological data are generally high-dimensional and require efficient machine
learning methods that are well generalized and scalable to discover their
complex nonlinear patterns. The recent advances in the domain of artificial
intelligence and machine learning can be attributed to deep neural networks
(DNNs) because they accomplish a variety of tasks in computer vision and
natural language processing. However, standard DNNs are not suitable for
handling high-dimensional data and data with small number of samples because
they require a large pool of computing resources as well as plenty of samples
to learn a large number of parameters. In particular, although interpretability
is important for high-dimensional biological data such as gene expression data,
a nonlinear feature selection algorithm for DNN models has not been fully
investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear feature selection
method called the Feature Selection Network (FsNet), which is a scalable
concrete neural network architecture, under high-dimensional and small number
of samples setups. Specifically, our network consists of a selector layer that
uses a concrete random variable for discrete feature selection and a supervised
deep neural network regularized with the reconstruction loss. Because a large
number of parameters in the selector and reconstruction layer can easily cause
overfitting under a limited number of samples, we use two tiny networks to
predict the large virtual weight matrices of the selector and reconstruction
layers. The experimental results on several real-world high-dimensional
biological datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Title: A Deep Learning Approach to Behavior-Based Learner Modeling
Authors: Yuwei Tu, Weiyu Chen, Christopher G. Brinton
Categories: cs.LG cs.HC
\\
  The increasing popularity of e-learning has created demand for improving
online education through techniques such as predictive analytics and content
recommendations. In this paper, we study learner outcome predictions, i.e.,
predictions of how they will perform at the end of a course. We propose a novel
Two Branch Decision Network for performance prediction that incorporates two
important factors: how learners progress through the course and how the content
progresses through the course. We combine clickstream features which log every
action the learner takes while learning, and textual features which are
generated through pre-trained GloVe word embeddings. To assess the performance
of our proposed network, we collect data from a short online course designed
for corporate training and evaluate both neural network and non-neural network
based algorithms on it. Our proposed algorithm achieves 95.7% accuracy and
0.958 AUC score, which outperforms all other models. The results also indicate
the combination of behavior features and text features are more predictive than
behavior features only and neural network models are powerful in capturing the
joint relationship between user behavior and course content.

Categories: cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  Accelerating DNN execution on various resource-limited computing platforms
has been a long-standing problem. Prior works utilize l1-based group lasso or
dynamic regularization such as ADMM to perform structured pruning on DNN models
to leverage the parallel computing architectures. However, both of the pruning
dimensions and pruning methods lack universality, which leads to degraded
performance and limited applicability. To solve the problem, we propose a new
block-based pruning framework that comprises a general and flexible structured
pruning dimension as well as a powerful and efficient reweighted regularization
method. Our framework is universal, which can be applied to both CNNs and RNNs,
implying complete support for the two major kinds of computation-intensive
layers (i.e., CONV and FC layers). To complete all aspects of the
pruning-for-acceleration task, we also integrate compiler-based code
optimization into our framework that can perform DNN inference in a real-time
manner. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the weight
pruning framework achieves universal coverage for both CNNs and RNNs with
real-time mobile acceleration and no accuracy compromise.

\\
  We study empirical scaling laws for language model performance on the
cross-entropy loss. The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset
size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning
more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as
network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple
equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the
dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to
determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are
significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient
training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of
data and stopping significantly before convergence.

Title: Random Matrix Theory Proves that Deep Learning Representations of
  GAN-data Behave as Gaussian Mixtures
Authors: Mohamed El Amine Seddik, Cosme Louart, Mohamed Tamaazousti, Romain
  Couillet
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This paper shows that deep learning (DL) representations of data produced by
generative adversarial nets (GANs) are random vectors which fall within the
class of so-called \textit{concentrated} random vectors. Further exploiting the
fact that Gram matrices, of the type $G = X^T X$ with $X=[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\in
\mathbb{R}^{p\times n}$ and $x_i$ independent concentrated random vectors from
a mixture model, behave asymptotically (as $n,p\to \infty$) as if the $x_i$
were drawn from a Gaussian mixture, suggests that DL representations of
GAN-data can be fully described by their first two statistical moments for a
wide range of standard classifiers. Our theoretical findings are validated by
generating images with the BigGAN model and across different popular deep
representation networks.

\\
  Effective patent value assessment provides decision support for patent
transection and promotes the practical application of patent technology. The
limitations of previous research on patent value assessment were analyzed in
this work, and a wrapper-mode feature selection algorithm that is based on
classifier prediction accuracy was developed. Verification experiments on
multiple UCI standard datasets indicated that the algorithm effectively reduced
the size of the feature set and significantly enhanced the prediction accuracy
of the classifier. When the algorithm was utilized to establish an indicator
system of patent value assessment, the size of the system was reduced, and the
generalization performance of the classifier was enhanced. Sequential forward
selection was applied to further reduce the size of the indicator set and
generate an optimal indicator system of patent value assessment.

Title: Visual Summary of Value-level Feature Attribution in Prediction Classes
  with Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Chuan Wang, Xumeng Wang, Kwan-Liu Ma
Categories: cs.LG cs.HC
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) is increasingly used in decision-making
with temporal sequences. However, understanding how RNN models produce final
predictions remains a major challenge. Existing work on interpreting RNN models
for sequence predictions often focuses on explaining predictions for individual
data instances (e.g., patients or students). Because state-of-the-art
predictive models are formed with millions of parameters optimized over
millions of instances, explaining predictions for single data instances can
easily miss a bigger picture. Besides, many outperforming RNN models use
multi-hot encoding to represent the presence/absence of features, where the
interpretability of feature value attribution is missing. We present ViSFA, an
interactive system that visually summarizes feature attribution over time for
different feature values. ViSFA scales to large data such as the MIMIC dataset
containing the electronic health records of 1.2 million high-dimensional
temporal events. We demonstrate that ViSFA can help us reason RNN prediction
and uncover insights from data by distilling complex attribution into compact
and easy-to-interpret visualizations.

Title: Towards Robust DNNs: An Taylor Expansion-Based Method for Generating
  Powerful Adversarial Examples
Authors: Ya-guan Qian, Xi-Ming Zhang, Bin Wang, Wei Li, Jian-Hai Chen, Wu-Jie

\\
  Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved successful applications in
many fields, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial training
is one of the most effective methods to improve the robustness of DNNs, and it
is generally considered as a minimax point problem that minimizes the loss
function and maximizes the perturbation. Therefore, powerful adversarial
examples can effectively simulate perturbation maximization to solve the
minimax problem. In paper, a novel method was proposed to generate more
powerful adversarial examples for robust adversarial training. The main idea is
to approximates the output of DNNs in the input neighborhood by using the
Taylor expansion, and then optimizes it by using the Lagrange multiplier method
to generate adversarial examples. The experiment results show it can
effectively improve the robust of DNNs trained with these powerful adversarial
examples.

  This paper presents a novel deep learning architecture for short term load
forecasting of building energy loads. The architecture is based on a simple
base learner and multiple boosting systems that are modelled as a single deep
neural network. The architecture transforms the original multivariate time
series into multiple cascading univariate time series. Together with sparse
interactions, parameter sharing and equivariant representations, this approach
makes it possible to combat against overfitting while still achieving good
presentation power with a deep network architecture. The architecture is
evaluated in several short-term load forecasting tasks with energy data from an
office building in Finland. The proposed architecture outperforms
state-of-the-art load forecasting model in all the tasks.

Title: Multi-objective Neural Architecture Search via Non-stationary Policy
  Gradient
Authors: Zewei Chen, Fengwei Zhou, George Trimponias, Zhenguo Li
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Multi-objective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to discover novel
architectures in the presence of multiple conflicting objectives. Recent
approaches based on scalarization and evolution have yielded promising results,
but the problem of approximating the full Pareto front accurately and
efficiently remains challenging. To this end, we explore in this work the novel
reinforcement learning based paradigm of non-stationary policy gradient (NPG).
NPG utilizes a non-stationary reward function, and encourages a continuous
adaptation of the policy to capture the entire Pareto front efficiently. We
introduce two novel reward functions with elements from scalarization and
evolution. To handle non-stationarity, we propose a new exploration scheme
using cosine temperature decay with warm restarts. For fast and accurate
architecture evaluation, we introduce a novel pre-trained shared model that we
continuously fine-tune throughout training. Our extensive experimental study on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet shows that our framework can uncover a
representative Pareto front at fast speeds, while achieving superior predictive
performance than other multi-objective NAS methods, and many state-of-the-art
NAS methods at similar network sizes. Our work demonstrates the potential of
NPG as a simple, fast, and effective paradigm for multi-objective NAS.

  The FloatSD technology has been shown to have excellent performance on
low-complexity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) training and inference. In
this paper, we applied FloatSD to recurrent neural networks (RNNs),

representation, we quantized the gradients and activations in model training to
8 bits. Moreover, the arithmetic precision for accumulations and the master
copy of weights were reduced from 32 bits to 16 bits. We demonstrated that the
proposed training scheme can successfully train several LSTM models from
scratch, while fully preserving model accuracy. Finally, to verify the proposed
method's advantage in implementation, we designed an LSTM neuron circuit and
showed that it achieved significantly reduced die area and power consumption.

Title: Ada-LISTA: Learned Solvers Adaptive to Varying Models
Authors: Aviad Aberdam, Alona Golts, Michael Elad
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Neural networks that are based on unfolding of an iterative solver, such as
LISTA (learned iterative soft threshold algorithm), are widely used due to
their accelerated performance. Nevertheless, as opposed to non-learned solvers,
these networks are trained on a certain dictionary, and therefore they are
inapplicable for varying model scenarios. This work introduces an adaptive
learned solver, termed Ada-LISTA, which receives pairs of signals and their
corresponding dictionaries as inputs, and learns a universal architecture to
serve them all. We prove that this scheme is guaranteed to solve sparse coding
in linear rate for varying models, including dictionary perturbations and
permutations. We also provide an extensive numerical study demonstrating its
practical adaptation capabilities. Finally, we deploy Ada-LISTA to natural
image inpainting, where the patch-masks vary spatially, thus requiring such an
adaptation.

model in generalizing beyond the Cornell Grasping Dataset (CGD) despite having
limited amount of labelled data. We validate this claim by testing the model on
images not there in the CGD. Also, the model performs significantly better than
existing approaches which do not make use of unlabeled images to improve the
grasp.

Title: Pelican: A Deep Residual Network for Network Intrusion Detection
Authors: Peilun Wu and Hui Guo
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR eess.SP
\\
  One challenge for building a secure network communication environment is how
to effectively detect and prevent malicious network behaviours. The abnormal
network activities threaten users' privacy and potentially damage the function
and infrastructure of the whole network. To address this problem, the network
intrusion detection system (NIDS) has been used. By continuously monitoring
network activities, the system can timely identify attacks and prompt
counter-attack actions. NIDS has been evolving over years. The
current-generation NIDS incorporates machine learning (ML) as the core
technology in order to improve the detection performance on novel attacks.
However, the high detection rate achieved by a traditional ML-based detection
method is often accompanied by large false-alarms, which greatly affects its
overall performance. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network, Pelican,
that is built upon specially-designed residual blocks. We evaluated Pelican on
two network traffic datasets, NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. Our experiments show that
Pelican can achieve a high attack detection performance while keeping a much
low false alarm rate when compared with a set of up-to-date machine learning
based designs.

Title: Information Compensation for Deep Conditional Generative Networks
Authors: Zehao Wang, Kaili Wang, Tinne Tuytelaars, Jose Oramas
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  In recent years, unsupervised/weakly-supervised conditional generative
adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved many successes on the task of
modeling and generating data. However, one of their weaknesses lies in their
poor ability to separate, or disentangle, the different factors that
characterize the representation encoded in their latent space. To address this
issue, we propose a novel structure for unsupervised conditional GANs powered
by a novel Information Compensation Connection (IC-Connection). The proposed
IC-Connection enables GANs to compensate for information loss incurred during
deconvolution operations. In addition, to quantify the degree of
disentanglement on both discrete and continuous latent variables, we design a
novel evaluation procedure. Our empirical results suggest that our method
achieves better disentanglement compared to the state-of-the-art GANs in a
conditional generation setting.

\\
  This paper addresses two crucial problems of learning disentangled image
representations, namely controlling the degree of disentanglement during image
editing, and balancing the disentanglement strength and the reconstruction
quality. To encourage disentanglement, we devise a distance covariance based
decorrelation regularization. Further, for the reconstruction step, our model
leverages a soft target representation combined with the latent image code. By
exploring the real-valued space of the soft target representation, we are able
to synthesize novel images with the designated properties. To improve the
perceptual quality of images generated by autoencoder (AE)-based models, we
extend the encoder-decoder architecture with the generative adversarial network
(GAN) by collapsing the AE decoder and the GAN generator into one. We also
design a classification based protocol to quantitatively evaluate the
disentanglement strength of our model. Experimental results showcase the
benefits of the proposed model.

\\
  Federated learning is a new machine learning framework which enables
different parties to collaboratively train a model while protecting data
privacy and security. Due to model complexity, network unreliability and
connection in-stability, communication cost has became a major bottleneck for
applying federated learning to real-world applications. Current existing
strategies are either need to manual setting for hyper-parameters, or break up
the original process into multiple steps, which make it hard to realize
end-to-end implementation. In this paper, we propose a novel compression
strategy called Residual Pooling Network (RPN). Our experiments show that RPN
not only reduce data transmission effectively, but also achieve almost the same
performance as compared to standard federated learning. Our new approach
performs as an end-to-end procedure, which should be readily applied to all
CNN-based model training scenarios for improvement of communication efficiency,
and hence make it easy to deploy in real-world application without human
intervention.

  Technological change and innovation are vitally important, especially for
high-tech companies. However, factors influencing their future research and
development (R&D) trends are both complicated and various, leading it a quite
difficult task to make technology tracing for high-tech companies. To this end,
in this paper, we develop a novel data-driven solution, i.e., Deep Technology
Forecasting (DTF) framework, to automatically find the most possible technology
directions customized to each high-tech company. Specially, DTF consists of
three components: Potential Competitor Recognition (PCR), Collaborative
Technology Recognition (CTR), and Deep Technology Tracing (DTT) neural network.
For one thing, PCR and CTR aim to capture competitive relations among
enterprises and collaborative relations among technologies, respectively. For

Title: Compositional properties of emergent languages in deep learning
Authors: Bence Keresztury and Elia Bruni
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Recent findings in multi-agent deep learning systems point towards the
emergence of compositional languages. These claims are often made without exact
analysis or testing of the language. In this work, we analyze the emergent
language resulting from two different cooperative multi-agent game with more
exact measures for compositionality. Our findings suggest that solutions found
by deep learning models are often lacking the ability to reason on an abstract
level therefore failing to generalize the learned knowledge to out of the
training distribution examples. Strategies for testing compositional capacities
and emergence of human-level concepts are discussed.

Title: Intelligent Chest X-ray Worklist Prioritization by CNNs: A Clinical
  Workflow Simulation

\\
  Growing radiologic workload and shortage of medical experts worldwide often
lead to delayed or even unreported examinations, which poses a risk for
patient's safety in case of unrecognized findings in chest radiographs (CXR).
The aim was to evaluate, whether deep learning algorithms for an intelligent
worklist prioritization might optimize the radiology workflow and can reduce
report turnaround times (RTAT) for critical findings, instead of reporting
according to the First-In-First-Out-Principle (FIFO). Furthermore, we
investigated the problem of false negative prediction in the context of
worklist prioritization. To assess the potential benefit of an intelligent
worklist prioritization, three different workflow simulations based on our
analysis were run and RTAT were compared: FIFO (non-prioritized), Prio1
(prioritized) and Prio2 (prioritized, with RTATmax.). Examination triage was
performed by "ChestXCheck", a convolutional neural network, classifying eight
different pathological findings ranked in descending order of urgency:
pneumothorax, pleural effusion, infiltrate, congestion, atelectasis,
cardiomegaly, mass and foreign object. The average RTAT for all critical
findings was significantly reduced by both Prio simulations compared to the
FIFO simulation (e.g. pneumothorax: 32.1 min vs. 69.7 min; p < 0.0001), while
the average RTAT for normal examinations increased at the same time (69.5 min
vs. 90.0 min; p < 0.0001). Both effects were slightly lower at Prio2 than at
Prio1, whereas the maximum RTAT at Prio1 was substantially higher for all
classes, due to individual examinations rated false negative.Our Prio2
simulation demonstrated that intelligent worklist prioritization by deep
learning algorithms reduces average RTAT for critical findings in chest X-ray
while maintaining a similar maximum RTAT as FIFO.

Title: Structured Compression and Sharing of Representational Space for
  Continual Learning
Authors: Gobinda Saha, Isha Garg, Aayush Ankit and Kaushik Roy
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Humans are skilled at learning adaptively and efficiently throughout their
lives, but learning tasks incrementally causes artificial neural networks to
overwrite relevant information learned about older tasks, resulting in
'Catastrophic Forgetting'. Efforts to overcome this phenomenon suffer from poor
utilization of resources in many ways, such as through the need to save older
data or parametric importance scores, or to grow the network architecture. We
propose an algorithm that enables a network to learn continually and
efficiently by partitioning the representational space into a Core space, that
contains the condensed information from previously learned tasks, and a
Residual space, which is akin to a scratch space for learning the current task.
The information in the Residual space is then compressed using Principal
Component Analysis and added to the Core space, freeing up parameters for the
next task. We evaluate our algorithm on P-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets. We achieve comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods while
overcoming the problem of catastrophic forgetting completely. Additionally, we
get up to 4.5x improvement in energy efficiency during inference due to the
structured nature of the resulting architecture.

Title: Best Arm Identification for Cascading Bandits in the Fixed Confidence
  Setting
Authors: Zixin Zhong, Wang Chi Cheung, and Vincent Y.F. Tan
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 38 pages, 25 figures
\\
  We design and analyze CascadeBAI, an algorithm for finding the best set of
$K$ items, also called an arm, within the framework of cascading bandits. An
upper bound on the time complexity of CascadeBAI is derived by overcoming a
crucial analytical challenge, namely, that of probabilistically estimating the
amount of available feedback at each step. To do so, we define a new class of
random variables (r.v.'s) which we term as left-sided sub-Gaussian r.v.'s;
these are r.v.'s whose cumulant generating functions (CGFs) can be bounded by a
quadratic only for non-positive arguments of the CGFs. This enables the
application of a sufficiently tight Bernstein-type concentration inequality. We
show, through the derivation of a lower bound on the time complexity, that the
performance of CascadeBAI is optimal in some practical regimes. Finally,
extensive numerical simulations corroborate the efficacy of CascadeBAI as well
as the tightness of our upper bound on its time complexity.

Title: Towards Automatic Clustering Analysis using Traces of Information Gain:
  The InfoGuide Method
Authors: Paulo Rocha, Diego Pinheiro, Martin Cadeiras, Carmelo Bastos-Filho
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: The 33rd International FLAIRS Conference
\\
  Clustering analysis has become a ubiquitous information retrieval tool in a
wide range of domains, but a more automatic framework is still lacking. Though
internal metrics are the key players towards a successful retrieval of
clusters, their effectiveness on real-world datasets remains not fully
understood, mainly because of their unrealistic assumptions underlying
datasets. We hypothesized that capturing {\it traces of information gain}
between increasingly complex clustering retrievals---{\it InfoGuide}---enables
an automatic clustering analysis with improved clustering retrievals. We
validated the {\it InfoGuide} hypothesis by capturing the traces of information
gain using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and comparing the clusters
retrieved by {\it InfoGuide} against those retrieved by other commonly used
internal metrics in artificially-generated, benchmarks, and real-world
datasets. Our results suggested that {\it InfoGuide} can enable a more
automatic clustering analysis and may be more suitable for retrieving clusters
in real-world datasets displaying nontrivial statistical properties.

Title: Expected Information Maximization: Using the I-Projection for Mixture
  Density Estimation
Authors: Philipp Becker, Oleg Arenz, Gerhard Neumann
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Modelling highly multi-modal data is a challenging problem in machine
learning. Most algorithms are based on maximizing the likelihood, which
corresponds to the M(oment)-projection of the data distribution to the model
distribution. The M-projection forces the model to average over modes it cannot
represent. In contrast, the I(information)-projection ignores such modes in the
data and concentrates on the modes the model can represent. Such behavior is
appealing whenever we deal with highly multi-modal data where modelling single
modes correctly is more important than covering all the modes. Despite this
advantage, the I-projection is rarely used in practice due to the lack of
algorithms that can efficiently optimize it based on data. In this work, we
present a new algorithm called Expected Information Maximization (EIM) for
computing the I-projection solely based on samples for general latent variable
models, where we focus on Gaussian mixtures models and Gaussian mixtures of
experts. Our approach applies a variational upper bound to the I-projection
objective which decomposes the original objective into single objectives for
each mixture component as well as for the coefficients, allowing an efficient
optimization. Similar to GANs, our approach employs discriminators but uses a
more stable optimization procedure, using a tight upper bound. We show that our
algorithm is much more effective in computing the I-projection than recent GAN
approaches and we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach for modelling
multi-modal behavior on two pedestrian and traffic prediction datasets.

Title: Star Games and Hydras
Authors: J\"org Endrullis, Jan Willem Klop, Roy Overbeek
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  The recursive path ordering is an established and crucial tool in term
rewriting to prove termination. We revisit its presentation by means of some
simple rules on trees equipped with a `star' as control symbol, signifying a
command to make that tree (or term) smaller in the order being defined. This
leads to star games that are very convenient for proving termination of many
rewriting tasks. For instance, using already the simplest star game on finite
unlabeled trees, we obtain a very direct proof of termination of the famous
Hydra battle. We also include an alternative road to setting up the star games,
using a proof method of Buchholz, and a quantitative version of the star as
control symbol. We conclude with a number of questions and future research
directions.

  In this paper we study the linear systems arising from discretized

Biot model under the unified relationship framework between well-posedness and
preconditioners. By the unified theory, we show all the considered
preconditioners are uniformly optimal with respect to material and

Title: An asymptotic preserving semi-implicit multiderivative solver
Authors: Jochen Sch\"utz and David C. Seal
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 18 Pages
MSC-class: 65L20
\\
  In this work we construct a multiderivative implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme
for a class of stiff ordinary differential equations. Our solver is high-order
accurate and has an asymptotic preserving (AP) property. The proposed method is
based upon a two-derivative backward Taylor series base solver, which we show
has an AP property. Higher order accuracies are found by iterating the result
over a high-order multiderivative interpolant of the right hand side function,
which we again prove has an AP property. Theoretical results showcasing the
asymptotic consistency as well as the high-order accuracy of the solver are
presented. In addition, an extension of the solver to an arbitrarily split
right hand side function is also offered. Numerical results for a collection of
standard test cases from the literature are presented that support the
theoretical findings of the paper.

Title: Substitution of subspace collections with nonorthogonal subspaces to
  accelerate Fast Fourier Transform methods applied to conducting composites
Authors: Graeme W. Milton
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 18 pages
\\
  We show the power of the algebra of subspace collections developed in Chapter
7 of the book "Extending the Theory of Composites to Other Areas of Science
(edited by Milton, 2016). Specifically we accelerate the Fast Fourier Transform
schemes of Moulinec and Suquet and Eyre and Milton (1994, 1998) for computing
the fields and effective tensor in a conducting periodic medium by substituting
a subspace collection with nonorthogonal subspaces inside one with orthogonal
subspaces. This can be done when the effective conductivity as a function of
the conductivity $\sigma_1$ of the inclusion phase (with the matrix phase
conductivity set to $1$) has its singularities confined to an interval
$[-\beta,-\alpha]$ of the negative real $\sigma_1$ axis. Numerical results of
Moulinec and Suquet show accelerated convergence for the model example of a
square array of squares at $25\%$ volume fraction. For other problems we show
how $Q^*_C$-convex functions can be used to restrict the region where
singularities of the effective tensor as a function of the component tensors
might be found.

Title: Efficient, positive, and energy stable schemes for multi-D
  Poisson-Nernst-Planck systems
Authors: Hailiang Liu and Wumaier Maimaitiyiming
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 32 pages, 3 tables, 4 figures
\\
  In this paper, we design, analyze, and numerically validate positive and
energy-dissipating schemes for solving the time-dependent multi-dimensional
system of Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, which has found much use in
the modeling of biological membrane channels and semiconductor devices. The
semi-implicit time discretization based on a reformulation of the system gives
a well-posed elliptic system, which is shown to preserve solution positivity
for arbitrary time steps. The first order (in time) fully-discrete scheme is
shown to preserve solution positivity and mass conservation unconditionally,
and energy dissipation with only a mild $O(1)$ time step restriction. The
scheme is also shown to preserve the steady-state. For the fully second order
(in both time and space) scheme with large time steps, solution positivity is
restored by a local scaling limiter, which is shown to maintain the spatial
accuracy. These schemes are easy to implement. Several three-dimensional
numerical examples verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed schemes, as well as the
fast approach to steady states.

Title: Solving advection-diffusion-reaction problems in layered media using the
  Laplace transform
Authors: Elliot J. Carr
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 11 pages, 3 figures
\\
  We derive a semi-analytical Laplace-transform based solution to the
one-dimensional linear advection-diffusion-reaction equation in a layered
medium. Our solution approach involves introducing unknown functions
representing the diffusive flux at the interfaces between adjacent layers,
allowing the multilayer problem to be solved separately on each layer in the
Laplace domain before being numerically inverted back to the time domain. The
derived solution is applicable to the most general form of linear
advection-diffusion-reaction equation, a finite medium comprising an arbitrary
number of layers, continuity of concentration and diffusive flux at the
interfaces between adjacent layers and transient boundary conditions of
arbitrary type at the two boundaries. Our derived semi-analytical solution
extends and addresses deficiencies of existing Laplace-transform based
solutions in a layered medium, which consider diffusion or reaction-diffusion
only. Code implementing our semi-analytical solution is provided and applied to
a selection of test cases, with the reported results in excellent agreement
with a standard numerical solution and other analytical results available in
the literature.

Title: Randomized sparse grid algorithms for multivariate integration on
  Haar-Wavelet spaces
Authors: Marcin Wnuk and Michael Gnewuch
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  The \emph{deterministic} sparse grid method, also known as Smolyak's method,
is a well-established and widely used tool to tackle multivariate approximation
problems, and there is a vast literature on it. Much less is known about
\emph{randomized} versions of the sparse grid method. In this paper we analyze
randomized sparse grid algorithms, namely randomized sparse grid quadratures
for multivariate integration on the $D$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1)^D$. Let
$d,s \in \mathbb{N}$ be such that $D=d\cdot s$. The $s$-dimensional building
blocks of the sparse grid quadratures are based on stratified sampling for
$s=1$ and on scrambled $(0,m,s)$-nets for $s\ge 2$. The spaces of integrands
and the error criterion we consider are Haar wavelet spaces with parameter
$\alpha$ and the randomized error (i.e., the worst case root mean square
error), respectively. We prove sharp (i.e., matching) upper and lower bounds
for the convergence rates of the $N$-th mininimal errors for all possible
combinations of the parameters $d$ and $s$.
  Our upper error bounds still hold if we consider as spaces of integrands
Sobolev spaces of mixed dominated smoothness with smoothness parameters $1/2<
\alpha < 1$ instead of Haar wavelet spaces.

suitable geometric description of the set of fixed rank matrices which relies
on a natural parametrization of matrices. More precisely, it is endowed with
the structure of analytic principal bundle, with an explicit description of
local charts. For matrix differential equations, we introduce a first order
numerical integrator working in local coordinates. The resulting chart based
algorithm can be interpreted as a particular splitting of the projection
operator onto the tangent space of the low-rank matrix manifold. It is proven
to be robust and exact in some particular case. Numerical experiments confirm
these results and illustrate the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Locking free and gradient robust H(div)-conforming HDG methods for
  linear elasticity
Authors: Guosheng Fu, Christoph Lehrenfeld, Alexander Linke, Timo Streckenbach
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Robust discretization methods for (nearly-incompressible) linear elasticity
are free of volume-locking and gradient-robust. While volume-locking is a
well-known problem that can be dealt with in many different discretization
approaches, the concept of gradient-robustness for linear elasticity is new. We
discuss both aspects and propose novel Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)
methods for linear elasticity. The starting point for these methods is a
divergence-conforming discretization. As a consequence of its well-behaved
Stokes limit the method is gradient-robust and free of volume-locking. To
improve computational efficiency, we additionally consider discretizations with
relaxed divergence-conformity and a modification which re-enables
gradient-robustness, yielding a robust and quasi-optimal discretization also in
the sense of HDG superconvergence.

Authors: William Layton, Wenlong Pei, Yi Qin and Catalin Trenchea
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  The two-step time discretization proposed by Dahlquist, Liniger and
Nevanlinna is variable step $G$-stable. (In contrast, for increasing time
steps, the BDF2 method loses $A$-stability and suffers non-physical energy
growth in the approximate solution.) While unexplored, it is thus ideal for
time accurate approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations. This report
presents an analysis, for variable time-steps, of the method's stability and
convergence rates when applied to the NSE. It is proven that the method is
variable step, unconditionally, long time stable and second order accurate.
Variable step error estimates are also proven. The results are supported by
several numerical tests.

Categories: cs.NE cs.CV
Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, submitted for IJCNN 2020
\\
  Convolutional neural networks are based on a huge number of trained weights.
Consequently, they are often data-greedy, sensitive to overtraining, and learn
slowly. We follow the line of research in which filters of convolutional neural
layers are determined on the basis of a smaller number of trained parameters.
In this paper, the trained parameters define a frequency spectrum which is
transformed into convolutional filters with Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform
(IDCT, the same is applied in decompression from JPEG). We analyze how
switching off selected components of the spectra, thereby reducing the number
of trained weights of the network, affects its performance. Our experiments
show that coding the filters with trained DCT parameters leads to improvement
over traditional convolution. Also, the performance of the networks modified
this way decreases very slowly with the increasing extent of switching off
these parameters. In some experiments, a good performance is observed when even
99.9% of these parameters are switched off.

Title: To schedule or not to schedule: when no-scheduling can beat the
  best-known flow scheduling algorithm in datacenter networks
Authors: Soheil Abbasloo, Yang Xu, H. Jonathan Chao
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Conventional wisdom for minimizing the average flow completion time (AFCT) in
the datacenter network (DCN), where flow sizes are highly variable, would
suggest scheduling every individual flow. However, we show that considering
scheduling delay (including scheduler's computational and communication
delays), serving most of the flows without any scheduling and only in
first-come-first-served (FCFS) manner significantly improves their performance
even when it is compared to the shortest remaining processing time (SRPT)-known
as optimum algorithm when scheduling delay is zero. To do so, we only require
to have two coarse classes of flows categorized based on flows' sizes
(1st-class including flows smaller than a threshold, H, and 2nd-class including
others) and serve 1st-class flows always before serving 2nd-class ones. To show
that, we take SRPT scheduling algorithm accompanied by the global knowledge of
flows, formulate impact of scheduling delay on its performance, and prove that
for any flow size distribution and network load (<1), there is always a
threshold, H, which guarantees 1st-class flows achieve lower AFCT under FCFS
compared to SRPT. Our numerically calculated results and extensive flow-level
simulations show that on average, more than 90% of flows could be in 1st-class
and consequently do not require any scheduling.

Title: Characterizing Smart Home IoT Traffic in the Wild

Comments: 12 pages, to be published in IoTDI 2020
\\
  As the smart home IoT ecosystem flourishes, it is imperative to gain a better
understanding of the unique challenges it poses in terms of management,
security, and privacy. Prior studies are limited because they examine smart
home IoT devices in testbed environments or at a small scale. To address this
gap, we present a measurement study of smart home IoT devices in the wild by
instrumenting home gateways and passively collecting real-world network traffic
logs from more than 200 homes across a large metropolitan area in the United
States. We characterize smart home IoT traffic in terms of its volume, temporal
patterns, and external endpoints along with focusing on certain security and
privacy concerns. We first show that traffic characteristics reflect the
functionality of smart home IoT devices such as smart TVs generating high
volume traffic to content streaming services following diurnal patterns
associated with human activity. While the smart home IoT ecosystem seems
fragmented, our analysis reveals that it is mostly centralized due to its
reliance on a few popular cloud and DNS services. Our findings also highlight
several interesting security and privacy concerns in smart home IoT ecosystem
such as the need to improve policy-based access control for IoT traffic, lack
of use of application layer encryption, and prevalence of third-party
advertising and tracking services. Our findings have important implications for
future research on improving management, security, and privacy of the smart

system, higher protocols from network to transport and application layer can be
used and tested in VLC-related experiments. Our approach has the advantage that
a VLC experimenter can fully focus on VLC-related low-level aspects like the
design of novel VLC front-ends, e.g. LED drivers, lenses, and photodetectors
and test their impact directly on the full network protocol stack in an
end-to-end manner with real applications like adaptive video streaming. We
present first results from experiments using our prototype showing the
performance of unidirectional VLC transmission. Here we analyze the distortions
introduced as well as the relationship between signal strength on frame error
rate for different MCS and the maximum communication distance. Experimental
results reveal that a data rate of up to 150 Mbps is possible over short
ranges.

Title: Congestion Control Mechanisms in IEEE 802.11p and Sidelink C-V2X
Authors: Alessandro Bazzi
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Connected vehicles are expected to play a major role in the next future to
improve safety and traffic efficiency on the road and short-range technologies
have been defined to enable the direct exchange of information. To this aim,
two solutions are currently the subject of a debate that goes beyond the
technician, i.e., IEEE 802.11p and sidelink cellular-vehicle-to-anything
(C-V2X). Tested and mature for deployment the first, possibly more efficient
the second. In both cases, one of the main aspects is the management of channel
congestions, which can cause serious packet losses and have a critical impact
on the reliability of applications. Congestions can be managed through
different approaches, including the control of transmission power, packet
generation frequency, and the adopted modulation and coding scheme. Congestion
management has been well studied in IEEE 802.11p, with consolidated algorithms
included in the standards, whereas it appears somehow as a new topic looking at
C-V2X. In this work, a review of the main congestion control mechanisms and a
discussion of their applicability and efficiency in the two technologies is
provided. This topic is addressed without focusing on specific algorithms and
with the aim to provide general guidelines as a starting point for new
proposals.

Title: Synchronous Transmissions in Low-Power Wireless: A Survey of
  Communication Protocols and Network Services
Authors: Marco Zimmerling, Luca Mottola, Silvia Santini
Categories: cs.NI cs.DC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: Submitted to ACM Computing Surveys
\\
  Low-power wireless communication is a central building block of
Cyber-physical Systems and the Internet of Things. Conventional low-power
wireless protocols make avoiding packet collisions a cornerstone design choice.
The concept of synchronous transmissions challenges this view. As collisions
are not necessarily destructive, under specific circumstances, commodity
low-power wireless radios are often able to receive useful information even in
the presence of superimposed signals from different transmitters. We survey the
growing number of protocols that exploit synchronous transmissions for higher
robustness and efficiency as well as unprecedented functionality and
versatility compared to conventional designs. The illustration of protocols
based on synchronous transmissions is cast in a conceptional framework we
establish, with the goal of highlighting differences and similarities among the
proposed solutions. We conclude the paper with a discussion on open research
questions in this field.

Title: Discovering the IPv6 Network Periphery
Authors: Erik C. Rye, Robert Beverly
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  We consider the problem of discovering the IPv6 network periphery, i.e., the
last hop router connecting endhosts in the IPv6 Internet. Finding the IPv6
periphery using active probing is challenging due to the IPv6 address space
size, wide variety of provider addressing and subnetting schemes, and
incomplete topology traces. As such, existing topology mapping systems can miss
the large footprint of the IPv6 periphery, disadvantaging applications ranging
from IPv6 census studies to geolocation and network resilience. We introduce
"edgy," an approach to explicitly discover the IPv6 network periphery, and use
it to find >~64M IPv6 periphery router addresses and >~87M links to these last
hops -- several orders of magnitude more than in currently available IPv6
topologies. Further, only 0.2% of edgy's discovered addresses are known to
existing IPv6 hitlists.

Title: A Probabilistic Framework for Imitating Human Race Driver Behavior

  (RA-L)

\\
  Understanding and modeling human driver behavior is crucial for advanced
vehicle development. However, unique driving styles, inconsistent behavior, and
complex decision processes render it a challenging task, and existing
approaches often lack variability or robustness. To approach this problem, we
propose Probabilistic Modeling of Driver behavior (ProMoD), a modular framework
which splits the task of driver behavior modeling into multiple modules. A
global target trajectory distribution is learned with Probabilistic Movement
Primitives, clothoids are utilized for local path generation, and the
corresponding choice of actions is performed by a neural network. Experiments
in a simulated car racing setting show considerable advantages in imitation
accuracy and robustness compared to other imitation learning algorithms. The
modular architecture of the proposed framework facilitates straightforward
extensibility in driving line adaptation and sequencing of multiple movement
primitives for future research.

Title: Socially intelligent task and motion planning for human-robot
  interaction
Authors: Andrea Frank, Laurel Riek
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
Comments: 2 pages plus references, no figures. Presented at RSS 2019 Workshop
  on Robust Task and Motion Planning
\\
  As social beings, much human behavior is predicated on social context - the
ambient social state that includes cultural norms, social signals, individual
preferences, etc. In this paper, we propose a socially-aware task and motion
planning algorithm that considers social context to generate appropriate and
effective plans in human social environments (HSEs). The key strength of our
proposed approach is that it explicitly models how potential actions not only
affect objective cost, but also transform the social context in which it plans
and acts. We investigate strategies to limit the complexity of our algorithm,
so that our planner will remain tractable for mobile platforms in complex HSEs
like hospitals and factories. The planner will also consider the relative
importance and urgency of its tasks, which it uses to determine when it is and
is not appropriate to violate social expectations to achieve its objective.
This social awareness will allow robots to understand a fundamental rule of
society: just because something makes your job easier, does not make it the
right thing to do!
  To our knowledge, the proposed work is the first task and motion planning
approach that supports socially intelligent robot policy for HSEs. Through this
ongoing work, robots will be able to understand, respect, and leverage social
context accomplish tasks both acceptably and effectively in HSEs.

Title: Fast, Compact and Highly Scalable Visual Place Recognition through
  Sequence-based Matching of Overloaded Representations
Authors: Sourav Garg and Michael Milford
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures, Accepted for oral presentation at the 2020 IEEE
  International Conference on Robotics and Automation
\\
  Visual place recognition algorithms trade off three key characteristics:
their storage footprint, their computational requirements, and their resultant
performance, often expressed in terms of recall rate. Significant prior work
has investigated highly compact place representations, sub-linear computational
scaling and sub-linear storage scaling techniques, but have always involved a
significant compromise in one or more of these regards, and have only been
demonstrated on relatively small datasets. In this paper we present a novel
place recognition system which enables for the first time the combination of
ultra-compact place representations, near sub-linear storage scaling and
extremely lightweight compute requirements. Our approach exploits the
inherently sequential nature of much spatial data in the robotics domain and
inverts the typical target criteria, through intentionally coarse scalar
quantization-based hashing that leads to more collisions but is resolved by
sequence-based matching. For the first time, we show how effective place
recognition rates can be achieved on a new very large 10 million place dataset,
requiring only 8 bytes of storage per place and 37K unitary operations to
achieve over 50% recall for matching a sequence of 100 frames, where a
conventional state-of-the-art approach both consumes 1300 times more compute
and fails catastrophically. We present analysis investigating the effectiveness
of our hashing overload approach under varying sizes of quantized vector
length, comparison of near miss matches with the actual match selections and
characterise the effect of variance re-scaling of data on quantization.

Title: Impact-aware humanoid robot motion generation with a quadratic
  optimization controller
Authors: Yuquan Wang, Arnaud Tanguy, Pierre Gergondet, and Abderrahmane Kheddar
Categories: cs.RO eess.SP
\\
  Impact-aware tasks (i.e. on purpose impacts) are not handled in
multi-objective whole body controllers of hu-manoid robots. This leads to the
fact that a humanoid robot typically operates at near-zero velocity to interact
with the external environment. We explicitly investigate the propagation of the
impact-induced velocity and torque jumps along the structure linkage and
propose a set of constraints that always satisfy the hardware limits, sustain
already established contacts and the stability measure, i.e. the zero moment
point condition. Without assumptions on the impact location or timing, our
proposed controller enables humanoid robots to generate non-zero contact
velocity without breaking the established contacts or falling. The novelty of
our approach lies in building on existing continuous dynamics whole body
multi-objective controller without the need of reset-maps or hybrid control.

\\
  Robots coexisting with humans in their environment and performing services
for them need the ability to interact with them. One particular requirement for
such robots is that they are able to understand spatial relations and can place
objects in accordance with the spatial relations expressed by their user. In
this work, we present a convolutional neural network for estimating pixelwise
object placement probabilities for a set of spatial relations from a single
input image. During training, our network receives the learning signal by
classifying hallucinated high-level scene representations as an auxiliary task.
Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require ground truth data for
the pixelwise relational probabilities or 3D models of the objects, which
significantly expands the applicability in practical applications. Our results
obtained using real-world data and human-robot experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in reasoning about the best way to place objects to
reproduce a spatial relation.

Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1905.10706
\\
  A key ingredient to achieving intelligent behavior is physical understanding
that equips robots with the ability to reason about the effects of their
actions in a dynamic environment. Several methods have been proposed to learn
dynamics models from data that inform model-based control algorithms. While
such learning-based approaches can model locally observed behaviors, they fail
to generalize to more complex dynamics and under long time horizons.
  In this work, we introduce a differentiable physics simulator for rigid body
dynamics. Leveraging various techniques for differential equation integration
and gradient calculation, we compare different methods for parameter estimation
that allow us to infer the simulation parameters that are relevant to
estimation and control of physical systems. In the context of trajectory
optimization, we introduce a closed-loop model-predictive control algorithm
that infers the simulation parameters through experience while achieving
cost-minimizing performance.

Categories: cs.RO cs.MS cs.NE
\\
  Voxel-based soft robots (VSRs) are aggregations of soft blocks whose design
is amenable to optimization. We here present a software, 2D-VSR-Sim, for
facilitating research concerning the optimization of VSRs body and brain. The
software, written in Java, provides consistent interfaces for all the VSRs
aspects suitable for optimization and considers by design the presence of
sensing, i.e., the possibility of exploiting the feedback from the environment
for controlling the VSR. We experimentally characterize, from a mechanical
point of view, the VSRs that can be simulated with 2D-VSR-Sim and we discuss
the computational burden of the simulation. Finally, we show how 2D-VSR-Sim can
be used to repeat the experiments of significant previous studies and, in
perspective, to provide experimental answers to a variety of research
questions.

Title: Trajectory Planning for Connected and Automated Vehicles: Cruising, Lane
  Changing, and Platooning
Authors: Xiangguo Liu, Guangchen Zhao, Neda Masoud, Qi Zhu
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Autonomy and connectivity are considered among the most promising
technologies to improve safety, mobility, fuel and time consumption in
transportation systems. Some of the fuel efficiency benefits of connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) can be realized through platooning. A platoon is a
virtual train of CAVs that travel together following the platoon head, with
small gaps between them. Vehicles may also reduce travel time by lane changing.
In this paper, we devise an optimal control-based trajectory planning model
that can provide safe and efficient trajectories for the subject vehicle and
can incorporate platooning and lane changing. We embed this trajectory planning
model in a simulation framework to quantify its efficiency benefits as it
relates to fuel consumption and travel time, in a dynamic traffic stream.
Furthermore, we perform extensive numerical experiments to investigate whether,
and the circumstances under which, the vehicles in upstream of the subject
vehicle may also experience second-hand fuel efficiency benefits.

Title: AprilTags 3D: Dynamic Fiducial Markers for Robust Pose Estimation in
  Highly Reflective Environments and Indirect Communication in Swarm Robotics
Authors: Luis A. Mateos
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages, 11 figures, IROS 2020
\\
  Although fiducial markers give an accurate pose estimation in laboratory
conditions, where the noisy factors are controlled, using them in field robotic
applications remains a challenge. This is constrained to the fiducial maker
systems, since they only work within the RGB image space. As a result, noises
in the image produce large pose estimation errors. In robotic applications,
fiducial markers have been mainly used in its original and simple form, as a
plane in a printed paper sheet. This setup is sufficient for basic visual
servoing and augmented reality applications, but not for complex swarm robotic
applications in which the setup consists of multiple dynamic markers (tags
displayed on LCD screen). This paper describes a novel methodology, called
AprilTags3D, that improves pose estimation accuracy of AprilTags in field
robotics with only RGB sensor by adding a third dimension to the marker
detector. Also, presents experimental results from applying the proposed
methodology to swarm autonomous robotic boats for latching between them and for
creating robotic formations.

Title: Interpretable End-to-end Urban Autonomous Driving with Latent Deep
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jianyu Chen, Shengbo Eben Li, Masayoshi Tomizuka
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Unlike popular modularized framework, end-to-end autonomous driving seeks to
solve the perception, decision and control problems in an integrated way, which
can be more adapting to new scenarios and easier to generalize at scale.
However, existing end-to-end approaches are often lack of interpretability, and
can only deal with simple driving tasks like lane keeping. In this paper, we
propose an interpretable deep reinforcement learning method for end-to-end
autonomous driving, which is able to handle complex urban scenarios. A
sequential latent environment model is introduced and learned jointly with the
reinforcement learning process. With this latent model, a semantic birdeye mask
can be generated, which is enforced to connect with a certain intermediate
property in today's modularized framework for the purpose of explaining the
behaviors of learned policy. The latent space also significantly reduces the
sample complexity of reinforcement learning. Comparison tests with a simulated
autonomous car in CARLA show that the performance of our method in urban
scenarios with crowded surrounding vehicles dominates many baselines including
DQN, DDPG, TD3 and SAC. Moreover, through masked outputs, the learned policy is
able to provide a better explanation of how the car reasons about the driving
environment.

\\
  The INTERSPEECH 2020 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge is intended to promote
collaborative research in real-time single-channel Speech Enhancement aimed to
maximize the subjective (perceptual) quality of the enhanced speech. A typical
approach to evaluate the noise suppression methods is to use objective metrics
on the test set obtained by splitting the original dataset. Many publications
report reasonable performance on the synthetic test set drawn from the same
distribution as that of the training set. However, often the model performance
degrades significantly on real recordings. Also, most of the conventional
objective metrics do not correlate well with subjective tests and lab
subjective tests are not scalable for a large test set. In this challenge, we
open-source a large clean speech and noise corpus for training the noise
suppression models and a representative test set to real-world scenarios
consisting of both synthetic and real recordings. We also open source an online
subjective test framework based on ITU-T P.808 for researchers to quickly test
their developments. The winners of this challenge will be selected based on
subjective evaluation on a representative test set using P.808 framework.

Title: Search-Based Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems: One Survey,

Categories: cs.SE cs.AI
Comments: submitted; 21 pages, 6 tables and 17 figures
\\
  Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is a promising paradigm that
exploits computational search to optimize different processes when engineering
complex software systems. Self-adaptive system (SAS) is one category of such
complex systems that permits to optimize different functional and
non-functional objectives/criteria under changing environment (e.g.,
requirements and workload), which involves problems that are subject to search.
In this regard, over years, there have been a considerable amount of work that
investigates SBSE for SASs. In this paper, we provide the first systematic and
comprehensive survey exclusively on SBSE for SASs, covering 3,740 papers in 27
venues from 7 repositories, which eventually leads to several key statistics
from the most notable 73 primary studies in this particular field of research.
Our results, surprisingly, have revealed five disappointed issues that are of
utmost importance, but have been overwhelmingly ignored in existing studies. We
provide evidences to justify our arguments against the disappointments and
highlight six emergent, but currently under-explored opportunities for future
work on SBSE for SASs. By mitigating the disappointed issues revealed in this
work, together with the highlighted opportunities, we hope to be able to excite
a much more significant growth on this particular research direction.

Title: An Android Application Risk Evaluation Framework Based on Minimum
  Permission Set Identification
Authors: Jianmao Xiao, Shizhan Chen, Qiang He, Zhiyong Feng, Xiao Xue
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Android utilizes a security mechanism that requires apps to request
permission for accessing sensitive user data, e.g., contacts and SMSs, or
certain system features, e.g., camera and Internet access. However, Android
apps tend to be overprivileged, i.e., they often request more permissions than
necessary. This raises the security problem of overprivilege. To alleviate the
overprivilege problem, this paper proposes MPDroid, an approach that combines
static analysis and collaborative filtering to identify the minimum permissions
for an Android app based on its app description and API usage. Given an app,
MPDroid first employs collaborative filtering to identify the initial minimum
permissions for the app. Then, through static analysis, the final minimum
permissions that an app really needs are identified. Finally, it evaluates the
overprivilege risk by inspecting the apps extra privileges, i.e., the
unnecessary permissions requested by the app. Experiments are conducted on
16,343 popular apps collected from Google Play. The results show that MPDroid
outperforms the state-of-the-art approach significantly.

Title: Optimal by Design: Model-Driven Synthesis of Adaptation Strategies for
  Autonomous Systems
Authors: Yehia Elrakaiby and Paola Spoletini and Bashar Nuseibeh
Categories: cs.SE cs.AI cs.MA
\\
  Many software systems have become too large and complex to be managed
efficiently by human administrators, particularly when they operate in
uncertain and dynamic environments and require frequent changes.
Requirements-driven adaptation techniques have been proposed to endow systems
with the necessary means to autonomously decide ways to satisfy their
requirements. However, many current approaches rely on general-purpose
languages, models and/or frameworks to design, develop and analyze autonomous
systems. Unfortunately, these tools are not tailored towards the
characteristics of adaptation problems in autonomous systems. In this paper, we
present Optimal by Design (ObD ), a framework for model-based
requirements-driven synthesis of optimal adaptation strategies for autonomous
systems. ObD proposes a model (and a language) for the high-level description
of the basic elements of self-adaptive systems, namely the system,
capabilities, requirements and environment. Based on those elements, a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) is constructed to compute the optimal strategy or the
most rewarding system behaviour. Furthermore, this defines a reflex controller
that can ensure timely responses to changes. One novel feature of the framework
is that it benefits both from goal-oriented techniques, developed for
requirement elicitation, refinement and analysis, and synthesis capabilities
and extensive research around MDPs, their extensions and tools. Our preliminary
evaluation results demonstrate the practicality and advantages of the
framework.

Title: Relational Thematic Clustering with Mutually Preferred Neighbors
Authors: Tiantian He, Lu Bai, Yew-Soon Ong
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  Automatically learning thematic clusters in network data has long been a
challenging task in machine learning community. A number of approaches have
been proposed to accomplish it, utilizing edges, vertex features, or both
aforementioned. However, few of them consider how the quantification of
dichotomous inclination w.r.t. network topology and vertex features may
influence vertex-cluster preferences, which deters previous methods from
uncovering more interpretable latent groups in network data. To fill this void,
we propose a novel probabilistic model, dubbed Relational Thematic Clustering
with Mutually Preferred Neighbors (RTCMPN). Different from prevalent approaches
which predetermine the learning significance of edge structure and vertex
features, RTCMPN can further learn the latent preferences indicating which
neighboring vertices are more possible to be in the same cluster, and the
dichotomous inclinations describing how relative significance w.r.t. edge
structure and vertex features may impact the association between pairwise
vertices. Therefore, cluster structure implanted with edge structure, vertex
features, neighboring preferences, and vertex-vertex dichotomous inclinations
can be learned by RTCMPN. We additionally derive an effective
Expectation-Maximization algorithm for RTCMPN to infer the optimal model
parameters. RTCMPN has been compared with several strong baselines on various
network data. The remarkable results validate the effectiveness of RTCMPN.

Facebook and Twitter, the technical barriers to acquisition still remain. Thus,
Reddit's millions of subreddits, hundreds of millions of users, and hundreds of
billions of comments are at the same time relatively accessible, but time
consuming to collect and analyze systematically. In this paper, we present the
Pushshift Reddit dataset. Pushshift is a social media data collection,
analysis, and archiving platform that since 2015 has collected Reddit data and
made it available to researchers. Pushshift's Reddit dataset is updated in
real-time, and includes historical data back to Reddit's inception. In addition
to monthly dumps, Pushshift provides computational tools to aid in searching,
aggregating, and performing exploratory analysis on the entirety of the
dataset. The Pushshift Reddit dataset makes it possible for social media
researchers to reduce time spent in the data collection, cleaning, and storage
phases of their projects.

Title: The Pushshift Telegram Dataset
Authors: Jason Baumgartner, Savvas Zannettou, Megan Squire, Jeremy Blackburn
Categories: cs.SI cs.CY
\\
  Messaging platforms, especially those with a mobile focus, have become
increasingly ubiquitous in society. These mobile messaging platforms can have
deceivingly large user bases, and in addition to being a way for people to stay
in touch, are often used to organize social movements, as well as a place for
extremists and other ne'er-do-well to congregate. In this paper, we present a
dataset from one such mobile messaging platform: Telegram. Our dataset is made
up of over 27.8K channels and 317M messages from 2.2M unique users. To the best
of our knowledge, our dataset comprises the largest and most complete of its
kind. In addition to the raw data, we also provide the source code used to
collect it, allowing researchers to run their own data collection instance. We
believe the Pushshift Telegram dataset can help researchers from a variety of
disciplines interested in studying online social movements, protests, political
extremism, and disinformation.

Title: Joint Inference on Truth/Rumor and Their Sources in Social Networks
Authors: Shan Qu, Ziqi Zhao, Luoyi Fu, XInbing Wang, Jun Xu
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  In the contemporary era of information explosion, we are often faced with the
mixture of massive \emph{truth} (true information) and \emph{rumor} (false
information) flooded over social networks. Under such circumstances, it is very
essential to infer whether each claim (e.g., news, messages) is a truth or a
rumor, and identify their \emph{sources}, i.e., the users who initially spread
those claims. While most prior arts have been dedicated to the two tasks
respectively, this paper aims to offer the joint inference on truth/rumor and
their sources. Our insight is that a joint inference can enhance the mutual
performance on both sides.
  To this end, we propose a framework named SourceCR, which alternates between
two modules, i.e., \emph{credibility-reliability training} for truth/rumor
inference and \emph{division-querying} for source detection, in an iterative
manner. To elaborate, the former module performs a simultaneous estimation of
claim credibility and user reliability by virtue of an Expectation Maximization
algorithm, which takes the source reliability outputted from the latter module
as the initial input. Meanwhile, the latter module divides the network into two
different subnetworks labeled via the claim credibility, and in each subnetwork
launches source detection by applying querying of theoretical budget guarantee
to the users selected via the estimated reliability from the former module. The
proposed SourceCR is provably convergent, and algorithmic implementable with
reasonable computational complexity. We empirically validate the effectiveness
of the proposed framework in both synthetic and real datasets, where the joint
inference leads to an up to 35\% accuracy of credibility gain and 29\% source
detection rate gain compared with the separate counterparts.

Title: ExEm: Expert Embedding using dominating set theory with deep learning

\\
  A collaborative network is a social network that is comprised of experts who
cooperate with each other to fulfill a special goal. Analyzing the graph of
this network yields meaningful information about the expertise of these experts
and their subject areas. To perform the analysis, graph embedding techniques
have emerged as a promising tool. Graph embedding attempts to represent graph
nodes as low-dimensional vectors. In this paper, we propose a graph embedding
method, called ExEm, which using dominating-set theory and deep learning
approaches. In the proposed method, the dominating set theory is applied to the
collaborative network and dominating nodes of this network are found. After
that, a set of random walks is created which starts from dominating nodes
(experts). The main condition for constricting these random walks is the
existence of another dominating node. After making the walks that satisfy the
stated conditions, they are stored as a sequence in a corpus. In the next step,
the corpus is fed to the SKIP-GRAM neural network model. Word2vec, fastText and
their combination are employed to train the neural network of the SKIP-GRAM
model. Finally, the result is the low dimensional vectors of experts, called
expert embeddings. Expert embeddings can be used for various purposes including
accurately modeling experts' expertise or computing experts' scores in expert
recommendation systems. Hence, we also introduce a novel strategy to calculate
experts' scores by using the extracted expert embedding vectors. The
effectiveness of ExEm is validated through assessing its performance on
multi-label classification, link prediction, and recommendation tasks. We
conduct extensive experiments on common datasets. Moreover in this study, we
present data related to a co-author network formed by crawling the vast author
profiles from Scopus.

Title: Amidst data-driven model reduction and control
Authors: Nima Monshizadeh
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In this note, we explore a middle ground between data-driven model reduction
and data-driven control. In particular, we use snapshots collected from the
system to build reduced models that can be expressed in terms of data. We
illustrate how the derived family of reduced models can be used for data-driven
control of the original system under suitable conditions. Finding a control law
that stabilizes certain solutions of the original system as well as the one
that reaches any desired state in final time are studied in detail.

Title: Classically Simulating Quantum Circuits with Local Depolarizing Noise
Authors: Yasuhiro Takahashi, Yuki Takeuchi, Seiichiro Tani
Categories: quant-ph cs.CC
Comments: 19 pages, 2 figures
\\
  We study the effect of noise on the classical simulatability of quantum
circuits defined by computationally tractable (CT) states and efficiently
computable sparse (ECS) operations. Examples of such circuits, which we call
CT-ECS circuits, are IQP, Clifford Magic, and conjugated Clifford circuits.
This means that there exist various CT-ECS circuits such that their output
probability distributions are anti-concentrated and not classically simulatable
in the noise-free setting (under plausible assumptions). First, we consider a
noise model where a depolarizing channel with an arbitrarily small constant
rate is applied to each qubit at the end of computation. We show that, under
this noise model, if an approximate value of the noise rate is known, any
CT-ECS circuit with an anti-concentrated output probability distribution is
classically simulatable. This indicates that the presence of small noise
drastically affects the classical simulatability of CT-ECS circuits. Then, we
consider an extension of the noise model where the noise rate can vary with
each qubit, and provide a similar sufficient condition for classically
simulating CT-ECS circuits with anti-concentrated output probability
distributions.

  We extend the recently introduced divergence-conforming immersed boundary
(DCIB) method [1] to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems involving
closed co-dimension one solids. We focus on capsules and vesicles, whose
discretization is particularly challenging due to the higher-order derivatives
that appear in their formulations. In two-dimensional settings, we employ cubic
B-splines with periodic knot vectors to obtain discretizations of closed curves
with C^2 inter-element continuity. In three-dimensional settings, we use
analysis-suitable bi-cubic T-splines to obtain discretizations of closed
surfaces with at least C^1 inter-element continuity. Large spurious changes of
the fluid volume inside closed co-dimension one solids is a well-known issue
for IB methods. The DCIB method results in volume changes orders of magnitude
lower than conventional IB methods. This is a byproduct of discretizing the
velocity-pressure pair with divergence-conforming B-splines, which lead to
negligible incompressibility errors at the Eulerian level. The higher
inter-element continuity of divergence-conforming B-splines is also crucial to
avoid the quadrature/interpolation errors of IB methods becoming the dominant
discretization error. Benchmark and application problems of vesicle and capsule
dynamics are solved, including mesh-independence studies and comparisons with
other numerical methods.

Title: Stochastic Item Descent Method for Large Scale Equal Circle Packing
  Problem

\\
  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a powerful method for large-scale
optimization problems in the area of machine learning, especially for a
finite-sum formulation with numerous variables. In recent years, mini-batch SGD
gains great success and has become a standard technique for training deep
neural networks fed with big amount of data. Inspired by its success in deep
learning, we apply the idea of SGD with batch selection of samples to a classic
optimization problem in decision version. Given $n$ unit circles, the equal
circle packing problem (ECPP) asks whether there exist a feasible packing that
could put all the circles inside a circular container without overlapping.
Specifically, we propose a stochastic item descent method (SIDM) for ECPP in
large scale, which randomly divides the unit circles into batches and runs
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm on the corresponding batch
function iteratively to speedup the calculation. We also increase the batch
size during the batch iterations to gain higher quality solution. Comparing to
the current best packing algorithms, SIDM greatly speeds up the calculation of
optimization process and guarantees the solution quality for large scale
instances with up to 1500 circle items, while the baseline algorithms usually
handle about 300 circle items. The results indicate the highly efficiency of
SIDM for this classic optimization problem in large scale, and show potential
for other large scale classic optimization problems in which gradient descent
is used for optimization.

Title: Improving speaker discrimination of target speech extraction with

\\
  Target speech extraction, which extracts a single target source in a mixture
given clues about the target speaker, has attracted increasing attention. We
have recently proposed SpeakerBeam, which exploits an adaptation utterance of
the target speaker to extract his/her voice characteristics that are then used
to guide a neural network towards extracting speech of that speaker.
SpeakerBeam presents a practical alternative to speech separation as it enables
tracking speech of a target speaker across utterances, and achieves promising
speech extraction performance. However, it sometimes fails when speakers have
similar voice characteristics, such as in same-gender mixtures, because it is
difficult to discriminate the target speaker from the interfering speakers. In
this paper, we investigate strategies for improving the speaker discrimination
capability of SpeakerBeam. First, we propose a time-domain implementation of
SpeakerBeam similar to that proposed for a time-domain audio separation network
(TasNet), which has achieved state-of-the-art performance for speech
separation. Besides, we investigate (1) the use of spatial features to better
discriminate speakers when microphone array recordings are available, (2)
adding an auxiliary speaker identification loss for helping to learn more
discriminative voice characteristics. We show experimentally that these
strategies greatly improve speech extraction performance, especially for
same-gender mixtures, and outperform TasNet in terms of target speech
extraction.

\\
  Recent advances in brain recording technology and artificial intelligence are
propelling a new paradigm in neuroscience beyond the traditional controlled
experiment. Naturalistic neuroscience studies neural computations associated
with spontaneous behaviors performed in unconstrained settings. Analyzing such
unstructured data lacking a priori experimental design remains a significant
challenge, especially when the data is multi-modal and long-term. Here we
describe an automated approach for analyzing large ($\approx$250 GB/subject)
datasets of simultaneously recorded human electrocorticography (ECoG) and
naturalistic behavior video data for 12 subjects. Our pipeline discovers and
annotates thousands of instances of human upper-limb movement events in
long-term (7--9 day) naturalistic behavior data using a combination of computer
vision, discrete latent-variable modeling, and string pattern-matching.
Analysis of the simultaneously recorded brain data uncovers neural signatures
of movement that corroborate prior findings from traditional controlled
experiments. We also prototype a decoder for a movement initiation detection
task to demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline as a source of training data
for brain-computer interfacing applications. We plan to publish our curated
dataset, which captures naturalistic neural and behavioral variability at a
scale not previously available. We believe this data will enable further
research on models of neural function and decoding that incorporate such
naturalistic variability and perform more robustly in real-world settings.

  $\textbf{Purpose:}$ To develop a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System
(BI-RADS) breast density DL model in a multi-site setting for synthetic 2D
mammography (SM) images derived from 3D DBT exams using FFDM images and limited
SM data.
  $\textbf{Materials and Methods:}$ A DL model was trained to predict BI-RADS
breast density using FFDM images acquired from 2008 to 2017 (Site 1: 57492
patients, 187627 exams, 750752 images) for this retrospective study. The FFDM
model was evaluated using SM datasets from two institutions (Site 1: 3842
patients, 3866 exams, 14472 images, acquired from 2016 to 2017; Site 2: 7557
patients, 16283 exams, 63973 images, 2015 to 2019). Adaptation methods were
investigated to improve performance on the SM datasets and the effect of
dataset size on each adaptation method is considered. Statistical significance
was assessed using confidence intervals (CI), estimated by bootstrapping.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ Without adaptation, the model demonstrated close
agreement with the original reporting radiologists for all three datasets (Site
1 FFDM: linearly-weighted $\kappa_w$ = 0.75, 95\% CI: [0.74, 0.76]; Site 1 SM:
$\kappa_w$ = 0.71, CI: [0.64, 0.78]; Site 2 SM: $\kappa_w$ = 0.72, CI: [0.70,
0.75]). With adaptation, performance improved for Site 2 (Site 1: $\kappa_w$ =
0.72, CI: [0.66, 0.79], Site 2: $\kappa_w$ = 0.79, CI: [0.76, 0.81]) using only
500 SM images from each site.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ A BI-RADS breast density DL model demonstrated strong
performance on FFDM and SM images from two institutions without training on SM
images and improved using few SM images.

  Myocardial infarction (MI) is a scientific term that refers to heart attack.
In this study, we infer highly relevant second harmonic generation (SHG) cues
from collagen fibers exhibiting highly non-centrosymmetric assembly together
with two-photon excited cellular autofluorescence in infarcted mouse heart to
quantitatively probe fibrosis, especially targeted at an early stage after MI.
We present a robust one-shot machine learning algorithm that enables
determination of 2D assembly of collagen with high spatial resolution along
with its structural arrangement in heart tissues post-MI with spectral
specificity and sensitivity. Detection, evaluation, and precise quantification
of fibrosis extent at early stage would guide one to develop treatment
therapies that may prevent further progression and determine heart transplant
needs for patient survival.

\\
  The treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) requires continuous
eye exams using optical coherence tomography (OCT). The need for treatment is
determined by the presence or change of disease-specific OCT-based biomarkers.
Therefore, the monitoring frequency has a significant influence on the success
of AMD therapy. However, the monitoring frequency of current treatment schemes
is not individually adapted to the patient and therefore often insufficient.
While a higher monitoring frequency would have a positive effect on the success
of treatment, in practice it can only be achieved with a home monitoring
solution. One of the key requirements of a home monitoring OCT system is a
computer-aided diagnosis to automatically detect and quantify pathological
changes using specific OCT-based biomarkers. In this paper, for the first time,
retinal scans of a novel self-examination low-cost full-field OCT (SELF-OCT)
are segmented using a deep learning-based approach. A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is utilized to segment the total retina as well as pigment
epithelial detachments (PED). It is shown that the CNN-based approach can
segment the retina with high accuracy, whereas the segmentation of the PED
proves to be challenging. In addition, a convolutional denoising autoencoder
(CDAE) refines the CNN prediction, which has previously learned retinal shape
information. It is shown that the CDAE refinement can correct segmentation
errors caused by artifacts in the OCT image.

  Predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy is a vexing challenge in breast
cancer. In this study, we evaluate the ability of deep learning to predict
response to HER2-targeted neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) from pre-treatment
dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI acquired prior to treatment. In a
retrospective study encompassing DCE-MRI data from a total of 157 HER2+ breast
cancer patients from 5 institutions, we developed and validated a deep learning
approach for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to HER2-targeted
NAC prior to treatment. 100 patients who received HER2-targeted neoadjuvant
chemotherapy at a single institution were used to train (n=85) and tune (n=15)
a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict pCR. A multi-input CNN
leveraging both pre-contrast and late post-contrast DCE-MRI acquisitions was
identified to achieve optimal response prediction within the validation set
(AUC=0.93). This model was then tested on two independent testing cohorts with
pre-treatment DCE-MRI data. It achieved strong performance in a 28 patient
testing set from a second institution (AUC=0.85, 95% CI 0.67-1.0, p=.0008) and
a 29 patient multicenter trial including data from 3 additional institutions
(AUC=0.77, 95% CI 0.58-0.97, p=0.006). Deep learning-based response prediction
model was found to exceed a multivariable model incorporating predictive
clinical variables (AUC < .65 in testing cohorts) and a model of
semi-quantitative DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic measurements (AUC < .60 in testing
cohorts). The results presented in this work across multiple sites suggest that
with further validation deep learning could provide an effective and reliable
tool to guide targeted therapy in breast cancer, thus reducing overtreatment
among HER2+ patients.

Title: CNN-CASS: CNN for Classification of Coronary Artery Stenosis Score in

\\
  To decrease patient waiting time for diagnosis of the Coronary Artery
Disease, automatic methods are applied to identify its severity using Coronary
Computed Tomography Angiography scans or extracted Multiplanar Reconstruction
(MPR) images, giving doctors a second-opinion on the priority of each case. The
main disadvantage of previous studies is the lack of large set of data that
could guarantee their reliability. Another limitation is the usage of
handcrafted features requiring manual preprocessing, such as centerline
extraction. We overcome both limitations by applying a different automated
approach based on ShuffleNet V2 network architecture and testing it on the
proposed collected dataset of MPR images, which is bigger than any other used
in this field before. We also omit centerline extraction step and train and
test our model using whole curved MPR images of 708 and 105 patients,
respectively. The model predicts one of three classes: 'no stenosis' for
normal, 'non-significant' - 1-50% of stenosis detected, 'significant' - more
than 50% of stenosis. We demonstrate model's interpretability through
visualization of the most important features selected by the network. For
stenosis score classification, the method shows improved performance comparing
to previous works, achieving 80% accuracy on the patient level. Our code is
publicly available.

\\
  The improvements in magnetic resonance imaging have led to the development of
numerous techniques to better detect structural alterations caused by
neurodegenerative diseases. Among these, the patch-based grading framework has
been proposed to model local patterns of anatomical changes. This approach is
attractive because of its low computational cost and its competitive
performance. Other studies have proposed to analyze the deformations of brain
structures using tensor-based morphometry, which is a highly interpretable
approach. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages of these two
approaches by extending the patch-based grading framework with a new
tensor-based grading method that enables us to model patterns of local
deformation using a log-Euclidean metric. We evaluate our new method in a study
of the putamen for the classification of patients with pre-manifest
Huntington's disease and healthy controls. Our experiments show a substantial
increase in classification accuracy (87.5 $\pm$ 0.5 vs. 81.3 $\pm$ 0.6)
compared to the existing patch-based grading methods, and a good complement to
putamen volume, which is a primary imaging-based marker for the study of
Huntington's disease.

Title: MRI Banding Removal via Adversarial Training
Authors: Aaron Defazio and Tullie Murrell and Michael P. Recht
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  MRI images reconstructed from sub-sampled data using deep learning techniques
often show a characteristic banding, which is particularly strong in low
signal-to-noise regions of the reconstructed image. In this work, we propose
the use of an adversarial loss that penalizes banding structures without
requiring any human annotation. Our technique greatly reduces the appearance of
banding, without requiring any additional computation or post-processing at
reconstruction time. We report the results of a blind comparison against a
strong baseline by a group of expert evaluators (board-certified radiologists),
where our approach is ranked superior at banding removal with no statistically
significant loss of detail.

Title: Counting directed acyclic and elementary digraphs
Authors: \'Elie de Panafieu and Sergey Dovgal
Categories: math.CO cs.DS math.PR
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be characterised as directed graphs whose
strongly connected components are isolated vertices. Using this restriction on
the strong components, we discover that when $m = cn$, where $m$ is the number
of directed edges, $n$ is the number of vertices, and $c < 1$, the asymptotic
probability that a random digraph is acyclic is an explicit function $p(c)$,
such that $p(0) = 1$ and $p(1) = 0$. When $m = n(1 + \mu n^{-1/3})$, the
asymptotic behaviour changes, and the probability that a digraph is acyclic
becomes $n^{-1/3} C(\mu)$, where $C(\mu)$ is an explicit function of $\mu$.
{\L}uczak and Seierstad (2009, Random Structures & Algorithms, 35(3), 271--293)
showed that, as $\mu \to -\infty$, the strongly connected components of a
random digraph with $n$ vertices and $m = n(1 + \mu n^{-1/3})$ directed edges
are, with high probability, only isolated vertices and cycles. We call such
digraphs elementary digraphs. We express the probability that a random digraph
is elementary as a function of $\mu$. Those results are obtained using
techniques from analytic combinatorics, developed in particular to study random
graphs.

  This paper studies social cooperation backed peer-to-peer energy trading
technique by which prosumers can decide how they can use their batteries
opportunistically for participating in the peer-to-peer trading. The objective
is to achieve a solution in which the ultimate beneficiaries are the prosumers,
i.e., a prosumer-centric solution. To do so, a coalition formation game is
designed, which enables a prosumer to compare its benefit of participating in
the peer-to-peer trading with and without using its battery and thus, allows
the prosumer to form suitable social coalition groups with other similar
prosumers in the network for conducting peer-to-peer trading. The properties of
the formed coalitions are studied, and it is shown that 1) the coalition
structure that stems from the social cooperation between participating
prosumers at each time slot is both stable and optimal, and 2) the outcomes of
the proposed peer- to-peer trading scheme is prosumer-centric. Case studies are
conducted based on real household energy usage and solar generation data to
highlight how the proposed scheme can benefit prosumers through exhibiting
prosumer-centric properties.

Title: On the human evaluation of audio adversarial examples
Authors: Jon Vadillo and Roberto Santana
Categories: eess.AS cs.HC cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML
Comments: Preprint. 17 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables
\\
  Human-machine interaction is increasingly dependent on speech communication.
Machine Learning models are usually applied to interpret human speech commands.
However, these models can be fooled by adversarial examples, which are inputs
intentionally perturbed to produce a wrong prediction without being noticed.
While much research has been focused on developing new techniques to generate
adversarial perturbations, less attention has been given to aspects that
determine whether and how the perturbations are noticed by humans. This
question is relevant since high fooling rates of proposed adversarial
perturbation strategies are only valuable if the perturbations are not
detectable. In this paper we investigate to which extent the distortion metrics
proposed in the literature for audio adversarial examples, and which are
commonly applied to evaluate the effectiveness of methods for generating these
attacks, are a reliable measure of the human perception of the perturbations.
Using an analytical framework, and an experiment in which 18 subjects evaluate
audio adversarial examples, we demonstrate that the metrics employed by
convention are not a reliable measure of the perceptual similarity of
adversarial examples in the audio domain.

Title: Inference over Wireless IoT Links with Importance-Filtered Updates
Authors: Ivana Nikoloska, Josefine Holm, Anders Kal{\o}r, Petar Popovski, and
  Nikola Zlatanov
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  We consider a communication cell comprised of Internet-of-Things (IoT) nodes
transmitting to a common Access Point (AP). The nodes in the cell are assumed
to generate data samples periodically, which are to be transmitted to the AP.
The AP hosts artificial deep neural networks and it is able to make inferences
based on the received data samples. We address the following tradeoff: The more
often the IoT nodes transmit, the higher the accuracy of the inference made by
the AP, but also the higher the energy expenditure at the IoT nodes. We propose
a data filtering scheme employed by the IoT nodes, which we refer to as
distributed importance filtering. The IoT nodes do not have an inherent
learning capability and the data filtering scheme operates under periodic
instructions from the neural network placed at the AP. The proposed scheme is
tested in two practical scenarios: leakage detection in water distribution
networks and air-pollution detection in urban areas. The results show that the
proposed scheme offers significant benefits in terms of network longevity,
whilst maintaining high inference accuracy. Our approach reduces the the
computational complexity for training the model and obviates the need for data
pre-processing, which makes it highly applicable in practical IoT scenarios.

  $L^{p,q}(\mathbf{R}\times \mathbf{R}^{d})$

  In this paper, we mainly discuss the $(p,q)$-frame in shift-invariant
subspace \begin{equation*}
V_{p,q}(\Phi)=\left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{r}\sum\limits_{j_{1}\in
\mathbf{Z}}\sum\limits_{j_{2}\in

\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}^{d}}\in
\ell^{p,q}(\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}^d)\right\} \end{equation*} of mixed
Lebesgue space $L^{p,q}(\mathbf{R}\times \mathbf{R}^{d})$. Some equivalent
conditions for
$\{\phi_{i}(\cdot-j_{1},\cdot-j_{2}):(j_{1},j_{2})\in\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}^d,1\leq
i\leq r\}$ to constitute a $(p,q)$-frame of $V_{p,q}(\Phi)$ are given.
Moreover, the result shows that $V_{p,q}(\Phi)$ is closed under these

$\{\phi_{i}(\cdot-j_{1},\cdot-j_{2}):(j_{1},j_{2})\in\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}^d,1\leq

Title: On lower semicontinuity of the quantum conditional mutual information
  and its corollaries
Authors: M.E. Shirokov
Categories: quant-ph cs.IT math-ph math.IT math.MP
Comments: 32 pages, preliminary version, any comments and references are
  welcome
\\
  It is well known that the quantum mutual information and its conditional
version do not increase under local channels. I this paper we show that the
recently established lower semicontinuity of the quantum conditional mutual
information implies (in fact, is equivalent to) the lower semicontinuity of the
loss of the quantum (conditional) mutual information under local channels
considered as a function on the Cartesian product of the set of all states of a
composite system and the sets of all local channels (equipped with the strong
convergence).
  Some applications of this property are considered. New continuity conditions
for the quantum mutual information and for the squashed entanglement in both
bipartite and multipartite infinite-dimensional systems are obtained. It is
proved, in particular, that the multipartite squashed entanglement of any
countably-non-decomposable separable state with finite marginal entropies is
equal to zero.
  Special continuity properties of the information gain of a quantum
measurement with and without quantum side information are established that can
be treated as robustness (stability) of these quantities w.r.t. perturbation of
the measurement and the measured state.

Title: A Multi-Scale Tensor Network Architecture for Classification and
  Regression
Authors: Justin Reyes, Miles Stoudenmire
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG quant-ph
\\
  We present an algorithm for supervised learning using tensor networks,
employing a step of preprocessing the data by coarse-graining through a
sequence of wavelet transformations. We represent these transformations as a
set of tensor network layers identical to those in a multi-scale entanglement
renormalization ansatz (MERA) tensor network, and perform supervised learning
and regression tasks through a model based on a matrix product state (MPS)
tensor network acting on the coarse-grained data. Because the entire model
consists of tensor contractions (apart from the initial non-linear feature
map), we can adaptively fine-grain the optimized MPS model backwards through
the layers with essentially no loss in performance. The MPS itself is trained
using an adaptive algorithm based on the density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) algorithm. We test our methods by performing a classification task on
audio data and a regression task on temperature time-series data, studying the
dependence of training accuracy on the number of coarse-graining layers and
showing how fine-graining through the network may be used to initialize models
with access to finer-scale features.

Title: Transformer-based Online CTC/attention End-to-End Speech Recognition
  Architecture
Authors: Haoran Miao, Gaofeng Cheng, Changfeng Gao, Pengyuan Zhang and Yonghong
  Yan
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.NE cs.SD stat.ML
\\
  Recently, Transformer has gained success in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) field. However, it is challenging to deploy a Transformer-based
end-to-end (E2E) model for online speech recognition. In this paper, we propose
the Transformer-based online CTC/attention E2E ASR architecture, which contains
the chunk self-attention encoder (chunk-SAE) and the monotonic truncated
attention (MTA) based self-attention decoder (SAD). Firstly, the chunk-SAE
splits the speech into isolated chunks. To reduce the computational cost and
improve the performance, we propose the state reuse chunk-SAE. Sencondly, the
MTA based SAD truncates the speech features monotonically and performs
attention on the truncated features. To support the online recognition, we
integrate the state reuse chunk-SAE and the MTA based SAD into online
CTC/attention architecture. We evaluate the proposed online models on the HKUST
Mandarin ASR benchmark and achieve a 23.66% character error rate (CER) with a
320 ms latency. Our online model yields as little as $0.19\%$ absolute CER
degradation compared with the offline baseline, and achieves significant
improvement over our prior work on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based online
E2E models.

Title: Target-Embedding Autoencoders for Supervised Representation Learning
Authors: Daniel Jarrett, Mihaela van der Schaar
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Journal-ref: In Proc. 8th International Conference on Learning Representations
  (ICLR 2020)
\\
  Autoencoder-based learning has emerged as a staple for disciplining
representations in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. This paper
analyzes a framework for improving generalization in a purely supervised
setting, where the target space is high-dimensional. We motivate and formalize
the general framework of target-embedding autoencoders (TEA) for supervised
prediction, learning intermediate latent representations jointly optimized to
be both predictable from features as well as predictive of targets---encoding
the prior that variations in targets are driven by a compact set of underlying
factors. As our theoretical contribution, we provide a guarantee of
generalization for linear TEAs by demonstrating uniform stability, interpreting
the benefit of the auxiliary reconstruction task as a form of regularization.
As our empirical contribution, we extend validation of this approach beyond
existing static classification applications to multivariate sequence
forecasting, verifying their advantage on both linear and nonlinear recurrent
architectures---thereby underscoring the further generality of this framework
beyond feedforward instantiations.

Title: A Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory Model for Value at Risk and Expected
  Shortfall Joint Forecasting
Authors: Zhengkun Li, Minh-Ngoc Tran, Chao Wang, Richard Gerlach and Junbin Gao
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG q-fin.RM
\\
  Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) are widely used in the
financial sector to measure the market risk and manage the extreme market
movement. The recent link between the quantile score function and the
Asymmetric Laplace density has led to a flexible likelihood-based framework for
joint modelling of VaR and ES. It is of high interest in financial applications
to be able to capture the underlying joint dynamics of these two quantities. We
address this problem by developing a hybrid model that is based on the
Asymmetric Laplace quasi-likelihood and employs the Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) time series modelling technique from Machine Learning to capture
efficiently the underlying dynamics of VaR and ES. We refer to this model as
LSTM-AL. We adopt the adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for
Bayesian inference in the LSTM-AL model. Empirical results show that the
proposed LSTM-AL model can improve the VaR and ES forecasting accuracy over a
range of well-established competing models.

only the topological structure of the network but rich time-series data
available for the graph nodes and edges. We evaluate the developed method using
the data provided by a large European bank for several years. The proposed
model outperforms the existing approaches, including other neural network
models, with a significant gap in ROC AUC score on link prediction problem and
also allows to improve the quality of credit scoring.

Title: Best Principal Submatrix Selection for the Maximum Entropy Sampling
  Problem: Scalable Algorithms and Performance Guarantees
Authors: Yongchun Li, Weijun Xie
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.OC
Comments: 62 pages
\\
  This paper studies a classic maximum entropy sampling problem (MESP), which
aims to select the most informative principal submatrix of a prespecified size
from a covariance matrix. MESP has been widely applied to many areas, including
healthcare, power system, manufacturing and data science. By investigating its
Lagrangian dual and primal characterization, we derive a novel convex integer
program for MESP and show that its continuous relaxation yields a near-optimal
solution. The results motivate us to study an efficient sampling algorithm and
develop its approximation bound for MESP, which improves the best-known bound
in literature. We then provide an efficient deterministic implementation of the
sampling algorithm with the same approximation bound. By developing new
mathematical tools for the singular matrices and analyzing the Lagrangian dual
of the proposed convex integer program, we investigate the widely-used local
search algorithm and prove its first-known approximation bound for MESP. The
proof techniques further inspire us with an efficient implementation of the
local search algorithm. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that these
approximation algorithms can efficiently solve medium-sized and large-scale
instances to near-optimality. Our proposed algorithms are coded and released as
open-source software. Finally, we extend the analyses to the A-Optimal MESP
(A-MESP), where the objective is to minimize the trace of the inverse of the
selected principal submatrix.

Title: A hemodynamic decomposition model for detecting cognitive load using
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy
Authors: Marco A. Pinto-Orellana, Diego C. Nascimento, Peyman Mirtaheri, Rune
  Jonassen, Anis Yazidi and Hugo L. Hammer
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
\\
  In the current paper, we introduce a parametric data-driven model for
functional near-infrared spectroscopy that decomposes a signal into a series of
independent, rescaled, time-shifted, hemodynamic basis functions. Each
decomposed waveform retains relevant biological information about the expected
hemodynamic behavior. The model is also presented along with an efficient
iterative estimation method to improve the computational speed. Our hemodynamic
decomposition model (HDM) extends the canonical model for instances when a) the
external stimuli are unknown, or b) when the assumption of a direct
relationship between the experimental stimuli and the hemodynamic responses
cannot hold. We also argue that the proposed approach can be potentially
adopted as a feature transformation method for machine learning purposes. By
virtue of applying our devised HDM to a cognitive load classification task on
fNIRS signals, we have achieved an accuracy of 86.20%+-2.56% using six channels
in the frontal cortex, and 86.34%+-2.81% utilizing only the AFpz channel also
located in the frontal area. In comparison, state-of-the-art time-spectral
transformations only yield 64.61%+-3.03% and 37.8%+-2.96% under identical
experimental settings.

Title: Cooperative Highway Work Zone Merge Control based on Reinforcement
  Learning in A Connected and Automated Environment
Authors: Tianzhu Ren, Yuanchang Xie, Liming Jiang
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
Comments: 17pages, 6 figures, TRB 2020
\\
  Given the aging infrastructure and the anticipated growing number of highway
work zones in the United States, it is important to investigate work zone merge
control, which is critical for improving work zone safety and capacity. This
paper proposes and evaluates a novel highway work zone merge control strategy
based on cooperative driving behavior enabled by artificial intelligence. The
proposed method assumes that all vehicles are fully automated, connected and
cooperative. It inserts two metering zones in the open lane to make space for
merging vehicles in the closed lane. In addition, each vehicle in the closed
lane learns how to optimally adjust its longitudinal position to find a safe
gap in the open lane using an off-policy soft actor critic (SAC) reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm, considering the traffic conditions in its surrounding.
The learning results are captured in convolutional neural networks and used to
control individual vehicles in the testing phase. By adding the metering zones
and taking the locations, speeds, and accelerations of surrounding vehicles
into account, cooperation among vehicles is implicitly considered. This
RL-based model is trained and evaluated using a microscopic traffic simulator.
The results show that this cooperative RL-based merge control significantly
outperforms popular strategies such as late merge and early merge in terms of
both mobility and safety measures.

Title: Motion Classification using Kinematically Sifted ACGAN-Synthesized Radar
  Micro-Doppler Signatures
Authors: Baris Erol, Sevgi Zubeyde Gurbuz, Moeness G. Amin
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently received vast attention in
applications requiring classification of radar returns, including radar-based
human activity recognition for security, smart homes, assisted living, and
biomedicine. However,acquiring a sufficiently large training dataset remains a
daunting task due to the high human costs and resources required for radar data
collection. In this paper, an extended approach to adversarial learning is
proposed for generation of synthetic radar micro-Doppler signatures that are
well-adapted to different environments. The synthetic data is evaluated using
visual interpretation, analysis of kinematic consistency, data diversity,
dimensions of the latent space, and saliency maps. A principle-component
analysis (PCA) based kinematic-sifting algorithm is introduced to ensure that
synthetic signatures are consistent with physically possible human motions. The
synthetic dataset is used to train a 19-layer deep convolutional neural network
(DCNN) to classify micro-Doppler signatures acquired from an environment
different from that of the dataset supplied to the adversarial network. An
overall accuracy 93% is achieved on a dataset that contains multiple aspect
angles (0 deg., 30 deg., and 45 deg. as well as 60 deg.), with 9% improvement
as a result of kinematic sifting.

\\
  Prediction models in mobility and transportation maintenance systems have
been dramatically improved through using machine learning methods. This paper
proposes novel machine learning models for intelligent road inspection. The
traditional road inspection systems based on the pavement condition index (PCI)
are often associated with the critical safety, energy and cost issues.
Alternatively, the proposed models utilize surface deflection data from falling
weight deflectometer (FWD) tests to predict the PCI. Machine learning methods
are the single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF)
neural networks as well as their hybrids, i.e., Levenberg-Marquardt (MLP-LM),
scaled conjugate gradient (MLP-SCG), imperialist competitive (RBF-ICA), and
genetic algorithms (RBF-GA). Furthermore, the committee machine intelligent
systems (CMIS) method was adopted to combine the results and improve the
accuracy of the modeling. The results of the analysis have been verified
through using four criteria of average percent relative error (APRE), average
absolute percent relative error (AAPRE), root mean square error (RMSE), and
standard error (SD). The CMIS model outperforms other models with the promising
results of APRE=2.3303, AAPRE=11.6768, RMSE=12.0056, and SD=0.0210.

independently assign a binary satisfaction variable $s_{k}$ which is equal to
one only if the agent is satisfied with that condition, and is equal to zero
otherwise. This defines 32 different satisfaction rules, which we investigate
in detail, focusing on pattern formation and measuring segregation with the
help of an "energy" function which is related to the number of neighboring
agents of different types and plays no role in the dynamics. We consider the
checkerboard lattice to be fully occupied and the dynamics consists of
switching the locations of randomly selected unsatisfied agents of opposite
types. We show that, starting from a random distribution of agents, only a
small number of rules lead to (nearly) fully segregated patterns in the long
run, with many rules leading to chaotic steady-state behavior. Nevertheless,
other interesting patterns may also be dynamically generated, such as
"anti-segregate d" patterns as well as patterns resembling sponges.

Title: Overcoming the curse of dimensionality for approximating Lyapunov
  functions with deep neural networks under a small-gain condition
Authors: Lars Gr\"une
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.DS math.NA
\\
  We propose a deep neural network architecture for storing approximate
Lyapunov functions of systems of ordinary differential equations. Under a
small-gain condition on the system, the number of neurons needed for an
approximation of a Lyapunov function with fixed accuracy grows only
polynomially in the state dimension, i.e., the proposed approach is able to
overcome the curse of dimensionality.

\\
  We develop K$\omega$, an open-source linear algebra library for the shifted
Krylov subspace methods. The methods solve a set of shifted linear equations
for a given matrix and a vector, simultaneously. The leading order of the
operational cost is the same as that for a single equation. The shift
invariance of the Krylov subspace is the mathematical foundation of the shifted
Krylov subspace methods. Applications in materials science are presented to
demonstrate the advantages of the algorithm over the standard Krylov subspace
methods such as the Lanczos method. We introduce benchmark calculations of (i)
an excited (optical) spectrum and (ii) intermediate eigenvalues by the contour
integral on the complex plane. In combination with the quantum lattice solver
H$\Phi$, K$\omega$ can realize parallel computation of excitation spectra and
intermediate eigenvalues for various quantum lattice models.

Title: Energy-Efficient Offloading in Delay-Constrained Massive MIMO Enabled
  Edge Network Using Data Partitioning
Authors: Rafia Malik and Mai Vu
Categories: eess.SP cs.NI math.OC
\\
  We study a wireless edge-computing system which allows multiple users to
simultaneously offload computation-intensive tasks to multiple massive-MIMO
access points, each with a collocated multi-access edge computing (MEC) server.
Massive-MIMO enables simultaneous uplink transmissions from all users,
significantly shortening the data offloading time compared to sequential
protocols, and makes the three phases of data offloading, computing, and
downloading have comparable durations. Based on this three-phase structure, we
formulate a novel problem to minimize a weighted sum of the energy consumption
at both the users and the MEC server under a round-trip latency constraint,
using a combination of data partitioning, transmit power control and CPU
frequency scaling at both the user and server ends. We design a novel nested
primal-dual algorithm using two different methods to solve this problem
efficiently. Optimized solutions show that for larger requests, more data is
offloaded to the MECs to reduce local computation time in order to meet the
latency constraint, despite higher energy cost of wireless transmissions.
Massive-MIMO channel estimation errors under pilot contamination also causes
more data to be offloaded to the MECs. Compared to binary offloading, partial
offloading with data partitioning is superior and leads to significant
reduction in the overall energy consumption.

Title: Characterizing cycle structure in complex networks
Authors: Tianlong Fan, Linyuan L\"u, Dinghua Shi, Tao Zhou

Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures and 3 tables
\\
  The ubiquitous existence of cycles is one of important originations of
network complexity, as cycle is the simplest structure that brings redundant
paths in connectivity and feedback effects in dynamics. Hence the in-depth
analyses on cycle structure may yield novel insights, metrics, models and
algorithms for network science. By measuring the extent to which a node is
involved in other nodes' smallest cycles, this paper proposes an index, named
cycle ratio, to quantify the importance of individual nodes. Experimental tests
on real networks suggest that cycle ratio contains rich information in addition
to well-known benchmark indices, that is, the node rankings by cycle ratio are
largely different from rankings by degree, H-index and coreness, while the
rankings by the three benchmarks are very similar to each other. Further
experiments show that cycle ratio performs overall better than the three
benchmarks in identifying critical nodes that maintain network connectivity and
facilitate network synchronization.

Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures
\\
  The terrorism rate in Pakistan becomes higher even after the advancement of
information technology. Especially APS Attack and numerous other in different
part of country. The root cause of such attacks as according to our research is
as: terrorists utilizing the benefit of lack of a full proof security check
system. Traditional explosive detection systems are large in size, expensive
and require manual attention. These systems are not much useful due to its
public visibility intruder or terrorists can easily bypass the system using
another route. This term paper is mainly focusing on explosive material
detection using IoT with WSN. Explosive Material Detection and security alert
system (e-DASS) consists of several hundreds of nodes depending upon the
geographical area we are going to cover. Each node should be able to
communicate with the other node and update the information if necessary.
Tracking of the target can be done in an easier and faster way because all the
nodes are synchronized. (e-DASS) is a power efficient explosive detection
system. Most of the times nodes will be in the idle state, unless and until
positive presence of an explosive is found.

\\
  The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a revolutionary technology that is rapidly
changing the world. IoT systems strive to provide automated solutions for
almost every life aspect; traditional devices are becoming connected,
ubiquitous, pervasive, wireless, context-aware, smart, controlled through
mobile solutions, to name but a few. IoT devices can now be found in our
apartments, places of work, cars, buildings, and in almost every aspect of
life. In this investigation, we propose an IoT system Development Model (IDM).
The proposed IDM enables the development of IoT systems from concept to
prototyping. The model comprises concept refinement pyramids, decision trees,
realistic constraint lists, architecture and organization diagrams,
communication interface patterns, use cases, and menus of analysis metrics and
evaluation indicators. The investigation confirms that the proposed model
enjoys several properties, such as, clarity, conciseness, thoroughness,
productivity, etc. The model is deployed for a variety of systems that belong
to heterogeneous areas of application; the model is proven to be effective in
application and successful in integrating mobile solutions. This chapter
includes the presentation of the IDM submodels, the reasoning about their
usefulness, and the technical developments of several systems. The chapter
includes thorough discussions, analysis of the model usability and application,
and in-depth evaluations.

  As the main contribution, this document provides a consistent discretization
of a class of fixed-time stable systems, namely predefined-time stable systems.
In the unperturbed case, the proposed approach allows obtaining not only a
consistent but exact discretization of the considered class of predefined-time
stable systems, whereas in the perturbed case, the consistent discretization
preserves the predefined-time stability property. All the results are validated
through simulations and compared with the conventional explicit Euler scheme,
highlighting the advantages of this proposal.

Title: Routing of Electric Vehicles in a Stochastic Network with Non-recurrent
  Incidents
Authors: Mohammad Arani, Mohammad Mehdi Rezvani, Hamzeh Davarikia, Yupo Chan
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: Accepted in Texas Power and Energy Conference 2020
\\
  An approach for mapping an electric vehicle EV driver s travel time
constraints and risk taking behavior to real time routing in a probabilistic
time-dependent or stochastic network is proposed in this paper. The proposed
approach is based on a heuristic algorithm that finds the shortest path
according to the driver s preferences. Accounting for en route delays and
alternate routes, the EV routing problem in stochastic networks is shown to
exhibit other than the First In First Out FIFO property i.e. the traveling time
for those who depart earlier may not sooner of those who depart later or wait
en route in the charging stations. The proposed approach provides EV drivers
the option to manage their trip and reach the destination on time, while by
taking advantage of the non FIFO characteristics of the traffic network, charge
their cars en route. The proposed routing algorithm is tested on a given
stochastic transportation network. The best routes based on the driver s
preferences are identified while accounting for the best-planned delays at the
charging stations or en-route.

Title: Bayesian estimates of transmission line outage rates that consider line
  dependencies
Authors: Kai Zhou, James R. Cruise, Chris J. Dent, Ian Dobson, Louis Wehenkel,
  Zhaoyu Wang, Amy L. Wilson
Categories: stat.AP cs.SY eess.SY physics.soc-ph
\\
  Transmission line outage rates are fundamental to power system reliability
analysis. Line outages are infrequent, occurring only about once a year, so
outage data are limited. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that
leverages line dependencies to better estimate outage rates of individual
transmission lines from limited outage data. The Bayesian estimates have a
lower standard deviation than estimating the outage rates simply by dividing
the number of outages by the number of years of data, especially when the
number of outages is small. The Bayesian model produces more accurate
individual line outage rates, as well as estimates of the uncertainty of these
rates. Better estimates of line outage rates can improve system risk
assessment, outage prediction, and maintenance scheduling.
