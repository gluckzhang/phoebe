Title: Dynamic Experience Replay
Authors: Jieliang Luo and Hui Li
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, presented at 2019 Conference on Robot Learning
  (CoRL)
\\
  We present a novel technique called Dynamic Experience Replay (DER) that
allows Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to use experience replay samples
not only from human demonstrations but also successful transitions generated by
RL agents during training and therefore improve training efficiency. It can be
combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm, such as DDPG or DQN, and
their distributed versions. We build upon Ape-X DDPG and demonstrate our
approach on robotic tight-fitting joint assembly tasks, based on force/torque
and Cartesian pose observations. In particular, we run experiments on two
different tasks: peg-in-hole and lap-joint. In each case, we compare different
replay buffer structures and how DER affects them. Our ablation studies show
that Dynamic Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient that either largely
shortens the training time in these challenging environments or solves the
tasks that the vanilla Ape-X DDPG cannot solve. We also show that our policies
learned purely in simulation can be deployed successfully on the real robot.

Title: An Incremental Explanation of Inference in Hybrid Bayesian Networks for
  Increasing Model Trustworthiness and Supporting Clinical Decision Making
Authors: Evangelia Kyrimi, Somayyeh Mossadegh, Nigel Tai, William Marsh
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Various AI models are increasingly being considered as part of clinical
decision-support tools. However, the trustworthiness of such models is rarely
considered. Clinicians are more likely to use a model if they can understand
and trust its predictions. Key to this is if its underlying reasoning can be
explained. A Bayesian network (BN) model has the advantage that it is not a
black-box and its reasoning can be explained. In this paper, we propose an
incremental explanation of inference that can be applied to hybrid BNs, i.e.
those that contain both discrete and continuous nodes. The key questions that
we answer are: (1) which important evidence supports or contradicts the
prediction, and (2) through which intermediate variables does the information
flow. The explanation is illustrated using a real clinical case study. A small
evaluation study is also conducted.

Title: Towards a Complexity-theoretic Understanding of Restarts in SAT solvers
Authors: Chunxiao Li, Noah Fleming, Marc Vinyals, Toniann Pitassi, Vijay Ganesh
Categories: cs.CC
\\
  Restarts are a widely used class of techniques integral to the efficiency of
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) SAT solvers. While the utility of such
policies has been well-established empirically, until now we didn't have a
complexity-theoretic understanding of why restart policies are crucial to the
power of CDCL SAT solvers.
  In this paper, we prove a series of theoretical results that characterize the
power of restarts for various models of Boolean SAT solvers. More precisely, we
make the following contributions. First, we prove an exponential separation
between a drunk randomized CDCL SAT solver model with restarts and the same
model without restarts using a family of satisfiable instances we call
$Ladder_n$ formulas. Second, we show that the configuration of CDCL SAT solver
with VSIDS branching and restarts (with activities erased after restarts) are
exponentially more powerful than the same configuration without restarts for a
family of unsatisfiable instances. To the best of our knowledge, these are the
first such set of separation results involving restarts in the context of SAT
solvers. Third, we show that restarts do not add any proof complexity-theoretic
power vis-a-vis a variety of models of CDCL and DPLL SAT solvers with
non-deterministic static variable selection (branching) and value selection.

Title: Characterizations and approximability of hard counting classes below #P
Authors: Eleni Bakali and Aggeliki Chalki and Aris Pagourtzis
Categories: cs.CC
Comments: 18 pages, 5 figures, to be published in the proceedings of TAMC2020
\\
  An important objective of research in counting complexity is to understand
which counting problems are approximable. In this quest, the complexity class
TotP, a hard subclass of #P, is of key importance, as it contains
self-reducible counting problems with easy decision version, thus eligible to
be approximable. Indeed, most problems known so far to admit an fpras fall into
this class.
  An open question raised recently by the community of descriptive complexity
is to find a logical characterization of TotP and of robust subclasses of TotP.
In this work we define two subclasses of TotP, in terms of descriptive
complexity, both of which are robust in the sense that they have natural
complete problems, which are defined in terms of satisfiability of Boolean
formulae.
  We then explore the relationship between the class of approximable counting
problems and TotP.
  We prove that TotP $\nsubseteq$ FPRAS if and only if NP $\neq$ RP and FPRAS
$\nsubseteq$ TotP unless RP = P. To this end we introduce two ancillary classes
that can both be seen as counting versions of RP. We further show that
  FPRAS lies between one of these classes and a counting version of BPP.
  Finally, we provide a complete picture of inclusions among all the classes
defined or discussed in this paper with respect to different conjectures about
the NP vs. RP vs. P questions.

Title: Fast uncertainty quantification of tracer distribution in the brain
  interstitial fluid with multilevel and quasi Monte Carlo
Authors: Matteo Croci, Vegard Vinje, Marie E. Rognes
Categories: cs.CE cs.NA math.NA stat.CO
Comments: Key words: Multilevel Monte Carlo, quasi Monte Carlo, brain
  simulation, brain fluids, finite element method, biomedical computing, random
  fields, diffusion-convection
\\
  Mathematical models in biology involve many parameters that are uncertain or
in some cases unknown. Over the last years, increased computing power has
expanded the complexity and increased the number of degrees of freedom of many
such models. For this reason, efficient uncertainty quantification algorithms
are now needed to explore the often large parameter space of a given model.
Advanced Monte Carlo methods such as quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and multilevel
Monte Carlo (MLMC) have become very popular in the mathematical, engineering,
and financial literature for the quantification of uncertainty in model
predictions. However, applying these methods to physiologically relevant
simulations is a difficult task given the typical complexity of the models and
geometries involved. In this paper, we design and apply QMC and MLMC methods to
quantify uncertainty in a convection-diffusion model for tracer transport
within the brain. We show that QMC outperforms standard Monte Carlo simulations
when the number of random inputs is small. MLMC considerably outperforms both
QMC and standard Monte Carlo methods and should therefore be preferred for
brain transport models.

Title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Neural Network Surrogates: Application to
  Contaminant Source Identification
Authors: Zitong Zhou, Daniel M. Tartakovsky
Categories: cs.CE
\\
  Subsurface remediation often involves reconstruction of contaminant release
history from sparse observations of solute concentration. Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC), the most accurate and general method for this task, is rarely
used in practice because of its high computational cost associated with
multiple solves of contaminant transport equations. We propose an adaptive MCMC
method, in which a transport model is replaced with a fast and accurate
surrogate model in the form of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The
CNN-based surrogate is trained on a small number of the transport model runs
based on the prior knowledge of the unknown release history. Thus reduced
computational cost allows one to reduce the sampling error associated with
construction of the approximate likelihood function. As all MCMC strategies for
source identification, our method has an added advantage of quantifying
predictive uncertainty and accounting for measurement errors. Our numerical
experiments demonstrate the accuracy comparable to that of MCMC with the
forward transport model, which is obtained at a fraction of the computational
cost of the latter.

Title: Inline Vector Compression for Computational Physics

\\
  A novel inline data compression method is presented for single-precision
vectors in three dimensions. The primary application of the method is for
accelerating computational physics calculations where the throughput is bound
by memory bandwidth. The scheme employs spherical polar coordinates, angle
quantisation, and a bespoke floating-point representation of the magnitude to
achieve a fixed compression ratio of 1.5. The anisotropy of this method is
considered, along with companding and fractional splitting techniques to
improve the efficiency of the representation. We evaluate the scheme
numerically within the context of high-order computational fluid-dynamics. For
both the isentropic convecting vortex and the Taylor--Green vortex test cases
the results are found to be comparable to those without compression.
Performance is evaluated for a vector addition kernel on an NVIDIA Titan V GPU;
it is demonstrated that a speedup of 1.5 can be achieved.

Title: Modified Bee Colony optimization algorithm for computational parameter

\\
  This paper discusses an optimization method called Modified Bee Colony
algorithm (MBC) based on a particular intelligent behavior of honeybee swarms.
The algorithm was checked in a few benchmarks like Shekel, Rozenbroke,
Himmelblau and Rastrigin functions, then was applied to parameter
identification for reactive flow problems in periodic porous media. The
simulation results show that the performance and efficiency of MBC algorithm
are comparable to the other parameter identification methods and strategies, at
the same time it is able to better capture local minima for the considered
class of problems. The proposed identification approach is applicable for
different geometries (random and periodic) and for a range of process
parameters. In this paper the potential of the approach is demonstrated in
identifying parameters of Langmuir isotherm for low Peclet and high Damkoler
numbers reactive flow in a 2D periodic porous media with circular inclusions.
Finite element approximation in space and implicit time discretization are
exploited.

Title: Maximum Clique in Disk-Like Intersection Graphs
Authors: \'Edouard Bonnet, Nicolas Grelier, Tillmann Miltzow
Categories: cs.CG cs.CC cs.DS
Comments: 23 pages, 5 figures
MSC-class: 68Q25, 68U05
ACM-class: F.2.2
\\
  We study the complexity of Maximum Clique in intersection graphs of convex
objects in the plane. On the algorithmic side, we extend the polynomial-time
algorithm for unit disks [Clark '90, Raghavan and Spinrad '03] to translates of
any fixed convex set. We also generalize the efficient polynomial-time
approximation scheme (EPTAS) and subexponential algorithm for disks [Bonnet et
al. '18, Bonamy et al. '18] to homothets of a fixed centrally symmetric convex
set. The main open question on that topic is the complexity of Maximum Clique
in disk graphs. It is not known whether this problem is NP-hard. We observe
that, so far, all the hardness proofs for Maximum Clique in intersection graph
classes $\mathcal I$ follow the same road. They show that, for every graph $G$
of a large-enough class $\mathcal C$, the complement of an even subdivision of
$G$ belongs to the intersection class $\mathcal I$. Then they conclude invoking
the hardness of Maximum Independent Set on the class $\mathcal C$, and the fact
that the even subdivision preserves that hardness. However there is a strong
evidence that this approach cannot work for disk graphs [Bonnet et al. '18]. We
suggest a new approach, based on a problem that we dub Max Interval Permutation
Avoidance, which we prove unlikely to have a subexponential-time approximation
scheme. We transfer that hardness to Maximum Clique in intersection graphs of
objects which can be either half-planes (or unit disks) or axis-parallel
rectangles. That problem is not amenable to the previous approach. We hope that
a scaled down (merely NP-hard) variant of Max Interval Permutation Avoidance
could help making progress on the disk case, for instance by showing the
NP-hardness for (convex) pseudo-disks.

Title: Dynamic Approximate Maximum Independent Set of Intervals, Hypercubes and
  Hyperrectangles
Authors: Monika Henzinger, Stefan Neumann, Andreas Wiese
Categories: cs.CG cs.DS
Comments: The conference version of this paper will appear at the Symposium on
  Computational Geometry (SoCG) 2020
\\
  Independent set is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization. While
in general graphs the problem is essentially inapproximable, for many important
graph classes there are approximation algorithms known in the offline setting.
These graph classes include interval graphs and geometric intersection graphs,
where vertices correspond to intervals/geometric objects and an edge indicates
that the two corresponding objects intersect.
  We present dynamic approximation algorithms for independent set of intervals,
hypercubes and hyperrectangles in $d$ dimensions. They work in the fully
dynamic model where each update inserts or deletes a geometric object. All our
algorithms are deterministic and have worst-case update times that are
polylogarithmic for constant $d$ and $\epsilon> 0$, assuming that the
coordinates of all input objects are in $[0, N]^d$ and each of their edges has
length at least 1. We obtain the following results:
  $\bullet$ For weighted intervals, we maintain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
solution.
  $\bullet$ For $d$-dimensional hypercubes we maintain a
$(1+\epsilon)2^{d}$-approximate solution in the unweighted case and a
$O(2^{d})$-approximate solution in the weighted case. Also, we show that for
maintaining an unweighted $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution one needs
polynomial update time for $d\ge2$ if the ETH holds.
  $\bullet$ For weighted $d$-dimensional hyperrectangles we present a dynamic
algorithm with approximation ratio $(1+\epsilon)\log^{d-1}N$.

Title: Minimum bounded chains and minimum homologous chains in embedded
  simplicial complexes
Authors: Glencora Borradaile, William Maxwell, Amir Nayyeri
Categories: cs.CG math.AT
\\
  We study two optimization problems on simplicial complexes with homology over
$\mathbb{Z}_2$, the minimum bounded chain problem: given a $d$-dimensional
complex $\mathcal{K}$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ and a null-homologous
$(d-1)$-cycle $C$ in $\mathcal{K}$, find the minimum $d$-chain with boundary
$C$, and the minimum homologous chain problem: given a $(d+1)$-manifold
$\mathcal{M}$ and a $d$-chain $D$ in $\mathcal{M}$, find the minimum $d$-chain
homologous to $D$. We show strong hardness results for both problems even for
small values of $d$; $d = 2$ for the former problem, and $d=1$ for the latter
problem. We show that both problems are APX-hard, and hard to approximate
within any constant factor assuming the unique games conjecture. On the
positive side, we show that both problems are fixed parameter tractable with
respect to the size of the optimal solution. Moreover, we provide an
$O(\sqrt{\log \beta_d})$-approximation algorithm for the minimum bounded chain
problem where $\beta_d$ is the $d$th Betti number of $\mathcal{K}$. Finally, we
provide an $O(\sqrt{\log n_{d+1}})$-approximation algorithm for the minimum
homologous chain problem where $n_{d+1}$ is the number of $d$-simplices in
$\mathcal{M}$.

Title: A Study on Efficiency, Accuracy and Document Structure for Answer
  Sentence Selection
Authors: Daniele Bonadiman and Alessandro Moschitti
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  An essential task of most Question Answering (QA) systems is to re-rank the
set of answer candidates, i.e., Answer Sentence Selection (A2S). These
candidates are typically sentences either extracted from one or more documents
preserving their natural order or retrieved by a search engine. Most
state-of-the-art approaches to the task use huge neural models, such as BERT,
or complex attentive architectures. In this paper, we argue that by exploiting
the intrinsic structure of the original rank together with an effective
word-relatedness encoder, we can achieve competitive results with respect to
the state of the art while retaining high efficiency. Our model takes 9.5
seconds to train on the WikiQA dataset, i.e., very fast in comparison with the
$\sim 18$ minutes required by a standard BERT-base fine-tuning.

  State-of-the-art solutions for Natural Language Processing (NLP) are able to
capture a broad range of contexts, like the sentence level context or document
level context for short documents. But these solutions are still struggling
when it comes to real-world longer documents with information encoded in the
spatial structure of the document, in elements like tables, forms, headers,
openings or footers, or the complex layout of pages or multiple pages.
  To encourage progress on deeper and more complex information extraction, we
present a new task (named Kleister) with two new datasets. Based on textual and
structural layout features, an NLP system must find the most important
information, about various types of entities, in formal long documents. These
entities are not only classes from standard named entity recognition (NER)
systems (e.g. location, date, or amount) but also the roles of the entities in
the whole documents (e.g. company town address, report date, income amount).

generation from recipe title and cooking instructions. Its back-end text
generation module comprises a generative pre-trained language model GPT-2
fine-tuned on a large cooking recipe dataset. Moreover, the recipe evaluation
module allows the users to conveniently inspect the quality of the generated
recipe contents and store the results for future reference. RecipeGPT can be

Title: SentenceMIM: A Latent Variable Language Model

\\
  We introduce sentenceMIM, a probabilistic auto-encoder for language
modelling, trained with Mutual Information Machine (MIM) learning. Previous
attempts to learn variational auto-encoders for language data? have had mixed
success, with empirical performance well below state-of-the-art auto-regressive
models, a key barrier being the? occurrence of posterior collapse with VAEs.
The recently proposed MIM framework encourages high mutual information between
observations and latent variables, and is more robust against posterior
collapse. This paper formulates a MIM model for text data, along with a
corresponding learning algorithm. We demonstrate excellent perplexity (PPL)
results on several datasets, and show that the framework learns a rich latent
space, allowing for interpolation between sentences of different lengths with a
fixed-dimensional latent representation. We also demonstrate the versatility of
sentenceMIM by utilizing a trained model for question-answering, a transfer
learning task, without fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first latent variable model (LVM) for text modelling that achieves competitive
performance with non-LVM models.

Title: Fact Check-Worthiness Detection as Positive Unlabelled Learning
Authors: Dustin Wright and Isabelle Augenstein
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables
\\
  A critical component of automatically combating misinformation is the
detection of fact check-worthiness, i.e. determining if a piece of information
should be checked for veracity. There are multiple isolated lines of research
which address this core issue: check-worthiness detection from political
speeches and debates, rumour detection on Twitter, and citation needed
detection from Wikipedia. What is still lacking is a structured comparison of
these variants of check-worthiness, as well as a unified approach to them. We
find that check-worthiness detection is a very challenging task in any domain,
because it both hinges upon detecting how factual a sentence is, and how likely
a sentence is to be believed without verification. As such, annotators often
only mark those instances they judge to be clear-cut check-worthy. Our
best-performing method automatically corrects for this, using a variant of
positive unlabelled learning, which learns when an instance annotated as not
check-worthy should in fact have been annotated as being check-worthy. In
applying this, we outperform the state of the art in two of the three domains
studied for check-worthiness detection in English.

Authors: Farhad Nooralahzadeh, Giannis Bekoulis, Johannes Bjerva, Isabelle

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Learning what to share between tasks has been a topic of high importance
recently, as strategic sharing of knowledge has been shown to improve the
performance of downstream tasks. The same applies to sharing between languages,
and is especially important when considering the fact that most languages in
the world suffer from being under-resourced. In this paper, we consider the
setting of training models on multiple different languages at the same time,
when little or no data is available for languages other than English. We show
that this challenging setup can be approached using meta-learning, where, in
addition to training a source language model, another model learns to select
which training instances are the most beneficial. We experiment using standard
supervised, zero-shot cross-lingual, as well as few-shot cross-lingual settings
for different natural language understanding tasks (natural language inference,
question answering). Our extensive experimental setup demonstrates the
consistent effectiveness of meta-learning, on a total 16 languages. We improve
upon state-of-the-art on zero-shot and few-shot NLI and QA tasks on the XNLI
and X-WikiRe datasets, respectively. We further conduct a comprehensive
analysis which indicates that correlation of typological features between
languages can further explain when parameter sharing learned via meta learning
is beneficial.

Title: HypoNLI: Exploring the Artificial Patterns of Hypothesis-only Bias in
  Natural Language Inference
Authors: Tianyu Liu, Xin Zheng, Baobao Chang and Zhifang Sui
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: LREC 2020
\\
  Many recent studies have shown that for models trained on datasets for
natural language inference (NLI), it is possible to make correct predictions by
merely looking at the hypothesis while completely ignoring the premise. In this
work, we manage to derive adversarial examples in terms of the hypothesis-only
bias and explore eligible ways to mitigate such bias. Specifically, we extract
various phrases from the hypotheses (artificial patterns) in the training sets,
and show that they have been strong indicators to the specific labels. We then
figure out `hard' and `easy' instances from the original test sets whose labels
are opposite to or consistent with those indications. We also set up baselines
including both pretrained models (BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet) and competitive
non-pretrained models (InferSent, DAM, ESIM). Apart from the benchmark and
baselines, we also investigate two debiasing approaches which exploit the
artificial pattern modeling to mitigate such hypothesis-only bias:
down-sampling and adversarial training. We believe those methods can be treated
as competitive baselines in NLI debiasing tasks.

Title: An Empirical Accuracy Law for Sequential Machine Translation: the Case

\\
  We have established, through empirical testing, a law that relates the number
of translating hops to translation accuracy in sequential machine translation
in Google Translate. Both accuracy and size decrease with the number of hops;
the former displays a decrease closely following a power law. Such a law allows
one to predict the behavior of translation chains that may be built as society
increasingly depends on automated devices.

Title: Finding linearly generated subsequences
Authors: Claude Gravel and Daniel Panario
Categories: cs.CR cs.DM math.CO
Comments: 18 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables
\\
  We develop a new algorithm to compute determinants of all possible Hankel
matrices made up from a given finite length sequence over a finite field. Our
algorithm fits within the dynamic programming paradigm by exploiting new
recursive relations on the determinants of Hankel matrices together with new
observations concerning the distribution of zero determinants among the
possible matrix sizes allowed by the length of the original sequence. The
algorithm can be used to isolate \emph{very} efficiently linear shift feedback
registers hidden in strings with random prefix and random postfix for instance
and, therefore, recovering the shortest generating vector. We compare our
results empirically with the trivial algorithm which consists of computing
determinants for each possible Hankel matrices made up from a given finite
length sequence. For instance for sequences of length $4096$, our algorithm is
about $83$ times faster than the trivial algorithm on typical worst-case
sequences and about $5947$ times faster on easy cases.

Title: DANTE: A framework for mining and monitoring darknet traffic
Authors: Dvir Cohen, Yisroel Mirsky, Yuval Elovici, Rami Puzis, Manuel Kamp,
  Tobias Martin, Asaf Shabtai
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Trillions of network packets are sent over the Internet to destinations which
do not exist. This 'darknet' traffic captures the activity of botnets and other
malicious campaigns aiming to discover and compromise devices around the world.
In order to mine threat intelligence from this data, one must be able to handle
large streams of logs and represent the traffic patterns in a meaningful way.
However, by observing how network ports (services) are used, it is possible to
capture the intent of each transmission. In this paper, we present DANTE: a
framework and algorithm for mining darknet traffic. DANTE learns the meaning of
targeted network ports by applying Word2Vec to observed port sequences. Then,
when a host sends a new sequence, DANTE represents the transmission as the
average embedding of the ports found that sequence. Finally, DANTE uses a novel
and incremental time-series cluster tracking algorithm on observed sequences to
detect recurring behaviors and new emerging threats. To evaluate the system, we
ran DANTE on a full year of darknet traffic (over three Tera-Bytes) collected
by the largest telecommunications provider in Europe, Deutsche Telekom and
analyzed the results. DANTE discovered 1,177 new emerging threats and was able
to track malicious campaigns over time. We also compared DANTE to the current
best approach and found DANTE to be more practical and effective at detecting
darknet traffic patterns.

Title: We Know What They've Been Put Through: Revisiting High-scalability
  Blockchain Transactions
Authors: Daniel Perez and Jiahua Xu and Benjamin Livshits
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Scalability has been a bottleneck for major blockchains such as Bitcoin and
Ethereum. Despite the significantly improved scalability claimed by several
high-profile blockchain projects, there has been little effort to understand
how their transactional throughput is being used. In this paper, we examine
recent network traffic of three major high-scalability blockchains-EOS, Tezos
and XRP-over a period of three months.Our analysis reveals that only a small
fraction of the transactions are used for value transfer purposes. In
particular, 95% of the transactions on EOS were triggered by the airdrop of a
currently valueless token; on Tezos, 82% of throughput was used for maintaining
consensus; and only 2% of transactions on the XRP ledger lead to value
transfers. The paper explores the different designs of the three blockchains
and sheds light on how they could shape user behavior.

Title: Detection and Recovery of Adversarial Attacks with Injected Attractors
Authors: Jiyi Zhang, Ee-Chien Chang, Hwee Kuan Lee
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Many machine learning adversarial attacks find adversarial samples of a
victim model ${\mathcal M}$ by following the gradient of some functions, either
explicitly or implicitly. To detect and recover from such attacks, we take the
proactive approach that modifies those functions with the goal of misleading
the attacks to some local minimals, or to some designated regions that can be
easily picked up by a forensic analyzer. To achieve the goal, we propose adding
a large number of artifacts, which we called $attractors$, onto the otherwise
smooth function. An attractor is a point in the input space, which has a
neighborhood of samples with gradients pointing toward it. We observe that
decoders of watermarking schemes exhibit properties of attractors, and give a
generic method that injects attractors from a watermark decoder into the victim
model ${\mathcal M}$. This principled approach allows us to leverage on known
watermarking schemes for scalability and robustness. Experimental studies show
that our method has competitive performance. For instance, for un-targeted
attacks on CIFAR-10 dataset, we can reduce the overall attack success rate of
DeepFool to 1.9%, whereas known defence LID, FS and MagNet can reduce the rate
to 90.8%, 98.5% and 78.5% respectively.

Title: Exploring Partial Intrinsic and Extrinsic Symmetry in 3D Medical Imaging
Authors: Javad Fotouhi, Giacomo Taylor, Mathias Unberath, Alex Johnson, Sing
  Chun Lee, Greg Osgood, Mehran Armand, Nassir Navab
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present a novel methodology to detect imperfect bilateral symmetry in CT
of human anatomy. In this paper, the structurally symmetric nature of the
pelvic bone is explored and is used to provide interventional image
augmentation for treatment of unilateral fractures in patients with traumatic
injuries. The mathematical basis of our solution is on the incorporation of
attributes and characteristics that satisfy the properties of intrinsic and
extrinsic symmetry and are robust to outliers. In the first step, feature
points that satisfy intrinsic symmetry are automatically detected in the
M\"obius space defined on the CT data. These features are then pruned via a
two-stage RANSAC to attain correspondences that satisfy also the extrinsic
symmetry. Then, a disparity function based on Tukey's biweight robust estimator
is introduced and minimized to identify a symmetry plane parametrization that
yields maximum contralateral similarity. Finally, a novel regularization term
is introduced to enhance similarity between bone density histograms across the
partial symmetry plane, relying on the important biological observation that,
even if injured, the dislocated bone segments remain within the body. Our
extensive evaluations on various cases of common fracture types demonstrate the
validity of the novel concepts and the robustness and accuracy of the proposed
method.

Title: The Impact of Hole Geometry on Relative Robustness of In-Painting
  Networks: An Empirical Study
Authors: Masood S. Mortazavi and Ning Yan
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  In-painting networks use existing pixels to generate appropriate pixels to
fill "holes" placed on parts of an image. A 2-D in-painting network's input
usually consists of (1) a three-channel 2-D image, and (2) an additional
channel for the "holes" to be in-painted in that image. In this paper, we study
the robustness of a given in-painting neural network against variations in hole
geometry distributions. We observe that the robustness of an in-painting
network is dependent on the probability distribution function (PDF) of the hole
geometry presented to it during its training even if the underlying image
dataset used (in training and testing) does not alter. We develop an
experimental methodology for testing and evaluating relative robustness of
in-painting networks against four different kinds of hole geometry PDFs. We
examine a number of hypothesis regarding (1) the natural bias of in-painting
networks to the hole distribution used for their training, (2) the underlying
dataset's ability to differentiate relative robustness as hole distributions
vary in a train-test (cross-comparison) grid, and (3) the impact of the
directional distribution of edges in the holes and in the image dataset. We
present results for L1, PSNR and SSIM quality metrics and develop a specific
measure of relative in-painting robustness to be used in cross-comparison grids
based on these quality metrics. (One can incorporate other quality metrics in
this relative measure.) The empirical work reported here is an initial step in
a broader and deeper investigation of "filling the blank" neural networks'
sensitivity, robustness and regularization with respect to hole "geometry"
PDFs, and it suggests further research in this domain.

Title: Learning View and Target Invariant Visual Servoing for Navigation
Authors: Yimeng Li, Jana Kosecka
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: Accepted to ICRA 2020
\\
  The advances in deep reinforcement learning recently revived interest in
data-driven learning based approaches to navigation. In this paper we propose
to learn viewpoint invariant and target invariant visual servoing for local
mobile robot navigation; given an initial view and the goal view or an image of
a target, we train deep convolutional network controller to reach the desired
goal. We present a new architecture for this task which rests on the ability of
establishing correspondences between the initial and goal view and novel reward
structure motivated by the traditional feedback control error. The advantage of
the proposed model is that it does not require calibration and depth
information and achieves robust visual servoing in a variety of environments
and targets without any parameter fine tuning. We present comprehensive
evaluation of the approach and comparison with other deep learning
architectures as well as classical visual servoing methods in visually
realistic simulation environment. The presented model overcomes the brittleness
of classical visual servoing based methods and achieves significantly higher
generalization capability compared to the previous learning approaches.

Title: Creating High Resolution Images with a Latent Adversarial Generator
Authors: David Berthelot, Peyman Milanfar, Ian Goodfellow
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV stat.ML
\\
  Generating realistic images is difficult, and many formulations for this task
have been proposed recently. If we restrict the task to that of generating a
particular class of images, however, the task becomes more tractable. That is
to say, instead of generating an arbitrary image as a sample from the manifold
of natural images, we propose to sample images from a particular "subspace" of
natural images, directed by a low-resolution image from the same subspace. The
problem we address, while close to the formulation of the single-image
super-resolution problem, is in fact rather different. Single image
super-resolution is the task of predicting the image closest to the ground
truth from a relatively low resolution image. We propose to produce samples of
high resolution images given extremely small inputs with a new method called
Latent Adversarial Generator (LAG). In our generative sampling framework, we
only use the input (possibly of very low-resolution) to direct what class of
samples the network should produce. As such, the output of our algorithm is not
a unique image that relates to the input, but rather a possible se} of related
images sampled from the manifold of natural images. Our method learns
exclusively in the latent space of the adversary using perceptual loss -- it
does not have a pixel loss.

Title: Towards Fair Cross-Domain Adaptation via Generative Learning
Authors: Tongxin Wang, Zhengming Ding, Wei Shao, Haixu Tang, Kun Huang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Domain Adaptation (DA) targets at adapting a model trained over the
well-labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain lying in different
distributions. Existing DA normally assumes the well-labeled source domain is
class-wise balanced, which means the size per source class is relatively
similar. However, in real-world applications, labeled samples for some
categories in the source domain could be extremely few due to the difficulty of
data collection and annotation, which leads to decreasing performance over
target domain on those few-shot categories. To perform fair cross-domain
adaptation and boost the performance on these minority categories, we develop a
novel Generative Few-shot Cross-domain Adaptation (GFCA) algorithm for fair
cross-domain classification. Specifically, generative feature augmentation is
explored to synthesize effective training data for few-shot source classes,
while effective cross-domain alignment aims to adapt knowledge from source to
facilitate the target learning. Experimental results on two large cross-domain
visual datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on
improving both few-shot and overall classification accuracy comparing with the
state-of-the-art DA approaches.

Title: A Benchmark for LiDAR-based Panoptic Segmentation based on KITTI
Authors: Jens Behley and Andres Milioto and Cyrill Stachniss
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Panoptic segmentation is the recently introduced task that tackles semantic
segmentation and instance segmentation jointly. In this paper, we present an
extension of SemanticKITTI, which is a large-scale dataset providing dense
point-wise semantic labels for all sequences of the KITTI Odometry Benchmark,
for training and evaluation of laser-based panoptic segmentation. We provide
the data and discuss the processing steps needed to enrich a given semantic
annotation with temporally consistent instance information, i.e., instance
information that supplements the semantic labels and identifies the same
instance over sequences of LiDAR point clouds. Additionally, we present two
strong baselines that combine state-of-the-art LiDAR-based semantic
segmentation approaches with a state-of-the-art detector enriching the
segmentation with instance information and that allow other researchers to
compare their approaches against. We hope that our extension of SemanticKITTI
with strong baselines enables the creation of novel algorithms for LiDAR-based
panoptic segmentation as much as it has for the original semantic segmentation
and semantic scene completion tasks. Data, code, and an online evaluation using
a hidden test set will be published on http://semantic-kitti.org.

Title: Who Make Drivers Stop? Towards Driver-centric Risk Assessment: Risk
  Object Identification via Causal Inference
Authors: Chengxi Li, Stanley H. Chan and Yi-Ting Chen
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  We propose a framework based on causal inference for risk object
identification, an essential task towards driver-centric risk assessment. In
this work, risk objects are defined as objects influencing driver's
goal-oriented behavior. There are two limitations of the existing approaches.
First, they require strong supervisions such as risk object location or human
gaze location. Second, there is no explicit reasoning stage for identifying
risk object. To address these issues, the task of identifying causes of driver
behavioral change is formalized in the language of functional causal models and
interventions. Specifically, we iteratively simulate causal effect by removing
an object using the proposed driving model. The risk object is determined as
the one causing the most substantial causal effect. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD). The dataset
provides the annotation for risk object localization to enable systematic
benchmarking with existing approaches. Our framework demonstrates a substantial
average performance boost over a strong baseline by 7.5%.

Title: Drone Based RGBT Vehicle Detection and Counting: A Challenge

  Camera-equipped drones can capture targets on the ground from a wider field
of view than static cameras or moving sensors over the ground. In this paper we
present a large-scale vehicle detection and counting benchmark, named
DroneVehicle, aiming at advancing visual analysis tasks on the drone platform.
The images in the benchmark were captured over various urban areas, which
include different types of urban roads, residential areas, parking lots,
highways, etc., from day to night. Specifically, DroneVehicle consists of
15,532 pairs of images, i.e., RGB images and infrared images with rich
annotations, including oriented object bounding boxes, object categories, etc.
With intensive amount of effort, our benchmark has 441,642 annotated instances
in 31,064 images. As a large-scale dataset with both RGB and thermal infrared
(RGBT) images, the benchmark enables extensive evaluation and investigation of
visual analysis algorithms on the drone platform. In particular, we design two
popular tasks with the benchmark, including object detection and object
counting. All these tasks are extremely challenging in the proposed dataset due
to factors such as illumination, occlusion, and scale variations. We hope the
benchmark largely boost the research and development in visual analysis on
drone platforms. The DroneVehicle dataset can be download from

Title: End-to-End Trainable One-Stage Parking Slot Detection Integrating Global
  and Local Information
Authors: Jae Kyu Suhr and Ho Gi Jung
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable one-stage parking slot detection
method for around view monitor (AVM) images. The proposed method simultaneously
acquires global information (entrance, type, and occupancy of parking slot) and
local information (location and orientation of junction) by using a
convolutional neural network (CNN), and integrates them to detect parking slots
with their properties. This method divides an AVM image into a grid and
performs a CNN-based feature extraction. For each cell of the grid, the global
and local information of the parking slot is obtained by applying convolution
filters to the extracted feature map. Final detection results are produced by
integrating the global and local information of the parking slot through
non-maximum suppression (NMS). Since the proposed method obtains most of the
information of the parking slot using a fully convolutional network without a
region proposal stage, it is an end-to-end trainable one-stage detector. In
experiments, this method was quantitatively evaluated using the public dataset
and outperforms previous methods by showing both recall and precision of
99.77%, type classification accuracy of 100%, and occupancy classification
accuracy of 99.31% while processing 60 frames per second.

Journal-ref: J-STSP-CDNN-00206-2019
DOI: 10.1109/JSTSP.2020.2971418
\\
  Even though the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has shown superior
results in the field of computer vision, it is still a challenging task to
implement computer vision algorithms in real-time at the edge, especially using
a low-cost IoT device due to high memory consumption and computation
complexities in a CNN. Network compression methodologies such as weight
pruning, filter pruning, and quantization are used to overcome the above
mentioned problem. Even though filter pruning methodology has shown better
performances compared to other techniques, irregularity of the number of
filters pruned across different layers of a CNN might not comply with majority
of the neural computing hardware architectures. In this paper, a novel greedy
approach called cluster pruning has been proposed, which provides a structured
way of removing filters in a CNN by considering the importance of filters and
the underlying hardware architecture. The proposed methodology is compared with
the conventional filter pruning algorithm on Pascal-VOC open dataset, and
Head-Counting dataset, which is our own dataset developed to detect and count
people entering a room. We benchmark our proposed method on three hardware
architectures, namely CPU, GPU, and Intel Movidius Neural Computer Stick (NCS)
using the popular SSD-MobileNet and SSD-SqueezeNet neural network architectures
used for edge-AI vision applications. Results demonstrate that our method
outperforms the conventional filter pruning methodology, using both datasets on
above mentioned hardware architectures. Furthermore, a low cost IoT hardware
setup consisting of an Intel Movidius-NCS is proposed to deploy an edge-AI
application using our proposed pruning methodology.

Title: Adversarial Vertex Mixup: Toward Better Adversarially Robust
  Generalization
Authors: Saehyung Lee, Hyungyu Lee, Sungroh Yoon
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To appear in CVPR 2020
\\
  Adversarial examples cause neural networks to produce incorrect outputs with
high confidence. Although adversarial training is one of the most effective
forms of defense against adversarial examples, unfortunately, a large gap
exists between test accuracy and training accuracy in adversarial training. In
this paper, we identify Adversarial Feature Overfitting (AFO), which may cause
poor adversarially robust generalization, and we show that adversarial training
can overshoot the optimal point in terms of robust generalization, leading to
AFO in our simple Gaussian model. Considering these theoretical results, we
present soft labeling as a solution to the AFO problem. Furthermore, we propose
Adversarial Vertex mixup (AVmixup), a soft-labeled data augmentation approach
for improving adversarially robust generalization. We complement our
theoretical analysis with experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and Tiny
ImageNet, and show that AVmixup significantly improves the robust
generalization performance and that it reduces the trade-off between standard
accuracy and adversarial robustness.

Title: Detecting Attended Visual Targets in Video
Authors: Eunji Chong, Yongxin Wang, Nataniel Ruiz, and James M. Rehg
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  We address the problem of detecting attention targets in video. Specifically,
our goal is to identify where each person in each frame of a video is looking,
and correctly handle the out-of-frame case. Our novel architecture effectively
models the dynamic interaction between the scene and head features in order to
infer time-varying attention targets. We introduce a new dataset,
VideoAttentionTarget, consisting of fully-annotated video clips containing
complex and dynamic patterns of real-world gaze behavior. Experiments on this
dataset show that our model can effectively infer attention in videos. To
further demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply our predicted
attention maps to two social gaze behavior recognition tasks, and show that the
resulting classifiers significantly outperform existing methods. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on three datasets: GazeFollow (static images),
VideoAttentionTarget (videos), and VideoCoAtt (videos), and obtain the first
results for automatically classifying clinically-relevant gaze behavior without
wearable cameras or eye trackers.

Title: A Balanced and Uncertainty-aware Approach for Partial Domain Adaptation
Authors: Jian Liang, Yunbo Wang, Dapeng Hu, Ran He, and Jiashi Feng
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  This work addresses the unsupervised domain adaptation problem, especially
for the partial scenario where the class labels in the target domain are only a
subset of those in the source domain. Such a partial transfer setting sounds
realistic but challenging while existing methods always suffer from two key
problems, i.e., negative transfer and uncertainty propagation. In this paper,
we build on domain adversarial learning and propose a novel domain adaptation
method BA$^3$US with two new techniques termed Balanced Adversarial Alignment
(BAA) and Adaptive Uncertainty Suppression (AUS), respectively. On one hand,
negative transfer results in that target samples are misclassified to the
classes only present in the source domain. To address this issue, BAA aims to
pursue the balance between label distributions across domains in a quite simple
manner. Specifically, it randomly leverages a few source samples to augment the
smaller target domain during domain alignment so that classes in different
domains are symmetric. On the other hand, a source sample is denoted as
uncertain if there is an incorrect class that has a relatively high prediction
score. Such uncertainty is easily propagated to the unlabeled target data
around it during alignment, which severely deteriorates the adaptation
performance. Thus, AUS emphasizes uncertain samples and exploits an adaptive
weighted complement entropy objective to expect that incorrect classes have the
uniform and low prediction scores. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that BA$^3$US surpasses state-of-the-arts for partial domain
adaptation tasks.

Title: Embedding Expansion: Augmentation in Embedding Space for Deep Metric
  Learning
Authors: Byungsoo Ko, Geonmo Gu
Categories: cs.CV cs.IR cs.LG
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020
\\
  Learning the distance metric between pairs of samples has been studied for
image retrieval and clustering. With the remarkable success of pair-based
metric learning losses, recent works have proposed the use of generated
synthetic points on metric learning losses for augmentation and generalization.
However, these methods require additional generative networks along with the
main network, which can lead to a larger model size, slower training speed, and
harder optimization. Meanwhile, post-processing techniques, such as query
expansion and database augmentation, have proposed the combination of feature
points to obtain additional semantic information. In this paper, inspired by
query expansion and database augmentation, we propose an augmentation method in
an embedding space for pair-based metric learning losses, called embedding
expansion. The proposed method generates synthetic points containing augmented
information by a combination of feature points and performs hard negative pair
mining to learn with the most informative feature representations. Because of
its simplicity and flexibility, it can be used for existing metric learning
losses without affecting model size, training speed, or optimization
difficulty. Finally, the combination of embedding expansion and representative
metric learning losses outperforms the state-of-the-art losses and previous
sample generation methods in both image retrieval and clustering tasks. The
implementation will be publicly available.

Title: GANwriting: Content-Conditioned Generation of Styled Handwritten Word
  Images
Authors: Lei Kang, Pau Riba, Yaxing Wang, Mar\c{c}al Rusi\~nol, Alicia Forn\'es
  and Mauricio Villegas
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Although current image generation methods have reached impressive quality
levels, they are still unable to produce plausible yet diverse images of
handwritten words. On the contrary, when writing by hand, a great variability
is observed across different writers, and even when analyzing words scribbled
by the same individual, involuntary variations are conspicuous. In this work,
we take a step closer to producing realistic and varied artificially rendered
handwritten words. We propose a novel method that is able to produce credible
handwritten word images by conditioning the generative process with both
calligraphic style features and textual content. Our generator is guided by
three complementary learning objectives: to produce realistic images, to
imitate a certain handwriting style and to convey a specific textual content.
Our model is unconstrained to any predefined vocabulary, being able to render
whatever input word. Given a sample writer, it is also able to mimic its
calligraphic features in a few-shot setup. We significantly advance over prior
art and demonstrate with qualitative, quantitative and human-based evaluations
the realistic aspect of our synthetically produced images.

Title: MarginDistillation: distillation for margin-based softmax
Authors: David Svitov and Sergey Alyamkin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The usage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in conjunction with a
margin-based softmax approach demonstrates a state-of-the-art performance for
the face recognition problem. Recently, lightweight neural network models
trained with the margin-based softmax have been introduced for the face
identification task for edge devices. In this paper, we propose a novel
distillation method for lightweight neural network architectures that
outperforms other known methods for the face recognition task on LFW, AgeDB-30
and Megaface datasets. The idea of the proposed method is to use class centers
from the teacher network for the student network. Then the student network is
trained to get the same angles between the class centers and the face
embeddings, predicted by the teacher network.

  Deep CNN architecture

\\
  Melanoma, one of most dangerous types of skin cancer, re-sults in a very high
mortality rate. Early detection and resection are two key points for a
successful cure. Recent research has used artificial intelligence to classify
melanoma and nevus and to compare the assessment of these algorithms to that of
dermatologists. However, an imbalance of sensitivity and specificity measures
affected the performance of existing models. This study proposes a method using
deep convolutional neural networks aiming to detect melanoma as a binary
classification problem. It involves 3 key features, namely customized batch
logic, customized loss function and reformed fully connected layers. The
training dataset is kept up to date including 17,302 images of melanoma and
nevus; this is the largest dataset by far. The model performance is compared to
that of 157 dermatologists from 12 university hospitals in Germany based on
MClass-D dataset. The model outperformed all 157 dermatologists and achieved
state-of-the-art performance with AUC at 94.4% with sensitivity of 85.0% and
specificity of 95.0% using a prediction threshold of 0.5 on the MClass-D
dataset of 100 dermoscopic images. Moreover, a threshold of 0.40858 showed the
most balanced measure compared to other researches, and is promisingly
application to medical diagnosis, with sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of
93.8%.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We introduce the first method for automatic image generation from scene-level
freehand sketches. Our model allows for controllable image generation by
specifying the synthesis goal via freehand sketches. The key contribution is an
attribute vector bridged generative adversarial network called edgeGAN which
supports high visual-quality image content generation without using freehand
sketches as training data. We build a large-scale composite dataset called
SketchyCOCO to comprehensively evaluate our solution. We validate our approach
on the task of both objectlevel and scene-level image generation on
SketchyCOCO. We demonstrate the method's capacity to generate realistic complex
scene-level images from a variety of freehand sketches by quantitative,
qualitative results, and ablation studies.

Title: Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning Using Variable
  Playback Speed Prediction
Authors: Hyeon Cho, Taehoon Kim, Hyung Jin Chang, Wonjun Hwang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 14 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We propose a self-supervised learning method by predicting the variable
playback speeds of a video. Without semantic labels, we learn the
spatio-temporal representation of the video by leveraging the variations in the
visual appearance according to different playback speeds under the assumption
of temporal coherence. To learn the spatio-temporal variations in the entire
video, we have not only predicted a single playback speed but also generated
clips of various playback speeds with randomized starting points. We then train
a 3D convolutional network by solving the formulation that sorts the shuffled
clips by their playback speed. In this case, the playback speed includes both
forward and reverse directions; hence the visual representation can be
successfully learned from the directional dynamics of the video. We also
propose a novel layer-dependable temporal group normalization method that can
be applied to 3D convolutional networks to improve the representation learning
performance where we divide the temporal features into several groups and
normalize each one using the different corresponding parameters. We validate
the effectiveness of the proposed method by fine-tuning it to the action
recognition task. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in action
recognition.

\\
  The superiority of deep learning performance is threatened by safety issues
for itself. Recent findings have shown that deep learning systems are very weak
to adversarial examples, an attack form that was altered by the attacker's
intent to deceive the deep learning system. There are many proposed defensive
methods to protect deep learning systems against adversarial examples. However,
there is still a lack of principal strategies to deceive those defensive
methods. Any time a particular countermeasure is proposed, a new powerful
adversarial attack will be invented to deceive that countermeasure. In this
study, we focus on investigating the ability to create adversarial patterns in
search space against defensive methods that use image filters. Experimental
results conducted on the ImageNet dataset with image classification tasks
showed the correlation between the search space of adversarial perturbation and
filters. These findings open a new direction for building stronger offensive
methods towards deep learning systems.

Title: Combating noisy labels by agreement: A joint training method with
  co-regularization
Authors: Hongxin Wei, Lei Feng, Xiangyu Chen, Bo An
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Code is available at: https://github.com/hongxin001/JoCoR
\\
  Deep Learning with noisy labels is a practically challenging problem in
weakly-supervised learning. The state-of-the-art approaches "Decoupling" and
"Co-teaching+" claim that the "disagreement" strategy is crucial for
alleviating the problem of learning with noisy labels. In this paper, we start
from a different perspective and propose a robust learning paradigm called
JoCoR, which aims to reduce the diversity of two networks during training.
Specifically, we first use two networks to make predictions on the same
mini-batch data and calculate a joint loss with Co-Regularization for each
training example. Then we select small-loss examples to update the parameters
of both two networks simultaneously. Trained by the joint loss, these two
networks would be more and more similar due to the effect of Co-Regularization.
Extensive experimental results on corrupted data from benchmark datasets
including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M demonstrate that JoCoR is
superior to many state-of-the-art approaches for learning with noisy labels.

Title: Multi-object Tracking via End-to-end Tracklet Searching and Ranking
Authors: Tao Hu, Lichao Huang, Han Shen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent works in multiple object tracking use sequence model to calculate the
similarity score between the detections and the previous tracklets. However,
the forced exposure to ground-truth in the training stage leads to the
training-inference discrepancy problem, i.e., exposure bias, where association
error could accumulate in the inference and make the trajectories drift. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for optimizing tracklet consistency,
which directly takes the prediction errors into account by introducing an
online, end-to-end tracklet search training process. Notably, our methods
directly optimize the whole tracklet score instead of pairwise affinity. With
sequence model as appearance encoders of tracklet, our tracker achieves
remarkable performance gain from conventional tracklet association baseline.
Our methods have also achieved state-of-the-art in MOT15~17 challenge
benchmarks using public detection and online settings.

Title: Feature Extraction for Hyperspectral Imagery: The Evolution from Shallow
  to Deep
Authors: Behnood Rasti, Danfeng Hong, Renlong Hang, Pedram Ghamisi, Xudong

\\
  Hyperspectral images provide detailed spectral information through hundreds
of (narrow) spectral channels (also known as dimensionality or bands) with
continuous spectral information that can accurately classify diverse materials
of interest. The increased dimensionality of such data makes it possible to
significantly improve data information content but provides a challenge to the
conventional techniques (the so-called curse of dimensionality) for accurate
analysis of hyperspectral images. Feature extraction, as a vibrant field of
research in the hyperspectral community, evolved through decades of research to
address this issue and extract informative features suitable for data
representation and classification. The advances in feature extraction have been
inspired by two fields of research, including the popularization of image and
signal processing as well as machine (deep) learning, leading to two types of
feature extraction approaches named shallow and deep techniques. This article
outlines the advances in feature extraction approaches for hyperspectral
imagery by providing a technical overview of the state-of-the-art techniques,
providing useful entry points for researchers at different levels, including
students, researchers, and senior researchers, willing to explore novel
investigations on this challenging topic. % by supplying a rich amount of
detail and references. In more detail, this paper provides a bird's eye view
over shallow (both supervised and unsupervised) and deep feature extraction
approaches specifically dedicated to the topic of hyperspectral feature
extraction and its application on hyperspectral image classification.
Additionally, this paper compares 15 advanced techniques with an emphasis on
their methodological foundations in terms of classification accuracies.

\\
  Despite the recent progress of fully-supervised action segmentation
techniques, the performance is still not fully satisfactory. One main challenge
is the problem of spatiotemporal variations (e.g. different people may perform
the same activity in various ways). Therefore, we exploit unlabeled videos to
address this problem by reformulating the action segmentation task as a
cross-domain problem with domain discrepancy caused by spatio-temporal
variations. To reduce the discrepancy, we propose Self-Supervised Temporal
Domain Adaptation (SSTDA), which contains two self-supervised auxiliary tasks
(binary and sequential domain prediction) to jointly align cross-domain feature
spaces embedded with local and global temporal dynamics, achieving better
performance than other Domain Adaptation (DA) approaches. On three challenging
benchmark datasets (GTEA, 50Salads, and Breakfast), SSTDA outperforms the
current state-of-the-art method by large margins (e.g. for the F1@25 score,
from 59.6% to 69.1% on Breakfast, from 73.4% to 81.5% on 50Salads, and from
83.6% to 89.1% on GTEA), and requires only 65% of the labeled training data for
comparable performance, demonstrating the usefulness of adapting to unlabeled
target videos across variations. The source code is available at

  Systems incorporating biometric technologies have become ubiquitous in
personal, commercial, and governmental identity management applications. Both
cooperative (e.g. access control) and non-cooperative (e.g. surveillance and
forensics) systems have benefited from biometrics. Such systems rely on the
uniqueness of certain biological or behavioural characteristics of human
beings, which enable for individuals to be reliably recognised using automated
algorithms.
  Recently, however, there has been a wave of public and academic concerns
regarding the existence of systemic bias in automated decision systems
(including biometrics). Most prominently, face recognition algorithms have
often been labelled as "racist" or "biased" by the media, non-governmental
organisations, and researchers alike.
  The main contributions of this article are: (1) an overview of the topic of
algorithmic bias in the context of biometrics, (2) a comprehensive survey of
the existing literature on biometric bias estimation and mitigation, (3) a
discussion of the pertinent technical and social matters, and (4) an outline of
the remaining challenges and future work items, both from technological and
social points of view.

data scraped from Scopus to explore and quantify trends in publications on A.I.
topics from institutions affiliated with each country. We find the total volume

over tens of years. While China initially experienced faster growth in
publication volume than the U.S., growth slowed in China when it reached parity
with the U.S. and the growth rates of both countries are now similar. We also
see both countries undergo a seismic shift in topic choice around 1990, and
connect this to an explosion of interest in neural network methods. Finally, we
see evidence that between 2000 and 2010, China's topic choice tended to lag
that of the U.S. but that in recent decades the topic portfolios have come into
closer alignment.

Comments: SIGMOD'20 version + Appendix
\\
  We present the High-speed Order-Preserving Encoder (HOPE) for in-memory
search trees. HOPE is a fast dictionary-based compressor that encodes arbitrary
keys while preserving their order. HOPE's approach is to identify common key
patterns at a fine granularity and exploit the entropy to achieve high
compression rates with a small dictionary. We first develop a theoretical model
to reason about order-preserving dictionary designs. We then select six
representative compression schemes using this model and implement them in HOPE.
These schemes make different trade-offs between compression rate and encoding
speed. We evaluate HOPE on five data structures used in databases: SuRF, ART,
HOT, B+tree, and Prefix B+tree. Our experiments show that using HOPE allows the
search trees to achieve lower query latency (up to 40\% lower) and better
memory efficiency (up to 30\% smaller) simultaneously for most string key
workloads.

Categories: cs.DB cs.AI
\\
  Querying on big data is a challenging task due to the rapid growth of data

fast response. In this paper, we propose a learning-based AQP method called the
LAQP. The LAQP builds an error model learned from the historical queries to
predict the sampling-based estimation error of each new query. It makes a
combination of the sampling-based AQP, the pre-computed aggregations and the
learned error model to provide high-accurate query estimations with a small
off-line sample. The experimental results indicate that our LAQP outperforms
the sampling-based AQP, the pre-aggregation-based AQP and the most recent
learning-based AQP method.

Title: Efficient and Effective Similar Subtrajectory Search with Deep

Authors: Zheng Wang, Cheng Long, Gao Cong, Yiding Liu
Categories: cs.DB cs.LG
\\
  Similar trajectory search is a fundamental problem and has been well studied
over the past two decades. However, the similar subtrajectory search (SimSub)
problem, aiming to return a portion of a trajectory (i.e., a subtrajectory)
which is the most similar to a query trajectory, has been mostly disregarded
despite that it could capture trajectory similarity in a finer-grained way and
many applications take subtrajectories as basic units for analysis. In this
paper, we study the SimSub problem and develop a suite of algorithms including
both exact and approximate ones. Among those approximate algorithms, two that
are based on deep reinforcement learning stand out and outperform those
non-learning based algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. We
conduct experiments on real-world trajectory datasets, which verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

Title: Constant-Delay Enumeration for Nondeterministic Document Spanners
Authors: Antoine Amarilli, Pierre Bourhis, Stefan Mengel, Matthias Niewerth
Categories: cs.DB cs.IR
Comments: 29 pages. Submitted. Extended version of arXiv:1807.09320
\\
  We consider the information extraction framework known as document spanners,
and study the problem of efficiently computing the results of the extraction
from an input document, where the extraction task is described as a sequential
variable-set automaton (VA). We pose this problem in the setting of enumeration
algorithms, where we can first run a preprocessing phase and must then produce
the results with a small delay between any two consecutive results. Our goal is
to have an algorithm which is tractable in combined complexity, i.e., in the
sizes of the input document and the VA; while ensuring the best possible data
complexity bounds in the input document size, i.e., constant delay in the
document size. Several recent works at PODS'18 proposed such algorithms but
with linear delay in the document size or with an exponential dependency in
size of the (generally nondeterministic) input VA. In particular, Florenzano et
al. suggest that our desired runtime guarantees cannot be met for general
sequential VAs. We refute this and show that, given a nondeterministic
sequential VA and an input document, we can enumerate the mappings of the VA on
the document with the following bounds: the preprocessing is linear in the
document size and polynomial in the size of the VA, and the delay is
independent of the document and polynomial in the size of the VA. The resulting
algorithm thus achieves tractability in combined complexity and the best
possible data complexity bounds. Moreover, it is rather easy to describe, in
particular for the restricted case of so-called extended VAs. Finally, we
evaluate our algorithm empirically using a prototype implementation.

Title: Que Sera Consensus: Simple Asynchronous Agreement with Private Coins and
  Threshold Logical Clocks
Authors: Bryan Ford, Philipp Jovanovic, Ewa Syta
Categories: cs.DC cs.DS cs.NI
Comments: 6 algorithms
\\
  It is commonly held that asynchronous consensus is much more complex,
difficult, and costly than partially-synchronous algorithms, especially without
using common coins. This paper challenges that conventional wisdom with que
sera consensus QSC, an approach to consensus that cleanly decomposes the
agreement problem from that of network asynchrony. QSC uses only private coins
and reaches consensus in $O(1)$ expected communication rounds. It relies on
"lock-step" synchronous broadcast, but can run atop a threshold logical clock
(TLC) algorithm to time and pace partially-reliable communication atop an
underlying asynchronous network. This combination is arguably simpler than
partially-synchronous consensus approaches like (Multi-)Paxos or Raft with
leader election, and is more robust to slow leaders or targeted network
denial-of-service attacks. The simplest formulations of QSC atop TLC incur
expected $O(n^2)$ messages and $O(n^4)$ bits per agreement, or $O(n^3)$ bits
with straightforward optimizations. An on-demand implementation, in which
clients act as "natural leaders" to execute the protocol atop stateful servers
that merely implement passive key-value stores, can achieve $O(n^2)$ expected
communication bits per client-driven agreement.

\\
  The University of California system has excellent networking between all of
its campuses as well as a number of other Universities in CA, including
Caltech, most of them being connected at 100 Gbps. UCSD and Caltech have thus
joined their disk systems into a single logical xcache system, with worker
nodes from both sites accessing data from disks at either site. This setup has
been in place for a couple years now and has shown to work very well.
Coherently managing nodes at multiple physical locations has however not been
trivial, and we have been looking for ways to improve operations. With the
Pacific Research Platform (PRP) now providing a Kubernetes resource pool
spanning resources in the science DMZs of all the UC campuses, we have recently
migrated the xcache services from being hosted bare-metal into containers. This
paper presents our experience in both migrating to and operating in the new
environment.

\\
  Feature tracking and the visualizations of the resulting trajectories make it
possible to derive insights from scientific data and thus reduce the amount of
data to be stored. However, existing serial methods are not scalable enough to
handle fast increasing data size. In this paper, we tackle the problem of
distributed parallelism for feature tracking and visualization by introducing a
scalable, asynchronous union-find algorithm. We show that asynchronous
communication can improve the scalability of distributed union-find operation
in comparison to synchronous communication, as seen in existing methods. In the
proposed feature tracking pipeline, we first construct and partition a
high-dimensional mesh that incorporates both space and time. Then, the
trajectories of features are built distributively across parallel processes,
and trajectory pieces are merged asynchronously by using our distributed
union-find implementation. Results demonstrate the scalability of tracking
critical points on exploding wire experimental data and tracking super level
sets on BOUT++ fusion plasma simulations.

Title: Ordering Chaos: Memory-Aware Scheduling of Irregularly Wired Neural
  Networks for Edge Devices
Authors: Byung Hoon Ahn, Jinwon Lee, Jamie Menjay Lin, Hsin-Pai Cheng, Jilei
  Hou, Hadi Esmaeilzadeh
Categories: cs.DC cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Published as a conference paper at MLSys 2020 (Oral Presentation)
\\
  Recent advances demonstrate that irregularly wired neural networks from
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Random Wiring can not only automate the
design of deep neural networks but also emit models that outperform previous
manual designs. These designs are especially effective while designing neural
architectures under hard resource constraints (memory, MACs, . . . ) which
highlights the importance of this class of designing neural networks. However,
such a move creates complication in the previously streamlined pattern of
execution. In fact one of the main challenges is that the order of such nodes
in the neural network significantly effects the memory footprint of the
intermediate activations. Current compilers do not schedule with regard to
activation memory footprint that it significantly increases its peak compared
to the optimum, rendering it not applicable for edge devices. To address this
standing issue, we present a memory-aware compiler, dubbed SERENITY, that
utilizes dynamic programming to find a sequence that finds a schedule with
optimal memory footprint. Our solution also comprises of graph rewriting
technique that allows further reduction beyond the optimum. As such, SERENITY
achieves optimal peak memory, and the graph rewriting technique further
improves this resulting in 1.68x improvement with dynamic programming-based
scheduler and 1.86x with graph rewriting, against TensorFlow Lite with less
than one minute overhead.

\\
  Smart devices have become an indispensable part of our lives and gain
increasing applicability in almost every area. Latency-aware applications such
as Augmented Reality (AR), autonomous driving, and online gaming demand more
resources such as network bandwidth and computational capabilities. Since the
traditional mobile networks cannot fulfill the required bandwidth and latency,
Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) emerged to provide cloud computing capabilities in the
proximity of users on 5G networks. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous
MEC network with numerous mobile users that send their tasks to MEC servers.
Each task has a maximum acceptable response time. Non-uniform distribution of
users makes some MEC servers hotspots that cannot take more. A solution is to
relocate the tasks among MEC servers, called Workload Migration. We formulate
this problem of task scheduling as a mixed-integer non-linear optimization
problem to minimize the number of Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations.
Since solving this optimization problem has high computational complexity, we
introduce a greedy algorithm called MESA, Migration Enabled Scheduling
Algorithm, which reaches a near-optimal solution quickly. Our experiments show
that in the term of SLA violation, MESA is only 8% and 11% far from the optimal
choice on the average and the worst-case, respectively. Moreover, the migration
enabled solution can reduce SLA violations by about 30% compare to assigning
tasks to MEC servers without migration.

Title: An Inverse Olympic Medal Tally Transformation for Optimal Lane-level
  Road Network Path Traversal
Authors: Dennis Luxen
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Lane-level traversal of (almost) arbitrary input paths is a common problem in
the mapping industry. This paper considers the problem of generating
\emph{feasible} and maximally convenient lane-level path traversals. The
presented approach exploits a graph transformation of an input path which is
subsequentially explored by a multi-criteria search algorithm. This approach is
able to yield paths traversals that are guaranteed to obey lane crossing rules
whenever possible, and minimize the number of legal, yet inconvenient lane
crossings along any given input path.

  Lempel-Ziv is an easy-to-compute member of a wide family of so-called macro
schemes; it restricts pointers to go in one direction only. Optimal
bidirectional macro schemes are NP-complete to find, but they may provide much
better compression on highly repetitive sequences. We consider the problem of
approximating optimal bidirectional macro schemes. We describe a simulated
annealing algorithm that usually converges quickly. Moreover, in some cases, we
obtain bidirectional macro schemes that are provably a 2-approximation of the
optimal. We test our algorithm on a number of artificial repetitive texts and
verify that it is efficient in practice and outperforms Lempel-Ziv, sometimes
by a wide margin.

Title: Fast Noise Removal for $k$-Means Clustering
Authors: Sungjin Im, Mahshid Montazer Qaem, Benjamin Moseley, Xiaorui Sun, Rudy
  Zhou
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: Published in AISTATS 2020
\\
  This paper considers $k$-means clustering in the presence of noise. It is
known that $k$-means clustering is highly sensitive to noise, and thus noise
should be removed to obtain a quality solution. A popular formulation of this
problem is called $k$-means clustering with outliers. The goal of $k$-means
clustering with outliers is to discard up to a specified number $z$ of points
as noise/outliers and then find a $k$-means solution on the remaining data. The
problem has received significant attention, yet current algorithms with
theoretical guarantees suffer from either high running time or inherent loss in
the solution quality. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly,
we develop a simple greedy algorithm that has provably strong worst case
guarantees. The greedy algorithm adds a simple preprocessing step to remove
noise, which can be combined with any $k$-means clustering algorithm. This
algorithm gives the first pseudo-approximation-preserving reduction from
$k$-means with outliers to $k$-means without outliers. Secondly, we show how to
construct a coreset of size $O(k \log n)$. When combined with our greedy
algorithm, we obtain a scalable, near linear time algorithm. The theoretical
contributions are verified experimentally by demonstrating that the algorithm
quickly removes noise and obtains a high-quality clustering.

Title: Optimal Discretization is Fixed-parameter Tractable
Authors: Stefan Kratsch and Tom\'a\v{s} Masa\v{r}\'ik and Irene Muzi and Marcin
  Pilipczuk and Manuel Sorge
Categories: cs.DS cs.CG cs.DM
\\
  Given two disjoint sets $W_1$ and $W_2$ of points in the plane, the Optimal
Discretization problem asks for the minimum size of a family of horizontal and
vertical lines that separate $W_1$ from $W_2$, that is, in every region into
which the lines partition the plane there are either only points of $W_1$, or
only points of $W_2$, or the region is empty. Equivalently, Optimal
Discretization can be phrased as a task of discretizing continuous variables:
we would like to discretize the range of $x$-coordinates and the range of
$y$-coordinates into as few segments as possible, maintaining that no pair of
points from $W_1 \times W_2$ are projected onto the same pair of segments under
this discretization.
  We provide a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem, parameterized by the
number of lines in the solution. Our algorithm works in time $2^{O(k^2 \log k)}
n^{O(1)}$, where $k$ is the bound on the number of lines to find and $n$ is the
number of points in the input.
  Our result answers in positive a question of Bonnet, Giannopolous, and Lampis
[IPEC 2017] and of Froese (PhD thesis, 2018) and is in contrast with the known
intractability of two closely related generalizations: the Rectangle Stabbing
problem and the generalization in which the selected lines are not required to
be axis-parallel.

Title: Parameterized Algorithms for Generalizations of Directed Feedback Vertex
  Set
Authors: Alexander G\"oke, D\'aniel Marx, Matthias Mnich
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  The Directed Feedback Vertex Set (DFVS) problem takes as input a directed
graph~$G$ and seeks a smallest vertex set~$S$ that hits all cycles in $G$. This
is one of Karp's 21 $\mathsf{NP}$-complete problems. Resolving the
parameterized complexity status of DFVS was a long-standing open problem until
Chen et al. [STOC 2008, J. ACM 2008] showed its fixed-parameter tractability
via a $4^kk! n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time algorithm, where $k = |S|$.
  Here we show fixed-parameter tractability of two generalizations of DFVS:
  - Find a smallest vertex set $S$ such that every strong component of $G - S$
has size at most~$s$: we give an algorithm solving this problem in time
$4^k(ks+k+s)!\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. This generalizes an algorithm by Xiao
[JCSS 2017] for the undirected version of the problem.
  - Find a smallest vertex set $S$ such that every non-trivial strong component
of $G - S$ is 1-out-regular: we give an algorithm solving this problem in time
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k^3)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$.
  We also solve the corresponding arc versions of these problems by
fixed-parameter algorithms.

Title: Simple and Fast Algorithm for Binary Integer and Online Linear
  Programming
Authors: Xiaocheng Li, Chunlin Sun, Yinyu Ye
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  In this paper, we develop a simple and fast online algorithm for solving a
general class of binary integer linear programs (LPs). The algorithm requires
only one single pass through the input data and is free of doing any matrix
inversion. It can be viewed as both an approximate algorithm for solving binary
integer LPs and a fast algorithm for solving online LP problems. The algorithm
is inspired by an equivalent form of the dual problem of the relaxed LP and it
essentially performs projected stochastic subgradient descent in the dual
space. We analyze the algorithm in two different models, stochastic input model
and random permutation model, with minimal assumptions on the input of the LP.
The algorithm achieves $O\left(m^2 \sqrt{n}\right)$ expected regret under the
stochastic input model and $O\left((m^2+\log n)\sqrt{n}\right)$ expected regret
under the random permutation model, and it achieves $O(m \sqrt{n})$ expected
constraint violation under both models, where $n$ is the number of decision
variables and $m$ is the number of constraints. Furthermore, the algorithm is
generalized to a multi-dimensional LP setting which covers a wider range of
applications and features for the same performance guarantee. Numerical
experiments illustrate the general applicability and the performance of the
algorithms.

Title: Deep Learning in Memristive Nanowire Networks
Authors: Jack D. Kendall, Ross D. Pantone, and Juan C. Nino
Categories: cs.ET cs.AI
\\
  Analog crossbar architectures for accelerating neural network training and
inference have made tremendous progress over the past several years. These
architectures are ideal for dense layers with fewer than roughly a thousand
neurons. However, for large sparse layers, crossbar architectures are highly
inefficient. A new hardware architecture, dubbed the MN3 (Memristive Nanowire
Neural Network), was recently described as an efficient architecture for
simulating very wide, sparse neural network layers, on the order of millions of
neurons per layer. The MN3 utilizes a high-density memristive nanowire mesh to
efficiently connect large numbers of silicon neurons with modifiable weights.
Here, in order to explore the MN3's ability to function as a deep neural
network, we describe one algorithm for training deep MN3 models and benchmark
simulations of the architecture on two deep learning tasks. We utilize a simple
piecewise linear memristor model, since we seek to demonstrate that training
is, in principle, possible for randomized nanowire architectures. In future
work, we intend on utilizing more realistic memristor models, and we will adapt
the presented algorithm appropriately. We show that the MN3 is capable of
performing composition, gradient propagation, and weight updates, which
together allow it to function as a deep neural network. We show that a
simulated multilayer perceptron (MLP), built from MN3 networks, can obtain a
1.61% error rate on the popular MNIST dataset, comparable to equivalently sized
software-based network. This work represents, to the authors' knowledge, the
first randomized nanowire architecture capable of reproducing the
backpropagation algorithm.

Title: What is affordance theory and how can it be used in communication
  research?
Authors: Sorin Adam Matei
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Affordance theory proposes that the use of an object is intrinsically
determined by its physical shape. However, when translated to digital objects,
affordance theory loses explanatory power, as the same physical affordances,
for example, screens, can have many socially constructed meanings and can be
used in many ways. Furthermore, the affordance theory core idea that physical
affordances have intrinsic, pre-cognitive meaning cannot be sustained for the
highly symbolic nature of digital affordances, which gain meaning through
social learning and use. A possible way to solve this issue is to think about
on-screen affordances as symbols and affordance research as a semiotic and
linguistic enterprise.

Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, ACM IUI 2020
\\
  The continued improvements in the predictive accuracy of machine learning
models have allowed for their widespread practical application. Yet, many
decisions made with seemingly accurate models still require verification by
domain experts. In addition, end-users of a model also want to understand the
reasons behind specific decisions. Thus, the need for interpretability is
increasingly paramount. In this paper we present an interactive visual
analytics tool, ViCE, that generates counterfactual explanations to
contextualize and evaluate model decisions. Each sample is assessed to identify
the minimal set of changes needed to flip the model's output. These
explanations aim to provide end-users with personalized actionable insights
with which to understand, and possibly contest or improve, automated decisions.
The results are effectively displayed in a visual interface where
counterfactual explanations are highlighted and interactive methods are
provided for users to explore the data and model. The functionality of the tool
is demonstrated by its application to a home equity line of credit dataset.

\\
  Conversational interfaces are currently on the rise: more and more
applications rely on a chat-like interaction pattern to increase their
acceptability and to improve user experience. Also in the area of questionnaire
design and administration, interaction design is increasingly looked at as an
important ingredient of a digital solution. For those reasons, we designed and
developed a conversational survey tool to administer questionnaires with a
colloquial form through a chat-like Web interface.
  In this paper, we present the evaluation results of our approach, taking into
account both the user point of view - by assessing user acceptance and
preferences in terms of survey compilation experience - and the survey design
perspective - by investigating the effectiveness of a conversational survey in
comparison to a traditional questionnaire. We show that users clearly
appreciate the conversational form and prefer it over a traditional approach
and that, from a data collection point of view, the conversational method shows
the same reliability and a higher response quality with respect to a
traditional questionnaire.

  In this work, we propose the use of a Natural User Interface (NUI) through

dynamic and intuitive way to control a drone. For the implementation, we use
the Robotic Operative System (ROS) to control and manage the different
components of the project. Wrapped inside ROS, OpenPose (OP) processes the
video obtained in real-time by a commercial drone, allowing to obtain the
user's pose. Finally, the keypoints from OpenPose are obtained and translated,
using geometric constraints, to specify high-level commands to the drone.
Real-time experiments validate the full strategy.

  Recommender systems (RS) play a very important role in various aspects of
people's online life. Many companies leverage RS to help users discover new and
favored items. Despite their empirical success, these systems still suffer from
two main problems: data noise and data sparsity. In recent years, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) have received a surge of interests in many fields
because of their great potential to learn complex real data distribution, and
they also provide new means to mitigate the aforementioned problems of RS.
Particularly, owing to adversarial learning, the problem of data noise can be
handled by adding adversarial perturbations or forcing discriminators to tell
the informative and uninformative data examples apart. As for the mitigation of
data sparsity issue, the GAN-based models are able to replicate the real
distribution of the user-item interactions and augment the available data. To
gain a comprehensive understanding of these GAN-based recommendation models, we
provide a retrospective of these studies and organize them from a
problem-driven perspective. Specifically, we propose a taxonomy of these
models, along with a detailed description of them and their advantages.
Finally, we elaborate on several open issues and expand on current trends in
the GAN-based RS.

Title: Hadath: From Social Media Mapping to Multi-Resolution Event-Enriched
  Maps
Authors: Faizan Ur Rehman, Imad Afyouni, Ahmed Lbath, Saleh Basalamah

\\
  Publicly available data is increasing rapidly, and will continue to grow with
the advancement of technologies in sensors, smartphones and the Internet of
Things. Data from multiple sources can improve coverage and provide more
relevant knowledge about surrounding events and points of Interest. The
strength of one source of data can compensate for the shortcomings of another
source by providing supplementary information. Maps are also getting popular
day-by-day and people are using it to achieve their daily task smoothly and
efficiently. Starting from paper maps hundred years ago, multiple type of maps
are available with point of interest, real-time traffic update or displaying
micro-blogs from social media. In this paper, we introduce Hadath, a system
that displays multi-resolution live events of interest from a variety of
available data sources. The system has been designed to be able to handle
multiple type of inputs by encapsulating incoming unstructured data into
generic data packets. System extracts local events of interest from generic
data packets and identify their spatio-temporal scope to display such events on
a map, so that as a user changes the zoom level, only events of appropriate
scope are displayed. This allows us to show live events in correspondence to
the scale of view - when viewing at a city scale, we see events of higher
significance, while zooming in to a neighbourhood, events of a more local
interest are highlighted. The final output creates a unique and dynamic map
browsing experience. Finally, to validate our proposed system, we conducted
experiments on social media data.

Title: MEC-enhanced Information Freshness for Safety-critical C-V2X
  Communications
Authors: Mustafa Emara, Miltiades C. Filippou, Dario Sabella
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Accepted at ICC 2020, CLEEN workshop
\\
  Information freshness is a status update timeliness indicator of utmost
importance to several real-time applications, such as connected and autonomous
driving. The Ageof- Information (AoI) metric is widely considered as useful to
quantify the information freshness of delivered messages to the involved
entities. Recently, the advent of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) promises
several performance benefits for Vehicular-to-Everything (V2X) communications,
emphasizing on the experienced End-to-End (E2E) message delay. In this paper,
we argue that, when it comes to safety-critical use cases, such as the one of
Vulnerable Road User (VRU), additional metrics can be more insightful to
evaluate and address scalability issues in dense urban environments. In
particular, the impact of the packet inter-arrival time on the timeliness of
VRU messages arriving at nearby vehicles can be directly assessed by exploiting
the AoI metric. For that purpose, assuming a MEC-enabled multi-VRU system
setting, we model the AoI and, by means of a performance comparison to the
state-of-the-art network architecture based on numerical evaluations, we
provide evidence of the information freshness and system scalability
enhancements offered by MEC infrastructure deployment for different system
parameter settings involving a large number of connected entities.

Title: Overhead-Aware Design of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Smart
  Radio Environments
Authors: Alessio Zappone, Marco Di Renzo, Farshad Shams, Xuewen Qian, Merouane
  Debbah
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces have emerged as a promising technology
for future wireless networks. Given that a large number of reflecting elements
is typically used, and that the surface has no signal processing capabilities,
a major challenge is to cope with the overhead that is required to estimate the
channel state information and to report the optimized phase shifts to the
surface. This issue has not been addressed by previous works, which do not
explicitly consider the overhead during the resource allocation phase. This
work aims at filling this gap, developing an overhead-aware resource allocation
framework for wireless networks where reconfigurable intelligent surfaces are
used to improve the communication performance. An overhead model is developed
and incorporated in the expressions of the system rate and energy efficiencies,
which are then optimized with respect to the phase shifts of the reconfigurable
intelligent surface, the transmit and receive filters, and the power and
bandwidth used for the communication and feedback phases. The bi-objective
maximization of the rate and energy efficiency is carried out as well. The
proposed framework allows characterizing the trade-off between optimized radio
resources and the related overhead in networks with reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces.

Title: Unsupervised Neural Universal Denoiser for Finite-Input General-Output
  Noisy Channel

Comments: 17 pages, 7 figures, Proceedings of the 23rdInternational Conference
  on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2020
\\
  We devise a novel neural network-based universal denoiser for the
finite-input, general-output (FIGO) channel. Based on the assumption of known
noisy channel densities, which is realistic in many practical scenarios, we
train the network such that it can denoise as well as the best sliding window
denoiser for any given underlying clean source data. Our algorithm, dubbed as
Generalized CUDE (Gen-CUDE), enjoys several desirable properties; it can be
trained in an unsupervised manner (solely based on the noisy observation data),
has much smaller computational complexity compared to the previously developed
universal denoiser for the same setting, and has much tighter upper bound on
the denoising performance, which is obtained by a theoretical analysis. In our
experiments, we show such tighter upper bound is also realized in practice by
showing that Gen-CUDE achieves much better denoising results compared to other
strong baselines for both synthetic and real underlying clean sequences.

Title: Optimizing Joint Probabilistic Caching and Channel Access for Clustered
  {D2D} Networks
Authors: Ramy Amer and M. Majid Butt and Nicola Marchetti

Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1810.05510
\\
  Caching at mobile devices and leveraging device-to-device (D2D) communication
are two promising approaches to support massive content delivery over wireless
networks. Analysis of such D2D caching networks based on a physical
interference model is usually carried out by assuming uniformly distributed
devices. However, this approach does not capture the notion of device
clustering. In this regard, this paper proposes a joint communication and
caching optimization framework for clustered D2D networks. Devices are
spatially distributed into disjoint clusters and are assumed to have a surplus
memory that is utilized to proactively cache files, following a random
probabilistic caching scheme. The cache offloading gain is maximized by jointly
optimizing channel access and caching scheme. A closed-form caching solution is
obtained and bisection search method is adopted to heuristically obtain the
optimal channel access probability. Results show significant improvement in the
offloading gain reaching up to 10% compared to the Zipf caching baseline.

\\
  Internet of things (IoT) devices are becoming increasingly popular thanks to
many new services and applications they offer. However, in addition to their
many benefits, they raise privacy concerns since they share fine-grained
time-series user data with untrusted third parties. In this work, we study the
privacy-utility trade-off (PUT) in time-series data sharing. Existing
approaches to PUT mainly focus on a single data point; however, temporal
correlations in time-series data introduce new challenges. Methods that
preserve the privacy for the current time may leak significant amount of
information at the trace level as the adversary can exploit temporal
correlations in a trace. We consider sharing the distorted version of a user's
true data sequence with an untrusted third party. We measure the privacy
leakage by the mutual information between the user's true data sequence and
shared version. We consider both instantaneous and average distortion between
the two sequences, under a given distortion measure, as the utility loss
metric. To tackle the history-dependent mutual information minimization, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and solve it using
asynchronous actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (RL). We apply our
optimal data release policies to location trace privacy scenario, and evaluate
the performance of the proposed policy numerically.

Title: WGAN-based Autoencoder Training Over-the-air
Authors: Sebastian D\"orner, Marcus Henninger, Sebastian Cammerer, Stephan ten
  Brink
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: Submitted to IEEE SPAWC
\\
  The practical realization of end-to-end training of communication systems is
fundamentally limited by its accessibility of the channel gradient. To overcome
this major burden, the idea of generative adversarial networks (GANs) that
learn to mimic the actual channel behavior has been recently proposed in the
literature. Contrarily to handcrafted classical channel modeling, which can
never fully capture the real world, GANs promise, in principle, the ability to
learn any physical impairment, enabled by the data-driven learning algorithm.
In this work, we verify the concept of GAN-based autoencoder training in actual
over-the-air (OTA) measurements. To improve training stability, we first extend
the concept to conditional Wasserstein GANs and embed it into a
state-of-the-art autoencoder-architecture, including bitwise estimates and an
outer channel code. Further, in the same framework, we compare the existing
three different training approaches: model-based pre-training with receiver
finetuning, reinforcement learning (RL) and GAN-based channel modeling. For
this, we show advantages and limitations of GAN-based end-to-end training. In
particular, for non-linear effects, it turns out that learning the whole
exploration space becomes prohibitively complex. Finally, we show that the
training strategy benefits from a simpler (training) data acquisition when
compared to RL-based training, which requires continuous transmitter weight
updates. This becomes an important practical bottleneck due to limited
bandwidth and latency between transmitter and training algorithm that may even
operate at physically different locations.

Title: Deep Learning Approach to Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
Authors: Borys Tymchenko, Philip Marchenko and Dmitry Spodarets
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most threatening complications of diabetes
that leads to permanent blindness if left untreated. One of the essential
challenges is early detection, which is very important for treatment success.
Unfortunately, the exact identification of the diabetic retinopathy stage is
notoriously tricky and requires expert human interpretation of fundus images.
Simplification of the detection step is crucial and can help millions of
people. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully applied in
many adjacent subjects, and for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy itself.
However, the high cost of big labeled datasets, as well as inconsistency
between different doctors, impede the performance of these methods. In this
paper, we propose an automatic deep-learning-based method for stage detection
of diabetic retinopathy by single photography of the human fundus.
Additionally, we propose the multistage approach to transfer learning, which
makes use of similar datasets with different labeling. The presented method can
be used as a screening method for early detection of diabetic retinopathy with
sensitivity and specificity of 0.99 and is ranked 54 of 2943 competing methods
(quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.925466) on APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection
Dataset (13000 images).

Title: Bandits with adversarial scaling
Authors: Thodoris Lykouris, Vahab Mirrokni, Renato Paes Leme
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.GT stat.ML
\\
  We study "adversarial scaling", a multi-armed bandit model where rewards have
a stochastic and an adversarial component. Our model captures display
advertising where the "click-through-rate" can be decomposed to a (fixed across
time) arm-quality component and a non-stochastic user-relevance component
(fixed across arms). Despite the relative stochasticity of our model, we
demonstrate two settings where most bandit algorithms suffer. On the positive
side, we show that two algorithms, one from the action elimination and one from
the mirror descent family are adaptive enough to be robust to adversarial
scaling. Our results shed light on the robustness of adaptive parameter
selection in stochastic bandits, which may be of independent interest.

Title: Reduced Dilation-Erosion Perceptron for Binary Classification
Authors: Marcos Eduardo Valle
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Dilation and erosion are two elementary operations from mathematical
morphology, a non-linear lattice computing methodology widely used for image
processing and analysis. The dilation-erosion perceptron (DEP) is a
morphological neural network obtained by a convex combination of a dilation and
an erosion followed by the application of a hard-limiter function for binary
classification tasks. A DEP classifier can be trained using a convex-concave
procedure along with the minimization of the hinge loss function. As a lattice
computing model, the DEP classifier assumes the feature and class spaces are
partially ordered sets. In many practical situations, however, there is no
natural ordering for the feature patterns. Using concepts from multi-valued
mathematical morphology, this paper introduces the reduced dilation-erosion
(r-DEP) classifier. An r-DEP classifier is obtained by endowing the feature
space with an appropriate reduced ordering. Such reduced ordering can be
determined using two approaches: One based on an ensemble of support vector
classifiers (SVCs) with different kernels and the other based on a bagging of
similar SVCs trained using different samples of the training set. Using several
binary classification datasets from the OpenML repository, the ensemble and
bagging r-DEP classifiers yielded in mean higher balanced accuracy scores than
the linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) SVCs as well as their
ensemble and a bagging of RBF SVCs.

Title: On the Learning Property of Logistic and Softmax Losses for Deep Neural
  Networks

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: AAAI2020. Previously this appeared as arXiv:1906.04026v2, which was
  submitted as a replacement by accident
\\
  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with logistic and softmax
losses have made significant advancement in visual recognition tasks in
computer vision. When training data exhibit class imbalances, the class-wise
reweighted version of logistic and softmax losses are often used to boost
performance of the unweighted version. In this paper, motivated to explain the
reweighting mechanism, we explicate the learning property of those two loss
functions by analyzing the necessary condition (e.g., gradient equals to zero)
after training CNNs to converge to a local minimum. The analysis immediately
provides us explanations for understanding (1) quantitative effects of the
class-wise reweighting mechanism: deterministic effectiveness for binary
classification using logistic loss yet indeterministic for multi-class
classification using softmax loss; (2) disadvantage of logistic loss for
single-label multi-class classification via one-vs.-all approach, which is due
to the averaging effect on predicted probabilities for the negative class
(e.g., non-target classes) in the learning process. With the disadvantage and
advantage of logistic loss disentangled, we thereafter propose a novel
reweighted logistic loss for multi-class classification. Our simple yet
effective formulation improves ordinary logistic loss by focusing on learning
hard non-target classes (target vs. non-target class in one-vs.-all) and turned
out to be competitive with softmax loss. We evaluate our method on several
benchmark datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Title: mmFall: Fall Detection using 4D MmWave Radar and Variational Recurrent
  Autoencoder
Authors: Feng Jin, Arindam Sengupta, and Siyang Cao
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering
\\
  Elderly fall prevention and detection is extremely crucial especially with
the fast aging society. In this paper, we propose mmFall, a novel system for
fall detection. In terms of sensing modality, we adopt the emerging
millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensor to collect the point cloud of a moving
human body along with its estimated centroid. In terms of detection
methodology, we propose a variational recurrent autoencoder (VRAE) model to
monitor the motion anomaly level, and claim a fall detection when two
conditions meet simultaneously, viz. (i) a anomaly level spike and (ii) a
sudden drop of body's centroid height. The mmWave radar sensor provides
advantages, such as privacy-compliance and high sensitivity to motion, over the
traditional sensing modalities. To overcome the difficulties in machine
learning using radar due to the data randomness, the VRAE uses variational
inference, a probabilistic approach rather than deterministic approach, to
infer the posterior probability of latent motion state at every frame, followed
by a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn the temporal features of the
motion over multiple frames. Moreover, to circumvent the difficulties in fall
data collection and labeling in the traditional fall detection research, the
VRAE is built upon an autoencoder architecture, a semisupervised approach, and
trained with only normal activities of daily living (ADL) such that in the
inference stage the VRAE will generate a spike in the anomaly level once an
abnormal motion, such as fall, occurs. During the experiment, we implemented
the VRAE along with two other baselines, and tested on the dataset collected in
an apartment. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicates that
our proposed model outperforms the other two baselines, and achieves 98%
detection out of 50 falls at expense of just 2 false alarms.

Title: Comparing Rewinding and Fine-tuning in Neural Network Pruning
Authors: Alex Renda, Jonathan Frankle, Michael Carbin
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Journal-ref: ICLR 2020
\\
  Many neural network pruning algorithms proceed in three steps: train the
network to completion, remove unwanted structure to compress the network, and
retrain the remaining structure to recover lost accuracy. The standard
retraining technique, fine-tuning, trains the unpruned weights from their final
trained values using a small fixed learning rate. In this paper, we compare
fine-tuning to alternative retraining techniques. Weight rewinding (as proposed
by Frankle et al., (2019)), rewinds unpruned weights to their values from
earlier in training and retrains them from there using the original training
schedule. Learning rate rewinding (which we propose) trains the unpruned
weights from their final values using the same learning rate schedule as weight
rewinding. Both rewinding techniques outperform fine-tuning, forming the basis
of a network-agnostic pruning algorithm that matches the accuracy and
compression ratios of several more network-specific state-of-the-art
techniques.

Title: TIME: A Transparent, Interpretable, Model-Adaptive and Explainable
  Neural Network for Dynamic Physical Processes
Authors: Gurpreet Singh, Soumyajit Gupta, Matt Lease, Clint N. Dawson
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Partial Differential Equations are infinite dimensional encoded
representations of physical processes. However, imbibing multiple observation
data towards a coupled representation presents significant challenges. We
present a fully convolutional architecture that captures the invariant
structure of the domain to reconstruct the observable system. The proposed
architecture is significantly low-weight compared to other networks for such
problems. Our intent is to learn coupled dynamic processes interpreted as
deviations from true kernels representing isolated processes for
model-adaptivity. Experimental analysis shows that our architecture is robust
and transparent in capturing process kernels and system anomalies. We also show
that high weights representation is not only redundant but also impacts network
interpretability. Our design is guided by domain knowledge, with isolated
process representations serving as ground truths for verification. These allow
us to identify redundant kernels and their manifestations in activation maps to
guide better designs that are both interpretable and explainable unlike
traditional deep-nets.

Title: Semi-supervised Learning Meets Factorization: Learning to Recommend with
  Chain Graph Model
Authors: Chaochao Chen, Kevin C. Chang, Qibing Li, Xiaolin Zheng
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by TKDD
\\
  Recently latent factor model (LFM) has been drawing much attention in
recommender systems due to its good performance and scalability. However,
existing LFMs predict missing values in a user-item rating matrix only based on
the known ones, and thus the sparsity of the rating matrix always limits their
performance. Meanwhile, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an effective
way to alleviate the label (i.e., rating) sparsity problem by performing label
propagation, which is mainly based on the smoothness insight on affinity
graphs. However, graph-based SSL suffers serious scalability and graph
unreliable problems when directly being applied to do recommendation. In this
paper, we propose a novel probabilistic chain graph model (CGM) to marry SSL
with LFM. The proposed CGM is a combination of Bayesian network and Markov
random field. The Bayesian network is used to model the rating generation and
regression procedures, and the Markov random field is used to model the
confidence-aware smoothness constraint between the generated ratings.
Experimental results show that our proposed CGM significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of four evaluation metrics, and with a
larger performance margin when data sparsity increases.

Our proposed method extends the PAC-Bayes framework from a single task setting
to the few-shot learning setting to upper-bound generalisation errors on unseen
tasks and samples. We also propose a generative-based approach to model the
shared prior and the posterior of task-specific model parameters more
expressively compared to the usual diagonal Gaussian assumption. We show that
the models trained with our proposed meta-learning algorithm are well
calibrated and accurate, with state-of-the-art calibration and classification
results on few-shot classification (mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet) and
regression (multi-modal task-distribution regression) benchmarks.

Title: Adversarial Robustness Through Local Lipschitzness
Authors: Yao-Yuan Yang, Cyrus Rashtchian, Hongyang Zhang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov,
  Kamalika Chaudhuri
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  A standard method for improving the robustness of neural networks is
adversarial training, where the network is trained on adversarial examples that
are close to the training inputs. This produces classifiers that are robust,
but it often decreases clean accuracy. Prior work even posits that the tradeoff
between robustness and accuracy may be inevitable. We investigate this tradeoff
in more depth through the lens of local Lipschitzness. In many image datasets,
the classes are separated in the sense that images with different labels are
not extremely close in $\ell_\infty$ distance. Using this separation as a
starting point, we argue that it is possible to achieve both accuracy and
robustness by encouraging the classifier to be locally smooth around the data.
More precisely, we consider classifiers that are obtained by rounding locally
Lipschitz functions. Theoretically, we show that such classifiers exist for any
dataset such that there is a positive distance between the support of different
classes. Empirically, we compare the local Lipschitzness of classifiers trained
by several methods. Our results show that having a small Lipschitz constant
correlates with achieving high clean and robust accuracy, and therefore, the
smoothness of the classifier is an important property to consider in the
context of adversarial examples. Code available at

Title: Bayesian Domain Randomization for Sim-to-Real Transfer
Authors: Fabio Muratore and Christian Eilers and Michael Gienger and Jan Peters
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  When learning policies for robot control, the real-world data required is
typically prohibitively expensive to acquire, so learning in simulation is a
popular strategy. Unfortunately, such polices are often not transferable to the
real world due to a mismatch between the simulation and reality, called
'reality gap'. Domain randomization methods tackle this problem by randomizing
the physics simulator (source domain) according to a distribution over domain
parameters during training in order to obtain more robust policies that are
able to overcome the reality gap. Most domain randomization approaches sample
the domain parameters from a fixed distribution. This solution is suboptimal in
the context of sim-to-real transferability, since it yields policies that have
been trained without explicitly optimizing for the reward on the real system
(target domain). Additionally, a fixed distribution assumes there is prior
knowledge about the uncertainty over the domain parameters. Thus, we propose
Bayesian Domain Randomization (BayRn), a black box sim-to-real algorithm that
solves tasks efficiently by adapting the domain parameter distribution during
learning by sampling the real-world target domain. BayRn utilizes Bayesian
optimization to search the space of source domain distribution parameters which
produce a policy that maximizes the real-word objective, allowing for adaptive
distributions during policy optimization. We experimentally validate the
proposed approach by comparing against two baseline methods on a nonlinear
under-actuated swing-up task. Our results show that BayRn is capable to perform
direct sim-to-real transfer, while significantly reducing the required prior
knowledge.

Title: On the performance of deep learning models for time series
  classification in streaming

  Computing Models in Industrial and Environmental Applications (SOCO 2020)
\\
  Processing data streams arriving at high speed requires the development of
models that can provide fast and accurate predictions. Although deep neural
networks are the state-of-the-art for many machine learning tasks, their
performance in real-time data streaming scenarios is a research area that has
not yet been fully addressed. Nevertheless, there have been recent efforts to
adapt complex deep learning models for streaming tasks by reducing their
processing rate. The design of the asynchronous dual-pipeline deep learning
framework allows to predict over incoming instances and update the model
simultaneously using two separate layers. The aim of this work is to assess the
performance of different types of deep architectures for data streaming
classification using this framework. We evaluate models such as multi-layer
perceptrons, recurrent, convolutional and temporal convolutional neural
networks over several time-series datasets that are simulated as streams. The
obtained results indicate that convolutional architectures achieve a higher
performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Title: Adaptive Prediction Timing for Electronic Health Records
Authors: Jacob Deasy, Ari Ercole and Pietro Li\`o
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In realistic scenarios, multivariate timeseries evolve over case-by-case
time-scales. This is particularly clear in medicine, where the rate of clinical
events varies by ward, patient, and application. Increasingly complex models
have been shown to effectively predict patient outcomes, but have failed to
adapt granularity to these inherent temporal resolutions. As such, we introduce
a novel, more realistic, approach to generating patient outcome predictions at
an adaptive rate based on uncertainty accumulation in Bayesian recurrent
models. We use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Bayesian embedding layer
with a new aggregation method to demonstrate adaptive prediction timing. Our
model predicts more frequently when events are dense or the model is certain of
event latent representations, and less frequently when readings are sparse or
the model is uncertain. At 48 hours after patient admission, our model achieves
equal performance compared to its static-windowed counterparts, while
generating patient- and event-specific prediction timings that lead to improved
predictive performance over the crucial first 12 hours of the patient stay.

Title: SAFE: Scalable Automatic Feature Engineering Framework for Industrial
  Tasks
Authors: Qitao Shi, Ya-Lin Zhang, Longfei Li, Xinxing Yang, Meng Li, Jun Zho
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Machine learning techniques have been widely applied in Internet companies
for various tasks, acting as an essential driving force, and feature
engineering has been generally recognized as a crucial tache when constructing
machine learning systems. Recently, a growing effort has been made to the
development of automatic feature engineering methods, so that the substantial
and tedious manual effort can be liberated. However, for industrial tasks, the
efficiency and scalability of these methods are still far from satisfactory. In
this paper, we proposed a staged method named SAFE (Scalable Automatic Feature
Engineering), which can provide excellent efficiency and scalability, along
with requisite interpretability and promising performance. Extensive
experiments are conducted and the results show that the proposed method can
provide prominent efficiency and competitive effectiveness when comparing with
other methods. What's more, the adequate scalability of the proposed method
ensures it to be deployed in large scale industrial tasks.

Title: Permute to Train: A New Dimension to Training Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Yushi Qiu, Reiji Suda
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages, 15 figures
\\
  We show that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be efficiently trained by
permuting neuron connections. We introduce a new family of methods to train
DNNs called Permute to Train (P2T). Two implementations of P2T are presented:
Stochastic Gradient Permutation and Lookahead Permutation. The former computes
permutation based on gradient, and the latter depends on another optimizer to
derive the permutation. We empirically show that our proposed method, despite
only swapping randomly weighted connections, achieves comparable accuracy to
that of Adam on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. It opens up
possibilities for new ways to train and regularize DNNs.

Title: Cross-GCN: Enhancing Graph Convolutional Network with $k$-Order Feature
  Interactions
Authors: Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He, Hanwang Zhang, and Tat-Seng Chua
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Submitted to TKDE
\\
  Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is an emerging technique that performs
learning and reasoning on graph data. It operates feature learning on the graph
structure, through aggregating the features of the neighbor nodes to obtain the
embedding of each target node. Owing to the strong representation power, recent
research shows that GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance on several tasks
such as recommendation and linked document classification.
  Despite its effectiveness, we argue that existing designs of GCN forgo
modeling cross features, making GCN less effective for tasks or data where
cross features are important. Although neural network can approximate any
continuous function, including the multiplication operator for modeling feature
crosses, it can be rather inefficient to do so (i.e., wasting many parameters
at the risk of overfitting) if there is no explicit design.
  To this end, we design a new operator named Cross-feature Graph Convolution,
which explicitly models the arbitrary-order cross features with complexity
linear to feature dimension and order size. We term our proposed architecture
as Cross-GCN, and conduct experiments on three graphs to validate its
effectiveness. Extensive analysis validates the utility of explicitly modeling
cross features in GCN, especially for feature learning at lower layers.

Title: Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbors with monotonicity constraints: Moving towards
  the robustness of monotonic noise
Authors: Sergio Gonz\'alez, Salvador Garc\'ia, Sheng-Tun Li, Robert John,
  Francisco Herrera
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted in Neurocomputing
\\
  This paper proposes a new model based on Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbors for
classification with monotonic constraints, Monotonic Fuzzy k-NN (MonFkNN).
Real-life data-sets often do not comply with monotonic constraints due to class
noise. MonFkNN incorporates a new calculation of fuzzy memberships, which
increases robustness against monotonic noise without the need for relabeling.
Our proposal has been designed to be adaptable to the different needs of the
problem being tackled. In several experimental studies, we show significant
improvements in accuracy while matching the best degree of monotonicity
obtained by comparable methods. We also show that MonFkNN empirically achieves
improved performance compared with Monotonic k-NN in the presence of large
amounts of class noise.

Title: SLEIPNIR: Deterministic and Provably Accurate Feature Expansion for
  Gaussian Process Regression with Derivatives
Authors: Emmanouil Angelis, Philippe Wenk, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Stefan Bauer
  and Andreas Krause
Categories: cs.LG math.DS stat.ML
\\
  Gaussian processes are an important regression tool with excellent analytic
properties which allow for direct integration of derivative observations.
However, vanilla GP methods scale cubically in the amount of observations. In
this work, we propose a novel approach for scaling GP regression with
derivatives based on quadrature Fourier features. We then prove deterministic,
non-asymptotic and exponentially fast decaying error bounds which apply for
both the approximated kernel as well as the approximated posterior. To
furthermore illustrate the practical applicability of our method, we then apply
it to ODIN, a recently developed algorithm for ODE parameter inference. In an
extensive experiments section, all results are empirically validated,
demonstrating the speed, accuracy, and practical applicability of this
approach.

Title: Stochastic Linear Contextual Bandits with Diverse Contexts
Authors: Weiqiang Wu, Jing Yang, and Cong Shen
Categories: cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
Comments: Accepted to AISTATS 2020
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the impact of context diversity on stochastic
linear contextual bandits. As opposed to the previous view that contexts lead
to more difficult bandit learning, we show that when the contexts are
sufficiently diverse, the learner is able to utilize the information obtained
during exploitation to shorten the exploration process, thus achieving reduced
regret. We design the LinUCB-d algorithm, and propose a novel approach to
analyze its regret performance. The main theoretical result is that under the
diverse context assumption, the cumulative expected regret of LinUCB-d is
bounded by a constant. As a by-product, our results improve the previous
understanding of LinUCB and strengthen its performance guarantee.

\\
  Diseases resulting from prolonged smoking are the most common preventable
causes of death in the world today. In this report we investigate the success
of utilizing accelerometer sensors in smart watches to identify smoking
gestures. Early identification of smoking gestures can help to initiate the
appropriate intervention method and prevent relapses in smoking. Our
experiments indicate 85%-95% success rates in identification of smoking gesture
among other similar gestures using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Our
investigations concluded that information obtained from the x-dimension of
accelerometers is the best means of identifying the smoking gesture, while y
and z dimensions are helpful in eliminating other gestures such as: eating,
drinking, and scratch of nose. We utilized sensor data from the Apple Watch
during the training of the ANN. Using sensor data from another participant
collected on Pebble Steel, we obtained a smoking identification accuracy of
greater than 90% when using an ANN trained on data previously collected from
the Apple Watch. Finally, we have demonstrated the possibility of using smart
watches to perform continuous monitoring of daily activities.

Title: BERT as a Teacher: Contextual Embeddings for Sequence-Level Reward
Authors: Florian Schmidt and Thomas Hofmann
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL stat.ML
\\
  Measuring the quality of a generated sequence against a set of references is
a central problem in many learning frameworks, be it to compute a score, to
assign a reward, or to perform discrimination. Despite great advances in model
architectures, metrics that scale independently of the number of references are
still based on n-gram estimates. We show that the underlying operations,
counting words and comparing counts, can be lifted to embedding words and
comparing embeddings. An in-depth analysis of BERT embeddings shows empirically
that contextual embeddings can be employed to capture the required dependencies
while maintaining the necessary scalability through appropriate pruning and
smoothing techniques. We cast unconditional generation as a reinforcement
learning problem and show that our reward function indeed provides a more
effective learning signal than n-gram reward in this challenging setting.

Title: Balance Between Efficient and Effective Learning: Dense2Sparse Reward
  Shaping for Robot Manipulation with Environment Uncertainty
Authors: Yongle Luo, Kun Dong, Lili Zhao, Zhiyong Sun, Chao Zhou, Bo Song
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Efficient and effective learning is one of the ultimate goals of the deep
reinforcement learning (DRL), although the compromise has been made in most of
the time, especially for the application of robot manipulations. Learning is
always expensive for robot manipulation tasks and the learning effectiveness
could be affected by the system uncertainty. In order to solve above
challenges, in this study, we proposed a simple but powerful reward shaping
method, namely Dense2Sparse. It combines the advantage of fast convergence of
dense reward and the noise isolation of the sparse reward, to achieve a balance
between learning efficiency and effectiveness, which makes it suitable for
robot manipulation tasks. We evaluated our Dense2Sparse method with a series of
ablation experiments using the state representation model with system
uncertainty. The experiment results show that the Dense2Sparse method obtained
higher expected reward compared with the ones using standalone dense reward or
sparse reward, and it also has a superior tolerance of system uncertainty.

  We present the application of a class of deep learning, known as Physics
Informed Neural Networks (PINN), to learning and discovery in solid mechanics.
We explain how to incorporate the momentum balance and constitutive relations
into PINN, and explore in detail the application to linear elasticity, although
the framework is rather general and can be extended to other solid-mechanics
problems. While common PINN algorithms are based on training one deep neural
network (DNN), we propose a multi-network model that results in more accurate
representation of the field variables. To validate the model, we test the
framework on synthetic data generated from analytical and numerical reference
solutions. We study convergence of the PINN model, and show that Isogeometric
Analysis (IGA) results in superior accuracy and convergence characteristics
compared with classic low-order Finite Element Method (FEM). We also show the
applicability of the framework for transfer learning, and find vastly
accelerated convergence during network re-training. Finally, we find that
honoring the physics leads to improved robustness: when trained only on a few
parameters, we find that the PINN model can accurately predict the solution for
a wide range of parameters new to the network---thus pointing to an important
application of this framework to sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Submitted for journal publication
\\
  Probability models have been proposed in the literature to account for
"intelligent" behavior in many contexts. In this paper, probability propagation
is applied to model agent's motion in potentially complex scenarios that
include goals and obstacles. The backward flow provides precious background
information to the agent's behavior, viz., inferences coming from the future
determine the agent's actions. Probability tensors are layered in time in both
directions in a manner similar to convolutional neural networks. The discussion
is carried out with reference to a set of simulated grids where, despite the
apparent task complexity, a solution, if feasible, is always found. The
original model proposed by Attias has been extended to include non-absorbing
obstacles, multiple goals and multiple agents. The emerging behaviors are very
realistic and demonstrate great potentials of the application of this framework
to real environments.

Title: Real-time Federated Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search
Authors: Hangyu Zhu and Yaochu Jin
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC stat.ML
\\
  Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach to privacy
preservation and two major technical challenges prevent a wider application of
federated learning. One is that federated learning raises high demands on
communication, since a large number of model parameters must be transmitted
between the server and the clients. The other challenge is that training large
machine learning models such as deep neural networks in federated learning
requires a large amount of computational resources, which may be unrealistic
for edge devices such as mobile phones. The problem becomes worse when deep
neural architecture search is to be carried out in federated learning. To
address the above challenges, we propose an evolutionary approach to real-time
federated neural architecture search that not only optimize the model
performance but also reduces the local payload. During the search, a
double-sampling technique is introduced, in which for each individual, a
randomly sampled sub-model of a master model is transmitted to a number of
randomly sampled clients for training without reinitialization. This way, we
effectively reduce computational and communication costs required for
evolutionary optimization and avoid big performance fluctuations of the local
models, making the proposed framework well suited for real-time federated
neural architecture search.

Title: Pruning Filters while Training for Efficiently Optimizing Deep Learning
  Networks
Authors: Sourjya Roy, Priyadarshini Panda, Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan, and Anand
  Raghunathan
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Modern deep networks have millions to billions of parameters, which leads to
high memory and energy requirements during training as well as during inference
on resource-constrained edge devices. Consequently, pruning techniques have
been proposed that remove less significant weights in deep networks, thereby
reducing their memory and computational requirements. Pruning is usually
performed after training the original network, and is followed by further
retraining to compensate for the accuracy loss incurred during pruning. The
prune-and-retrain procedure is repeated iteratively until an optimum tradeoff
between accuracy and efficiency is reached. However, such iterative retraining
adds to the overall training complexity of the network. In this work, we
propose a dynamic pruning-while-training procedure, wherein we prune filters of
the convolutional layers of a deep network during training itself, thereby
precluding the need for separate retraining. We evaluate our dynamic
pruning-while-training approach with three different pre-existing pruning
strategies, viz. mean activation-based pruning, random pruning, and L1
normalization-based pruning. Our results for VGG-16 trained on CIFAR10 shows
that L1 normalization provides the best performance among all the techniques
explored in this work with less than 1% drop in accuracy after pruning 80% of
the filters compared to the original network. We further evaluated the L1
normalization based pruning mechanism on CIFAR100. Results indicate that
pruning while training yields a compressed network with almost no accuracy loss
after pruning 50% of the filters compared to the original network and ~5% loss
for high pruning rates (>80%). The proposed pruning methodology yields 41%
reduction in the number of computations and memory accesses during training for
CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet compared to training with retraining for 10
epochs .

Authors: Igor V. Tetko, Pavel Karpov, Ruud Van Deursen, Guillaume Godin
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML

  We investigated the effect of different augmentation scenarios on predicting
(retro)synthesis of chemical compounds using SMILES representation. We showed
that augmentation of not only input sequences but also, importantly, of the
target data eliminated the effect of data memorization by neural networks and
improved their generalization performance for prediction of new sequences. The
Top-5 accuracy was 85.4% for the prediction of the largest fragment (thus
identifying principal transformation for classical retro-synthesis) for
USPTO-50k test dataset and was achieved by a combination of SMILES augmentation
and beam search. The same approach also outperformed best published results for
prediction of direct reactions from the USPTO-MIT test set. Our model achieved
90.4% Top-1 and 96.5% Top-5 accuracy for its most challenging mixed set and 97%
Top-5 accuracy for the USPTO-MIT separated set. The appearance frequency of the
most abundantly generated SMILES was well correlated with the prediction
outcome and can be used as a measure of the quality of reaction prediction.

Title: Linear time dynamic programming for the exact path of optimal models
  selected from a finite set
Authors: Toby Hocking, Joseph Vargovich
Categories: cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML
Comments: 14 pages
\\
  Many learning algorithms are formulated in terms of finding model parameters
which minimize a data-fitting loss function plus a regularizer. When the
regularizer involves the l0 pseudo-norm, the resulting regularization path
consists of a finite set of models. The fastest existing algorithm for
computing the breakpoints in the regularization path is quadratic in the number
of models, so it scales poorly to high dimensional problems. We provide new
formal proofs that a dynamic programming algorithm can be used to compute the
breakpoints in linear time. Empirical results on changepoint detection problems
demonstrate the improved accuracy and speed relative to grid search and the
previous quadratic time algorithm.

Title: Does label smoothing mitigate label noise?
Authors: Michal Lukasik, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Aditya Krishna Menon, Sanjiv
  Kumar
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Label smoothing is commonly used in training deep learning models, wherein
one-hot training labels are mixed with uniform label vectors. Empirically,
smoothing has been shown to improve both predictive performance and model
calibration. In this paper, we study whether label smoothing is also effective
as a means of coping with label noise. While label smoothing apparently
amplifies this problem --- being equivalent to injecting symmetric noise to the
labels --- we show how it relates to a general family of loss-correction
techniques from the label noise literature. Building on this connection, we
show that label smoothing is competitive with loss-correction under label
noise. Further, we show that when distilling models from noisy data, label
smoothing of the teacher is beneficial; this is in contrast to recent findings
for noise-free problems, and sheds further light on settings where label
smoothing is beneficial.

Title: What went wrong and when? Instance-wise Feature Importance for
  Time-series Models
Authors: Sana Tonekaboni, Shalmali Joshi, David Duvenaud, Anna Goldenberg
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Multivariate time series models are poised to be used for decision support in
high-stakes applications, such as healthcare. In these contexts, it is
important to know which features at which times most influenced a prediction.
We demonstrate a general approach for assigning importance to observations in
multivariate time series, based on their counterfactual influence on future
predictions. Specifically, we define the importance of an observation as the
change in the predictive distribution, had the observation not been seen. We
integrate over plausible counterfactuals by sampling from the corresponding
conditional distributions of generative time series models. We compare our
importance metric to gradient-based explanations, attention mechanisms, and
other baselines in simulated and clinical ICU data, and show that our approach
generates the most precise explanations. Our method is inexpensive, model
agnostic, and can be used with arbitrarily complex time series models and
predictors.

commonly solved by various label propagation methods that work iteratively
starting from a few labeled seed nodes. For graphs with arbitrary
compatibilities between classes, these methods crucially depend on knowing the
compatibility matrix that must be provided by either domain experts or
heuristics. Can we instead directly estimate the correct compatibilities from a
sparsely labeled graph in a principled and scalable way? We answer this
question affirmatively and suggest a method called distant compatibility
estimation that works even on extremely sparsely labeled graphs (e.g., 1 in
10,000 nodes is labeled) in a fraction of the time it later takes to label the
remaining nodes. Our approach first creates multiple factorized graph
representations (with size independent of the graph) and then performs
estimation on these smaller graph sketches. We define algebraic amplification
as the more general idea of leveraging algebraic properties of an algorithm's
update equations to amplify sparse signals. We show that our estimator is by
orders of magnitude faster than an alternative approach and that the end-to-end
classification accuracy is comparable to using gold standard compatibilities.
This makes it a cheap preprocessing step for any existing label propagation
method and removes the current dependence on heuristics.

Title: Finite Open-World Query Answering with Number Restrictions
Authors: Antoine Amarilli, Michael Benedikt
Categories: cs.LO cs.DB
Comments: 70 pages. Extended journal version of arXiv:1505.04216. This article
  is the same as what will be published in ToCL, except for publisher-induced
  changes, minor changes, and reordering of the material (in the ToCL version
  some detailed proofs are moved from the article body to an appendix)
\\
  Open-world query answering is the problem of deciding, given a set of facts,
conjunction of constraints, and query, whether the facts and constraints imply
the query. This amounts to reasoning over all instances that include the facts
and satisfy the constraints. We study finite open-world query answering (FQA),
which assumes that the underlying world is finite and thus only considers the
finite completions of the instance. The major known decidable cases of FQA
derive from the following: the guarded fragment of first-order logic, which can
express referential constraints (data in one place points to data in another)
but cannot express number restrictions such as functional dependencies; and the
guarded fragment with number restrictions but on a signature of arity only two.
In this paper, we give the first decidability results for FQA that combine both
referential constraints and number restrictions for arbitrary signatures: we
show that, for unary inclusion dependencies and functional dependencies, the
finiteness assumption of FQA can be lifted up to taking the finite implication
closure of the dependencies. Our result relies on new techniques to construct
finite universal models of such constraints, for any bound on the maximal query
size.

Title: Towards a Better Understanding of (Partial Weighted) MaxSAT Proof
  Systems
Authors: Javier Larrosa and Emma Rollon
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  MaxSAT is a very popular language for discrete optimization with many domains
of application. While there has been a lot of progress in MaxSAT solvers during
the last decade, the theoretical analysis of MaxSAT inference has not followed
the pace. Aiming at compensating that lack of balance, in this paper we do a
proof complexity approach to MaxSAT resolution-based proof systems. First, we
give some basic definitions on completeness and show that refutational
completeness makes compleness redundant, as it happens in SAT. Then we take
three inference rules such that adding them sequentially allows us to navigate
from the weakest to the strongest resolution-based MaxSAT system available
(i.e., from standalone MaxSAT resolution to the recently proposed ResE), each
rule making the system stronger. Finally, we show that the strongest system
captures the recently proposed concept of Circular Proof while being
conceptually simpler, since weights, which are intrinsic in MaxSAT, naturally
guarantee the flow condition required for the SAT case.

\\
  Predicting and planning interactive behaviors in complex traffic situations
presents a challenging task. Especially in scenarios involving multiple traffic
participants that interact densely, autonomous vehicles still struggle to
interpret situations and to eventually achieve their own driving goal. As
driving tests are costly and challenging scenarios are hard to find and
reproduce, simulation is widely used to develop, test, and benchmark behavior
models. However, most simulations rely on datasets and simplistic behavior
models for traffic participants and do not cover the full variety of
real-world, interactive human behaviors. In this work, we introduce BARK, an
open-source behavior benchmarking environment designed to mitigate the
shortcomings stated above. In BARK, behavior models are (re-)used for planning,
prediction, and simulation. A range of models is currently available, such as
Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Reinforcement Learning-based behavior models. We
use a public dataset and sampling-based scenario generation to show the
inter-exchangeability of behavior models in BARK. We evaluate how well the
models used cope with interactions and how robust they are towards exchanging
behavior models. Our evaluation shows that BARK provides a suitable framework
for a systematic development of behavior models.

  Volumetric video is an emerging technology for immersive representation of 3D
spaces that captures objects from all directions using multiple cameras and
creates a dynamic 3D model of the scene. However, rendering volumetric content
requires high amounts of processing power and is still a very demanding tasks
for today's mobile devices. To mitigate this, we propose a volumetric video
streaming system that offloads the rendering to a powerful cloud/edge server
and only sends the rendered 2D view to the client instead of the full
volumetric content. We use 6DoF head movement prediction techniques, WebRTC
protocol and hardware video encoding to ensure low-latency in different parts
of the processing chain. We demonstrate our system using both a browser-based
client and a Microsoft Hololens client. Our application contains generic
interfaces that allow easy deployment of different augmented/mixed reality
clients using the same server implementation.

Title: Split form ALE discontinuous Galerkin methods with applications to
  under-resolved turbulent low-Mach number flows
Authors: Nico Krais and Gero Schn\"ucke and Thomas Bolemann and Gregor Gassner
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: Submitted to Journal of Computational Physics
\\
  The construction of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the compressible
Euler or Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) includes the approximation of non-linear
flux terms in the volume integrals. The terms can lead to aliasing and
stability issues in turbulence simulations with moderate Mach numbers (Ma <
0.3), e.g. due to under-resolution of vortical dominated structures typical in
large eddy simulations (LES). The kinetic energy or entropy are elevated in
smooth, but under-resolved parts of the solution which are affected by
aliasing. It is known that the kinetic energy is not a conserved quantity for
compressible flows, but for small Mach numbers minor deviations from a
conserved evolution can be expected. While it is formally possible to construct
kinetic energy preserving (KEP) and entropy conserving (EC) DG methods for the
Euler equations, due to the viscous terms in case of the NSE, we aim to
construct kinetic energy dissipative (KED) or entropy stable (ES) DG methods on
moving curved hexahedral meshes. The Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
approach is used to include the effect of mesh motion in the split form DG
methods. First, we use the three dimensional Taylor-Green vortex to investigate
and analyze our theoretical findings and the behavior of the novel split form
ALE DG schemes for a turbulent vortical dominated flow. Second, we apply the
framework to a complex aerodynamics application. An implicit LES split form ALE
DG approach is used to simulate the transitional flow around a plunging SD7003
airfoil at Reynolds number Re = 40, 000 and Mach number Ma = 0.1. We compare
the standard nodal ALE DG scheme, the ALE DG variant with consistent
overintegration of the non-linear terms and the novel KED and ES split form ALE
DG methods in terms of robustness, accuracy and computational efficiency.

Title: Ensemble Kalman Inversion for nonlinear problems: weights, consistency,
  and variance bounds
Authors: Zhiyan Ding, Qin Li, Jianfeng Lu
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EnKI), originally derived from Enseble Kalman
Filter, is a popular sampling method for obtaining a target posterior
distribution. It is, however, inconsistent when the forward map is nonlinear.
Important Sampling (IS), on the other hand, ensures consistency at the expense
of large variance of weights, leading to slow convergence of high moments.
  We propose a WEnKI, a weighted version of EnKI in this paper. It follows the
same gradient flow as that of EnKI with a weight correction. Compared to EnKI,
the new method is consistent, and compared with IS, the method has bounded
weight variance. Both properties will be proved rigorously in this paper. We
further discuss the stability of the underlying Fokker-Planck equation. This
partially explains why EnKI, despite being inconsistent, performs well
occasionally in nonlinear settings. Numerical evidence will be demonstrated at
the end.

Title: Stability Analysis of Inline ZFP Compression for Floating-Point Data in
  Iterative Methods
Authors: Alyson Fox, James Diffenderfer, Jeffrey Hittinger, Geoffrey Sanders,
  and Peter Lindstrom
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Currently, the dominating constraint in many high performance computing
applications is data capacity and bandwidth, in both inter-node communications
and even more-so in on-node data motion. A new approach to address this
limitation is to make use of data compression in the form of a compressed data
array. Storing data in a compressed data array and converting to standard
IEEE-754 types as needed during a computation can reduce the pressure on
bandwidth and storage. However, repeated conversions (lossy compression and
decompression) introduce additional approximation errors, which need to be
shown to not significantly affect the simulation results. We extend recent work
[J. Diffenderfer, et al., Error Analysis of ZFP Compression for Floating-Point
Data, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 2019] that analyzed the error of a
single use of compression and decompression of the ZFP compressed data array
representation [P. Lindstrom, Fixed-rate compressed floating-point arrays, IEEE
Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2014] to the case of
time-stepping and iterative schemes, where an advancement operator is
repeatedly applied in addition to the conversions. We show that the accumulated
error for iterative methods involving fixed-point and time evolving iterations
is bounded under standard constraints. An upper bound is established on the
number of additional iterations required for the convergence of stationary
fixed-point iterations. An additional analysis of traditional forward and
backward error of stationary iterative methods using ZFP compressed arrays is
also presented. The results of several 1D, 2D, and 3D test problems are
provided to demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical bounds.

  We study the problem of identifying unknown processes embedded in
time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE) using observational data,
with an application to advection-diffusion type PDE. We first conduct
theoretical analysis and derive conditions to ensure the solvability of the
problem. We then present a set of numerical approaches, including Galerkin type
algorithm and collocation type algorithm. Analysis of the algorithms are
presented, along with their implementation detail. The Galerkin algorithm is
more suitable for practical situations, particularly those with noisy data, as
it avoids using derivative/gradient data. Various numerical examples are then
presented to demonstrate the performance and properties of the numerical
methods.

Title: Adaptive Interpolatory MOR by Learning the Error Estimator in the
  Parameter Domain

  Benner

Comments: 21 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables. Submitted to the proceedings of MODRED

\\
  Interpolatory methods offer a powerful framework for generating reduced-order
models (ROMs) for non-parametric or parametric systems with time-varying
inputs. Choosing the interpolation points adaptively remains an area of active
interest. A greedy framework has been introduced in Feng et al. [ESAIM: Math.
Model. Numer. Anal. 51(6), 2017] and in Feng and Benner [IEEE Trans. Microw.
Theory Techn. 67(12), 2019] to choose interpolation points automatically using
a posteriori error estimators. Nevertheless, when the parameter range is large
or if the parameter space dimension is larger than two, the greedy algorithm
may take considerable time, since the training set needs to include a
considerable number of parameters. As a remedy, we introduce an adaptive
training technique by learning an efficient a posteriori error estimator over
the parameter domain. A fast learning process is created by interpolating the
error estimator using radial basis functions (RBF) over a fine parameter
training set, representing the whole parameter domain. The error estimator is
evaluated only on a coarse training set including a few parameter samples. The
algorithm is an extension of the work in Chellappa et al. [arXiv e-prints
1910.00298] to interpolatory model order reduction (MOR) in frequency domain.
Beyond this work, we use a newly proposed inf-sup-constant-free error estimator
in the frequency domain, which is often much tighter than the error estimator
using the inf-sup constant.

Title: A diagonal sweeping domain decomposition method with trace transfer for
  the Helmholtz equation
Authors: Wei Leng, Lili Ju
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 32 pages, 13 figures
\\
  In this paper, the diagonal sweeping domain decomposition method (DDM) for
solving the high-frequency Helmholtz equation in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is re-proposed
with the trace transfer method, where $n$ is the dimension. The diagonal
sweeping DDM uses $2^n$ sweeps of diagonal directions on the checkerboard
domain decomposition based on the source transfer method, it is sequential in
nature yet suitable for parallel computing, since the number of sequential
steps is quite small compared to the number of subdomains. The advantages of
changing the basic transfer method from source transfer to trace transfer are
as follows: first, no overlapping region is required in the domain
decomposition; second, the sweeping algorithm becomes simpler since the
transferred traces have only $n$ cardinal directions, whereas the transferred
sources have all $3^n-1$ directions. We proved that the exact solution is
obtained with the proposed method in the constant medium case, and also in the
two-layered medium case provided the source is on the same side with the first
swept subdomain. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated using
numerical experiments in two and three dimensions, and it is found that
numerical differences of the diagonal sweeping DDM with the two transfer
methods are very small using second-order finite difference discretization.

Title: Space-time adaptive ADER discontinuous Galerkin schemes for nonlinear
  hyperelasticity with material failure
Authors: Maurizio Tavelli, Simone Chiocchetti, Evgeniy Romenski, Alice-Agnes
  Gabriel, Michael Dumbser
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We are concerned with the numerical solution of a unified first order
hyperbolic formulation of continuum mechanics that originates from the work of
Godunov, Peshkov and Romenski (GPR model) and which is an extension of
nonlinear hyperelasticity that is able to describe simultaneously nonlinear
elasto-plastic solids at large strain, as well as viscous and ideal fluids. The
proposed governing PDE system also contains the effect of heat conduction and
can be shown to be symmetric and thermodynamically compatible.
  In this paper we extend the GPR model to the simulation of nonlinear dynamic
rupture processes and material fatigue effects, by adding a new scalar variable
to the governing PDE system. This extra parameter describes the material damage
and is governed by an advection-reaction equation, where the stiff and highly
nonlinear reaction mechanisms depend on the ratio of the local von Mises stress
to the yield stress of the material. The stiff reaction mechanisms are
integrated in time via an efficient exponential time integrator. Due to the
multiple space-time scales, the model is solved on space-time adaptive
Cartesian meshes using high order discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes
with a posteriori subcell finite volume limiting.
  A key feature of our new model is the use of a twofold diffuse interface
approach that allows the cracks to form anywhere and at any time, independently
of the chosen computational grid, without requiring that the geometry of the
rupture fault be known a priori. We furthermore make use of a scalar volume
fraction function that indicates whether a given point is inside the solid or
outside, allowing the description of solids of arbitrarily complex shape.

Title: On numerical methods for hyperbolic PDE with curl involutions
Authors: Michael Dumbser, Simone Chiocchetti and Ilya Peshkov
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-38870-6
\\
  In this paper we present three different numerical approaches to account for
curl-type involution constraints in hyperbolic partial differential equations
for continuum physics. All approaches have a direct analogy to existing and
well-known divergence-preserving schemes for the Maxwell and MHD equations. The
first method consists in a generalization of the Godunov-Powell terms, which
means adding suitable multiples of the involution constraints to the PDE system
in order to achieve the symmetric Godunov form. The second method is an
extension of the generalized Lagrangian multiplier (GLM) approach of Munz et
al., where the numerical errors in the involution constraint are propagated
away via an augmented PDE system. The last method is an exactly involution
preserving discretization, similar to the exactly divergence-free schemes for
the Maxwell and MHD equations, making use of appropriately staggered meshes. We
present some numerical results that allow to compare all three approaches with
each other.

Title: QED: using Quality-Environment-Diversity to evolve resilient robot
  swarms
Authors: David M. Bossens and Danesh Tarapore
Categories: cs.NE
\\
  In swarm robotics, any of the robots in a swarm may be affected by different
faults, resulting in significant performance declines. To allow fault recovery
from randomly injected faults to different robots in a swarm, a model-free
approach may be preferable due to the accumulation of faults in models and the
difficulty to predict the behaviour of neighbouring robots. One model-free
approach to fault recovery involves two phases: during simulation, a
quality-diversity algorithm evolves a behaviourally diverse archive of
controllers; during the target application, a search for the best controller is
initiated after fault injection. In quality-diversity algorithms, the choice of
the behavioural descriptor is a key design choice that determines the quality
of the evolved archives, and therefore the fault recovery performance. Although
the environment is an important determinant of behaviour, the impact of
environmental diversity is often ignored in the choice of a suitable
behavioural descriptor. This study compares different behavioural descriptors,
including two generic descriptors that work on a wide range of tasks, one
hand-coded descriptor which fits the domain of interest, and one novel type of
descriptor based on environmental diversity, which we call
Quality-Environment-Diversity (QED). Results demonstrate that the
above-mentioned model-free approach to fault recovery is feasible in the
context of swarm robotics, reducing the fault impact by a factor 2-3. Further,
the environmental diversity obtained with QED yields a unique behavioural
diversity profile that allows it to recover from high-impact faults.

approximate circuits. As demonstrated in an extensive experimental evaluation
including several structurally different arithmetic circuits and target
precisions, the search strategy provides superior scalability and versatility
with respect to various approximation scenarios. Our approach significantly

  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that process
information conveyed as temporal spikes rather than numeric values. A spiking
neuron of an SNN only produces a spike whenever a significant number of spikes

any pre-processing at extremely lower power unlike standard artificial neural
networks. This is possible due to specialized neuromorphic hardware that
implements the highly-parallelizable concept of SNNs in silicon. Yet, SNNs have
not enjoyed the same rise of popularity as artificial neural networks. This not
only stems from the fact that their input format is rather unconventional but
also due to the challenges in training spiking networks. Despite their temporal
nature and recent algorithmic advances, they have been mostly evaluated on
classification problems. We propose, for the first time, a temporal regression
problem of numerical values given events from an event camera. We specifically
investigate the prediction of the 3-DOF angular velocity of a rotating event
camera with an SNN. The difficulty of this problem arises from the prediction
of angular velocities continuously in time directly from irregular,
asynchronous event-based input. Directly utilising the output of event cameras
without any pre-processing ensures that we inherit all the benefits that they
provide over conventional cameras. That is high-temporal resolution,
high-dynamic range and no motion blur. To assess the performance of SNNs on
this task, we introduce a synthetic event camera dataset generated from
real-world panoramic images and show that we can successfully train an SNN to
perform angular velocity regression.

Title: LSQ: Load Balancing in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Systems with Multiple
  Dispatchers
Authors: Shay Vargaftik, Isaac Keslassy, Ariel Orda
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: This manuscript is an extended version of a paper accepted for
  publication in the IEEE/ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING (submitted on 15 Apr
  2019, revised on 12 Aug 2019, 19 Nov 2019, 09 Jan 2020 and accepted on 26 Feb
  2020). It is based on part of the Ph.D. thesis of Shay Vargaftik, submitted
  to the Senate of the Technion on Apr 2019
\\
  Nowadays, the efficiency and even the feasibility of traditional
load-balancing policies are challenged by the rapid growth of cloud
infrastructure and the increasing levels of server heterogeneity. In such
heterogeneous systems with many load-balancers, traditional solutions, such as
JSQ, incur a prohibitively large communication overhead and detrimental incast
effects due to herd behavior. Alternative low-communication policies, such as
JSQ(d) and the recently proposed JIQ, are either unstable or provide poor
performance.
  We introduce the Local Shortest Queue (LSQ) family of load balancing
algorithms. In these algorithms, each dispatcher maintains its own, local, and
possibly outdated view of the server queue lengths, and keeps using JSQ on its
local view. A small communication overhead is used infrequently to update this
local view. We formally prove that as long as the error in these local
estimates of the server queue lengths is bounded in expectation, the entire
system is strongly stable. Finally, in simulations, we show how simple and
stable LSQ policies exhibit appealing performance and significantly outperform
existing low-communication policies, while using an equivalent communication
budget. In particular, our simple policies often outperform even JSQ due to
their reduction of herd behavior. We further show how, by relying on smart
servers (i.e., advanced pull-based communication), we can further improve
performance and lower communication overhead.

Title: Dual link failure survivability with recovery time constraint: A
  Parallel cross connection backup route recovery strategy
Authors: Dinesh Kumar, Rajiv Kumar, Neeru Sharma
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures
MSC-class: no
\\
  In this paper, we proposed a fast recovery strategy for a dual link failure
in elastic optical network. The elastic optical network is a promising solution
to meet the next generation higher bandwidth demand. The survivability of high
speed network is very crucial. As the network size increases the probability of
the dual link failure and node failure also increases. Here, we proposed a
parallel cross connection backup recovery strategy for dual link failure in the
network. Proposed strategy shows lower bandwidth blocking probability (BBP),
fast connection recovery, and bandwidth provisioning ratio when compared with
the existing shared path protection (SPP) and dedicated path protection (DPP)
approaches. Simulation is performed on ARPANET and COST239 topology networks.

Title: Optimal Sampling Cost in Wireless Networks with Age of Information
  Constraints
Authors: Emmanouil Fountoulakis, Nikolaos Pappas, Marian Codreanu, Anthony
  Ephremides
Categories: cs.NI cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Accepted in IEEE INFOCOM Workshops
\\
  We consider the problem of minimizing the time average cost of sampling and
transmitting status updates by users over a wireless channel subject to average
Age of Information constraints (AoI). Errors in the transmission may occur and
the scheduling algorithm has to decide if the users sample a new packet or
attempt for retransmission of the packet sampled previously. The cost consists
of both sampling and transmission costs. The sampling of a new packet after a
failure imposes an additional cost in the system. We formulate a stochastic
optimization problem with time average cost in the objective under time average
AoI constraints. To solve this problem, we apply tools from Lyapunov
optimization theory and develop a dynamic algorithm that takes decisions in a
slot-by-slot basis. The algorithm decides if a user: a) samples a new packet,
b) transmits the old one, c) remains silent. We provide optimality guarantees
of the algorithm and study its performance in terms of time average cost and
AoI through simulation results.

Title: Cellular Traffic Prediction with Recurrent Neural Network
Authors: Shan Jaffry
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Autonomous prediction of traffic demand will be a key function in future
cellular networks. In the past, researchers have used statistical methods such
as Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to provide traffic
predictions. However, ARIMA based predictions fail to give an exact and
accurate forecast for dynamic input quantities such as cellular traffic. More
recently, researchers have started to explore deep learning techniques, such
as, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long-short-term-memory (LSTM) to
autonomously predict future cellular traffic. In this research, we have
designed a LSTM based cellular traffic prediction model. We have compared the
LSTM based prediction with the base line ARIMA model and vanilla feed-forward
neural network (FFNN). The results show that LSTM and FFNN accurately predicted
future cellular traffic. However, it was found that LSTM train the prediction
model in much shorter time as compared to FFNN. Hence, we conclude that LSTM
models can be effectively even used with small amount of training data which
will allow to timely predict future cellular traffic.

\\
  Disturbance estimation for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
robustness and safety. In this paper, we use novel, bio-inspired airflow
sensors to measure the airflow acting on a MAV, and we fuse this information in
an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to simultaneously estimate the
three-dimensional wind vector, the drag force, and other interaction forces
(e.g. due to collisions, interaction with a human) acting on the robot. To this
end, we present and compare a fully model-based and a deep learning-based
strategy. The model-based approach considers the MAV and airflow sensor
dynamics and its interaction with the wind, while the deep learning-based
strategy uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to obtain an
estimate of the relative airflow, which is then fused in the proposed filter.
We validate our methods in hardware experiments, showing that we can accurately
estimate relative airflow of up to 4 m/s, and we can differentiate drag and
interaction force.

  This study proposes a novel imitation learning approach for the stochastic
generation of human-like rhythmic wave gestures and their modulation for
effective non-verbal communication through a probabilistic formulation using
joint angle data from human demonstrations. This is achieved by learning and
modulating the overall expression characteristics of the gesture (e.g., arm
posture, waving frequency and amplitude) in the frequency domain. The method
was evaluated on simulated robot experiments involving a robot with a
manipulator of 6 degrees of freedom. The results show that the method provides
efficient encoding and modulation of rhythmic movements and ensures variability
in their execution.

Title: Validation of Image-Based Neural Network Controllers through Adaptive
  Stress Testing
Authors: Kyle D. Julian, Ritchie Lee, Mykel J. Kochenderfer
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Neural networks have become state-of-the-art for computer vision problems
because of their ability to efficiently model complex functions from large
amounts of data. While neural networks can be shown to perform well empirically
for a variety of tasks, their performance is difficult to guarantee. Neural
network verification tools have been developed that can certify robustness with
respect to a given input image; however, for neural network systems used in
closed-loop controllers, robustness with respect to individual images does not
address multi-step properties of the neural network controller and its
environment. Furthermore, neural network systems interacting in the physical
world and using natural images are operating in a black-box environment, making
formal verification intractable. This work combines the adaptive stress testing
(AST) framework with neural network verification tools to search for the most
likely sequence of image disturbances that cause the neural network controlled
system to reach a failure. An autonomous aircraft taxi application is
presented, and results show that the AST method finds failures with more likely
image disturbances than baseline methods. Further analysis of AST results
revealed an explainable cause of the failure, giving insight into the
problematic scenarios that should be addressed.

Title: PointLoc: Deep Pose Regressor for LiDAR Point Cloud Localization
Authors: Wei Wang, Bing Wang, Peijun Zhao, Changhao Chen, Ronald Clark, Bo
  Yang, Andrew Markham, Niki Trigoni
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end learning-based LiDAR
relocalization framework, termed PointLoc, which infers 6-DoF poses directly
using only a single point cloud as input, without requiring a pre-built map.
Compared to RGB image-based relocalization, LiDAR frames can provide rich and
robust geometric information about a scene. However, LiDAR point clouds are
sparse and unstructured making it difficult to apply traditional deep learning
regression models for this task. We address this issue by proposing a novel
PointNet-style architecture with self-attention to efficiently estimate 6-DoF
poses from 360{\deg} LiDAR input frames. Extensive experiments on recently
released challenging Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset and real-world robot
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve accurate
relocalization performance. We show that our approach improves the
state-of-the-art MapNet by 69.59% in translation and 75.70% in rotation, and
AtLoc by 66.86% in translation and 78.83% in rotation on the challenging
outdoor large-scale Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset.

Title: GOMP: Grasp-Optimized Motion Planning for Bin Picking
Authors: Jeffrey Ichnowski, Michael Danielczuk, Jingyi Xu, Vishal Satish, Ken
  Goldberg
Categories: cs.RO
Journal-ref: ICRA 2020
\\
  Rapid and reliable robot bin picking is a critical challenge in automating
warehouses, often measured in picks-per-hour (PPH). We explore increasing PPH
using faster motions based on optimizing over a set of candidate grasps. The
source of this set of grasps is two-fold: (1) grasp-analysis tools such as
Dex-Net generate multiple candidate grasps, and (2) each of these grasps has a
degree of freedom about which a robot gripper can rotate. In this paper, we
present Grasp-Optimized Motion Planning (GOMP), an algorithm that speeds up the
execution of a bin-picking robot's operations by incorporating robot dynamics
and a set of candidate grasps produced by a grasp planner into an optimizing
motion planner. We compute motions by optimizing with sequential quadratic
programming (SQP) and iteratively updating trust regions to account for the
non-convex nature of the problem. In our formulation, we constrain the motion
to remain within the mechanical limits of the robot while avoiding obstacles.
We further convert the problem to a time-minimization by repeatedly shorting a
time horizon of a trajectory until the SQP is infeasible. In experiments with a
UR5, GOMP achieves a speedup of 9x over a baseline planner.

Title: Autonomous Driving at Intersections: A Critical-Turning-Point Approach
  for Left Turns
Authors: K. Shu, H. Yu, X. Chen, L. Chen, Q. Wang, L. Li, and D. Cao
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Left-turn planning is one of the formidable challenges for autonomous
vehicles, especially at unsignalized intersections due to the unknown
intentions of oncoming vehicles. This paper addresses the challenge by
proposing a critical turning point (CTP) based hierarchical planning approach.
This includes a high-level candidate path generator and a low-level partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP) based planner. The proposed (CTP)
concept, inspired by human-driving behaviors at intersections, aims to increase
the computational efficiency of the low-level planner and to enable
human-friendly autonomous driving. The POMDP based low-level planner takes
unknown intentions of oncoming vehicles into considerations to perform less
conservative yet safe actions. With proper integration, the proposed
hierarchical approach is capable of achieving safe planning results with high
commute efficiency at unsignalized intersections in real time.

  We propose a versatile robotic system for kitting and assembly tasks which
uses no jigs or commercial tool changers. Instead of specialized end effectors,
it uses its two-finger grippers to grasp and hold tools to perform subtasks
such as screwing and suctioning. A third gripper is used as a precision picking
and centering tool, and uses in-built passive compliance to compensate for
small position errors and uncertainty. A novel grasp point detection for bin
picking is described for the kitting task, using a single depth map. Using the
proposed system we competed in the Assembly Challenge of the Industrial
Robotics Category of the World Robot Challenge at the World Robot Summit 2018,
obtaining 4th place and the SICE award for lean design and versatile tool use.
We show the effectiveness of our approach through experiments performed during

Title: Learning-based distributionally robust motion control with Gaussian
  processes
Authors: Astghik Hakobyan, Insoon Yang
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Safety is a critical issue in learning-based robotic and autonomous systems
as learned information about their environments is often unreliable and
inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a risk-aware motion control tool that is
robust against errors in learned distributional information about obstacles
moving with unknown dynamics. The salient feature of our model predictive
control (MPC) method is its capability of limiting the risk of unsafety even
when the true distribution deviates from the distribution estimated by Gaussian
process (GP) regression, within an ambiguity set. Unfortunately, the
distributionally robust MPC problem with GP is intractable because the
worst-case risk constraint involves an infinite-dimensional optimization
problem over the ambiguity set. To remove the infinite-dimensionality issue, we
develop a systematic reformulation approach exploiting modern distributionally
robust optimization techniques. The performance and utility of our method are
demonstrated through simulations using a nonlinear car-like vehicle model for
autonomous driving.

\\
  Coverage path planning (CPP) is the task of designing a trajectory that
enables a mobile agent to travel over every point of an area of interest. We
propose a new method to control an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying a
camera on a CPP mission with random start positions and multiple options for
landing positions in an environment containing no-fly zones. While numerous
approaches have been proposed to solve similar CPP problems, we leverage
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) to learn a control policy that
generalizes over varying power constraints for the UAV. Despite recent
improvements in battery technology, the maximum flying range of small UAVs is
still a severe constraint, which is exacerbated by variations in the UAV's
power consumption that are hard to predict. By using map-like input channels to
feed spatial information through convolutional network layers to the agent, we
are able to train a double deep Q-network (DDQN) to make control decisions for
the UAV, balancing limited power budget and coverage goal. The proposed method
can be applied to a wide variety of environments and harmonizes complex goal
structures with system constraints.

Title: Dimensionality Reduction of Movement Primitives in Parameter Space
Authors: Samuele Tosatto, Jonas Stadtmueller, Jan Peters
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Movement primitives are an important policy class for real-world robotics.
However, the high dimensionality of their parametrization makes the policy
optimization expensive both in terms of samples and computation. Enabling an
efficient representation of movement primitives facilitates the application of
machine learning techniques such as reinforcement on robotics. Motions,
especially in highly redundant kinematic structures, exhibit high correlation
in the configuration space. For these reasons, prior work has mainly focused on
the application of dimensionality reduction techniques in the configuration
space. In this paper, we investigate the application of dimensionality
reduction in the parameter space, identifying principal movements. The
resulting approach is enriched with a probabilistic treatment of the
parameters, inheriting all the properties of the Probabilistic Movement
Primitives. We test the proposed technique both on a real robotic task and on a
database of complex human movements. The empirical analysis shows that the
dimensionality reduction in parameter space is more effective than in
configuration space, as it enables the representation of the movements with a
significant reduction of parameters.

  While robot learning has demonstrated promising results for enabling robots
to automatically acquire new skills, a critical challenge in deploying
learning-based systems is scale: acquiring enough data for the robot to
effectively generalize broadly. Imitation learning, in particular, has remained
a stable and powerful approach for robot learning, but critically relies on
expert operators for data collection. In this work, we target this challenge,
aiming to build an imitation learning system that can continuously improve
through autonomous data collection, while simultaneously avoiding the explicit
use of reinforcement learning, to maintain the stability, simplicity, and
scalability of supervised imitation. To accomplish this, we cast the problem of
imitation with autonomous improvement into a multi-task setting. We utilize the
insight that, in a multi-task setting, a failed attempt at one task might
represent a successful attempt at another task. This allows us to leverage the
robot's own trials as demonstrations for tasks other than the one that the
robot actually attempted. Using an initial dataset of multi-task demonstration
data, the robot autonomously collects trials which are only sparsely labeled
with a binary indication of whether the trial accomplished any useful task or
not. We then embed the trials into a learned latent space of tasks, trained
using only the initial demonstration dataset, to draw similarities between
various trials, enabling the robot to achieve one-shot generalization to new
tasks. In contrast to prior imitation learning approaches, our method can
autonomously collect data with sparse supervision for continuous improvement,
and in contrast to reinforcement learning algorithms, our method can
effectively improve from sparse, task-agnostic reward signals.

  Mobile manipulation is usually achieved by sequentially executing base and
manipulator movements. This simplification, however, leads to a loss in
efficiency and in some cases a reduction of workspace size. Even though
different methods have been proposed to solve Whole-Body Control (WBC) online,
they are either limited by a kinematic model or do not allow for reactive,
online obstacle avoidance. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this work,
we propose an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to WBC. We
compared our learned controller against a state-of-the-art sampling-based
method in simulation and achieved faster overall mission times. In addition, we
validated the learned policy on our mobile manipulator RoyalPanda in
challenging narrow corridor environments.

  The development of autonomous robotic systems that can learn from human
demonstrations to imitate a desired behavior - rather than being manually
programmed - has huge technological potential. One major challenge in imitation
learning is the correspondence problem: how to establish corresponding states
and actions between expert and learner, when the embodiments of the agents are
different (morphology, dynamics, degrees of freedom, etc.). Many existing
approaches in imitation learning circumvent the correspondence problem, for
example, kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation, which are performed on the
robot. In this work we explicitly address the correspondence problem by
introducing a distance measure between dissimilar embodiments. This measure is
then used as a loss function for static pose imitation and as a feedback signal
within a model-free deep reinforcement learning framework for dynamic movement
imitation between two anthropomorphic robotic arms in simulation. We find that
the measure is well suited for describing the similarity between embodiments
and for learning imitation policies by distance minimization.

  Data-driven approaches to tactile sensing aim to overcome the complexity of
accurately modeling contact with soft materials. However, their widespread
adoption is impaired by concerns about data efficiency and the capability to
generalize when applied to various tasks. This paper focuses on both these
aspects with regard to a vision-based tactile sensor, which aims to reconstruct
the distribution of the three-dimensional contact forces applied on its soft
surface. Accurate models for the soft materials and the camera projection,
derived via state-of-the-art techniques in the respective domains, are employed
to generate a dataset in simulation. A strategy is proposed to train a tailored
deep neural network entirely from the simulation data. The resulting learning
architecture is directly transferable across multiple tactile sensors without
further training and yields accurate predictions on real data, while showing
promising generalization capabilities to unseen contact conditions.

Title: Dimensionality Reduction and Motion Clustering during Activities of
  Daily Living: 3, 4, and 7 Degree-of-Freedom Arm Movements
Authors: Yuri Gloumakov, Adam J. Spiers, Aaron M. Dollar

\\
  The wide variety of motions performed by the human arm during daily tasks
makes it desirable to find representative subsets to reduce the dimensionality
of these movements for a variety of applications, including the design and
control of robotic and prosthetic devices. This paper presents a novel method
and the results of an extensive human subjects study to obtain representative
arm joint angle trajectories that span naturalistic motions during Activities
of Daily Living (ADLs). In particular, we seek to identify sets of useful
motion trajectories of the upper limb that are functions of a single variable,
allowing, for instance, an entire prosthetic or robotic arm to be controlled
with a single input from a user, along with a means to select between motions
for different tasks. Data driven approaches are used to obtain clusters as well
as representative motion averages for the full-arm 7 degree of freedom (DOF),
elbow-wrist 4 DOF, and wrist-only 3 DOF motions. The proposed method makes use
of well-known techniques such as dynamic time warping (DTW) to obtain a
divergence measure between motion segments, DTW barycenter averaging (DBA) to
obtain averages, Ward's distance criterion to build hierarchical trees,
batch-DTW to simultaneously align multiple motion data, and functional
principal component analysis (fPCA) to evaluate cluster variability. The
clusters that emerge associate various recorded motions into primarily hand
start and end location for the full-arm system, motion direction for the
wrist-only system, and an intermediate between the two qualities for the
elbow-wrist system. The proposed clustering methodology is justified by
comparing results against alternative approaches.

Title: PPMC Training Algorithm: A Robot Independent Rough Terrain Deep Learning
  Based Path Planner and Motion Controller
Authors: Tamir Blum and Kazuya Yoshida
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
Comments: 6 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Robots can now learn how to make decisions and control themselves,
generalizing learned behaviors to unseen scenarios. In particular, AI powered
robots show promise in rough environments like the lunar surface, due to the
environmental uncertainties. We address this critical generalization aspect for
robot locomotion in rough terrain through a training algorithm we have created
called the Path Planning and Motion Control (PPMC) Training Algorithm. This
algorithm is coupled with any generic reinforcement learning algorithm to teach
robots how to respond to user commands and to travel to designated locations on
a single neural network. In this paper, we show that the algorithm works
independent of the robot structure, demonstrating that it works on a wheeled
rover in addition the past results on a quadruped walking robot. Further, we
take several big steps towards real world practicality by introducing a rough
highly uneven terrain. Critically, we show through experiments that the robot
learns to generalize to new rough terrain maps, retaining a 100% success rate.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to introduce a generic
training algorithm teaching generalized PPMC in rough environments to any
robot, with just the use of reinforcement learning.

Title: Efficient Uncertainty-aware Decision-making for Automated Driving Using
  Guided Branching
Authors: Lu Zhang, Wenchao Ding, Jing Chen, Shaojie Shen
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  (ICRA) 2020
\\
  Decision-making in dense traffic scenarios is challenging for automated
vehicles (AVs) due to potentially stochastic behaviors of other traffic
participants and perception uncertainties (e.g., tracking noise and prediction
errors, etc.). Although the partially observable Markov decision process
(POMDP) provides a systematic way to incorporate these uncertainties, it
quickly becomes computationally intractable when scaled to the real-world
large-size problem. In this paper, we present an efficient uncertainty-aware
decision-making (EUDM) framework, which generates long-term lateral and
longitudinal behaviors in complex driving environments in real-time. The
computation complexity is controlled to an appropriate level by two novel
techniques, namely, the domain-specific closed-loop policy tree (DCP-Tree)
structure and conditional focused branching (CFB) mechanism. The key idea is
utilizing domain-specific expert knowledge to guide the branching in both
action and intention space. The proposed framework is validated using both
onboard sensing data captured by a real vehicle and an interactive multi-agent
simulation platform. We also release the code of our framework to accommodate
benchmarking.

Title: Safe Planning for Self-Driving Via Adaptive Constrained ILQR
Authors: Yanjun Pan, Qin Lin, Het Shah, and John M. Dolan
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Constrained Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (CILQR), a variant of ILQR,
has been recently proposed for motion planning problems of autonomous vehicles
to deal with constraints such as obstacle avoidance and reference tracking.
However, the previous work considers either deterministic trajectories or
persistent prediction for target dynamical obstacles. The other drawback is
lack of generality - it requires manual weight tuning for different scenarios.
In this paper, two significant improvements are achieved. Firstly, a two-stage
uncertainty-aware prediction is proposed. The short-term prediction with safety
guarantee based on reachability analysis is responsible for dealing with
extreme maneuvers conducted by target vehicles. The long-term prediction
leveraging an adaptive least square filter preserves the long-term optimality
of the planned trajectory since using reachability only for long-term
prediction is too pessimistic and makes the planner over-conservative.
Secondly, to allow a wider coverage over different scenarios and to avoid
tedious parameter tuning case by case, this paper designs a scenario-based
analytical function taking the states from the ego vehicle and the target
vehicle as input, and carrying weights of a cost function as output. It allows
the ego vehicle to execute multiple behaviors (such as lane-keeping and
overtaking) under a single planner. We demonstrate safety, effectiveness, and
real-time performance of the proposed planner in simulations.

Title: A Geometric Perspective on Visual Imitation Learning
Authors: Jun Jin, Laura Petrich, Masood Dehghan and Martin Jagersand
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
Comments: submitted to IROS 2020
\\
  We consider the problem of visual imitation learning without human
supervision (e.g. kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation), nor access to an
interactive reinforcement learning (RL) training environment. We present a
geometric perspective to derive solutions to this problem. Specifically, we
propose VGS-IL (Visual Geometric Skill Imitation Learning), an end-to-end
geometry-parameterized task concept inference method, to infer globally
consistent geometric feature association rules from human demonstration video
frames. We show that, instead of learning actions from image pixels, learning a
geometry-parameterized task concept provides an explainable and invariant
representation across demonstrator to imitator under various environmental
settings. Moreover, such a task concept representation provides a direct link
with geometric vision based controllers (e.g. visual servoing), allowing for
efficient mapping of high-level task concepts to low-level robot actions.

Title: Some Aspects of a Software Reliability Problem
Authors: Anton Petrov, Elena Popova, Alexander Petrov
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Obviously, the dynamism of software reliability research has speeded up
significantly in the last period, and we can state the fact that its intensity
is approaching, and in some cases is ahead of the information systems hardware
reliability research intensity. Reliability of software is much more important
than its other characteristics, such as runtime, and although the absolute
reliability of modern software is apparently unattainable, there is still no
generally accepted measure of reliability of computer programs. The article
analyzes the reasons for the situation and offers an approach to solving the
problem. The article touches upon the issue of general characteristics of
information systems software life cycle. Considered software application
reliability questions and use of fail-safe ensuring programming. Also presented
basic types of so-called virus programs that lead to abnormal functioning of
information systems. Much attention is given to presenting some known models
used for software debugging and operating. So, this review paper consists of
four sections: information systems software process creation, reliability of
information systems software, using of fail-safe programs and estimation of
software reliability according the results of adjusting and normal operation.

Title: Microservice Decomposition via Static and Dynamic Analysis of the
  Monolith
Authors: Alexander Krause, Christian Zirkelbach, Wilhelm Hasselbring, Stephan
  Lenga, Dan Kr\"oger
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Migrating monolithic software systems into microservices requires the
application of decomposition techniquesto find and select appropriate service
boundaries. These techniques are often based on domain knowledge, static code
analysis, and non-functional requirements such as maintainability. In this
paper, we present our experience with an approach that extends static analysis
with dynamic analysis of a legacy software system's runtime behavior, including
the live trace visualization to support the decomposition into microservices.
Overall, our approach combines established analysis techniques for microservice
decomposition, such as the bounded context pattern of domain-driven design, and
enriches the collected information via dynamic software visualization to
identify appropriate microservice boundaries. In collaboration with the German
IT service provider adesso SE, we applied our approach to their real-word,
legacy lottery application in|FOCUS to identify good microservice
decompositions for this layered monolithic Enterprise Java system.

Title: Measuring the Quality of B Abstract Machines with ISO/IEC 25010
Authors: Cheng-Hao Cai, Jing Sun, Gillian Dobbie
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: 11 pages, 1 figure, 1 table
ACM-class: D.2.1; D.2.4; D.2.8
\\
  The B method has facilitated the development of software by specifying the
design of software as abstract machines and formally verifying the correctness
of the abstract machines. The quality of B abstract machines can significantly
impact the quality of final software products. In this paper, we propose a set
of criteria for measuring the quality of B abstract machines based on ISO/IEC
25010, which is one of the latest international standards for evaluating
software quality in software engineering. These criteria evaluate abstract
machines using a number of general-purpose and domain-independent equations and
model checking techniques, so that the quality of abstract machines can be
quantified as vectors. The proposed criteria are implemented as a B model
quality evaluator, and they are explained and justified using a number of
examples.

  In this paper we provide a comprehensive introduction to knowledge graphs,
which have recently garnered significant attention from both industry and
academia in scenarios that require exploiting diverse, dynamic, large-scale
collections of data. After a general introduction, we motivate and contrast
various graph-based data models and query languages that are used for knowledge
graphs. We discuss the roles of schema, identity, and context in knowledge
graphs. We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted using a
combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We summarise methods for the
creation, enrichment, quality assessment, refinement, and publication of
knowledge graphs. We provide an overview of prominent open knowledge graphs and
enterprise knowledge graphs, their applications, and how they use the
aforementioned techniques. We conclude with high-level future research
directions for knowledge graphs.

Title: AGL: a Scalable System for Industrial-purpose Graph Machine Learning
Authors: Dalong Zhang, Xin Huang, Ziqi Liu, Zhiyang Hu, Xianzheng Song, Zhibang
  Ge, Zhiqiang Zhang, Lin Wang, Jun Zhou, Yuan Qi
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  Machine learning over graphs have been emerging as powerful learning tools
for graph data. However, it is challenging for industrial communities to
leverage the techniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), and solve
real-world problems at scale because of inherent data dependency in the graphs.
As such, we cannot simply train a GNN with classic learning systems, for
instance parameter server that assumes data parallel. Existing systems store
the graph data in-memory for fast accesses either in a single machine or graph
stores from remote. The major drawbacks are in three-fold. First, they cannot
scale because of the limitations on the volume of the memory, or the bandwidth
between graph stores and workers. Second, they require extra development of
graph stores without well exploiting mature infrastructures such as MapReduce
that guarantee good system properties. Third, they focus on training but ignore
the optimization of inference over graphs, thus makes them an unintegrated
system.
  In this paper, we design AGL, a scalable, fault-tolerance and integrated
system, with fully-functional training and inference for GNNs. Our system
design follows the message passing scheme underlying the computations of GNNs.
We design to generate the $k$-hop neighborhood, an information-complete
subgraph for each node, as well as do the inference simply by merging values
from in-edge neighbors and propagating values to out-edge neighbors via
MapReduce. In addition, the $k$-hop neighborhood contains information-complete
subgraphs for each node, thus we simply do the training on parameter servers
due to data independency. Our system AGL, implemented on mature
infrastructures, can finish the training of a 2-layer graph attention network
on a graph with billions of nodes and hundred billions of edges in 14 hours,
and complete the inference in 1.2 hour.

Title: Fragility of spectral clustering for networks with an overlapping
  structure
Authors: Chihiro Noguchi and Tatsuro Kawamoto
Categories: cs.SI cond-mat.stat-mech physics.soc-ph
Comments: 22 pages, 15 figures
\\
  Groups, or communities, commonly overlap in real-world networks. This is a
motivation to develop overlapping community detection methods, because methods
for non-overlapping communities may not perform well. However, deterioration
mechanism of the detection methods used for non-overlapping communities have
rarely been investigated theoretically. Here, we analyze the performance of
spectral clustering, which does not consider overlapping structures, by using
the replica method from statistical physics. Our analysis on an overlapping
stochastic block model reveals how the structural information is lost from the
leading eigenvector because of the overlapping structure.

Title: Modeling the Popularity of Twitter Hashtags with Master Equations
Authors: Oscar Fontanelli, Ricardo Mansilla
Categories: cs.SI math.PR
Comments: 15 pages, 1 figure
\\
  In this work we introduce a model based on master equations to describe the
time evolution of the popularity of topics and hashtags on the Twitter social
network. Specifically, we model the number of times a certain hashtag appears
on the network as a function of time. In our model, the behavior of this
quantity depends on the degree distribution of the network and the extrinsic
interest the community has for the topic or hashtag. From the master equation,
we are able to obtain explicit solutions for the mean and variance. We propose
a gamma kernel function to model the topic popularity, which is quite simple
and yields reasonable results. Finally, we validate the plausibility of the
model by analyzing actual Twitter data obtained through the public API.

Title: Properties of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Graphs
Authors: Hang Chen, Vahan Hurovan, Stephen Kobourov
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  We study graph properties, such as diameter, density and clustering
coefficients, and the relationships between these graph properties. Whereas for
graphs on small number of vertices we can exactly compute the average values
and range for each property of interest, this becomes infeasible for larger
graphs. Thus, we analyze graph properties and the relationships between the
properties using Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, which model well the underlying
graph space. Specifically, we focus on thirteen properties of interest in graph
theory and graph mining. We numerically study the behavior of these properties,
as the number of vertices increase, for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model and compare
the results with known theoretical bounds, where applicable. We also use linear
and non-linear models to predict a specific property based on the other
properties.

Title: EPINE: Enhanced Proximity Information Network Embedding
Authors: Luoyi Zhang, Ming Xu
Categories: cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Unsupervised homogeneous network embedding (NE) represents every vertex of
networks into a low-dimensional vector and meanwhile preserves the network
information. Adjacency matrices retain most of the network information, and
directly charactrize the first-order proximity. In this work, we devote to
mining valuable information in adjacency matrices at a deeper level. Under the
same objective, many NE methods calculate high-order proximity by the powers of
adjacency matrices, which is not accurate and well-designed enough. Instead, we
propose to redefine high-order proximity in a more intuitive manner. Besides,
we design a novel algorithm for calculation, which alleviates the scalability
problem in the field of accurate calculation for high-order proximity.
Comprehensive experiments on real-world network datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in downstream machine learning tasks such as
network reconstruction, link prediction and node classification.

Title: The Multi-granularity in Graph Revealed by a Generalized Leading Tree
Authors: Shun Fu and Ji Xu
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  There are hierarchical characteristics in the network and how to effectively
reveal the hierarchical characteristics in the network is a problem in the
research of network structure. If a node is assigned to the community to which
it belongs, how to assign the community to a higher level of community to which
it belongs is a problem. In this paper, the density of data points is
investigated based on the clustering task. By forming the density of data
points, the hierarchical difference of data points is constructed. In
combination with the distance between data points, a density-based leading tree
can be constructed. But in a graph structure, it is a problem to build a lead
tree that reveals the hierarchical relationships of the nodes on the graph.
Based on the method of tree formation based on density, this paper extends the
model of leading tree to the hierarchical structure of graph nodes, discusses
the importance of graph nodes, and forms a leading tree that can reveal the
hierarchical structure of graph nodes and the dependency of community.
Experiments were carried out on real data sets, and a tree structure was formed
in the experiment. This graph leading tree can well reveal the hierarchical
relationships in the graph structure.

  This paper introduces a Deep Reinforcement Learning based control

key challenge in protective relay control is to quickly and accurately detect
faults from other disturbances in the system. The performance of widely-used
traditional overcurrent protection scheme is limited by factors including
distributed generations, power electronic interfaced devices and fault
impedance. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach that is highly

Title: Univariate ReLU neural network and its application in nonlinear system
  identification
Authors: Xinglong Liang and Jun Xu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY eess.SP
Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures
\\
  ReLU (rectified linear units) neural network has received significant
attention since its emergence. In this paper, a univariate ReLU (UReLU) neural
network is proposed to both modelling the nonlinear dynamic system and
revealing insights about the system. Specifically, the neural network consists
of neurons with linear and UReLU activation functions, and the UReLU functions
are defined as the ReLU functions respect to each dimension. The UReLU neural
network is a single hidden layer neural network, and the structure is
relatively simple. The initialization of the neural network employs the
decoupling method, which provides a good initialization and some insight into
the nonlinear system. Compared with normal ReLU neural network, the number of
parameters of UReLU network is less, but it still provide a good approximation
of the nonlinear dynamic system. The performance of the UReLU neural network is
shown through a Hysteretic benchmark system: the Bouc-Wen system. Simulation
results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Robust Market Making via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Thomas Spooner, Rahul Savani
Categories: q-fin.TR cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures
\\
  We show that adversarial reinforcement learning (ARL) can be used to produce
market marking agents that are robust to adversarial and adaptively chosen
market conditions. To apply ARL, we turn the well-studied single-agent model of
Avellaneda and Stoikov [2008] into a discrete-time zero-sum game between a
market maker and adversary, a proxy for other market participants who would
like to profit at the market maker's expense. We empirically compare two
conventional single-agent RL agents with ARL, and show that our ARL approach
leads to: 1) the emergence of naturally risk-averse behaviour without
constraints or domain-specific penalties; 2) significant improvements in
performance across a set of standard metrics, evaluated with or without an
adversary in the test environment, and; 3) improved robustness to model
uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that our ARL method consistently
converges, and we prove for several special cases that the profiles that we
converge to are Nash equilibria in a corresponding simplified single-stage
game.

system. Through adding an audio-agnostic universal perturbation on arbitrary
enrolled speaker's voice input, the DNN-based speaker recognition system would
identify the speaker as any target (i.e., adversary-desired) speaker label. In
addition, we improve the robustness of our attack by modeling the sound
distortions caused by the physical over-the-air propagation through estimating
room impulse response (RIR). Experiment using a public dataset of $109$ English
speakers demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed attack
with a high attack success rate of over 90%. The attack launching time also
achieves a 100X speedup over contemporary non-universal attacks.

Title: Phase transitions in a decentralized graph-based approach to human
  language
Authors: Javier Vera, Felipe Urbina and Wenceslao Palma
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.CL
\\
  Zipf's law establishes a scaling behavior for word-frequencies in large text
corpora. The appearance of Zipfian properties in human language has been
previously explained as an optimization problem for the interests of speakers
and hearers. On the other hand, human-like vocabularies can be viewed as
bipartite graphs. The aim here is double: within a bipartite-graph approach to
human vocabularies, to propose a decentralized language game model for the
formation of Zipfian properties. To do this, we define a language game, in
which a population of artificial agents is involved in idealized linguistic
interactions. Numerical simulations show the appearance of a phase transition
from an initially disordered state to three possible phases for language
formation. Our results suggest that Zipfian properties in language seem to
arise partly from decentralized linguistic interactions between agents endowed
with bipartite word-meaning mappings.

Title: Harnessing Multi-View Perspective of Light Fields for Low-Light Imaging
Authors: Mohit Lamba, Kranthi Kumar, Kaushik Mitra
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Light Field (LF) offers unique advantages such as post-capture refocusing and
depth estimation, but low-light conditions limit these capabilities. To restore
low-light LFs we should harness the geometric cues present in different LF
views, which is not possible using single-frame low-light enhancement
techniques. We, therefore, propose a deep neural network for Low-Light Light
Field (L3F) restoration, which we refer to as L3Fnet. The proposed L3Fnet not
only performs the necessary visual enhancement of each LF view but also
preserves the epipolar geometry across views. We achieve this by adopting a
two-stage architecture for L3Fnet. Stage-I looks at all the LF views to encode
the LF geometry. This encoded information is then used in Stage-II to
reconstruct each LF view. To facilitate learning-based techniques for low-light
LF imaging, we collected a comprehensive LF dataset of various scenes. For each
scene, we captured four LFs, one with near-optimal exposure and ISO settings
and the others at different levels of low-light conditions varying from low to
extreme low-light settings. The effectiveness of the proposed L3Fnet is
supported by both visual and numerical comparisons on this dataset. To further
analyze the performance of low-light reconstruction methods, we also propose an
L3F-wild dataset that contains LF captured late at night with almost zero lux
values. No ground truth is available in this dataset. To perform well on the
L3F-wild dataset, any method must adapt to the light level of the captured
scene. To do this we propose a novel pre-processing block that makes L3Fnet
robust to various degrees of low-light conditions. Lastly, we show that L3Fnet
can also be used for low-light enhancement of single-frame images, despite it
being engineered for LF data. We do so by converting the single-frame DSLR
image into a form suitable to L3Fnet, which we call as pseudo-LF.

Title: Cumulant-free closed-form formulas for some common (dis)similarities
  between densities of an exponential family
Authors: Frank Nielsen and Richard Nock
Categories: math.ST cs.CV cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.TH
Comments: 27 pages
\\
  It is well-known that the Bhattacharyya, Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler,
$\alpha$-divergences, and Jeffreys' divergences between densities belonging to
a same exponential family have generic closed-form formulas relying on the
strictly convex and real-analytic cumulant function characterizing the
exponential family. In this work, we report (dis)similarity formulas which
bypass the explicit use of the cumulant function and highlight the role of
quasi-arithmetic means and their multivariate mean operator extensions. In
practice, these cumulant-free formulas are handy when implementing these
(dis)similarities using legacy Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) since
our method requires only to partially factorize the densities canonically of
the considered exponential family.

\\
  QSW_MPI is a python package developed for the modeling of quantum stochastic
walks, a generalization of the classical random walk and continuous-time
quantum walk in the Lindblad formalism. This model allows for the study of a
wide range of Markovian open quantum systems subject to varying degrees of
incoherent scattering. Consisting of a python interface built on parallelized
Fortran libraries utilizing sparse data structures; QSW_MPI is scalable to
massively parallel computers, making possible the simulation of walks on graphs
with many thousands of vertices. QSW_MPI also provides explicit support for an
extension of the standard quantum stochastic walk model to the study of
non-Hermitian absorption and emission processes.

Title: Optimal matroid bases with intersection constraints: Valuated matroids,
  M-convex functions, and their applications
Authors: Yuni Iwamasa, Kenjiro Takazawa
Categories: math.CO cs.DM
Comments: Full version of a TAMC 2020 paper
\\
  For two matroids $M_1$ and $M_2$ with the same ground set $V$ and two cost
functions $w_1$ and $w_2$ on $2^V$, we consider the problem of finding bases
$X_1$ of $M_1$ and $X_2$ of $M_2$ minimizing $w_1(X_1)+w_2(X_2)$ subject to a
certain cardinality constraint on their intersection $X_1 \cap X_2$. Lendl,
Peis, and Timmermans (2019) discussed modular cost functions: they reduced the
problem to weighted matroid intersection for the case where the cardinality
constraint is $|X_1 \cap X_2|\le k$ or $|X_1 \cap X_2|\ge k$; and designed a
new primal-dual algorithm for the case where the constraint is $|X_1 \cap
X_2|=k$.
  The aim of this paper is to generalize the problems to have nonlinear convex
cost functions, and to comprehend them from the viewpoint of discrete convex
analysis. We prove that each generalized problem can be solved via valuated
independent assignment, valuated matroid intersection, or $\mathrm{M}$-convex
submodular flow, to offer a comprehensive understanding of weighted matroid
intersection with intersection constraints. We also show the NP-hardness of
some variants of these problems, which clarifies the coverage of discrete
convex analysis for those problems. Finally, we present applications of our
generalized problems in the recoverable robust matroid basis problem, matroid
congestion games, and combinatorial optimization problems with interaction
costs.

Title: Central limit theorems for additive functionals and fringe trees in
  tries
Authors: Svante Janson
Categories: math.PR cs.DS
Comments: 74 pages
MSC-class: 60C05, 05C05, 68P05
\\
  We give general theorems on asymptotic normality for additive functionals of
random tries generated by a sequence of independent strings. These theorems are
applied to show asymptotic normality of the distribution of random fringe trees
in a random trie. Formulas for asymptotic mean and variance are given. In
particular, the proportion of fringe trees of size $k$ (defined as number of
keys) is asymptotically, ignoring oscillations, $c/(k(k-1))$ for $k\ge2$, where
$c=1/(1+H)$ with $H$ the entropy of the digits. Another application gives
asymptotic normality of the number of $k$-protected nodes in a random trie. For
symmetric tries, it is shown that the asymptotic proportion of $k$-protected
nodes (ignoring oscillations) decreases geometrically as $k\to\infty$.

Title: Compute-and-Forward Network Coding Design over Multi-Source Multi-Relay
  Channels
Authors: Lili Wei and Wen Chen
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Network coding is a new and promising paradigm for modern communication
networks by allowing intermediate nodes to mix messages received from multiple
sources. Compute-and-forward strategy is one category of network coding in
which a relay will decode and forward a linear combination of source messages
according to the observed channel coefficients, based on the algebraic
structure of lattice codes. The destination will recover all transmitted
messages if enough linear equations are received. In this work, we design in a
system level, the compute-and-forward network coding coefficients by
Fincke-Pohst based candidate set searching algorithm and network coding system
matrix constructing algorithm, such that by those proposed algorithms, the
transmission rate of the multi-source multi-relay system is maximized.
Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Title: Approximate Message Passing with a Colored Aliasing Model for Variable

ACM-class: G.1.3
\\
  The Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm efficiently reconstructs
signals which have been sampled with large i.i.d. sub-Gaussian sensing
matrices. However, when Fourier coefficients of a signal with non-uniform
spectral density are sampled, such as in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the
aliasing is intrinsically colored. Consequently, AMP's i.i.d. state evolution
is no longer accurate and the algorithm encounters convergence problems. In
response, we propose an algorithm based on Orthogonal Approximate Message
Passing (OAMP) that uses the wavelet domain to model the colored aliasing. We
present empirical evidence that a structured state evolution occurs, where the
effective noise covariance matrix is diagonal with one unique entry per
subband. A benefit of state evolution is that Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate
(SURE) can be effectively implemented, yielding an algorithm with no free
parameters. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the parameter-free
algorithm on a synthetic image with three variable density sampling schemes and
find that it converges in over 20x fewer iterations than optimally tuned Fast
Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding (FISTA).

Title: Multiple Patients Behavior Detection in Real-time using mmWave Radar and

DOI: 10.1109/RADAR.2019.8835656
\\
  To address potential gaps noted in patient monitoring in the hospital, a
novel patient behavior detection system using mmWave radar and deep convolution
neural network (CNN), which supports the simultaneous recognition of multiple
patients' behaviors in real-time, is proposed. In this study, we use an mmWave
radar to track multiple patients and detect the scattering point cloud of each
one. For each patient, the Doppler pattern of the point cloud over a time
period is collected as the behavior signature. A three-layer CNN model is
created to classify the behavior for each patient. The tracking and point
clouds detection algorithm was also implemented on an mmWave radar hardware
platform with an embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) board to collect
Doppler pattern and run the CNN model. A training dataset of six types of
behavior were collected, over a long duration, to train the model using Adam
optimizer with an objective to minimize cross-entropy loss function. Lastly,
the system was tested for real-time operation and obtained a very good
inference accuracy when predicting each patient's behavior in a two-patient
scenario.

Title: MmWave Radar Point Cloud Segmentation using GMM in Multimodal Traffic
  Monitoring
Authors: Feng Jin, Arindam Sengupta, Siyang Cao and Yao-Jan Wu
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: This paper has been accepted by the IEEE International Radar
  Conference 2020
\\
  In multimodal traffic monitoring, we gather traffic statistics for distinct
transportation modes, such as pedestrians, cars and bicycles, in order to
analyze and improve people's daily mobility in terms of safety and convenience.
On account of its robustness to bad light and adverse weather conditions, and
inherent speed measurement ability, the radar sensor is a suitable option for
this application. However, the sparse radar data from conventional commercial
radars make it extremely challenging for transportation mode classification.
Thus, we propose to use a high-resolution millimeter-wave(mmWave) radar sensor
to obtain a relatively richer radar point cloud representation for a traffic
monitoring scenario. Based on a new feature vector, we use the multivariate
Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to do the radar point cloud segmentation, i.e.
`point-wise' classification, in an unsupervised learning environment. In our
experiment, we collected radar point clouds for pedestrians and cars, which
also contained the inevitable clutter from the surroundings. The experimental
results using GMM on the new feature vector demonstrated a good segmentation
performance in terms of the intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. The detailed
methodology and validation metrics are presented and discussed.

Title: mm-Pose: Real-Time Human Skeletal Posture Estimation using mmWave Radars
  and CNNs
Authors: Arindam Sengupta, Feng Jin, Renyuan Zhang and Siyang Cao
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Sensors Journal
\\
  In this paper, mm-Pose, a novel approach to detect and track human skeletons
in real-time using an mmWave radar, is proposed. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, this is the first method to detect >15 distinct skeletal joints
using mmWave radar reflection signals. The proposed method would find several
applications in traffic monitoring systems, autonomous vehicles, patient
monitoring systems and defense forces to detect and track human skeleton for
effective and preventive decision making in real-time. The use of radar makes
the system operationally robust to scene lighting and adverse weather
conditions. The reflected radar point cloud in range, azimuth and elevation are
first resolved and projected in Range-Azimuth and Range-Elevation planes. A
novel low-size high-resolution radar-to-image representation is also presented,
that overcomes the sparsity in traditional point cloud data and offers
significant reduction in the subsequent machine learning architecture. The RGB
channels were assigned with the normalized values of range, elevation/azimuth
and the power level of the reflection signals for each of the points. A forked
CNN architecture was used to predict the real-world position of the skeletal
joints in 3-D space, using the radar-to-image representation. The proposed
method was tested for a single human scenario for four primary motions, (i)
Walking, (ii) Swinging left arm, (iii) Swinging right arm, and (iv) Swinging
both arms to validate accurate predictions for motion in range, azimuth and
elevation. The detailed methodology, implementation, challenges, and validation
results are presented.

Comments: Prepared for submission to JCAP
\\
  In this work we present a Neural Network (NN) algorithm for the
identification of the appropriate parametrization of diffuse polarized Galactic
emissions in the context of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) $B$-mode
multi-frequency observations. In particular, we have focused our analysis on
low frequency foregrounds relevant for polarization observation: namely
Galactic Synchrotron and Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME). We have
implemented and tested our approach on a set of simulated maps corresponding to
the frequency coverage and sensitivity represented by future satellite and low
frequency ground based probes. The NN efficiency in recognizing the right
parametrization of foreground emission in different sky regions reaches an
accuracy of about $90\%$. We have compared this performance with the $\chi^{2}$
information following parametric foreground estimation using multi-frequency
fitting, and quantify the gain provided by a NN approach. Our results show the
relevance of model recognition in CMB $B$-mode observations, and highlight the
exploitation of dedicated procedures to this purpose.

Title: Approximating the Hotelling Observer with Autoencoder-Learned Efficient
  Channels for Binary Signal Detection Tasks
Authors: Jason L. Granstedt and Weimin Zhou and Mark A. Anastasio
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE-TMI
\\
  The objective assessment of image quality (IQ) has been advocated for the
analysis and optimization of medical imaging systems. One method of obtaining
such IQ metrics is through a mathematical observer. The Bayesian ideal observer
is optimal by definition for signal detection tasks, but is frequently both
intractable and non-linear. As an alternative, linear observers are sometimes
used for task-based image quality assessment. The optimal linear observer is
the Hotelling observer (HO). The computational cost of calculating the HO
increases with image size, making a reduction in the dimensionality of the data
desirable. Channelized methods have become popular for this purpose, and many
competing methods are available for computing efficient channels. In this work,
a novel method for learning channels using an autoencoder (AE) is presented.
AEs are a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are frequently employed
to learn concise representations of data to reduce dimensionality. Modifying
the traditional AE loss function to focus on task-relevant information permits
the development of efficient AE-channels. These AE-channels were trained and
tested on a variety of signal shapes and backgrounds to evaluate their
performance. In the experiments, the AE-learned channels were competitive with
and frequently outperformed other state-of-the-art methods for approximating
the HO. The performance gains were greatest for the datasets with a small
number of training images and noisy estimates of the signal image. Overall, AEs
are demonstrated to be competitive with state-of-the-art methods for generating
efficient channels for the HO and can have superior performance on small
datasets.

  Recent literature implements machine learning techniques to assess corporate
credit rating based on financial statement reports. In this work, we analyze
the performance of four neural network architectures (MLP, CNN, CNN2D, LSTM) in
predicting corporate credit rating as issued by Standard and Poor's. We analyze
companies from the energy, financial and healthcare sectors in US. The goal of
the analysis is to improve application of machine learning algorithms to credit
assessment. To this end, we focus on three questions. First, we investigate if
the algorithms perform better when using a selected subset of features, or if
it is better to allow the algorithms to select features themselves. Second, is
the temporal aspect inherent in financial data important for the results
obtained by a machine learning algorithm? Third, is there a particular neural
network architecture that consistently outperforms others with respect to input
features, sectors and holdout set? We create several case studies to answer
these questions and analyze the results using ANOVA and multiple comparison

Title: Nonlinear Time Series Classification Using Bispectrum-based Deep
  Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Paul A. Parker, Scott H. Holan, Nalini Ravishanker
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Time series classification using novel techniques has experienced a recent
resurgence and growing interest from statisticians, subject-domain scientists,
and decision makers in business and industry. This is primarily due to the ever
increasing amount of big and complex data produced as a result of technological
advances. A motivating example is that of Google trends data, which exhibit
highly nonlinear behavior. Although a rich literature exists for addressing
this problem, existing approaches mostly rely on first and second order
properties of the time series, since they typically assume linearity of the
underlying process. Often, these are inadequate for effective classification of
nonlinear time series data such as Google Trends data. Given these
methodological deficiencies and the abundance of nonlinear time series that
persist among real-world phenomena, we introduce an approach that merges higher
order spectral analysis (HOSA) with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
for classifying time series. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated
using simulated data and two motivating industry examples that involve Google
trends data and electronic device energy consumption data.

Title: Bayesian System ID: Optimal management of parameter, model, and
  measurement uncertainty
Authors: Nicholas Galioto and Alex Gorodetsky
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.DS physics.data-an
\\
  We evaluate the robustness of a probabilistic formulation of system
identification (ID) to sparse, noisy, and indirect data. Specifically, we
compare estimators of future system behavior derived from the Bayesian
posterior of a learning problem to several commonly used least squares-based
optimization objectives used in system ID. Our comparisons indicate that the
log posterior has improved geometric properties compared with the objective
function surfaces of traditional methods that include differentially
constrained least squares and least squares reconstructions of discrete time
steppers like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). These properties allow it to be
both more sensitive to new data and less affected by multiple minima ---
overall yielding a more robust approach. Our theoretical results indicate that
least squares and regularized least squares methods like dynamic mode
decomposition and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) can be
derived from the probabilistic formulation by assuming noiseless measurements.
We also analyze the computational complexity of a Gaussian filter-based
approximate marginal Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme that we use to obtain the
Bayesian posterior for both linear and nonlinear problems. We then empirically
demonstrate that obtaining the marginal posterior of the parameter dynamics and
making predictions by extracting optimal estimators (e.g., mean, median, mode)
yields orders of magnitude improvement over the aforementioned approaches. We
attribute this performance to the fact that the Bayesian approach captures
parameter, model, and measurement uncertainties, whereas the other methods
typically neglect at least one type of uncertainty.

Title: On the Convergence of Adam and Adagrad
Authors: Alexandre D\'efossez, L\'eon Bottou, Francis Bach, Nicolas Usunier
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 19 pages, 0 figures, preprint version
\\
  We provide a simple proof of the convergence of the optimization algorithms
Adam and Adagrad with the assumptions of smooth gradients and almost sure
uniform bound on the $\ell_\infty$ norm of the gradients. This work builds on
the techniques introduced by Ward et al. (2019) and extends them to the Adam
optimizer. We show that in expectation, the squared norm of the objective
gradient averaged over the trajectory has an upper-bound which is explicit in
the constants of the problem, parameters of the optimizer and the total number
of iterations N. This bound can be made arbitrarily small. In particular, Adam
with a learning rate $\alpha=1/\sqrt{N}$ and a momentum parameter on squared
gradients $\beta_2=1 - 1/N$ achieves the same rate of convergence
$O(\ln(N)/\sqrt{N})$ as Adagrad. Thus, it is possible to use Adam as a finite
horizon version of Adagrad, much like constant step size SGD can be used
instead of its asymptotically converging decaying step size version.

  Eigengap," in IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 2020
DOI: 10.1109/LSP.2019.2961071
\\
  In this study, we propose a new spectral clustering framework that can
auto-tune the parameters of the clustering algorithm in the context of speaker
diarization. The proposed framework uses normalized maximum eigengap (NME)
values to estimate the number of clusters and the parameters for the threshold
of the elements of each row in an affinity matrix during spectral clustering,
without the use of parameter tuning on the development set. Even through this
hands-off approach, we achieve a comparable or better performance across
various evaluation sets than the results found using traditional clustering
methods that apply careful parameter tuning and development data. A relative
improvement of 17% in the speaker error rate on the well-known CALLHOME
evaluation set shows the effectiveness of our proposed spectral clustering with
auto-tuning.

Title: Individual Claims Forecasting with Bayesian Mixture Density Networks
Authors: Kevin Kuo
Categories: stat.AP cs.LG
\\
  We introduce an individual claims forecasting framework utilizing Bayesian
mixture density networks that can be used for claims analytics tasks such as
case reserving and triaging. The proposed approach enables incorporating claims
information from both structured and unstructured data sources, producing
multi-period cash flow forecasts, and generating different scenarios of future
payment patterns. We implement and evaluate the modeling framework using
publicly available data.

  We consider the problem of neural network training in a time-varying context.
Machine learning algorithms have excelled in problems that do not change over
time. However, problems encountered in financial markets are often
non-stationary. We propose the online early stopping algorithm and show that a
neural network trained using this algorithm can track a function changing with
unknown dynamics. We applied the proposed algorithm to the stock return
prediction problem studied in Gu et al. (2019) and achieved mean rank
correlation of 4.69%, almost twice as high as the expanding window approach. We
also show that prominent factors, such as the size effect and momentum, exhibit
time varying stock return predictiveness.

Title: $MC^2RAM$: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling in SRAM for Fast Bayesian
  Inference

Categories: eess.SP cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: This paper has been accepted at the IEEE International Symposium on
  Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) to be held in May 2020 at Seville, Spain
\\
  This work discusses the implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling from an arbitrary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) within SRAM. We show a
novel architecture of SRAM by embedding it with random number generators
(RNGs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs), and analog-to-digital converters
(ADCs) so that SRAM arrays can be used for high performance Metropolis-Hastings
(MH) algorithm-based MCMC sampling. Most of the expensive computations are
performed within the SRAM and can be parallelized for high speed sampling. Our
iterative compute flow minimizes data movement during sampling. We characterize
power-performance trade-off of our design by simulating on 45 nm CMOS
technology. For a two-dimensional, two mixture GMM, the implementation consumes
~ 91 micro-Watts power per sampling iteration and produces 500 samples in 2000
clock cycles on an average at 1 GHz clock frequency. Our study highlights
interesting insights on how low-level hardware non-idealities can affect
high-level sampling characteristics, and recommends ways to optimally operate
SRAM within area/power constraints for high performance sampling.

Title: Machine Learning for Predictive Deployment of UAVs with Multiple Access
Authors: Linyan Lu and Zhaohui Yang and Mingzhe Chen and Zelin Zang and and
  Mohammad Shikh-Bahaei
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, a machine learning based deployment framework of unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) is studied. In the considered model, UAVs are deployed
as flying base stations (BS) to offload heavy traffic from ground BSs. Due to
time-varying traffic distribution, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based
prediction algorithm is introduced to predict the future cellular traffic. To
predict the user service distribution, a KEG algorithm, which is a joint
K-means and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm based on Gaussian mixture
model (GMM), is proposed for determining the service area of each UAV. Based on
the predicted traffic, the optimal UAV positions are derived and three
multi-access techniques are compared so as to minimize the total transmit
power. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce up to 24\%
of the total power consumption compared to the conventional method without
traffic prediction. Besides, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) has the
lower required transmit power compared to frequency domain multiple access
(FDMA) and time domain multiple access (TDMA).

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for QoS-Constrained Resource Allocation in
  Multiservice Networks

Comments: Submitted to "Journal of Communication and Information System"
\\
  In this article, we study a Radio Resource Allocation (RRA) that was
formulated as a non-convex optimization problem whose main aim is to maximize
the spectral efficiency subject to satisfaction guarantees in multiservice
wireless systems. This problem has already been previously investigated in the
literature and efficient heuristics have been proposed. However, in order to
assess the performance of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms when solving
optimization problems in the context of RRA, we revisit that problem and
propose a solution based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework.
Specifically, a distributed optimization method based on multi-agent deep RL is
developed, where each agent makes its decisions to find a policy by interacting
with the local environment, until reaching convergence. Thus, this article
focuses on an application of RL and our main proposal consists in a new deep RL
based approach to jointly deal with RRA, satisfaction guarantees and Quality of
Service (QoS) constraints in multiservice celular networks. Lastly, through
computational simulations we compare the state-of-art solutions of the
literature with our proposal and we show a near optimal performance of the
latter in terms of throughput and outage rate.

Title: Watch and learn -- a generalized approach for transferrable learning in
  deep neural networks via physical principles
Authors: Kyle Sprague and Juan Carrasquilla and Steve Whitelam and Isaac

\\
  Transfer learning refers to the use of knowledge gained while solving a
machine learning task and applying it to the solution of a closely related
problem. Such an approach has enabled scientific breakthroughs in computer
vision and natural language processing where the weights learned in
state-of-the-art models can be used to initialize models for other tasks which
dramatically improve their performance and save computational time. Here we
demonstrate an unsupervised learning approach augmented with basic physical
principles that achieves fully transferrable learning for problems in
statistical physics across different physical regimes. By coupling a sequence
model based on a recurrent neural network to an extensive deep neural network,
we are able to learn the equilibrium probability distributions and
inter-particle interaction models of classical statistical mechanical systems.
Our approach, distribution-consistent learning, DCL, is a general strategy that
works for a variety of canonical statistical mechanical models (Ising and
Potts) as well as disordered (spin-glass) interaction potentials. Using data
collected from a single set of observation conditions, DCL successfully
extrapolates across all temperatures, thermodynamic phases, and can be applied
to different length-scales. This constitutes a fully transferrable
physics-based learning in a generalizable approach.

Title: Learning in the Sky: An Efficient 3D Placement of UAVs
Authors: Atefeh Hajijamali Arani, M. Mahdi Azari, William Melek, and Safieddin
  Safavi-Naeini
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations can
deliver a fast and flexible solution for serving varying traffic demand. In
order to adequately benefit of UAVs deployment, their efficient placement is of
utmost importance, and requires to intelligently adapt to the environment
changes. In this paper, we propose a learning-based mechanism for the
three-dimensional deployment of UAVs assisting terrestrial cellular networks in
the downlink. The problem is modeled as a non-cooperative game among UAVs in
satisfaction form. To solve the game, we utilize a low complexity algorithm, in
which unsatisfied UAVs update their locations based on a learning algorithm.
Simulation results reveal that the proposed UAV placement algorithm yields
significant performance gains up to about 52% and 74% in terms of throughput
and the number of dropped users, respectively, compared to an optimized
baseline algorithm.

Title: Learning-Based Link Scheduling in Millimeter-wave Multi-connectivity
  Scenarios
Authors: Cristian Tatino, Nikolaos Pappas, Ilaria Malanchini, Lutz Ewe, and Di
  Yuan
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG cs.NI stat.ML
\\
  Multi-connectivity is emerging as a promising solution to provide reliable
communications and seamless connectivity for the millimeter-wave frequency
range. Due to the blockage sensitivity at such high frequencies, connectivity
with multiple cells can drastically increase the network performance in terms
of throughput and reliability. However, an inefficient link scheduling, i.e.,
over and under-provisioning of connections, can lead either to high
interference and energy consumption or to unsatisfied user's quality of service
(QoS) requirements. In this work, we present a learning-based solution that is
able to learn and then to predict the optimal link scheduling to satisfy users'
QoS requirements while avoiding communication interruptions. Moreover, we
compare the proposed approach with two base line methods and the genie-aided
link scheduling that assumes perfect channel knowledge. We show that the
learning-based solution approaches the optimum and outperforms the base line
methods.

Title: Multi-Scale Neural network for EEG Representation Learning in BCI
Authors: Wonjun Ko, Eunjin Jeon, Seungwoo Jeong, and Heung-Il Suk
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Recent advances in deep learning have had a methodological and practical
impact on brain-computer interface research. Among the various deep network
architectures, convolutional neural networks have been well suited for
spatio-spectral-temporal electroencephalogram signal representation learning.
Most of the existing CNN-based methods described in the literature extract
features at a sequential level of abstraction with repetitive nonlinear
operations and involve densely connected layers for classification. However,
studies in neurophysiology have revealed that EEG signals carry information in
different ranges of frequency components. To better reflect these
multi-frequency properties in EEGs, we propose a novel deep multi-scale neural
network that discovers feature representations in multiple frequency/time
ranges and extracts relationships among electrodes, i.e., spatial
representations, for subject intention/condition identification. Furthermore,
by completely representing EEG signals with spatio-spectral-temporal
information, the proposed method can be utilized for diverse paradigms in both
active and passive BCIs, contrary to existing methods that are primarily
focused on single-paradigm BCIs. To demonstrate the validity of our proposed
method, we conducted experiments on various paradigms of active/passive BCI
datasets. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method
achieved performance improvements when judged against comparable
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we analyzed the proposed method using
different techniques, such as PSD curves and relevance score inspection to
validate the multi-scale EEG signal information capturing ability, activation
pattern maps for investigating the learned spatial filters, and t-SNE plotting
for visualizing represented features. Finally, we also demonstrated our
method's application to real-world problems.

Title: Hybrid modeling: Applications in real-time diagnosis
Authors: Ion Matei, Johan de Kleer, Alexander Feldman, Rahul Rai, Souma
  Chowdhury
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG math.DS math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Reduced-order models that accurately abstract high fidelity models and enable
faster simulation is vital for real-time, model-based diagnosis applications.
In this paper, we outline a novel hybrid modeling approach that combines
machine learning inspired models and physics-based models to generate
reduced-order models from high fidelity models. We are using such models for
real-time diagnosis applications. Specifically, we have developed machine
learning inspired representations to generate reduced order component models
that preserve, in part, the physical interpretation of the original high
fidelity component models. To ensure the accuracy, scalability and numerical
stability of the learning algorithms when training the reduced-order models we
use optimization platforms featuring automatic differentiation. Training data
is generated by simulating the high-fidelity model. We showcase our approach in
the context of fault diagnosis of a rail switch system. Three new model
abstractions whose complexities are two orders of magnitude smaller than the
complexity of the high fidelity model, both in the number of equations and
simulation time are shown. The numerical experiments and results demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed hybrid modeling approach.

Title: Knot Selection in Sparse Gaussian Processes with a Variational Objective
Authors: Nathaniel Garton and Jarad Niemi and Alicia Carriquiry
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Sparse, knot-based Gaussian processes have enjoyed considerable success as
scalable approximations to full Gaussian processes. Certain sparse models can
be derived through specific variational approximations to the true posterior,
and knots can be selected to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
the approximate and true posterior. While this has been a successful approach,
simultaneous optimization of knots can be slow due to the number of parameters
being optimized. Furthermore, there have been few proposed methods for
selecting the number of knots, and no experimental results exist in the
literature. We propose using a one-at-a-time knot selection algorithm based on
Bayesian optimization to select the number and locations of knots. We showcase
the competitive performance of this method relative to simultaneous
optimization of knots on three benchmark data sets, but at a fraction of the
computational cost.

indicator works, empirical evidence achieved on a toy examples and simulated
data are provided. On the basis of results at hand, we underline that our
approach discriminates better for model selection with respect to performance
indexes proposed in the literature.

Title: Overdetermined independent vector analysis

Categories: eess.AS cs.SD eess.SP
Comments: To appear at the 45th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech,
  and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2020)
\\
  We address the convolutive blind source separation problem for the
(over-)determined case where (i) the number of nonstationary target-sources $K$
is less than that of microphones $M$, and (ii) there are up to $M - K$
stationary Gaussian noises that need not to be extracted. Independent vector
analysis (IVA) can solve the problem by separating into $M$ sources and
selecting the top $K$ highly nonstationary signals among them, but this
approach suffers from a waste of computation especially when $K \ll M$. Channel
reductions in preprocessing of IVA by, e.g., principle component analysis have
the risk of removing the target signals. We here extend IVA to resolve these
issues. One such extension has been attained by assuming the orthogonality
constraint (OC) that the sample correlation between the target and noise
signals is to be zero. The proposed IVA, on the other hand, does not rely on OC
and exploits only the independence between sources and the stationarity of the
noises. This enables us to develop several efficient algorithms based on block
coordinate descent methods with a problem specific acceleration. We clarify
that one such algorithm exactly coincides with the conventional IVA with OC,
and also explain that the other newly developed algorithms are faster than it.
Experimental results show the improved computational load of the new algorithms
compared to the conventional methods. In particular, a new algorithm
specialized for $K = 1$ outperforms the others.

Title: HPIPM: a high-performance quadratic programming framework for model
  predictive control
Authors: Gianluca Frison and Moritz Diehl
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  This paper introduces HPIPM, a high-performance framework for quadratic
programming (QP), designed to provide building blocks to efficiently and
reliably solve model predictive control problems. HPIPM currently supports
three QP types, and provides interior point method (IPM) solvers as well
(partial) condensing routines. In particular, the IPM for optimal control QPs
is intended to supersede the HPMPC solver, and it largely improves robustness
while keeping the focus on speed. Numerical experiments show that HPIPM
reliably solves challenging QPs, and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art
solvers in speed.

Title: Neural network based terramechanics modeling and estimation for
  deformable terrains
Authors: James Dallas, Michael P. Cole, Paramsothy Jayakumar, and Tulga Ersal
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  In this work, a neural network based terramechanics model and terrain
estimator are presented with an outlook for optimal control applications such
as model predictive control. Recognizing the limitations of the
state-of-the-art terramechanics models in terms of operating conditions,
computational cost, and continuous differentiability for gradient-based
optimization, an efficient and twice continuously differentiable terramechanics
model is developed using neural networks for dynamic operations on deformable
terrains. It is demonstrated that the neural network terramechanics model is
able to predict the lateral tire forces accurately and efficiently compared to
the Soil Contact Model as a state-of-the-art model. Furthermore, the neural
network terramechanics model is implemented within a terrain estimator and it
is shown that using this model the estimator converges within around 2% of the
true terrain parameter. Finally, with model predictive control applications in
mind, which typically rely on bicycle models for their predictions, it is
demonstrated that utilizing the estimated terrain parameter can reduce
prediction errors of a bicycle model by orders of magnitude. The result is an
efficient, dynamic, twice continuously differentiable terramechanics model and
estimator that has inherent advantages for implementation in model predictive
control as compared to previously established models.

  A recursive least squares algorithm with variable rate forgetting (VRF) is
derived by minimizing a quadratic cost function.Under persistent excitation and
boundedness of the forgetting factor, the minimizer given by VRF is shown to
converge to the true parameters. In addition, under persistent excitation and
with noisy measurements, where the noise is uncorrelated with the regressor,
conditions are given under which the minimizer given by VRF is a consistent
estimator of the true parameters.The results are illustrated by a numerical
example involving abruptly changing parameters.

  The paper provides conditions that guarantee existence and uniqueness of
classical solutions for a non-local conservation law on a ring-road with
possible nudging (or "look behind") terms. The obtained conditions are novel,
as they are not covered by existing results in the literature. The paper also
provides results which indicate that nudging can increase the flow in a
ring-road and, if properly designed, can have a strong stabilizing effect on
traffic flow. More specifically, the paper gives results which guarantee local
exponential stability of the uniform equilibrium in the L2 state norm even for
cases where the uniform equilibrium profile in a ring-road without nudging is
not asymptotically stable and the model admits density waves. The efficiency of
the use of nudging terms is demonstrated by means of a numerical example.even
for cases where the uniform equilibrium profile in a ring-road without nudging
is not asymptotically stable and the model admits density waves. The efficiency
of the use of nudging terms is demonstrated by means of a numerical example.

  training overhead, the maximum number of supportable users, and channel
  estimation error of the two proposed multi-user channel estimation schemes in
  an IRS-assisted multi-user broadband communication system
