Title: Behavior Planning For Connected Autonomous Vehicles Using Feedback Deep
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Songyang Han, Fei Miao
Categories: cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: conference
\\
  With the development of communication technologies, connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) can share information with each other. Besides basic safety
messages, they can also share their future plan. We propose a behavior planning
method for CAVs to decide whether to change lane or keep lane based on the
information received from neighbors and a policy learned by deep reinforcement
learning (DRL). Our state design based on shared information is scalable to the
number of vehicles. The proposed feedback deep Q-learning algorithms integrate
the policy learning process with a continuous state space controller, which in
turn gives feedback about actions and rewards to the learning process. We
design both centralized and distributed DRL algorithms. In experiments, our
behavior planning method can help increase traffic flow and driving comfort
compared with a traditional rule-based control method. It also shows the
distributed learning result is comparable to the centralized learning result,
which reveals the possibility of improving the policy of behavior planning
online. We also validate our algorithm in a more complicated scenario where
there are two road closures on a freeway.

Title: Containment of Simple Regular Path Queries
Authors: Diego Figueira and Adwait Godbole and S. Krishna and Wim Martens and
  Matthias Niewerth and Tina Trautner
Categories: cs.AI cs.DB
\\
  Testing containment of queries is a fundamental reasoning task in knowledge
representation. We study here the containment problem for Conjunctive Regular
Path Queries (CRPQs), a navigational query language extensively used in
ontology and graph database querying. While it is known that containment of
CRPQs is expspace-complete in general, we focus here on severely restricted
fragments, which are known to be highly relevant in practice according to
several recent studies. We obtain a detailed overview of the complexity of the
containment problem, depending on the features used in the regular expressions
of the queries, with completeness results for np, pitwo, pspace or expspace.

Title: Convex Hull Monte-Carlo Tree Search
Authors: Michael Painter, Bruno Lacerda and Nick Hawes
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  This work investigates Monte-Carlo planning for agents in stochastic
environments, with multiple objectives. We propose the Convex Hull Monte-Carlo
Tree-Search (CHMCTS) framework, which builds upon Trial Based Heuristic Tree
Search and Convex Hull Value Iteration (CHVI), as a solution to multi-objective
planning in large environments. Moreover, we consider how to pose the problem
of approximating multiobjective planning solutions as a contextual multi-armed
bandits problem, giving a principled motivation for how to select actions from
the view of contextual regret. This leads us to the use of Contextual Zooming
for action selection, yielding Zooming CHMCTS. We evaluate our algorithm using
the Generalised Deep Sea Treasure environment, demonstrating that Zooming
CHMCTS can achieve a sublinear contextual regret and scales better than CHVI on
a given computational budget.

Title: Exploring Unknown States with Action Balance
Authors: Yan Song, Yingfeng Chen, Yujing Hu, Changjie Fan
Categories: cs.AI cs.GT
\\
  Exploration is a key problem in reinforcement learning. Recently bonus-based
methods have achieved considerable successes in environments where exploration
is difficult such as Montezuma's Revenge, which assign additional bonus (e.g.,
intrinsic reward) to guide the agent to rarely visited states. Since the bonus
is calculated according to the novelty of the next state after performing an
action, we call such methods the next-state bonus methods. However, the
next-state bonus methods bring extra issues. It may lead agent to be trapped in
states that fewer being visited and ignore to explore unknown states. Moreover,
the behavior policy of the agent is also influenced by the bonus added to the
state (or state-action) values indirectly. In contrast to the bonus-based
methods which explore in known states, in this paper, we focus on the other
part of exploration: exploration for finding unknown states. We propose the
action balance exploration method to overcome the defects of the next-state
bonus methods, which balances the chosen time of each action in each state and
can be treated as an extension of upper confidence bound (UCB) to deep
reinforcement learning. To take both the advantages of the next-state bonus
method and our action balance exploration method, we propose the action balance
RND method, which takes both parts of exploration into consideration. The
experiments on grid world and Atari games demonstrate action balance
exploration has a better capability in finding unknown states and can improve
the real performance of RND in some hard exploration environments respectively.

Title: Ecological Semantics: Programming Environments for Situated Language
  Understanding

\\
  Large-scale natural language understanding (NLU) systems have made impressive
progress: they can be applied flexibly across a variety of tasks, and employ
minimal structural assumptions. However, extensive empirical research has shown
this to be a double-edged sword, coming at the cost of shallow understanding:
inferior generalization, grounding and explainability. Grounded language
learning approaches offer the promise of deeper understanding by situating
learning in richer, more structured training environments, but are limited in
scale to relatively narrow, predefined domains. How might we enjoy the best of
both worlds: grounded, general NLU? Following extensive contemporary cognitive
science, we propose treating environments as ``first-class citizens'' in
semantic representations, worthy of research and development in their own
right. Importantly, models should also be partners in the creation and
configuration of environments, rather than just actors within them, as in
existing approaches. To do so, we argue that models must begin to understand
and program in the language of affordances (which define possible actions in a
given situation) both for online, situated discourse comprehension, as well as
large-scale, offline common-sense knowledge mining. To this end we propose an
environment-oriented ecological semantics, outlining theoretical and practical
approaches towards implementation. We further provide actual demonstrations
building upon interactive fiction programming languages.

Title: MQA: Answering the Question via Robotic Manipulation
Authors: Yuhong Deng, Naifu Zhang, Di Guo, Huaping Liu, Fuchun Sun, Chen Pang
  and Jing Pang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In this paper,we propose a novel task of Manipulation Question
Answering(MQA),a class of Question Answering (QA) task, where the robot is
required to find the answer to the question by actively interacting with the
environment via manipulation. Considering the tabletop scenario, a heatmap of
the scene is generated to facilitate the robot to have a semantic understanding
of the scene and an imitation learning approach with semantic understanding
metric is proposed to generate manipulation actions which guide the manipulator
to explore the tabletop to find the answer to the question. Besides, a novel
dataset which contains a variety of tabletop scenarios and corresponding
question-answer pairs is established. Extensive experiments have been conducted
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

\\
  Computational context understanding refers to an agent's ability to fuse
disparate sources of information for decision-making and is, therefore,
generally regarded as a prerequisite for sophisticated machine reasoning
capabilities, such as in artificial intelligence (AI). Data-driven and
knowledge-driven methods are two classical techniques in the pursuit of such
machine sense-making capability. However, while data-driven methods seek to
model the statistical regularities of events by making observations in the
real-world, they remain difficult to interpret and they lack mechanisms for
naturally incorporating external knowledge. Conversely, knowledge-driven
methods, combine structured knowledge bases, perform symbolic reasoning based
on axiomatic principles, and are more interpretable in their inferential
processing; however, they often lack the ability to estimate the statistical
salience of an inference. To combat these issues, we propose the use of hybrid
AI methodology as a general framework for combining the strengths of both
approaches. Specifically, we inherit the concept of neuro-symbolism as a way of
using knowledge-bases to guide the learning progress of deep neural networks.
We further ground our discussion in two applications of neuro-symbolism and, in
both cases, show that our systems maintain interpretability while achieving
comparable performance, relative to the state-of-the-art.

Title: Optimizing Revenue while showing Relevant Assortments at Scale
Authors: Theja Tulabandhula and Deeksha Sinha
Categories: cs.AI cs.CE stat.AP
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1708.05510
\\
  Scalable real-time assortment optimization has become essential in e-commerce
operations due to the need for personalization and the availability of a large
variety of items. While this can be done when there are simplistic assortment
choices to be made, imposing constraints on the collection of feasible
assortments gives more flexibility to incorporate insights of store-managers
and historically well-performing assortments. We design fast and flexible
algorithms based on variations of binary search that find the revenue of the
(approximately) optimal assortment. In particular, we revisit the problem of
large-scale assortment optimization under the multinomial logit choice model
without any assumptions on the structure of the feasible assortments. We speed
up the comparisons steps using novel vector space embeddings, based on advances
in the fields of information retrieval and machine learning. For an arbitrary
collection of assortments, our algorithms can find a solution in time that is
sub-linear in the number of assortments and for the simpler case of cardinality
constraints - linear in the number of items (existing methods are quadratic or
worse). Empirical validations using the Billion Prices dataset and several
retail transaction datasets show that our algorithms are competitive even when
the number of items is $\sim 10^5$ ($100$x larger instances than previously
studied).

\\
  This work focuses on a comparison between the performances of two well-known
Swarm algorithms: Cuckoo Search (CS) and Firefly Algorithm (FA), in estimating
the parameters of Software Reliability Growth Models. This study is further
reinforced using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization
(ACO). All algorithms are evaluated according to real software failure data,
the tests are performed and the obtained results are compared to show the
performance of each of the used algorithms. Furthermore, CS and FA are also
compared with each other on bases of execution time and iteration number.
Experimental results show that CS is more efficient in estimating the
parameters of SRGMs, and it has outperformed FA in addition to PSO and ACO for
the selected Data sets and employed models.

Title: Metafeatures-based Rule-Extraction for Classifiers on Behavioral and
  Textual Data
Authors: Yanou Ramon, David Martens, Theodoros Evgeniou, Stiene Praet
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 25 pages, 13 figures
\\
  Machine learning using behavioral and text data can result in highly accurate
prediction models, but these are often very difficult to interpret. Linear
models require investigating thousands of coefficients, while the opaqueness of
nonlinear models makes things even worse. Rule-extraction techniques have been
proposed to combine the desired predictive behaviour of complex "black-box"
models with explainability. However, rule-extraction in the context of
ultra-high-dimensional and sparse data can be challenging, and has thus far
received scant attention. Because of the sparsity and massive dimensionality,
rule-extraction might fail in their primary explainability goal as the
black-box model may need to be replaced by many rules, leaving the user again
with an incomprehensible model. To address this problem, we develop and test a
rule-extraction methodology based on higher-level, less-sparse "metafeatures".
We empirically validate the quality of the rules in terms of fidelity,
explanation stability and accuracy over a collection of data sets, and
benchmark their performance against rules extracted using the original
features. Our analysis points to key trade-offs between explainability,
fidelity, accuracy, and stability that Machine Learning researchers and
practitioners need to consider. Results indicate that the proposed metafeatures
approach leads to better trade-offs between these, and is better able to mimic
the black-box model. There is an average decrease of the loss in fidelity,
accuracy, and stability from using metafeatures instead of the original
fine-grained features by respectively 18.08%, 20.15% and 17.73%, all
statistically significant at a 5% significance level. Metafeatures thus improve
a key "cost of explainability", which we define as the loss in fidelity when
replacing a black-box with an explainable model.

Title: Algebraic Branching Programs, Border Complexity, and Tangent Spaces
Authors: Markus Bl\"aser, Christian Ikenmeyer, Meena Mahajan, Anurag Pandey,
  Nitin Saurabh
Categories: cs.CC

\\
  Nisan showed in 1991 that the width of a smallest noncommutative
single-(source,sink) algebraic branching program (ABP) to compute a
noncommutative polynomial is given by the ranks of specific matrices. This
means that the set of noncommutative polynomials with ABP width complexity at
most $k$ is Zariski-closed, an important property in geometric complexity
theory. It follows that approximations cannot help to reduce the required ABP
width.
  It was mentioned by Forbes that this result would probably break when going
from single-(source,sink) ABPs to trace ABPs. We prove that this is correct.
Moreover, we study the commutative monotone setting and prove a result similar
to Nisan, but concerning the analytic closure. We observe the same behavior
here: The set of polynomials with ABP width complexity at most $k$ is closed
for single-(source,sink) ABPs and not closed for trace ABPs. The proofs reveal
an intriguing connection between tangent spaces and the vector space of flows
on the ABP. We close with additional observations on VQP and the closure of VNP
which allows us to establish a separation between the two classes.

Title: TopologyGAN: Topology Optimization Using Generative Adversarial Networks
  Based on Physical Fields Over the Initial Domain
Authors: Zhenguo Nie, Tong Lin, Haoliang Jiang, Levent Burak Kara
Categories: cs.CE cs.AI eess.IV
Comments: 18 pages, 16 figures
\\
  In topology optimization using deep learning, load and boundary conditions
represented as vectors or sparse matrices often miss the opportunity to encode
a rich view of the design problem, leading to less than ideal generalization
results. We propose a new data-driven topology optimization model called
TopologyGAN that takes advantage of various physical fields computed on the
original, unoptimized material domain, as inputs to the generator of a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). Compared to a baseline cGAN,
TopologyGAN achieves a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the mean squared error and
a $2.5\times$ reduction in the mean absolute error on test problems involving
previously unseen boundary conditions. Built on several existing network
models, we also introduce a hybrid network called
U-SE(Squeeze-and-Excitation)-ResNet for the generator that further increases
the overall accuracy. We publicly share our full implementation and trained
network.

Title: Adaptive phase field modelling of crack propagation in orthotropic

Categories: cs.CE cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.NA math.NA
Journal-ref: Defence Technology (2020)
\\
  In this work, we extend the recently proposed adaptive phase field method to
model fracture in orthotropic functionally graded materials (FGMs). A recovery
type error indicator combined with quadtree decomposition is employed for
adaptive mesh refinement. The proposed approach is capable of capturing the
fracture process with a localized mesh refinement that provides notable gains
in computational efficiency. The implementation is validated against
experimental data and other numerical experiments on orthotropic materials with
different material orientations. The results reveal an increase in the
stiffness and the maximum force with increasing material orientation angle. The
study is then extended to the analysis of orthotropic FGMs. It is observed
that, if the gradation in fracture properties is neglected, the material
gradient plays a secondary role, with the fracture behaviour being dominated by
the orthotropy of the material. However, when the toughness increases along the
crack propagation path, a substantial gain in fracture resistance is observed.

Title: Drawing Graphs with Circular Arcs and Right Angle Crossings
Authors: Steven Chaplick, Henry F\"orster, Myroslav Kryven, Alexander Wolff
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  In a RAC drawing of a graph, vertices are represented by points in the plane,
adjacent vertices are connected by line segments, and crossings must form right
angles. Graphs that admit such drawings are RAC graphs. RAC graphs are
beyond-planar graphs and have been studied extensively. In particular, it is
known that a RAC graph with n vertices has at most 4n - 10 edges. We introduce
a superclass of RAC graphs, which we call arc-RAC graphs. In an arc-RAC
drawing, edges are drawn as circular arcs whereas crossings must still form
right angles. We provide a Tur\'an-type result showing that an arc-RAC graph
with n vertices has at most 14n - 12 edges and that there are n-vertex arc-RAC
graphs with 4.5n - o(n) edges.

Title: GenNet : Reading Comprehension with Multiple Choice Questions using
  Generation and Selection model
Authors: Vaishali Ingale, Pushpender Singh
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Multiple-choice machine reading comprehension is difficult task as its
required machines to select the correct option from a set of candidate or
possible options using the given passage and question.Reading Comprehension
with Multiple Choice Questions task,required a human (or machine) to read a
given passage, question pair and select the best one option from n given
options. There are two different ways to select the correct answer from the
given passage. Either by selecting the best match answer to by eliminating the
worst match answer. Here we proposed GenNet model, a neural network-based
model. In this model first we will generate the answer of the question from the
passage and then will matched the generated answer with given answer, the best
matched option will be our answer. For answer generation we used S-net (Tan et
al., 2017) model trained on SQuAD and to evaluate our model we used Large-scale
RACE (ReAding Comprehension Dataset From Examinations) (Lai et al.,2017).

\\
  Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is the task of answering a question over
a paragraph of text. While neural MRC systems gain popularity and achieve
noticeable performance, issues are being raised with the methodology used to
establish their performance, particularly concerning the data design of gold
standards that are used to evaluate them. There is but a limited understanding
of the challenges present in this data, which makes it hard to draw comparisons
and formulate reliable hypotheses. As a first step towards alleviating the
problem, this paper proposes a unifying framework to systematically investigate
the present linguistic features, required reasoning and background knowledge
and factual correctness on one hand, and the presence of lexical cues as a
lower bound for the requirement of understanding on the other hand. We propose
a qualitative annotation schema for the first and a set of approximative
metrics for the latter. In a first application of the framework, we analyse
modern MRC gold standards and present our findings: the absence of features
that contribute towards lexical ambiguity, the varying factual correctness of
the expected answers and the presence of lexical cues, all of which potentially
lower the reading comprehension complexity and quality of the evaluation data.

Title: Learning to Respond with Stickers: A Framework of Unifying
  Multi-Modality in Multi-Turn Dialog
Authors: Shen Gao, Xiuying Chen, Chang Liu, Li Liu, Dongyan Zhao and Rui Yan
Categories: cs.CL cs.CV cs.MM
Comments: Accepted by The Web Conference 2020 (WWW 2020). Equal contribution
  from first two authors. Dataset and code are released at

\\
  Stickers with vivid and engaging expressions are becoming increasingly
popular in online messaging apps, and some works are dedicated to automatically
select sticker response by matching text labels of stickers with previous
utterances. However, due to their large quantities, it is impractical to
require text labels for the all stickers. Hence, in this paper, we propose to
recommend an appropriate sticker to user based on multi-turn dialog context
history without any external labels. Two main challenges are confronted in this
task. One is to learn semantic meaning of stickers without corresponding text
labels. Another challenge is to jointly model the candidate sticker with the
multi-turn dialog context. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sticker
response selector (SRS) model. Specifically, SRS first employs a convolutional
based sticker image encoder and a self-attention based multi-turn dialog
encoder to obtain the representation of stickers and utterances. Next, deep
interaction network is proposed to conduct deep matching between the sticker
with each utterance in the dialog history. SRS then learns the short-term and
long-term dependency between all interaction results by a fusion network to
output the the final matching score. To evaluate our proposed method, we
collect a large-scale real-world dialog dataset with stickers from one of the
most popular online chatting platform. Extensive experiments conducted on this
dataset show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance for all
commonly-used metrics. Experiments also verify the effectiveness of each
component of SRS. To facilitate further research in sticker selection field, we
release this dataset of 340K multi-turn dialog and sticker pairs.

Title: Efficient Intent Detection with Dual Sentence Encoders
Authors: I\~nigo Casanueva, Tadas Tem\v{c}inas, Daniela Gerz, Matthew
  Henderson, Ivan Vuli\'c
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Building conversational systems in new domains and with added functionality
requires resource-efficient models that work under low-data regimes (i.e., in
few-shot setups). Motivated by these requirements, we introduce intent
detection methods backed by pretrained dual sentence encoders such as USE and
ConveRT. We demonstrate the usefulness and wide applicability of the proposed
intent detectors, showing that: 1) they outperform intent detectors based on
fine-tuning the full BERT-Large model or using BERT as a fixed black-box
encoder on three diverse intent detection data sets; 2) the gains are
especially pronounced in few-shot setups (i.e., with only 10 or 30 annotated
examples per intent); 3) our intent detectors can be trained in a matter of
minutes on a single CPU; and 4) they are stable across different hyperparameter
settings. In hope of facilitating and democratizing research focused on
intention detection, we release our code, as well as a new challenging
single-domain intent detection dataset comprising 13,083 annotated examples
over 77 intents.

Title: Undersensitivity in Neural Reading Comprehension
Authors: Johannes Welbl, Pasquale Minervini, Max Bartolo, Pontus Stenetorp,
  Sebastian Riedel
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 15 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Current reading comprehension models generalise well to in-distribution test
sets, yet perform poorly on adversarially selected inputs. Most prior work on
adversarial inputs studies oversensitivity: semantically invariant text
perturbations that cause a model's prediction to change when it should not. In
this work we focus on the complementary problem: excessive prediction
undersensitivity, where input text is meaningfully changed but the model's
prediction does not, even though it should. We formulate a noisy adversarial
attack which searches among semantic variations of the question for which a
model erroneously predicts the same answer, and with even higher probability.
Despite comprising unanswerable questions, both SQuAD2.0 and NewsQA models are
vulnerable to this attack. This indicates that although accurate, models tend
to rely on spurious patterns and do not fully consider the information
specified in a question. We experiment with data augmentation and adversarial
training as defences, and find that both substantially decrease vulnerability
to attacks on held out data, as well as held out attack spaces. Addressing
undersensitivity also improves results on AddSent and AddOneSent, and models
furthermore generalise better when facing train/evaluation distribution
mismatch: they are less prone to overly rely on predictive cues present only in
the training set, and outperform a conventional model by as much as 10.9% F1.

Title: Video Caption Dataset for Describing Human Actions in Japanese

Comments: Accepted for LREC 2020. Dataset available at

\\
  In recent years, automatic video caption generation has attracted
considerable attention. This paper focuses on the generation of Japanese
captions for describing human actions. While most currently available video
caption datasets have been constructed for English, there is no equivalent
Japanese dataset. To address this, we constructed a large-scale Japanese video
caption dataset consisting of 79,822 videos and 399,233 captions. Each caption
in our dataset describes a video in the form of "who does what and where." To
describe human actions, it is important to identify the details of a person,
place, and action. Indeed, when we describe human actions, we usually mention
the scene, person, and action. In our experiments, we evaluated two caption
generation methods to obtain benchmark results. Further, we investigated
whether those generation methods could specify "who does what and where."

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Data and guidelines available at https://multisimlex.com/
\\
  We introduce Multi-SimLex, a large-scale lexical resource and evaluation
benchmark covering datasets for 12 typologically diverse languages, including
major languages (e.g., Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Russian) as well as
less-resourced ones (e.g., Welsh, Kiswahili). Each language dataset is
annotated for the lexical relation of semantic similarity and contains 1,888
semantically aligned concept pairs, providing a representative coverage of word
classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs), frequency ranks, similarity
intervals, lexical fields, and concreteness levels. Additionally, owing to the
alignment of concepts across languages, we provide a suite of 66 cross-lingual
semantic similarity datasets. Due to its extensive size and language coverage,
Multi-SimLex provides entirely novel opportunities for experimental evaluation
and analysis. On its monolingual and cross-lingual benchmarks, we evaluate and
analyze a wide array of recent state-of-the-art monolingual and cross-lingual
representation models, including static and contextualized word embeddings
(such as fastText, M-BERT and XLM), externally informed lexical
representations, as well as fully unsupervised and (weakly) supervised
cross-lingual word embeddings. We also present a step-by-step dataset creation
protocol for creating consistent, Multi-Simlex-style resources for additional
languages. We make these contributions -- the public release of Multi-SimLex
datasets, their creation protocol, strong baseline results, and in-depth
analyses which can be be helpful in guiding future developments in multilingual
lexical semantics and representation learning -- available via a website which
will encourage community effort in further expansion of Multi-Simlex to many
more languages. Such a large-scale semantic resource could inspire significant
further advances in NLP across languages.

Title: A quantum secret sharing scheme with verifiable function
Authors: Li-Juan Liu, Zhi-Hui Li, Zhao-Wei Han, Dan-Li Zhi
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  In the $\left( {t,n} \right)$ threshold quantum secret sharing scheme, it is
difficult to ensure that internal participants are honest. In this paper, a
verifiable $\left( {t,n} \right)$ threshold quantum secret sharing scheme is
designed combined with classical secret sharing scheme. First of all, the
distributor uses the asymmetric binary polynomials to generate the shares and
sends them to each participant. Secondly, the distributor sends the initial
quantum state with the secret to the first participant, and each participant
performs unitary operation that using the mutually unbiased bases on the
obtained $d$ dimension single bit quantum state ($d$ is a large odd prime
number). In this process, distributor can randomly check the participants, and
find out the internal fraudsters by unitary inverse operation gradually upward.
Then the secret is reconstructed after all other participants simultaneously
public transmission. Security analysis show that this scheme can resist both
external and internal attacks.

  Decentralized systems, such as distributed ledgers and the InterPlanetary

Title: Actions speak louder than words: Semi-supervised learning for browser
  fingerprinting detection
Authors: Sarah Bird, Vikas Mishra, Steven Englehardt, Rob Willoughby, David
  Zeber, Walter Rudametkin, Martin Lopatka
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  As online tracking continues to grow, existing anti-tracking and
fingerprinting detection techniques that require significant manual input must
be augmented. Heuristic approaches to fingerprinting detection are precise but
must be carefully curated. Supervised machine learning techniques proposed for
detecting tracking require manually generated label-sets. Seeking to overcome
these challenges, we present a semi-supervised machine learning approach for
detecting fingerprinting scripts. Our approach is based on the core insight
that fingerprinting scripts have similar patterns of API access when generating
their fingerprints, even though their access patterns may not match exactly.
Using this insight, we group scripts by their JavaScript (JS) execution traces
and apply a semi-supervised approach to detect new fingerprinting scripts. We
detail our methodology and demonstrate its ability to identify the majority of
scripts ($\geqslant$94.9%) identified by existing heuristic techniques. We also
show that the approach expands beyond detecting known scripts by surfacing
candidate scripts that are likely to include fingerprinting. Through an
analysis of these candidate scripts we discovered fingerprinting scripts that
were missed by heuristics and for which there are no heuristics. In particular,
we identified over one hundred device-class fingerprinting scripts present on
hundreds of domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
device-class fingerprinting has been measured in the wild. These successes
illustrate the power of a sparse vector representation and semi-supervised
learning to complement and extend existing tracking detection techniques.

\\
  Cloud providers are concerned that Rowhammer poses a potentially critical
threat to their servers, yet today they lack a systematic way to test whether
the DRAM used in their servers is vulnerable to Rowhammer attacks. This paper
presents an end-to-end methodology to determine if cloud servers are
susceptible to these attacks. With our methodology, a cloud provider can
construct worst-case testing conditions for DRAM.
  We apply our methodology to three classes of servers from a major cloud
provider. Our findings show that none of the CPU instruction sequences used in
prior work to mount Rowhammer attacks create worst-case DRAM testing
conditions. To address this limitation, we develop an instruction sequence that
leverages microarchitectural side-effects to ``hammer'' DRAM at a near-optimal
rate on modern Intel Skylake and Cascade Lake platforms. We also design a DDR4
fault injector that can reverse engineer row adjacency for any DDR4 DIMM. When
applied to our cloud provider's DIMMs, we find that DRAM rows do not always
follow a linear map.

Title: Streamlining Integrity Tree Updates for Secure Persistent Non-Volatile
  Memory
Authors: Alexander Freij, Shougang Yuan, Huiyang Zhou, Yan Solihin
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 13 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Emerging non-volatile main memory (NVMM) is rapidly being integrated into
computer systems. However, NVMM is vulnerable to potential data remanence and
replay attacks.
  Established security models including split counter mode encryption and
Bonsai Merkle tree (BMT) authentication have been introduced against such data
integrity attacks. However, these security methods are not readily compatible
with NVMM. Recent works on secure NVMM pointed out the need for data and its
metadata, including the counter, the message authentication code (MAC), and the
BMT to be persisted atomically. However, memory persistency models have been
overlooked for secure NVMM, which is essential for crash recoverability.
  In this work, we analyze the invariants that need to be ensured in order to
support crash recovery for secure NVMM. We highlight that prior research has
substantially under-estimated the cost of BMT persistence and propose several
optimization techniques to reduce the overhead of atomically persisting updates
to BMTs. The optimizations proposed explore the use of pipelining, out-of-order
writes, and update coalescing while conforming to strict or epoch persistency
models respectively. We evaluate our work and show that our proposed
optimizations significantly reduce the performance overhead of secure NVMM with
crash recoverability.

Title: Security of Distributed Machine Learning: A Game-Theoretic Approach to
  Design Secure DSVM
Authors: Rui Zhang, Quanyan Zhu
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Distributed machine learning algorithms play a significant role in processing
massive data sets over large networks. However, the increasing reliance on
machine learning on information and communication technologies (ICTs) makes it
inherently vulnerable to cyber threats. This work aims to develop secure
distributed algorithms to protect the learning from data poisoning and network
attacks. We establish a game-theoretic framework to capture the conflicting
goals of a learner who uses distributed support vector machines (SVMs) and an
attacker who is capable of modifying training data and labels. We develop a
fully distributed and iterative algorithm to capture real-time reactions of the
learner at each node to adversarial behaviors. The numerical results show that
distributed SVM is prone to fail in different types of attacks, and their
impact has a strong dependence on the network structure and attack
capabilities.

\\
  In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive study of user-chosen 4- and
6-digit PINs (n=1220) collected on smartphones with participants being
explicitly primed for the situation of device unlocking. We find that against a
throttled attacker (with 10, 30, or 100 guesses, matching the smartphone unlock
setting), using 6-digit PINs instead of 4-digit PINs provides little to no
increase in security, and surprisingly may even decrease security. We also
study the effects of blacklists, where a set of "easy to guess" PINs is
disallowed during selection. Two such blacklists are in use today by iOS, for
4-digits (274 PINs) as well as 6-digits (2910 PINs). We extracted both
blacklists compared them with four other blacklists, including a small 4-digit
(27 PINs), a large 4-digit (2740 PINs), and two placebo blacklists for 4- and
6-digit PINs that always excluded the first-choice PIN. We find that relatively
small blacklists in use today by iOS offer little or no benefit against a
throttled guessing attack. Security gains are only observed when the blacklists
are much larger, which in turn comes at the cost of increased user frustration.
Our analysis suggests that a blacklist at about 10% of the PIN space may
provide the best balance between usability and security.

Title: Crossmodal learning for audio-visual speech event localization

Categories: cs.CV cs.MM
\\
  An objective understanding of media depictions, such as about inclusive
portrayals of how much someone is heard and seen on screen in film and
television, requires the machines to discern automatically who, when, how and
where someone is talking. Media content is rich in multiple modalities such as
visuals and audio which can be used to learn speaker activity in videos. In
this work, we present visual representations that have implicit information
about when someone is talking and where. We propose a crossmodal neural network
for audio speech event detection using the visual frames. We use the learned
representations for two downstream tasks: i) audio-visual voice activity
detection ii) active speaker localization in video frames. We present a
state-of-the-art audio-visual voice activity detection system and demonstrate
that the learned embeddings can effectively localize to active speakers in the
visual frames.

Title: A New Meta-Baseline for Few-Shot Learning

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Meta-learning has become a popular framework for few-shot learning in recent
years, with the goal of learning a model from collections of few-shot
classification tasks. While more and more novel meta-learning models are being
proposed, our research has uncovered simple baselines that have been
overlooked. We present a Meta-Baseline method, by pre-training a classifier on
all base classes and meta-learning on a nearest-centroid based few-shot
classification algorithm, it outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by a
large margin. Why does this simple method work so well? In the meta-learning
stage, we observe that a model generalizing better on unseen tasks from base
classes can have a decreasing performance on tasks from novel classes,
indicating a potential objective discrepancy. We find both pre-training and
inheriting a good few-shot classification metric from the pre-trained
classifier are important for Meta-Baseline, which potentially helps the model
better utilize the pre-trained representations with stronger transferability.
Furthermore, we investigate when we need meta-learning in this Meta-Baseline.
Our work sets up a new solid benchmark for this field and sheds light on
further understanding the phenomenons in the meta-learning framework for
few-shot learning.

Title: FusionLane: Multi-Sensor Fusion for Lane Marking Semantic Segmentation
  Using Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Ruochen Yin, Biao Yu, Huapeng Wu, Yutao Song, Runxin Niu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  It is a crucial step to achieve effective semantic segmentation of lane
marking during the construction of the lane level high-precision map. In recent
years, many image semantic segmentation methods have been proposed. These
methods mainly focus on the image from camera, due to the limitation of the
sensor itself, the accurate three-dimensional spatial position of the lane
marking cannot be obtained, so the demand for the lane level high-precision map
construction cannot be met. This paper proposes a lane marking semantic
segmentation method based on LIDAR and camera fusion deep neural network.
Different from other methods, in order to obtain accurate position information
of the segmentation results, the semantic segmentation object of this paper is
a bird's eye view converted from a LIDAR points cloud instead of an image
captured by a camera. This method first uses the deeplabv3+ [\ref{ref:1}]
network to segment the image captured by the camera, and the segmentation
result is merged with the point clouds collected by the LIDAR as the input of
the proposed network. In this neural network, we also add a long short-term
memory (LSTM) structure to assist the network for semantic segmentation of lane
markings by using the the time series information. The experiments on more than
14,000 image datasets which we have manually labeled and expanded have shown
the proposed method has better performance on the semantic segmentation of the
points cloud bird's eye view. Therefore, the automation of high-precision map
construction can be significantly improved. Our code is available at

Title: Texture Superpixel Clustering from Patch-based Nearest Neighbor Matching
Authors: R\'emi Giraud, Yannick Berthoumieu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Superpixels are widely used in computer vision applications. Nevertheless,
decomposition methods may still fail to efficiently cluster image pixels
according to their local texture. In this paper, we propose a new Nearest
Neighbor-based Superpixel Clustering (NNSC) method to generate texture-aware
superpixels in a limited computational time compared to previous approaches. We
introduce a new clustering framework using patch-based nearest neighbor
matching, while most existing methods are based on a pixel-wise K-means
clustering. Therefore, we directly group pixels in the patch space enabling to
capture texture information. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method with
favorable comparison in terms of segmentation performances on both standard
color and texture datasets. We also show the computational efficiency of NNSC
compared to recent texture-aware superpixel methods.

Title: Multi-Scale Superpatch Matching using Dual Superpixel Descriptors
Authors: R\'emi Giraud, Merlin Boyer, Micha\"el Cl\'ement
Categories: cs.CV
Journal-ref: Pattern Recognition Letters 2020
\\
  Over-segmentation into superpixels is a very effective dimensionality
reduction strategy, enabling fast dense image processing. The main issue of
this approach is the inherent irregularity of the image decomposition compared
to standard hierarchical multi-resolution schemes, especially when searching
for similar neighboring patterns. Several works have attempted to overcome this
issue by taking into account the region irregularity into their comparison
model. Nevertheless, they remain sub-optimal to provide robust and accurate
superpixel neighborhood descriptors, since they only compute features within
each region, poorly capturing contour information at superpixel borders. In
this work, we address these limitations by introducing the dual superpatch, a
novel superpixel neighborhood descriptor. This structure contains features
computed in reduced superpixel regions, as well as at the interfaces of
multiple superpixels to explicitly capture contour structure information. A
fast multi-scale non-local matching framework is also introduced for the search
of similar descriptors at different resolution levels in an image dataset. The
proposed dual superpatch enables to more accurately capture similar structured
patterns at different scales, and we demonstrate the robustness and performance
of this new strategy on matching and supervised labeling applications.

\\
  Accurate motion state estimation of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), is a
critical requirement for autonomous vehicles that navigate in urban
environments. Due to their computational efficiency, many traditional autonomy
systems perform multi-object tracking using Kalman Filters which frequently
rely on hand-engineered association. However, such methods fail to generalize
to crowded scenes and multi-sensor modalities, often resulting in poor state
estimates which cascade to inaccurate predictions. We present a practical and
lightweight tracking system, SDVTracker, that uses a deep learned model for
association and state estimation in conjunction with an Interacting Multiple
Model (IMM) filter. The proposed tracking method is fast, robust and
generalizes across multiple sensor modalities and different VRU classes. In
this paper, we detail a model that jointly optimizes both association and state
estimation with a novel loss, an algorithm for determining ground-truth
supervision, and a training procedure. We show this system significantly
outperforms hand-engineered methods on a real-world urban driving dataset while
running in less than 2.5 ms on CPU for a scene with 100 actors, making it
suitable for self-driving applications where low latency and high accuracy is
critical.

Title: Single-view 2D CNNs with Fully Automatic Non-nodule Categorization for
  False Positive Reduction in Pulmonary Nodule Detection

\\
  Background and Objective: In pulmonary nodule detection, the first stage,
candidate detection, aims to detect suspicious pulmonary nodules. However,
detected candidates include many false positives and thus in the following
stage, false positive reduction, such false positives are reliably reduced.
Note that this task is challenging due to 1) the imbalance between the numbers
of nodules and non-nodules and 2) the intra-class diversity of non-nodules.
Although techniques using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown
promising performance, they suffer from high computational complexity which
hinders constructing deep networks. To efficiently address these problems, we
propose a novel framework using the ensemble of 2D CNNs using single views,
which outperforms existing 3D CNN-based methods.
  Methods: Our ensemble of 2D CNNs utilizes single-view 2D patches to improve
both computational and memory efficiency compared to previous techniques
exploiting 3D CNNs. We first categorize non-nodules on the basis of features
encoded by an autoencoder. Then, all 2D CNNs are trained by using the same
nodule samples, but with different types of non-nodules. By extending the
learning capability, this training scheme resolves difficulties of extracting
representative features from non-nodules with large appearance variations. Note
that, instead of manual categorization requiring the heavy workload of
radiologists, we propose to automatically categorize non-nodules based on the
autoencoder and k-means clustering.

Title: Tracking Road Users using Constraint Programming
Authors: Alexandre Pineault, Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau, Gilles Pesant
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we aim at improving the tracking of road users in urban
scenes. We present a constraint programming (CP) approach for the data
association phase found in the tracking-by-detection paradigm of the multiple
object tracking (MOT) problem. Such an approach can solve the data association
problem more efficiently than graph-based methods and can handle better the
combinatorial explosion occurring when multiple frames are analyzed. Because
our focus is on the data association problem, our MOT method only uses simple
image features, which are the center position and color of detections for each
frame. Constraints are defined on these two features and on the general MOT
problem. For example, we enforce color appearance preservation over
trajectories and constrain the extent of motion between frames. Filtering
layers are used in order to eliminate detection candidates before using CP and
to remove dummy trajectories produced by the CP solver. Our proposed method was
tested on a motorized vehicles tracking dataset and produces results that
outperform the top methods of the UA-DETRAC benchmark.

\\
  Breast cancer is one of the leading fatal disease worldwide with high risk
control if early discovered. Conventional method for breast screening is x-ray
mammography, which is known to be challenging for early detection of cancer
lesions. The dense breast structure produced due to the compression process
during imaging lead to difficulties to recognize small size abnormalities.
Also, inter- and intra-variations of breast tissues lead to significant
difficulties to achieve high diagnosis accuracy using hand-crafted features.
Deep learning is an emerging machine learning technology that requires a
relatively high computation power. Yet, it proved to be very effective in
several difficult tasks that requires decision making at the level of human
intelligence. In this paper, we develop a new network architecture inspired by
the U-net structure that can be used for effective and early detection of
breast cancer. Results indicate a high rate of sensitivity and specificity that
indicate potential usefulness of the proposed approach in clinical use.

Title: Compositional Convolutional Neural Networks: A Deep Architecture with
  Innate Robustness to Partial Occlusion
Authors: Adam Kortylewski, Ju He, Qing Liu, Alan Yuille
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR 2020
\\
  Recent work has shown that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) do not
generalize well under partial occlusion. Inspired by the success of
compositional models at classifying partially occluded objects, we propose to
integrate compositional models and DCNNs into a unified deep model with innate
robustness to partial occlusion. We term this architecture Compositional
Convolutional Neural Network. In particular, we propose to replace the fully
connected classification head of a DCNN with a differentiable compositional
model. The generative nature of the compositional model enables it to localize
occluders and subsequently focus on the non-occluded parts of the object. We
conduct classification experiments on artificially occluded images as well as
real images of partially occluded objects from the MS-COCO dataset. The results
show that DCNNs do not classify occluded objects robustly, even when trained
with data that is strongly augmented with partial occlusions. Our proposed
model outperforms standard DCNNs by a large margin at classifying partially
occluded objects, even when it has not been exposed to occluded objects during
training. Additional experiments demonstrate that CompositionalNets can also
localize the occluders accurately, despite being trained with class labels
only.

  Motion estimation of cardiac MRI videos is crucial for the evaluation of
human heart anatomy and function. Recent researches show promising results with
deep learning-based methods. In clinical deployment, however, they suffer
dramatic performance drops due to mismatched distributions between training and
testing datasets, commonly encountered in the clinical environment. On the
other hand, it is arguably impossible to collect all representative datasets
and to train a universal tracker before deployment. In this context, we
proposed a novel fast online adaptive learning (FOAL) framework: an online
gradient descent based optimizer that is optimized by a meta-learner. The
meta-learner enables the online optimizer to perform a fast and robust
adaptation. We evaluated our method through extensive experiments on two public
clinical datasets. The results showed the superior performance of FOAL in
accuracy compared to the offline-trained tracking method. On average, the FOAL
took only $0.4$ second per video for online optimization.

Title: Implementation of Deep Neural Networks to Classify EEG Signals using
  Gramian Angular Summation Field for Epilepsy Diagnosis

\\
  This paper evaluates the approach of imaging timeseries data such as EEG in
the diagnosis of epilepsy through Deep Neural Network (DNN). EEG signal is
transformed into an RGB image using Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF).
Many such EEG epochs are transformed into GASF images for the normal and focal
EEG signals. Then, some of the widely used Deep Neural Networks for image
classification problems are used here to detect the focal GASF images. Three
pre-trained DNN such as the AlexNet, VGG16, and VGG19 are validated for
epilepsy detection based on the transfer learning approach. Furthermore, the
textural features are extracted from GASF images, and prominent features are
selected for a multilayer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier. Lastly, a
Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three CNN layers, Batch
Normalization, Max-pooling layer, and Dense layers, is proposed for epilepsy
diagnosis from GASF images. The results of this paper show that the Custom CNN
model was able to discriminate against the focal and normal GASF images with an
average peak Precision of 0.885, Recall of 0.92, and F1-score of 0.90.
Moreover, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.92 for the Custom CNN model. This paper
suggests that Deep Learning methods widely used in image classification
problems can be an alternative approach for epilepsy detection from EEG signals
through GASF images.

Title: PBRnet: Pyramidal Bounding Box Refinement to Improve Object Localization
  Accuracy
Authors: Li Xiao, Yufan Luo, Chunlong Luo, Lianhe Zhao, Quanshui Fu, Guoqing
  Yang, Anpeng Huang, Yi Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Many recently developed object detectors focused on coarse-to-fine framework
which contains several stages that classify and regress proposals from
coarse-grain to fine-grain, and obtains more accurate detection gradually.
Multi-resolution models such as Feature Pyramid Network(FPN) integrate
information of different levels of resolution and effectively improve the
performance. Previous researches also have revealed that localization can be
further improved by: 1) using fine-grained information which is more
translational variant; 2) refining local areas which is more focused on local
boundary information. Based on these principles, we designed a novel boundary
refinement architecture to improve localization accuracy by combining
coarse-to-fine framework with feature pyramid structure, named as Pyramidal
Bounding Box Refinement network(PBRnet), which parameterizes gradually focused
boundary areas of objects and leverages lower-level feature maps to extract
finer local information when refining the predicted bounding boxes. Extensive
experiments are performed on the MS-COCO dataset. The PBRnet brings a
significant performance gains by roughly 3 point of $mAP$ when added to FPN or
Libra R-CNN. Moreover, by treating Cascade R-CNN as a coarse-to-fine detector
and replacing its localization branch by the regressor of PBRnet, it leads an
extra performance improvement by 1.5 $mAP$, yielding a total performance
boosting by as high as 5 point of $mAP$.

Title: 3D Quasi-Recurrent Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising
Authors: Kaixuan Wei, Ying Fu, Hua Huang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Network and Learning System
  (TNNLS), 2020
\\
  In this paper, we propose an alternating directional 3D quasi-recurrent
neural network for hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising, which can effectively
embed the domain knowledge -- structural spatio-spectral correlation and global
correlation along spectrum. Specifically, 3D convolution is utilized to extract
structural spatio-spectral correlation in an HSI, while a quasi-recurrent
pooling function is employed to capture the global correlation along spectrum.
Moreover, alternating directional structure is introduced to eliminate the
causal dependency with no additional computation cost. The proposed model is
capable of modeling spatio-spectral dependency while preserving the flexibility
towards HSIs with arbitrary number of bands. Extensive experiments on HSI
denoising demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-arts under
various noise settings, in terms of both restoration accuracy and computation
time. Our code is available at https://github.com/Vandermode/QRNN3D.

Title: Channel Pruning via Optimal Thresholding
Authors: Yun Ye, Ganmei You, Jong-Kae Fwu, Xia Zhu, Qing Yang and Yuan Zhu

Comments: 8 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables
\\
  Structured pruning, especially channel pruning is widely used for the reduced
computational cost and the compatibility with off-the-shelf hardware devices.
Among existing works, weights are typically removed using a predefined global
threshold, or a threshold computed from a predefined metric. The predefined
global threshold based designs ignore the variation among different layers and
weights distribution, therefore, they may often result in sub-optimal
performance caused by over-pruning or under-pruning. In this paper, we present
a simple yet effective method, termed Optimal Thresholding (OT), to prune
channels with layer dependent thresholds that optimally separate important from
negligible channels. By using OT, most negligible or unimportant channels are
pruned to achieve high sparsity while minimizing performance degradation. Since
most important weights are preserved, the pruned model can be further
fine-tuned and quickly converge with very few iterations. Our method
demonstrates superior performance, especially when compared to the
state-of-the-art designs at high levels of sparsity. On CIFAR-100, a pruned and
fine-tuned DenseNet-121 by using OT achieves 75.99% accuracy with only 1.46e8
FLOPs and 0.71M parameters. code is available at:

\\
  Most SLAM algorithms are based on the assumption that the scene is static.
However, in practice, most scenes are dynamic which usually contains moving
objects, these methods are not suitable. In this paper, we introduce DymSLAM, a
dynamic stereo visual SLAM system being capable of reconstructing a 4D (3D +
time) dynamic scene with rigid moving objects. The only input of DymSLAM is
stereo video, and its output includes a dense map of the static environment, 3D
model of the moving objects and the trajectories of the camera and the moving
objects. We at first detect and match the interesting points between successive
frames by using traditional SLAM methods. Then the interesting points belonging
to different motion models (including ego-motion and motion models of rigid
moving objects) are segmented by a multi-model fitting approach. Based on the
interesting points belonging to the ego-motion, we are able to estimate the
trajectory of the camera and reconstruct the static background. The interesting
points belonging to the motion models of rigid moving objects are then used to
estimate their relative motion models to the camera and reconstruct the 3D
models of the objects. We then transform the relative motion to the
trajectories of the moving objects in the global reference frame. Finally, we
then fuse the 3D models of the moving objects into the 3D map of the
environment by considering their motion trajectories to obtain a 4D (3D+time)
sequence. DymSLAM obtains information about the dynamic objects instead of
ignoring them and is suitable for unknown rigid objects. Hence, the proposed
system allows the robot to be employed for high-level tasks, such as obstacle
avoidance for dynamic objects. We conducted experiments in a real-world
environment where both the camera and the objects were moving in a wide range.

Title: The Virtual Tailor: Predicting Clothing in 3D as a Function of Human
  Pose, Shape and Garment Style
Authors: Chaitanya Patel, Zhouyingcheng Liao, Gerard Pons-Moll

Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020. Chaitanya Patel and Zhouyingcheng Liao
  contributed equally
\\
  In this paper, we present TailorNet, a neural model which predicts clothing
deformation in 3D as a function of three factors: pose, shape and style
(garment geometry), while retaining wrinkle detail. This goes beyond prior
models, which are either specific to one style and shape, or generalize to
different shapes producing smooth results, despite being style specific. Our
hypothesis is that (even non-linear) combinations of examples smooth out high
frequency components such as fine-wrinkles, which makes learning the three
factors jointly hard. At the heart of our technique is a decomposition of
deformation into a high frequency and a low frequency component. While the
low-frequency component is predicted from pose, shape and style parameters with
an MLP, the high-frequency component is predicted with a mixture of shape-style
specific pose models. The weights of the mixture are computed with a narrow
bandwidth kernel to guarantee that only predictions with similar high-frequency
patterns are combined. The style variation is obtained by computing, in a
canonical pose, a subspace of deformation, which satisfies physical constraints
such as inter-penetration, and draping on the body. TailorNet delivers 3D
garments which retain the wrinkles from the physics based simulations (PBS) it
is learned from, while running more than 1000 times faster. In contrast to
classical PBS, TailorNet is easy to use and fully differentiable, which is
crucial for computer vision algorithms. Several experiments demonstrate
TailorNet produces more realistic results than prior work, and even generates
temporally coherent deformations on sequences of the AMASS dataset, despite
being trained on static poses from a different dataset. To stimulate further
research in this direction, we will make a dataset consisting of 55800 frames,
as well as our model publicly available at

Title: Label-Driven Reconstruction for Domain Adaptation in Semantic
  Segmentation

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Unsupervised domain adaptation enables to alleviate the need for pixel-wise
annotation in the semantic segmentation. One of the most common strategies is
to translate images from the source domain to the target domain and then align
their marginal distributions in the feature space using adversarial learning.
However, source-to-target translation enlarges the bias in translated images,
owing to the dominant data size of the source domain. Furthermore, consistency
of the joint distribution in source and target domains cannot be guaranteed
through global feature alignment. Here, we present an innovative framework,
designed to mitigate the image translation bias and align cross-domain features
with the same category. This is achieved by 1) performing the target-to-source
translation and 2) reconstructing both source and target images from their
predicted labels. Extensive experiments on adapting from synthetic to real
urban scene understanding demonstrate that our framework competes favorably
against existing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Convolutional Occupancy Networks

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recently, implicit neural representations have gained popularity for
learning-based 3D reconstruction. While demonstrating promising results, most
implicit approaches are limited to comparably simple geometry of single objects
and do not scale to more complicated or large-scale scenes. The key limiting
factor of implicit methods is their simple fully-connected network architecture
which does not allow for integrating local information in the observations or
incorporating inductive biases such as translational equivariance. In this
paper, we propose Convolutional Occupancy Networks, a more flexible implicit
representation for detailed reconstruction of objects and 3D scenes. By
combining convolutional encoders with implicit occupancy decoders, our model
incorporates inductive biases and Manhattan-world priors, enabling structured
reasoning in 3D space. We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed
representation by reconstructing complex geometry from noisy point clouds and
low-resolution voxel representations. We empirically find that our method
enables fine-grained implicit 3D reconstruction of single objects, scales to
large indoor scenes and generalizes well from synthetic to real data.

Title: Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search for Single Image
  Super-Resolution
Authors: Yong Guo, Yongsheng Luo, Zhenhao He, Jin Huang, Jian Chen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep neural networks have exhibited promising performance in image
super-resolution (SR). Most SR models follow a hierarchical architecture that
contains both the cell-level design of computational blocks and the
network-level design of the positions of upsampling blocks. However, designing
SR models heavily relies on human expertise and is very labor-intensive. More
critically, these SR models often contain a huge number of parameters and may
not meet the requirements of computation resources in real-world applications.
To address the above issues, we propose a Hierarchical Neural Architecture
Search (HNAS) method to automatically design promising architectures with
different requirements of computation cost. To this end, we design a
hierarchical SR search space and propose a hierarchical controller for
architecture search. Such a hierarchical controller is able to simultaneously
find promising cell-level blocks and network-level positions of upsampling
layers. Moreover, to design compact architectures with promising performance,
we build a joint reward by considering both the performance and computation
cost to guide the search process. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods.

Title: PnP-Net: A hybrid Perspective-n-Point Network
Authors: Roy Sheffer, Ami Wiesel
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We consider the robust Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem using a hybrid
approach that combines deep learning with model based algorithms. PnP is the
problem of estimating the pose of a calibrated camera given a set of 3D points
in the world and their corresponding 2D projections in the image. In its more
challenging robust version, some of the correspondences may be mismatched and
must be efficiently discarded. Classical solutions address PnP via iterative
robust non-linear least squares method that exploit the problem's geometry but
are either inaccurate or computationally intensive. In contrast, we propose to
combine a deep learning initial phase followed by a model-based fine tuning
phase. This hybrid approach, denoted by PnP-Net, succeeds in estimating the
unknown pose parameters under correspondence errors and noise, with low and
fixed computational complexity requirements. We demonstrate its advantages on
both synthetic data and real world data.

Title: HeatNet: Bridging the Day-Night Domain Gap in Semantic Segmentation with
  Thermal Images
Authors: Johan Vertens, Jannik Z\"urn, Wolfram Burgard
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  The majority of learning-based semantic segmentation methods are optimized
for daytime scenarios and favorable lighting conditions. Real-world driving
scenarios, however, entail adverse environmental conditions such as nighttime
illumination or glare which remain a challenge for existing approaches. In this
work, we propose a multimodal semantic segmentation model that can be applied
during daytime and nighttime. To this end, besides RGB images, we leverage
thermal images, making our network significantly more robust. We avoid the
expensive annotation of nighttime images by leveraging an existing daytime
RGB-dataset and propose a teacher-student training approach that transfers the
dataset's knowledge to the nighttime domain. We further employ a domain
adaptation method to align the learned feature spaces across the domains and
propose a novel two-stage training scheme. Furthermore, due to a lack of
thermal data for autonomous driving, we present a new dataset comprising over
20,000 time-synchronized and aligned RGB-thermal image pairs. In this context,
we also present a novel target-less calibration method that allows for
automatic robust extrinsic and intrinsic thermal camera calibration. Among
others, we employ our new dataset to show state-of-the-art results for
nighttime semantic segmentation.

  CT imaging is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and staging COVID-19
infection. Follow-up scans every 3-5 days are often recommended for disease
progression. It has been reported that bilateral and peripheral ground glass
opacification (GGO) with or without consolidation are predominant CT findings
in COVID-19 patients. However, due to lack of computerized quantification
tools, only qualitative impression and rough description of infected areas are
currently used in radiological reports. In this paper, a deep learning
(DL)-based segmentation system is developed to automatically quantify infection
regions of interest (ROIs) and their volumetric ratios w.r.t. the lung. The
performance of the system was evaluated by comparing the automatically
segmented infection regions with the manually-delineated ones on 300 chest CT
scans of 300 COVID-19 patients. For fast manual delineation of training samples
and possible manual intervention of automatic results, a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) strategy has been adopted to assist radiologists for infection region
segmentation, which dramatically reduced the total segmentation time to 4
minutes after 3 iterations of model updating. The average Dice simiarility
coefficient showed 91.6% agreement between automatic and manual infaction
segmentations, and the mean estimation error of percentage of infection (POI)
was 0.3% for the whole lung. Finally, possible applications, including but not
limited to analysis of follow-up CT scans and infection distributions in the
lobes and segments correlated with clinical findings, were discussed.

Title: Incremental Few-Shot Object Detection
Authors: Juan-Manuel Perez-Rua and Xiatian Zhu and Timothy Hospedales and Tao
  Xiang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR 2020
\\
  Most existing object detection methods rely on the availability of abundant
labelled training samples per class and offline model training in a batch mode.
These requirements substantially limit their scalability to open-ended
accommodation of novel classes with limited labelled training data. %, both in
terms of model accuracy and training efficiency during deployment. We present a
study aiming to go beyond these limitations by considering the Incremental
Few-Shot Detection (iFSD) problem setting, where new classes must be registered
incrementally (without revisiting base classes) and with few examples. To this
end we propose OpeN-ended Centre nEt (ONCE), a detector designed for
incrementally learning to detect novel class objects with few examples. This is
achieved by an elegant adaptation of the CentreNet detector to the few-shot
learning scenario, and meta-learning a class-specific code generator model for
registering novel classes. ONCE fully respects the incremental learning
paradigm, with novel class registration requiring only a single forward pass of
few-shot training samples, and no access to base classes -- thus making it
suitable for deployment on embedded devices. Extensive experiments conducted on
both the standard object detection and fashion landmark detection tasks show
the feasibility of iFSD for the first time, opening an interesting and very
important line of research.

Title: Realizing Pixel-Level Semantic Learning in Complex Driving Scenes based
  on Only One Annotated Pixel per Class
Authors: Xi Li, Huimin Ma, Sheng Yi, Yanxian Chen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Semantic segmentation tasks based on weakly supervised condition have been
put forward to achieve a lightweight labeling process. For simple images that
only include a few categories, researches based on image-level annotations have
achieved acceptable performance. However, when facing complex scenes, since
image contains a large amount of classes, it becomes difficult to learn visual
appearance based on image tags. In this case, image-level annotations are not
effective in providing information. Therefore, we set up a new task in which
only one annotated pixel is provided for each category. Based on the more
lightweight and informative condition, a three step process is built for pseudo
labels generation, which progressively implement optimal feature representation
for each category, image inference and context-location based refinement. In
particular, since high-level semantics and low-level imaging feature have
different discriminative ability for each class under driving scenes, we divide
each category into "object" or "scene" and then provide different operations
for the two types separately. Further, an alternate iterative structure is
established to gradually improve segmentation performance, which combines
CNN-based inter-image common semantic learning and imaging prior based
intra-image modification process. Experiments on Cityscapes dataset demonstrate
that the proposed method provides a feasible way to solve weakly supervised
semantic segmentation task under complex driving scenes.

Title: Deep Hough Transform for Semantic Line Detection
Authors: Qi Han, Kai Zhao, Jun Xu, Mingg-Ming Cheng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: https://github.com/Hanqer/deep-hough-transform
\\
  In this paper, we put forward a simple yet effective method to detect
meaningful straight lines, a.k.a. semantic lines, in given scenes. Prior
methods take line detection as a special case of object detection, while
neglect the inherent characteristics of lines, leading to less efficient and
suboptimal results. We propose a one-shot end-to-end framework by incorporating
the classical Hough transform into deeply learned representations. By
parameterizing lines with slopes and biases, we perform Hough transform to
translate deep representations to the parametric space and then directly detect
lines in the parametric space. More concretely, we aggregate features along
candidate lines on the feature map plane and then assign the aggregated
features to corresponding locations in the parametric domain. Consequently, the
problem of detecting semantic lines in the spatial domain is transformed to
spotting individual points in the parametric domain, making the post-processing
steps, \ie non-maximal suppression, more efficient. Furthermore, our method
makes it easy to extract contextual line features, that are critical to
accurate line detection. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate
the advantages of our method over state-of-the-arts.

Title: Deep Blind Video Super-resolution
Authors: Jinshan Pan, Songsheng Cheng, Jiawei Zhang, Jinhui Tang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Existing video super-resolution (SR) algorithms usually assume that the blur
kernels in the degradation process are known and do not model the blur kernels
in the restoration. However, this assumption does not hold for video SR and
usually leads to over-smoothed super-resolved images. In this paper, we propose
a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to solve video SR by a blur
kernel modeling approach. The proposed deep CNN model consists of motion blur
estimation, motion estimation, and latent image restoration modules. The motion
blur estimation module is used to provide reliable blur kernels. With the
estimated blur kernel, we develop an image deconvolution method based on the
image formation model of video SR to generate intermediate latent images so
that some sharp image contents can be restored well. However, the generated
intermediate latent images may contain artifacts. To generate high-quality
images, we use the motion estimation module to explore the information from
adjacent frames, where the motion estimation can constrain the deep CNN model
for better image restoration. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to
generate clearer images with finer structural details. Extensive experimental
results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against
state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Dual-attention Guided Dropblock Module for Weakly Supervised Object
  Localization
Authors: Junhui Yin, Siqing Zhang, Dongliang Chang, Zhanyu Ma, Jun Guo

Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1908.10028 by other authors
\\
  In this paper, we propose a dual-attention guided dropblock module, and
target at learning the complementary and discriminative visual patterns for
weakly supervised object localization (WSOL). We extend the attention mechanism
in the task of WSOL, and carefully design two types of attention modules to
capture the informative features for better feature representations. Based on
two types of attention mechanism, we propose a channel attention guided dropout
(CAGD) and a spatial attention guided dropblock (SAGD). The CAGD ranks channel
attention according to a measure of importance and treat the top-k largest
magnitude attentions as important ones. The SAGD can not only completely remove
the information by erasing the contiguous regions of feature maps rather than
individual pixels, but also simply sense the foreground objects and background
regions to alleviate the attention misdirection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art localization
accuracy on three challenging datasets.

Title: Restore from Restored: Single Image Denoising with Pseudo Clean Image
Authors: Seunghwan Lee, Donghyeon Cho, Jiwon Kim, Tae Hyun Kim
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2001.02899
\\
  Under certain statistical assumptions of noise (e.g., zero-mean noise),
recent self-supervised approaches for denoising have been introduced to learn
network parameters without ground-truth clean images, and these methods can
restore an image by exploiting information available from the given input
(i.e., internal statistics) at test time. However, self-supervised methods are
not yet properly combined with conventional supervised denoising methods which
train the denoising networks with a large number of external training images.
Thus, we propose a new denoising approach that can greatly outperform the
state-of-the-art supervised denoising methods by adapting (fine-tuning) their
network parameters to the given specific input through self-supervision without
changing the fully original network architectures. We demonstrate that the
proposed method can be easily employed with state-of-the-art denoising networks
without additional parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on
numerous denoising benchmark datasets.

\\
  Acquisition of data with adverse conditions in robotics is a cumbersome task
due to the difficulty in guaranteeing proper ground truth and synchronising
with desired weather conditions. In this paper, we present a simple method -
recording a high resolution screen - for generating diverse rainy images from
existing clear ground-truth images that is domain- and source-agnostic, simple
and scales up. This setup allows us to leverage the diversity of existing
datasets with auxiliary task ground-truth data, such as semantic segmentation,
object positions etc. We generate rainy images with real adherent droplets and
rain streaks based on Cityscapes and BDD, and train a de-raining model. We
present quantitative results for image reconstruction and semantic
segmentation, and qualitative results for an out-of-sample domain, showing that
models trained with our data generalize well.

Title: AP-MTL: Attention Pruned Multi-task Learning Model for Real-time
  Instrument Detection and Segmentation in Robot-assisted Surgery
Authors: Mobarakol Islam, Vibashan VS, Hongliang Ren
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: Accepted in the conference of ICRA 2020
\\
  Surgical scene understanding and multi-tasking learning are crucial for
image-guided robotic surgery. Training a real-time robotic system for the
detection and segmentation of high-resolution images provides a challenging
problem with the limited computational resource. The perception drawn can be
applied in effective real-time feedback, surgical skill assessment, and
human-robot collaborative surgeries to enhance surgical outcomes. For this
purpose, we develop a novel end-to-end trainable real-time Multi-Task Learning
(MTL) model with weight-shared encoder and task-aware detection and
segmentation decoders. Optimization of multiple tasks at the same convergence
point is vital and presents a complex problem. Thus, we propose an asynchronous
task-aware optimization (ATO) technique to calculate task-oriented gradients
and train the decoders independently. Moreover, MTL models are always
computationally expensive, which hinder real-time applications. To address this
challenge, we introduce a global attention dynamic pruning (GADP) by removing
less significant and sparse parameters. We further design a skip squeeze and
excitation (SE) module, which suppresses weak features, excites significant
features and performs dynamic spatial and channel-wise feature re-calibration.
Validating on the robotic instrument segmentation dataset of MICCAI endoscopic
vision challenge, our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation and detection models, including best-performed models in the
challenge.

  Surgical gesture recognition is important for surgical data science and
computer-aided intervention. Even with robotic kinematic information,
automatically segmenting surgical steps presents numerous challenges because
surgical demonstrations are characterized by high variability in style,
duration and order of actions. In order to extract discriminative features from
the kinematic signals and boost recognition accuracy, we propose a multi-task
recurrent neural network for simultaneous recognition of surgical gestures and
estimation of a novel formulation of surgical task progress. To show the
effectiveness of the presented approach, we evaluate its application on the
JIGSAWS dataset, that is currently the only publicly available dataset for
surgical gesture recognition featuring robot kinematic data. We demonstrate
that recognition performance improves in multi-task frameworks with progress
estimation without any additional manual labelling and training.

  We propose a method for off-road drivable area extraction using 3D LiDAR data
with the goal of autonomous driving application. A specific deep learning
framework is designed to deal with the ambiguous area, which is one of the main
challenges in the off-road environment. To reduce the considerable demand for
human-annotated data for network training, we utilize the information from vast
quantities of vehicle paths and auto-generated obstacle labels. Using these
autogenerated annotations, the proposed network can be trained using weakly
supervised or semi-supervised methods, which can achieve better performance
with fewer human annotations. The experiments on our dataset illustrate the
reasonability of our framework and the validity of our weakly and
semi-supervised methods.

Title: Dam Burst: A region-merging-based image segmentation method
Authors: Rui Tang, Wenlong Song, Xiaoping Guan, Huibin Ge, and Deke Kong
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Until now, all single level segmentation algorithms except CNN-based ones
lead to over segmentation. And CNN-based segmentation algorithms have their own
problems. To avoid over segmentation, multiple thresholds of criteria are
adopted in region merging process to produce hierarchical segmentation results.
However, there still has extreme over segmentation in the low level of the
hierarchy, and outstanding tiny objects are merged to their large adjacencies
in the high level of the hierarchy. This paper proposes a region-merging-based
image segmentation method that we call it Dam Burst. As a single level
segmentation algorithm, this method avoids over segmentation and retains
details by the same time. It is named because of that it simulates a flooding
from underground destroys dams between water-pools. We treat edge detection
results as strengthening structure of a dam if it is on the dam. To simulate a
flooding from underground, regions are merged by ascending order of the average
gra-dient inside the region.

Title: SAD: Saliency-based Defenses Against Adversarial Examples
Authors: Richard Tran, David Patrick, Michael Geyer, Amanda Fernandez
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  With the rise in popularity of machine and deep learning models, there is an
increased focus on their vulnerability to malicious inputs. These adversarial
examples drift model predictions away from the original intent of the network
and are a growing concern in practical security. In order to combat these
attacks, neural networks can leverage traditional image processing approaches
or state-of-the-art defensive models to reduce perturbations in the data.
Defensive approaches that take a global approach to noise reduction are
effective against adversarial attacks, however their lossy approach often
distorts important data within the image. In this work, we propose a visual
saliency based approach to cleaning data affected by an adversarial attack. Our
model leverages the salient regions of an adversarial image in order to provide
a targeted countermeasure while comparatively reducing loss within the cleaned
images. We measure the accuracy of our model by evaluating the effectiveness of
state-of-the-art saliency methods prior to attack, under attack, and after
application of cleaning methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach in comparison with related defenses and against established
adversarial attack methods, across two saliency datasets. Our targeted approach
shows significant improvements in a range of standard statistical and distance
saliency metrics, in comparison with both traditional and state-of-the-art
approaches.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020.
  Code:https://github.com/hlzhu09/Hierarchical-Human-Parsing
\\
  Human parsing is for pixel-wise human semantic understanding. As human bodies
are underlying hierarchically structured, how to model human structures is the
central theme in this task. Focusing on this, we seek to simultaneously exploit
the representational capacity of deep graph networks and the hierarchical human
structures. In particular, we provide following two contributions. First, three
kinds of part relations, i.e., decomposition, composition, and dependency, are,
for the first time, completely and precisely described by three distinct
relation networks. This is in stark contrast to previous parsers, which only
focus on a portion of the relations and adopt a type-agnostic relation modeling
strategy. More expressive relation information can be captured by explicitly
imposing the parameters in the relation networks to satisfy the specific
characteristics of different relations. Second, previous parsers largely ignore
the need for an approximation algorithm over the loopy human hierarchy, while
we instead address an iterative reasoning process, by assimilating generic
message-passing networks with their edge-typed, convolutional counterparts.
With these efforts, our parser lays the foundation for more sophisticated and
flexible human relation patterns of reasoning. Comprehensive experiments on
five datasets demonstrate that our parser sets a new state-of-the-art on each.

large-scale, long-term, and multi-object visual analysis. The videos in PANDA
were captured by a gigapixel camera and cover real-world scenes with both wide
field-of-view (~1 square kilometer area) and high-resolution details
(~gigapixel-level/frame). The scenes may contain 4k head counts with over 100x
scale variation. PANDA provides enriched and hierarchical ground-truth
annotations, including 15,974.6k bounding boxes, 111.8k fine-grained attribute
labels, 12.7k trajectories, 2.2k groups and 2.9k interactions. We benchmark the
human detection and tracking tasks. Due to the vast variance of pedestrian
pose, scale, occlusion and trajectory, existing approaches are challenged by
both accuracy and efficiency. Given the uniqueness of PANDA with both wide FoV
and high resolution, a new task of interaction-aware group detection is
introduced. We design a 'global-to-local zoom-in' framework, where global
trajectories and local interactions are simultaneously encoded, yielding
promising results. We believe PANDA will contribute to the community of
artificial intelligence and praxeology by understanding human behaviors and
interactions in large-scale real-world scenes. PANDA Website:

Title: Image Restoration for Under-Display Camera

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The new trend of full-screen devices encourages us to position a camera
behind a screen. Removing the bezel and centralizing the camera under the
screen brings larger display-to-body ratio and enhances eye contact in video
chat, but also causes image degradation. In this paper, we focus on a
newly-defined Under-Display Camera (UDC), as a novel real-world single image
restoration problem. First, we take a 4k Transparent OLED (T-OLED) and a phone
Pentile OLED (P-OLED) and analyze their optical systems to understand the
degradation. Second, we design a novel Monitor-Camera Imaging System (MCIS) for
easier real pair data acquisition, and a model-based data synthesizing pipeline
to generate UDC data only from display pattern and camera measurements.
Finally, we resolve the complicated degradation using learning-based methods.
Our model demonstrates a real-time high-quality restoration trained with either
real or synthetic data. The presented results and methods provide good practice
to apply image restoration to real-world applications.

Title: Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Adversarial Consistency Loss
Authors: Yihao Zhao, Ruihai Wu, Hao Dong
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Unpaired image-to-image translation is a class of vision problems whose goal
is to find the mapping between different image domains using unpaired training
data. Cycle-consistency loss is a widely used constraint for such problems.
However, due to the strict pixel-level constraint, it cannot perform geometric
changes, remove large objects, or ignore irrelevant texture. In this paper, we
propose a novel adversarial-consistency loss for image-to-image translation.
This loss does not require the translated image to be translated back to be a
specific source image but can encourage the translated images to retain
important features of the source images and overcome the drawbacks of
cycle-consistency loss noted above. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
results on three challenging tasks: glasses removal, male-to-female
translation, and selfie-to-anime translation.

  Smart cities solutions are often monolithically implemented, from sensors
data handling through to the provided services. The same challenges are
regularly faced by different developers, for every new solution in a new city.
Expertise and know-how can be re-used and the effort shared. In this article we
present the methodologies to minimize the efforts of implementing new smart
city solutions and maximizing the sharing of components. The final target is to
have a live technical community of smart city application developers. The
results of this activity comes from the implementation of 35 city services in
27 cities between Europe and South Korea. To share efforts, we encourage
developers to devise applications using a modular approach. Single-function
components that are re-usable by other city services are packaged and published
as standalone components, named Atomic Services. We identify 15 atomic services
addressing smart city challenges in data analytics, data evaluation, data
integration, data validation, and visualization. 38 instances of the atomic
services are already operational in several smart city services. We detail in
this article, as atomic service examples, some data predictor components.
Furthermore, we describe real-world atomic services usage in the scenarios of
Santander and three Danish cities. The resulting atomic services also generate
a side market for smart city solutions, allowing expertise and know-how to be
re-used by different stakeholders.

Title: Probabilistic Partitive Partitioning (PPP)
Authors: Mujahid Sultan
Categories: cs.DB cs.LG
\\
  Clustering is a NP-hard problem. Thus, no optimal algorithm exists,
heuristics are applied to cluster the data. Heuristics can be very
resource-intensive, if not applied properly. For substantially large data sets
computational efficiencies can be achieved by reducing the input space if a
minimal loss of information can be achieved. Clustering algorithms, in general,
face two common problems: 1) these converge to different settings with
different initial conditions and; 2) the number of clusters has to be
arbitrarily decided beforehand. This problem has become critical in the realm
of big data. Recently, clustering algorithms have emerged which can speedup
computations using parallel processing over the grid but face the
aforementioned problems. Goals: Our goals are to find methods to cluster data
which: 1) guarantee convergence to the same settings irrespective of the
initial conditions; 2) eliminate the need to establish the number of clusters
beforehand, and 3) can be applied to cluster large datasets. Methods: We
introduce a method that combines probabilistic and combinatorial clustering
methods to produce repeatable and compact clusters that are not sensitive to
initial conditions. This method harnesses the power of k-means (a combinatorial
clustering method) to cluster/partition very large dimensional datasets and
uses the Gaussian Mixture Model (a probabilistic clustering method) to validate
the k-means partitions. Results: We show that this method produces very compact
clusters that are not sensitive to initial conditions. This method can be used
to identify the most 'separable' set in a dataset which increases the
'clusterability' of a dataset. This method also eliminates the need to specify
the number of clusters in advance.

Title: A Note On Operator-Level Query Execution Cost Modeling
Authors: Wentao Wu
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  External query execution cost modeling using query execution feedback has
found its way in various database applications such as admission control and
query scheduling. Existing techniques in general fall into two categories,
plan-level cost modeling and operator-level cost modeling. It has been shown in
the literature that operator-level cost modeling can often significantly
outperform plan-level cost modeling. In this paper, we study operator-level
cost modeling from a robustness perspective. We address two main challenges in
practice regarding limited execution feedback (for certain operators) and mixed
cost estimates due to the use of multiple cost modeling techniques. We propose
a framework that deals with these issues and present a comprehensive analysis
of this framework. We further provide a case study to demonstrate the efficacy
of our framework in the context of index tuning, which is itself a new
application of external cost modeling techniques.

\\
  In recent years, precision agriculture is becoming very popular. The
introduction of modern information and communication technologies for
collecting and processing Agricultural data revolutionise the agriculture
practises. This has started a while ago (early 20th century) and it is driven
by the low cost of collecting data about everything; from information on fields
such as seed, soil, fertiliser, pest, to weather data, drones and satellites
images. Specially, the agricultural data mining today is considered as Big Data
application in terms of volume, variety, velocity and veracity. Hence it leads
to challenges in processing vast amounts of complex and diverse information to
extract useful knowledge for the farmer, agronomist, and other businesses. It
is a key foundation to establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will
enable efficient resource management and high quality agronomy decision making
and recommendations. In this paper, we designed and implemented a continental
level agricultural data warehouse (ADW). ADW is characterised by its (1)
flexible schema; (2) data integration from real agricultural multi datasets;
(3) data science and business intelligent support; (4) high performance; (5)
high storage; (6) security; (7) governance and monitoring; (8) consistency,
availability and partition tolerant; (9) cloud compatibility. We also evaluate
the performance of ADW and present some complex queries to extract and return
necessary knowledge about crop management.

Title: Distributed Submodular Maximization with Parallel Execution
Authors: Haoyuan Sun, David Grimsman, Jason R Marden
Categories: cs.DC cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  The submodular maximization problem is widely applicable in many engineering
problems where objectives exhibit diminishing returns. While this problem is
known to be NP-hard for certain subclasses of objective functions, there is a
greedy algorithm which guarantees approximation at least 1/2 of the optimal
solution. This greedy algorithm can be implemented with a set of agents, each
making a decision sequentially based on the choices of all prior agents. In
this paper, we consider a generalization of the greedy algorithm in which
agents can make decisions in parallel, rather than strictly in sequence. In
particular, we are interested in partitioning the agents, where a set of agents
in the partition all make a decision simultaneously based on the choices of
prior agents, so that the algorithm terminates in limited iterations. We
provide bounds on the performance of this parallelized version of the greedy
algorithm and show that dividing the agents evenly among the sets in the
partition yields an optimal structure. We additionally show that this optimal
structure is still near-optimal when the objective function exhibits a certain
monotone property. Lastly, we show that the same performance guarantees can be
achieved in the parallelized greedy algorithm even when agents can only observe
the decisions of a subset of prior agents.

Title: HEAAN Demystified: Accelerating Fully Homomorphic Encryption Through
  Architecture-centric Analysis and Optimization
Authors: Wonkyung Jung, Eojin Lee, Sangpyo Kim, Keewoo Lee, Namhoon Kim,
  Chohong Min, Jung Hee Cheon, Jung Ho Ahn
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Homomorphic Encryption (HE) draws a significant attention as a
privacy-preserving way for cloud computing because it allows computation on
encrypted messages called ciphertexts. Among numerous HE schemes proposed, HE
for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers (HEAAN) is rapidly gaining popularity
across a wide range of applications because it supports messages that can
tolerate approximate computation with no limit on the number of arithmetic
operations applicable to the corresponding ciphertexts. A critical shortcoming
of HE is the high computation complexity of ciphertext arithmetic; especially,
HE multiplication (HE Mul) is more than 10,000 times slower than the
corresponding multiplication between unencrypted messages. This leads to a
large body of HE acceleration studies, including ones exploiting FPGAs;
however, those did not conduct a rigorous analysis of computational complexity
and data access patterns of HE Mul. Moreover, the proposals mostly focused on
designs with small parameter sizes, making it difficult to accurately estimate
their performance in conducting a series of complex arithmetic operations. In
this paper, we first describe how HE Mul of HEAAN is performed in a manner
friendly to computer architects. Then we conduct a disciplined analysis on its
computational and memory access characteristics, through which we (1) extract
parallelism in the key functions composing HE Mul and (2) demonstrate how to
effectively map the parallelism to the popular parallel processing platforms,
multicore CPUs and GPUs, by applying a series of optimization techniques such
as transposing matrices and pinning data to threads. This leads to the
performance improvement of HE Mul on a CPU and a GPU by 42.9x and 134.1x,
respectively, over the single-thread reference HEAAN running on a CPU. The
conducted analysis and optimization would set a new foundation for future HE
acceleration research.

\\
  Graphs and their traversal is becoming significant as it is applicable to
various areas of mathematics, science and technology. Various problems in
fields as varied as biochemistry (genomics), electrical engineering
(communication networks), computer science (algorithms and computation) can be
modeled as Graph problems. Real world scenarios including communities their
interconnections and related properties can be studied using graphs. So fast,
scalable, low-cost execution of parallel graph algorithms is very important. In
this implementation of parallel breadth first search of graphs, we implemented
Parallel BFS algorithm with 1-D partitioning of graph as described in [2] and
have reduced execution time by optimizing communication for local buffers.

Title: Maximizing Happiness in Graphs of Bounded Clique-Width
Authors: Ivan Bliznets and Danil Sagunov
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: Accepted to LATIN 2020
ACM-class: F.2.0
\\
  Clique-width is one of the most important parameters that describes
structural complexity of a graph. Probably, only treewidth is more studied
graph width parameter. In this paper we study how clique-width influences the
complexity of the Maximum Happy Vertices (MHV) and Maximum Happy Edges (MHE)
problems. We answer a question of Choudhari and Reddy '18 about
parameterization by the distance to threshold graphs by showing that MHE is
NP-complete on threshold graphs. Hence, it is not even in XP when parameterized
by clique-width, since threshold graphs have clique-width at most two. As a
complement for this result we provide a $n^{\mathcal{O}(\ell \cdot
\operatorname{cw})}$ algorithm for MHE, where $\ell$ is the number of colors
and $\operatorname{cw}$ is the clique-width of the input graph. We also
construct an FPT algorithm for MHV with running time
$\mathcal{O}^*((\ell+1)^{\mathcal{O}(\operatorname{cw})})$, where $\ell$ is the
number of colors in the input. Additionally, we show $\mathcal{O}(\ell n^2)$
algorithm for MHV on interval graphs.

Title: Circulation Control for Faster Minimum Cost Flow in Unit-Capacity Graphs
Authors: Kyriakos Axiotis, Aleksander M\k{a}dry, Adrian Vladu
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We present an $m^{11/8+o(1)} \log W$-time algorithm for solving the minimum
cost flow problem in graphs with unit capacity, where $W$ is the absolute
maximum weight of an edge in the graph. For sparse graphs, this improves over
the best known running time for this problem and, by well-known reductions,
also implies improved running times for the shortest path problem with negative
weights, minimum cost bipartite $\boldsymbol{\mathit{b}}$-matching when
$\|\boldsymbol{\mathit{b}}\|_1 = O(m)$, and recovers the running time of the
currently fastest algorithm for maximum flow in graphs with unit capacities
(Liu-Sidford).
  Our algorithm relies on developing an interior point method--based framework
which acts on the space of circulations in the underlying graph. From the
combinatorial point of view, this framework can be viewed as iteratively
improving the cost of a suboptimal solution by pushing flow around
circulations. These circulations are derived by computing a regularized version
of the standard Newton step, which can be done efficiently due to recent
developments on computing $\ell_p$-norm minimizing flows
(Kyng-Peng-Sachdeva-Wang). We obtain our faster algorithm by combining this
approach with a customized preconditioning method, which aims to ensure that
the graph on which these circulations are computed has sufficiently large
conductance.

Title: Physics for Neuromorphic Computing

Categories: cs.ET cond-mat.mtrl-sci
\\
  Neuromorphic computing takes inspiration from the brain to create energy
efficient hardware for information processing, capable of highly sophisticated
tasks. In this article, we make the case that building this new hardware
necessitates reinventing electronics. We show that research in physics and
material science will be key to create artificial nano-neurons and synapses, to
connect them together in huge numbers, to organize them in complex systems, and
to compute with them efficiently. We describe how some researchers choose to
take inspiration from artificial intelligence to move forward in this
direction, whereas others prefer taking inspiration from neuroscience, and we
highlight recent striking results obtained with these two approaches. Finally,
we discuss the challenges and perspectives in neuromorphic physics, which
include developing the algorithms and the hardware hand in hand, making
significant advances with small toy systems, as well as building large scale
networks.

Title: Scattered Factor-Universality of Words
Authors: Laura Barker, Pamela Fleischmann, Katharina Harwardt, Florin Manea,

Categories: cs.FL math.CO
\\
  A word $u=u_1\dots u_n$ is a scattered factor of a word $w$ if $u$ can be
obtained from $w$ by deleting some of its letters: there exist the (potentially
empty) words $v_0,v_1,..,v_n$ such that $w = v_0u_1v_1...u_nv_n$. The set of
all scattered factors up to length $k$ of a word is called its full
$k$-spectrum. Firstly, we show an algorithm deciding whether the $k$-spectra
for given $k$ of two words are equal or not, running in optimal time. Secondly,
we consider a notion of scattered-factors universality: the word $w$, with
$\letters(w)=\Sigma$, is called $k$-universal if its $k$-spectrum includes all
words of length $k$ over the alphabet $\Sigma$; we extend this notion to
$k$-circular universality. After a series of preliminary combinatorial results,
we present an algorithm computing, for a given $k'$-universal word $w$ the
minimal $i$ such that $w^i$ is $k$-universal for some $k>k'$. Several other
connected problems~are~also~considered.

Title: Enabling Viewpoint Learning through Dynamic Label Generation
Authors: Michael Schelling, Pedro Hermosilla, Pere-Pau Vazquez, Timo Ropinski
Categories: cs.GR cs.CV
\\
  Optimal viewpoint prediction is an essential task in many computer
graphicsapplications. Unfortunately, common viewpoint qualities suffer from
majordrawbacks: dependency on clean surface meshes, which are not
alwaysavailable, insensitivity to upright orientation, and the lack of
closed-formexpressions, which requires a costly sampling process involving
rendering.We overcome these limitations through a 3D deep learning approach,
whichsolely exploits vertex coordinate information to predict optimal
viewpointsunder upright orientation, while reflecting both informational
content andhuman preference analysis. To enable this approach we propose a
dynamiclabel generation strategy, which resolves inherent label ambiguities
dur-ing training. In contrast to previous viewpoint prediction methods,
whichevaluate many rendered views, we directly learn on the 3D mesh, and
arethus independent from rendering. Furthermore, by exploiting
unstructuredlearning, we are independent of mesh discretization. We show how
the pro-posed technology enables learned prediction from model to viewpoints
fordifferent object categories and viewpoint qualities. Additionally, we
showthat prediction times are reduced from several minutes to a fraction of
asecond, as compared to viewpoint quality evaluation. We will release thecode
and training data, which will to our knowledge be the biggest viewpointquality
dataset available.

Title: Crowd-MECS: A Novel Crowdsourcing Framework for Mobile Edge Caching and
  Sharing
Authors: Changkun Jiang, Lin Gao, Tong Wang, Yufei Jiang, and Jianqiang Li
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  Crowdsourced mobile edge caching and sharing (Crowd-MECS) is emerging as a
promising content delivery paradigm by employing a large crowd of existing edge
devices (EDs) to cache and share popular contents. The successful technology
adoption of Crowd-MECS relies on a comprehensive understanding of the
complicated economic interactions and strategic decision-making of different
stakeholders. In this paper, we focus on studying the economic and strategic
interactions between one content provider (CP) and a large crowd of EDs, where
the EDs can decide whether to cache and share contents for the CP, and the CP
can decide to share a certain revenue with EDs as the incentive of caching and
sharing contents. We formulate such an interaction as a two-stage Stackelberg
game. In Stage I, the CP aims to maximize its own profit by deciding the ratio
of revenue shared with EDs. In Stage II, EDs aim to maximize their own payoffs
by choosing to be agents who cache and share contents, and meanwhile gain a
certain revenue from the CP, or requesters who do not cache but request
contents in the on-demand fashion. We first analyze the EDs' best responses and
prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium in Stage II by using the
non-atomic game theory. Then, we identify the piece-wise structure and the
unimodal feature of the CP's profit function, based on which we design a
tailored low-complexity one-dimensional search algorithm to achieve the optimal
revenue sharing ratio for the CP in Stage I. Simulation results show that both
the CP's profit and the EDs' total welfare can be improved significantly (e.g.,
by 120% and 50%, respectively) by using the proposed Crowd-MECS, comparing with
the Non-MEC system where the CP serves all EDs directly.

  Unaccompanied migrant youth, fleeing to a new country without their parents,
are exposed to mental health risks. Resilience interventions mitigate such
risks, but access can be hindered by systemic and personal barriers. While much
work has recently addressed designing technology to promote mental health, none
has focused on the needs of these populations. This paper presents the results
of interviews with 18 professional/ volunteer support workers and 5
unaccompanied migrant youths, followed by three design workshops. The results
point to the diverse systems that can facilitate youths' resilience
development. The relationship between the youth and volunteers acting as
mentors is particularly important for increasing resilience but comes with
challenges. This suggests the relevance of a social-ecological model of
resilience with a focus on designing technology to support the mentors in order
to help them better support the youth. We conclude by mapping out the design
space for mentor support.

Title: Explanation-Based Tuning of Opaque Machine Learners with Application to

Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Research in human-centered AI has shown the benefits of machine-learning
systems that can explain their predictions. Methods that allow users to tune a
model in response to the explanations are similarly useful. While both
capabilities are well-developed for transparent learning models (e.g., linear
models and GA2Ms), and recent techniques (e.g., LIME and SHAP) can generate
explanations for opaque models, no method currently exists for tuning of opaque
models in response to explanations. This paper introduces LIMEADE, a general
framework for tuning an arbitrary machine learning model based on an
explanation of the model's prediction. We apply our framework to Semantic
Sanity, a neural recommender system for scientific papers, and report on a
detailed user study, showing that our framework leads to significantly higher
perceived user control, trust, and satisfaction.

  Keyphrase extraction models are usually evaluated under different, not

well proposed models actually perform, and how they compare to each other. In
this work, we address this issue by presenting a systematic large-scale
analysis of state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction models involving multiple
benchmark datasets from various sources and domains. Our main results reveal
that state-of-the-art models are in fact still challenged by simple baselines
on some datasets. We also present new insights about the impact of using
author- or reader-assigned keyphrases as a proxy for gold standard, and give
recommendations for strong baselines and reliable benchmark datasets.

  paper was presented in part at the IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW),

\\
  We analyze the finite-length performance of spatially coupled low-density
parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes under window decoding over the binary erasure
channel. In particular, we propose a refinement of the scaling law by Olmos and
Urbanke for the frame error rate (FER) of terminated SC-LDPC ensembles under
full belief propagation (BP) decoding. The refined scaling law models the
decoding process as two independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, in
correspondence to the two decoding waves that propagate toward the center of
the coupled chain for terminated SC-LDPC codes. We then extend the proposed
scaling law to predict the performance of (terminated) SC-LDPC code ensembles
under the more practical sliding window decoding. Finally, we extend this
framework to predict the bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) of
SC-LDPC code ensembles. The proposed scaling law yields very accurate
predictions of the FER, BLER, and BER for both full BP and window decoding.

Comments: This paper was submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information

\\
  We study the covert communication over K-user discrete memoryless
interference channels (DM-ICs) with a warden. It is assumed that the warden's
channel output distribution induced by K "off" input symbols, which are sent
when no communication occurs, is not a convex combination of those induced by
any other combination of input symbols (otherwise, the square-root law does not
hold). We derive the exact covert capacity region and show that a simple
point-to-point based scheme with treating interference as noise is optimal. In
addition, we analyze the secret key length required for the reliable and covert
communication with the desired rates, and present a channel condition where a
secret key between each user pair is unnecessary. The results are extended to
the Gaussian case and the case with multiple wardens.

Title: Joint Parameter-and-Bandwidth Allocation for Improving the Efficiency of
  Partitioned Edge Learning
Authors: Dingzhu Wen, Mehdi Bennis, and Kaibin Huang
Categories: cs.IT cs.DC cs.LG math.IT
\\
  To leverage data and computation capabilities of mobile devices, machine
learning algorithms are deployed at the network edge for training artificial
intelligence (AI) models, resulting in the new paradigm of edge learning. In
this paper, we consider the framework of partitioned edge learning for
iteratively training a large-scale model using many resource-constrained
devices (called workers). To this end, in each iteration, the model is
dynamically partitioned into parametric blocks, which are downloaded to worker
groups for updating using data subsets. Then, the local updates are uploaded to
and cascaded by the server for updating a global model. To reduce resource
usage by minimizing the total learning-and-communication latency, this work
focuses on the novel j.pdfoint design of parameter (computation load)
allocation and bandwidth allocation (for downloading and uploading). Two design
approaches are adopted. First, a practical sequential approach, called
partially integrated parameter-and-bandwidth allocation (PABA), yields two
schemes, namely bandwidth aware parameter allocation and parameter aware
bandwidth allocation. The former minimizes the load for the slowest (in
computing) of worker groups, each training a same parametric block. The latter
allocates the largest bandwidth to the worker being the latency bottleneck.
Second, PABA are jointly optimized. Despite its being a nonconvex problem, an
efficient and optimal solution algorithm is derived by intelligently nesting a
bisection search and solving a convex problem. Experimental results using real
data demonstrate that integrating PABA can substantially improve the
performance of partitioned edge learning in terms of latency (by e.g., 46%) and
accuracy (by e.g., 4%).

Title: On a Class of Markov Order Estimators Based on PPM and Other Universal
  Codes
Authors: {\L}ukasz D\k{e}bowski

\\
  We investigate a class of estimators of the Markov order for stationary
ergodic processes which form a slight modification of the construction by
Merhav, Gutman, and Ziv (1989). Both kinds of estimators compare the estimate
of the entropy rate given by a universal code with the empirical conditional
entropy of a string and return the order for which the two quantities are
approximately equal. However, our modification, which we call universal Markov
orders, satisfies a few attractive properties, not shown by Merhav, Gutman, and
Ziv (1989) for their original definition. Firstly, the universal Markov orders
are almost surely consistent, without any restrictions. Secondly, they are
upper bounded asymptotically by the logarithm of the string length divided by
the entropy rate. Thirdly, if we choose the Prediction by Partial Matching
(PPM) as the universal code then the number of distinct substrings of the
length equal to the universal Markov order constitutes an upper bound for the
block mutual information. Thus universal Markov orders can be also used
indirectly for quantification of long memory for an ergodic process.

  Constraints

\\
  In the fifth generation and beyond (B5G), delayconstraints emerge as a topic
of particular interest, e.g. forultra-reliable low latency communications
(URLLC) such asautonomous vehicles and enhanced reality. In this paper,
westudythe performance of a two-user uplink NOMA network understatistical
quality of service (QoS) delay constraints, capturedthrough each user s
effective capacity (EC). We propose novelclosed-form expressions for the EC of
the NOMA users andshow that in the high signal to noise ratio (SNR) region, the
'strong' NOMA user has a limited EC, assuming the same delayconstraint as the
'weak' user. We demonstrate that for the weakuser, OMA achieves higher EC than
NOMA at small values ofthe transmit SNR, while NOMA outperforms OMA in terms
ofEC at high SNRs. On the other hand, for the strong user theopposite is true,
i.e., NOMA achieves higher EC than OMA atsmall SNRs, while OMA becomes more
beneficial at high SNRs.This result raises the question of introducing
'adaptive' OMA /NOMA policies, based jointly on the users delay constraints
aswell as on the available transmit power.

Title: An Optimal Condition of Robust Low-rank Matrices Recovery
Authors: Jianwen Huang, Jianjun Wang, Feng Zhang, and Wendong Wang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper we investigate the reconstruction conditions of nuclear norm
minimization for low-rank matrix recovery. We obtain sufficient conditions
$\delta_{tr}<t/(4-t)$ with $0<t<4/3$ to guarantee the robust reconstruction
$(z\neq0)$ or exact reconstruction $(z=0)$ of all rank $r$ matrices
$X\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ from $b=\mathcal{A}(X)+z$ via nuclear norm
minimization. Furthermore, we not only show that when $t=1$, the upper bound of
$\delta_r<1/3$ is the same as the result of Cai and Zhang \cite{Cai and Zhang},
but also demonstrate that the gained upper bounds concerning the recovery error
are better. Moreover, we prove that the restricted isometry property condition
is sharp. Besides, the numerical experiments are conducted to reveal the
nuclear norm minimization method is stable and robust for the recovery of
low-rank matrix.

Title: Revisiting SGD with Increasingly Weighted Averaging: Optimization and
  Generalization Perspectives
Authors: Zhishuai Guo, Zixuan Wu, Yan Yan, Xiaoyu Wang and Tianbao Yang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been widely studied in the literature
from different angles, and is commonly employed for solving many big data
machine learning problems. However, the averaging technique, which combines all
iterative solutions into a single solution, is still under-explored. While some
increasingly weighted averaging schemes have been considered in the literature,
existing works are mostly restricted to strongly convex objective functions and
the convergence of optimization error. It remains unclear how these averaging
schemes affect the convergence of {\it both optimization error and
generalization error} (two equally important components of testing error) for
{\bf non-strongly convex objectives, including non-convex problems}. In this
paper, we {\it fill the gap} by comprehensively analyzing the increasingly
weighted averaging on convex, strongly convex and non-convex objective
functions in terms of both optimization error and generalization error. In
particular, we analyze a family of increasingly weighted averaging, where the
weight for the solution at iteration $t$ is proportional to $t^{\alpha}$
($\alpha > 0$). We show how $\alpha$ affects the optimization error and the
generalization error, and exhibit the trade-off caused by $\alpha$. Experiments
have demonstrated this trade-off and the effectiveness of polynomially
increased weighted averaging compared with other averaging schemes for a wide
range of problems including deep learning.

Title: Continuous Domain Adaptation with Variational Domain-Agnostic Feature
  Replay
Authors: Qicheng Lao, Xiang Jiang, Mohammad Havaei, Yoshua Bengio
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Learning in non-stationary environments is one of the biggest challenges in
machine learning. Non-stationarity can be caused by either task drift, i.e.,
the drift in the conditional distribution of labels given the input data, or
the domain drift, i.e., the drift in the marginal distribution of the input
data. This paper aims to tackle this challenge in the context of continuous
domain adaptation, where the model is required to learn new tasks adapted to
new domains in a non-stationary environment while maintaining previously
learned knowledge. To deal with both drifts, we propose variational
domain-agnostic feature replay, an approach that is composed of three
components: an inference module that filters the input data into
domain-agnostic representations, a generative module that facilitates knowledge
transfer, and a solver module that applies the filtered and transferable
knowledge to solve the queries. We address the two fundamental scenarios in
continuous domain adaptation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed
approach for practical usage.

Title: Correlated Initialization for Correlated Data
Authors: Johannes Schneider
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Spatial data exhibits the property that nearby points are correlated. This
holds also for learnt representations across layers, but not for commonly used
weight initialization methods. Our theoretical analysis reveals for
uncorrelated initialization that (i) flow through layers suffers from much more
rapid decrease and (ii) training of individual parameters is subject to more
``zig-zagging''. We propose multiple methods for correlated initialization. For
CNNs, they yield accuracy gains of several per cent in the absence of
regularization. Even for properly tuned L2-regularization gains are often
possible.

Title: Transfer Reinforcement Learning under Unobserved Contextual Information
Authors: Yan Zhang and Michael M. Zavlanos
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we study a transfer reinforcement learning problem where the
state transitions and rewards are affected by the environmental context.
Specifically, we consider a demonstrator agent that has access to a
context-aware policy and can generate transition and reward data based on that
policy. These data constitute the experience of the demonstrator. Then, the
goal is to transfer this experience, excluding the underlying contextual
information, to a learner agent that does not have access to the environmental
context, so that they can learn a control policy using fewer samples. It is
well known that, disregarding the causal effect of the contextual information,
can introduce bias in the transition and reward models estimated by the
learner, resulting in a learned suboptimal policy. To address this challenge,
in this paper, we develop a method to obtain causal bounds on the transition
and reward functions using the demonstrator's data, which we then use to obtain
causal bounds on the value functions. Using these value function bounds, we
propose new Q learning and UCB-Q learning algorithms that converge to the true
value function without bias. We provide numerical experiments for robot motion
planning problems that validate the proposed value function bounds and
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively make use of the data
from the demonstrator to accelerate the learning process of the learner.

Title: Set-Structured Latent Representations
Authors: Qian Huang, Horace He, Abhay Singh, Yan Zhang, Ser-Nam Lim, Austin
  Benson
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Preprint, 17 pages
\\
  Unstructured data often has latent component structure, such as the objects
in an image of a scene. In these situations, the relevant latent structure is
an unordered collection or \emph{set}. However, learning such representations
directly from data is difficult due to the discrete and unordered structure.
Here, we develop a framework for differentiable learning of set-structured
latent representations. We show how to use this framework to naturally
decompose data such as images into sets of interpretable and meaningful
components and demonstrate how existing techniques cannot properly disentangle
relevant structure. We also show how to extend our methodology to downstream
tasks such as set matching, which uses set-specific operations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/CUVL/SSLR.

Title: Domain Adaptation with Conditional Distribution Matching and Generalized
  Label Shift
Authors: Remi Tachet des Combes, Han Zhao, Yu-Xiang Wang and Geoff Gordon
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Adversarial learning has demonstrated good performance in the unsupervised
domain adaptation setting, by learning domain-invariant representations that
perform well on the source domain. However, recent work has underlined
limitations of existing methods in the presence of mismatched label
distributions between the source and target domains. In this paper, we extend a
recent upper-bound on the performance of adversarial domain adaptation to
multi-class classification and more general discriminators. We then propose
generalized label shift (GLS) as a way to improve robustness against mismatched
label distributions. GLS states that, conditioned on the label, there exists a
representation of the input that is invariant between the source and target
domains. Under GLS, we provide theoretical guarantees on the transfer
performance of any classifier. We also devise necessary and sufficient
conditions for GLS to hold. The conditions are based on the estimation of the
relative class weights between domains and on an appropriate reweighting of
samples. Guided by our theoretical insights, we modify three widely used
algorithms, JAN, DANN and CDAN and evaluate their performance on standard
domain adaptation tasks where our method outperforms the base versions. We also
demonstrate significant gains on artificially created tasks with large
divergences between their source and target label distributions.

Title: Online Tensor-Based Learning for Multi-Way Data
Authors: Ali Anaissi, Basem Suleiman, Seid Miad Zandavi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The online analysis of multi-way data stored in a tensor $\mathcal{X} \in
\mathbb{R} ^{I_1 \times \dots \times I_N} $ has become an essential tool for
capturing the underlying structures and extracting the sensitive features which
can be used to learn a predictive model. However, data distributions often
evolve with time and a current predictive model may not be sufficiently
representative in the future. Therefore, incrementally updating the
tensor-based features and model coefficients are required in such situations. A
new efficient tensor-based feature extraction, named NeSGD, is proposed for
online $CANDECOMP/PARAFAC$ (CP) decomposition. According to the new features
obtained from the resultant matrices of NeSGD, a new criteria is triggered for
the updated process of the online predictive model. Experimental evaluation in
the field of structural health monitoring using laboratory-based and real-life
structural datasets show that our methods provide more accurate results
compared with existing online tensor analysis and model learning. The results
showed that the proposed methods significantly improved the classification
error rates, were able to assimilate the changes in the positive data
distribution over time, and maintained a high predictive accuracy in all case
studies.

Title: Graph Convolutional Auto-encoder with Bi-decoder and Adaptive-sharing
  Adjacency
Authors: Rui Zhang, Yunxing Zhang, Xuelong Li
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Graph autoencoder (GAE) serves as an effective unsupervised learning
framework to represent graph data in a latent space for network embedding. Most
exiting approaches typically focus on minimizing the reconstruction loss of
graph structure but neglect the reconstruction of node features, which may
result in overfitting due to the capacity of the autoencoders. Additionally,
the adjacency matrix in these methods is always fixed such that the adjacency
matrix cannot properly represent the connections among nodes in latent space.
To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Convolutional
Auto-encoder with Bidecoder and Adaptive-sharing Adjacency method, namely BAGA.
The framework encodes the topological structure and node features into latent
representations, on which a bi-decoder is trained to reconstruct the graph
structure and node features simultaneously. Furthermore, the adjacency matrix
can be adaptively updated by the learned latent representations for better
representing the connections among nodes in latent space. Experimental results
on datasets validate the superiority of our method to the state-of-the-art
network embedding methods on the clustering task.

Title: Closure Properties for Private Classification and Online Prediction
Authors: Noga Alon, Amos Beimel, Shay Moran, and Uri Stemmer
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Let H be a class of boolean functions and consider acomposed class H' that is
derived from H using some arbitrary aggregation rule (for example, H' may be
the class of all 3-wise majority votes of functions in H). We upper bound the
Littlestone dimension of H' in terms of that of H. The bounds are proved using
combinatorial arguments that exploit a connection between the Littlestone
dimension and Thresholds. As a corollary, we derive closure properties for
online learning and private PAC learning.
  The derived bounds on the Littlestone dimension exhibit an undesirable
super-exponential dependence. For private learning, we prove close to optimal
bounds that circumvents this suboptimal dependency. The improved bounds on the
sample complexity of private learning are derived algorithmically via
transforming a private learner for the original class H to a private learner
for the composed class H'. Using the same ideas we show that any (proper or
improper) private algorithm that learns a class of functions H in the
realizable case (i.e., when the examples are labeled by some function in the
class) can be transformed to a private algorithm that learns the class H in the
agnostic case.

  Although deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a
number of vision tasks, generalization over high dimensional multi-modal data,
and reliable predictive uncertainty estimation are still active areas of
research. Bayesian approaches including Bayesian Neural Nets (BNNs) do not
scale well to modern computer vision tasks, as they are difficult to train, and
have poor generalization under dataset-shift. This motivates the need for
effective ensembles which can generalize and give reliable uncertainty
estimates. In this paper, we target the problem of generating effective
ensembles of neural networks by encouraging diversity in prediction. We
explicitly optimize a diversity inducing adversarial loss for learning the
stochastic latent variables and thereby obtain diversity in the output
predictions necessary for modeling multi-modal data. We evaluate our method on
benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR100, TinyImageNet and MIT Places 2, and
compared to the most competitive baselines show significant improvements in
classification accuracy, under a shift in the data distribution and in
out-of-distribution detection. Code will be released in this url

Title: Learning to be Global Optimizer
Authors: Haotian Zhang, Jianyong Sun and Zongben Xu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML
\\
  The advancement of artificial intelligence has cast a new light on the
development of optimization algorithm. This paper proposes to learn a two-phase
(including a minimization phase and an escaping phase) global optimization
algorithm for smooth non-convex functions. For the minimization phase, a
model-driven deep learning method is developed to learn the update rule of
descent direction, which is formalized as a nonlinear combination of historical
information, for convex functions. We prove that the resultant algorithm with
the proposed adaptive direction guarantees convergence for convex functions.
Empirical study shows that the learned algorithm significantly outperforms some
well-known classical optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent,
conjugate descent and BFGS, and performs well on ill-posed functions. The
escaping phase from local optimum is modeled as a Markov decision process with
a fixed escaping policy. We further propose to learn an optimal escaping policy
by reinforcement learning. The effectiveness of the escaping policies is
verified by optimizing synthesized functions and training a deep neural network
for CIFAR image classification. The learned two-phase global optimization
algorithm demonstrates a promising global search capability on some benchmark
functions and machine learning tasks.

Title: Slice Tuner: A Selective Data Collection Framework for Accurate and Fair
  Machine Learning Models
Authors: Ki Hyun Tae, Steven Euijong Whang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 16 pages, 11 figures
\\
  As machine learning becomes democratized in the era of Software 2.0, one of
the most serious bottlenecks is collecting enough labeled data to ensure
accurate and fair models. Recent techniques including crowdsourcing provide
cost-effective ways to gather such data. However, simply collecting data as
much as possible is not necessarily an effective strategy for optimizing
accuracy and fairness. For example, if an online app store has enough training
data for certain slices of data (say American customers), but not for others,
collecting more American customer data will only bias the model training.
Instead, we contend that one needs to selectively collect data and propose
Slice Tuner, which collects possibly-different amounts of data per slice such
that the model accuracy and fairness on all slices are optimized. At its core,
Slice Tuner maintains learning curves of slices that estimate the model
accuracies given more data and uses convex optimization to find the best data
collection strategy. The key challenges of estimating learning curves are that
they may be inaccurate if there is not enough data, and there may be
dependencies among slices where collecting data for one slice influences the
learning curves of others. We solve these issues by iteratively and efficiently
updating the learning curves as more data is collected. We evaluate Slice Tuner
on real datasets using crowdsourcing for data collection and show that Slice
Tuner significantly outperforms baselines in terms of model accuracy and
fairness, even for initially small slices. We believe Slice Tuner is a
practical tool for suggesting concrete action items based on model analysis.

Title: Frequency Bias in Neural Networks for Input of Non-Uniform Density
Authors: Ronen Basri, Meirav Galun, Amnon Geifman, David Jacobs, Yoni Kasten,
  Shira Kritchman
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Recent works have partly attributed the generalization ability of
over-parameterized neural networks to frequency bias -- networks trained with
gradient descent on data drawn from a uniform distribution find a low frequency
fit before high frequency ones. As realistic training sets are not drawn from a
uniform distribution, we here use the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) model to
explore the effect of variable density on training dynamics. Our results, which
combine analytic and empirical observations, show that when learning a pure
harmonic function of frequency $\kappa$, convergence at a point $\x \in
\Sphere^{d-1}$ occurs in time $O(\kappa^d/p(\x))$ where $p(\x)$ denotes the
local density at $\x$. Specifically, for data in $\Sphere^1$ we analytically
derive the eigenfunctions of the kernel associated with the NTK for two-layer
networks. We further prove convergence results for deep, fully connected
networks with respect to the spectral decomposition of the NTK. Our empirical
study highlights similarities and differences between deep and shallow networks
in this model.

Title: Channel Attention with Embedding Gaussian Process: A Probabilistic
  Methodology
Authors: Jiyang Xie, Dongliang Chang, Zhanyu Ma, Guoqiang Zhang and Jun Guo
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Channel attention mechanisms, as the key components of some modern
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures, have been commonly used in
many visual tasks for effective performance improvement. It is able to
reinforce the informative channels and to suppress useless channels of feature
maps obtained by CNNs. Recently, different attention modules have been
proposed, which are implemented in various ways. However, they are mainly based
on convolution and pooling operations, which are lack of intuitive and
reasonable insights about the principles that they are based on. Moreover, the
ways that they improve the performance of the CNNs is not clear either. In this
paper, we propose a Gaussian process embedded channel attention (GPCA) module
and interpret the channel attention intuitively and reasonably in a
probabilistic way. The GPCA module is able to model the correlations from
channels which are assumed as beta distributed variables with Gaussian process
prior. As the beta distribution is intractably integrated into the end-to-end
training of the CNNs, we utilize an appropriate approximation of the beta
distribution to make the distribution assumption implemented easily. In this
case, the proposed GPCA module can be integrated into the end-to-end training
of the CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GPCA module can
improve the accuracies of image classification on four widely used datasets.

  Precision beekeeping allows to monitor bees' living conditions by equipping
beehives with sensors. The data recorded by these hives can be analyzed by
machine learning models to learn behavioral patterns of or search for unusual
events in bee colonies. One typical target is the early detection of bee
swarming as apiarists want to avoid this due to economical reasons. Advanced
methods should be able to detect any other unusual or abnormal behavior arising
from illness of bees or from technical reasons, e.g. sensor failure.
  In this position paper we present an autoencoder, a deep learning model,
which detects any type of anomaly in data independent of its origin. Our model
is able to reveal the same swarms as a simple rule-based swarm detection
algorithm but is also triggered by any other anomaly. We evaluated our model on
real world data sets that were collected on different hives and with different
sensor setups.

  Accurate models of the world are built upon notions of its underlying
symmetries. In physics, these symmetries correspond to conservation laws, such
as for energy and momentum. Yet even though neural network models see
increasing use in the physical sciences, they struggle to learn these
symmetries. In this paper, we propose Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), which
can parameterize arbitrary Lagrangians using neural networks. In contrast to
models that learn Hamiltonians, LNNs do not require canonical coordinates, and
thus perform well in situations where canonical momenta are unknown or
difficult to compute. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not restrict
the functional form of learned energies and will produce energy-conserving
models for a variety of tasks. We test our approach on a double pendulum and a
relativistic particle, demonstrating energy conservation where a baseline
approach incurs dissipation and modeling relativity without canonical
coordinates where a Hamiltonian approach fails. Finally, we show how this model
can be applied to graphs and continuous systems using a Lagrangian Graph
Network, and demonstrate it on the 1D wave equation.

Title: Automatic Curriculum Learning For Deep RL: A Short Survey
Authors: R\'emy Portelas, C\'edric Colas, Lilian Weng, Katja Hofmann and
  Pierre-Yves Oudeyer
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Automatic Curriculum Learning (ACL) has become a cornerstone of recent
successes in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).These methods shape the learning
trajectories of agents by challenging them with tasks adapted to their
capacities. In recent years, they have been used to improve sample efficiency
and asymptotic performance, to organize exploration, to encourage
generalization or to solve sparse reward problems, among others. The ambition
of this work is dual: 1) to present a compact and accessible introduction to
the Automatic Curriculum Learning literature and 2) to draw a bigger picture of
the current state of the art in ACL to encourage the cross-breeding of existing
concepts and the emergence of new ideas.

Title: An Exact Transformation from Deep Neural Networks to Multi-Class
  Multivariate Decision Trees
Authors: Tung D. Nguyen, Kathryn E. Kasmarik, Hussein A. Abbass
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 37 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Journal of Neural Networks
\\
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are commonly labelled as black-boxes lacking
interpretability; thus, hindering human's understanding of DNNs' behaviors. A
need exists to generate a meaningful sequential logic for the production of a
specific output. Decision trees exhibit better interpretability and expressive
power due to their representation language and the existence of efficient
algorithms to generate rules. Growing a decision tree based on the available
data could produce larger than necessary trees or trees that do not generalise
well. In this paper, we introduce two novel multivariate decision tree (MDT)
algorithms for rule extraction from a DNN: an Exact-Convertible Decision Tree
(EC-DT) and a Deep C-Net algorithm to transform a neural network with Rectified
Linear Unit activation functions into a representative tree which can be used
to extract multivariate rules for reasoning. While the EC-DT translates the DNN
in a layer-wise manner to represent exactly the decision boundaries implicitly
learned by the hidden layers of the network, the Deep C-Net inherits the
decompositional approach from EC-DT and combines with a C5 tree learning
algorithm to construct the decision rules. The results suggest that while EC-DT
is superior in preserving the structure and the accuracy of DNN, C-Net
generates the most compact and highly effective trees from DNN. Both proposed
MDT algorithms generate rules including combinations of multiple attributes for
precise interpretation of decision-making processes.

Title: Communication-efficient Variance-reduced Stochastic Gradient Descent
Authors: Hossein S. Ghadikolaei and Sindri Magnusson
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC cs.NI
Comments: IFAC World Congress 2020
\\
  We consider the problem of communication efficient distributed optimization
where multiple nodes exchange important algorithm information in every
iteration to solve large problems. In particular, we focus on the stochastic
variance-reduced gradient and propose a novel approach to make it
communication-efficient. That is, we compress the communicated information to a
few bits while preserving the linear convergence rate of the original
uncompressed algorithm. Comprehensive theoretical and numerical analyses on
real datasets reveal that our algorithm can significantly reduce the
communication complexity, by as much as 95\%, with almost no noticeable
penalty. Moreover, it is much more robust to quantization (in terms of
maintaining the true minimizer and the convergence rate) than the
state-of-the-art algorithms for solving distributed optimization problems. Our
results have important implications for using machine learning over
internet-of-things and mobile networks.

Title: New advances in enumerative biclustering algorithms with online
  partitioning
Authors: Rosana Veroneze and Fernando J. Von Zuben
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: This report unifies the proposals of two previous reports ('Efficient
  mining of maximal biclusters in mixed-attribute datasets' and
  'RIn-Close_CVC2: an even more efficient enumerative algorithm for
  biclustering of numerical datasets') and brings some new novelties too. arXiv
  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1810.07725
\\
  This paper further extends RIn-Close_CVC, a biclustering algorithm capable of
performing an efficient, complete, correct and non-redundant enumeration of
maximal biclusters with constant values on columns in numerical datasets. By
avoiding a priori partitioning and itemization of the dataset, RIn-Close_CVC
implements an online partitioning, which is demonstrated here to guide to more
informative biclustering results. The improved algorithm is called
RIn-Close_CVC3, keeps those attractive properties of RIn-Close_CVC, as formally
proved here, and is characterized by: a drastic reduction in memory usage; a
consistent gain in runtime; additional ability to handle datasets with missing
values; and additional ability to operate with attributes characterized by
distinct distributions or even mixed data types. The experimental results
include synthetic and real-world datasets used to perform scalability and
sensitivity analyses. As a practical case study, a parsimonious set of relevant
and interpretable mixed-attribute-type rules is obtained in the context of
supervised descriptive pattern mining.

Title: Reservoir memory machines
Authors: Benjamin Paassen and Alexander Schulz
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In recent years, Neural Turing Machines have gathered attention by joining
the flexibility of neural networks with the computational capabilities of
Turing machines. However, Neural Turing Machines are notoriously hard to train,
which limits their applicability. We propose reservoir memory machines, which
are still able to solve some of the benchmark tests for Neural Turing Machines,
but are much faster to train, requiring only an alignment algorithm and linear
regression. Our model can also be seen as an extension of echo state networks
with an external memory, enabling arbitrarily long storage without
interference.

Title: Addressing multiple metrics of group fairness in data-driven decision
  making
Authors: Marius Miron, Song\"ul Tolan, Emilia G\'omez, Carlos Castillo
Categories: cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML
\\
  The Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT-ML)
literature proposes a varied set of group fairness metrics to measure
discrimination against socio-demographic groups that are characterized by a
protected feature, such as gender or race.Such a system can be deemed as either
fair or unfair depending on the choice of the metric. Several metrics have been
proposed, some of them incompatible with each other.We do so empirically, by
observing that several of these metrics cluster together in two or three main
clusters for the same groups and machine learning methods. In addition, we
propose a robust way to visualize multidimensional fairness in two dimensions
through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the group fairness metrics.
Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the PCA decomposition
explains the variance between the metrics with one to three components.

Title: An API Oriented Open-source Python Framework for Unsupervised Learning

Authors: Benedek Rozemberczki, Oliver Kiss, Rik Sarkar
Categories: cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML
\\
  We present Karate Club a Python framework combining more than 30
state-of-the-art graph mining algorithms which can solve unsupervised machine
learning tasks. The primary goal of the package is to make community detection,
node and whole graph embedding available to a wide audience of machine learning
researchers and practitioners. We designed Karate Club with an emphasis on a
consistent application interface, scalability, ease of use, sensible out of the
box model behaviour, standardized dataset ingestion, and output generation.
This paper discusses the design principles behind this framework with practical
examples. We show Karate Club's efficiency with respect to learning performance
on a wide range of real world clustering problems, classification tasks and
support evidence with regards to its competitive speed.

Title: Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models
Authors: Nicholas Carlini, Matthew Jagielski, Ilya Mironov
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR
\\
  We argue that the machine learning problem of model extraction is actually a
cryptanalytic problem in disguise, and should be studied as such. Given oracle
access to a neural network, we introduce a differential attack that can
efficiently steal the parameters of the remote model up to floating point
precision. Our attack relies on the fact that ReLU neural networks are
piecewise linear functions, and that queries at the critical points reveal
information about the model parameters.
  We evaluate our attack on multiple neural network models and extract models
that are 2^20 times more precise and require 100x fewer queries than prior
work. For example, we extract a 100,000 parameter neural network trained on the
MNIST digit recognition task with 2^21.5 queries in under an hour, such that
the extracted model agrees with the oracle on all inputs up to a worst-case
error of 2^-25, or a model with 4,000 parameters in 2^18.5 queries with
worst-case error of 2^-40.4.

Title: ReZero is All You Need: Fast Convergence at Large Depth
Authors: Thomas Bachlechner, Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, Huanru Henry Mao,
  Garrison W. Cottrell, Julian McAuley
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL stat.ML
\\
  Deep networks have enabled significant performance gains across domains, but
they often suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients. This is especially true
for Transformer architectures where depth beyond 12 layers is difficult to
train without large datasets and computational budgets. In general, we find
that inefficient signal propagation impedes learning in deep networks. In
Transformers, multi-head self-attention is the main cause of this poor signal
propagation. To facilitate deep signal propagation, we propose ReZero, a simple
change to the architecture that initializes an arbitrary layer as the identity
map, using a single additional learned parameter per layer. We apply this
technique to language modeling and find that we can easily train
ReZero-Transformer networks over a hundred layers. When applied to 12 layer
Transformers, ReZero converges 56% faster on enwiki8. ReZero applies beyond
Transformers to other residual networks, enabling 1,500% faster convergence for
deep fully connected networks and 32% faster convergence for a ResNet-56
trained on CIFAR 10.

Title: Hilbert's Tenth Problem in Coq

Categories: cs.LO
Comments: submitted to LMCS
\\
  We formalise the undecidability of solvability of Diophantine equations, i.e.
polynomial equations over natural numbers, in Coq's constructive type theory.
To do so, we give the first full mechanisation of the
Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich theorem, stating that every recursively
enumerable problem -- in our case by a Minsky machine -- is Diophantine. We
obtain an elegant and comprehensible proof by using a synthetic approach to
computability and by introducing Conway's FRACTRAN language as intermediate
layer. Additionally, we prove the reverse direction and show that every
Diophantine relation is recognisable by $\mu$-recursive functions and give a
certified compiler from $\mu$-recursive functions to Minsky machines.

ACM-class: F.0; F.3; I.1; I.2
\\
  We lift the SCL calculus for first-order logic without equality to the SCL(T)
calculus for first-order logic without equality modulo a background theory. The
model representation consists of ground background theory literals and ground
first-order literals. The model representation language is expressive enough to
simulate hierarchic superposition on full first-order theory constrained
clauses with variables. Generated clauses enjoy a non-redundancy property.
SCL(T) is a semi-decision procedure for pure clause sets that are clause sets
without first-order function symbols ranging into the background theory sorts.
SCL(T) can be turned into a decision procedure if the considered combination of
a first-order logic modulo a background theory enjoys an abstract finite model
property.

  In this paper, we investigate the module-checking problem of pushdown
multi-agent systems (PMS) against ATL and ATL* specifications. We establish
that for ATL, module checking of PMS is 2EXPTIME-complete, which is the same
complexity as pushdown module-checking for CTL. On the other hand, we show that
ATL* module-checking of PMS turns out to be 4EXPTIME-complete, hence
exponentially harder than both CTL* pushdown module-checking and ATL*
model-checking of PMS. Our result for ATL* provides a rare example of a natural
decision problem that is elementary yet but with a complexity that is higher
than triply exponential-time.

Categories: cs.LO
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1805.12592
\\
  We introduce an extension of Strategy Logic for the imperfect-information
setting, called SLii, and study its model-checking problem. As this logic
naturally captures multi-player games with imperfect information, this problem
is undecidable; but we introduce a syntactical class of "hierarchical
instances" for which, intuitively, as one goes down the syntactic tree of the
formula, strategy quantifications are concerned with finer observations of the
model, and we prove that model-checking SLii restricted to hierarchical
instances is decidable. To establish this result we go through QCTL, an
intermediary, "low-level" logic much more adapted to automata techniques. QCTL
is an extension of CTL with second-order quantification over atomic
propositions. We extend it to the imperfect information setting by
parameterising second-order quantifiers with observations. While the
model-checking problem of QCTLii is, in general, undecidable, we identify a
syntactic fragment of hierarchical formulas and prove, using an
automata-theoretic approach, that it is decidable. We apply our result to solve
complex strategic problems in the imperfect-information setting. We first show
that the existence of Nash equilibria for deterministic strategies is decidable
in games with hierarchical information. We also introduce distributed rational
synthesis, a generalisation of rational synthesis to the imperfect-information
setting. Because it can easily be expressed in our logic, our main result
provides solution to this problem in the case of hierarchical information.

Title: An Under-Approximate Relational Logic: Heralding Logics of Insecurity,
  Incorrect Implementation & More
Authors: Toby Murray
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  Recently, authors have proposed under-approximate logics for reasoning about
programs. So far, all such logics have been confined to reasoning about
individual program behaviours. Yet there exist many over-approximate relational
logics for reasoning about pairs of programs and relating their behaviours. We
present the first under-approximate relational logic, for the simple imperative
language IMP. We prove our logic is both sound and complete. Additionally, we
show how reasoning in this logic can be decomposed into non-relational
reasoning in an under-approximate Hoare logic, mirroring Beringer's result for
over-approximate relational logics. We illustrate the application of our logic
on some small examples in which we provably demonstrate the presence of
insecurity.

Title: Beyond sets with atoms: definability in first order logic
Authors: Micha{\l} R. Przyby{\l}ek
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  Sets with atoms serve as an alternative to ZFC foundations for mathematics,
where some infinite, though highly symmetric sets, behave in a finitistic way.
Therefore, one can try to carry over analysis of the classical algorithms from
finite structures to some infinite structures. Recent results show that this is
indeed possible and leads to many practical applications. In this paper we
shall take another route to finite analysis of infinite sets, which extends and
sheds more light on sets with atoms. As an application of our theory we give a
characterisation of languages recognized by automata definable in fragments of
first-order logic.

Comments: Accepted for the post-proceedings of EMAS 2019
\\
  A multitude of agent-oriented software engineering frameworks exist, most of
which are developed by the academic multi-agent systems community. However,
these frameworks often impose programming paradigms on their users that are
challenging to learn for engineers who are used to modern high-level
programming languages such as JavaScript and Python. To show how the adoption
of agent-oriented programming by the software engineering mainstream can be
facilitated, we provide a lean JavaScript library prototype for implementing
reasoning-loop agents. The library focuses on core agent programming concepts
and refrains from imposing further restrictions on the programming approach. To
illustrate its usefulness, we show how the library can be applied to
multi-agent systems simulations on the web, deployed to cloud-hosted
function-as-a-service environments, and embedded in Python-based data science
tools.

  In this paper we consider the problem of computing generalized eigenvectors
of a matrix pencil in real Schur form. In exact arithmetic, this problem can be
solved using substitution. In practice, substitution is vulnerable to
floating-point overflow. The robust solvers xTGEVC in LAPACK prevent overflow
by dynamically scaling the eigenvectors. These subroutines are sequential
scalar codes which compute the eigenvectors one by one. In this paper we
discuss how to derive robust blocked algorithms. The new StarNEig library
contains a robust task-parallel solver Zazamoukh which runs on top of StarPU.
Our numerical experiments show that Zazamoukh achieves a super-linear speedup
compared with DTGEVC for sufficiently large matrices.

Title: A Parallelizable Energy-Preserving Integrator MB4 and Its Application to
  Quantum-Mechanical Wavepacket Dynamics
Authors: Tsubasa Sakai, Shuhei Kudo, Hiroto Imachi, Yuto Miyatake, Takeo Hoshi
  and Yusaku Yamamoto
Categories: math.NA cs.DC cs.NA
\\
  In simulating physical systems, conservation of the total energy is often
essential, especially when energy conversion between different forms of energy
occurs frequently. Recently, a new fourth order energy-preserving integrator
named MB4 was proposed based on the so-called continuous stage Runge--Kutta
methods (Y.~Miyatake and J.~C.~Butcher, SIAM J.~Numer.~Anal., 54(3),
1993-2013). A salient feature of this method is that it is parallelizable,
which makes its computational time for one time step comparable to that of
second order methods. In this paper, we illustrate how to apply the MB4 method
to a concrete ordinary differential equation using the nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger-type equation on a two-dimensional grid as an example. This
system is a prototypical model of two-dimensional disordered organic material
and is difficult to solve with standard methods like the classical Runge--Kutta
methods due to the nonlinearity and the $\delta$-function like potential coming
from defects. Numerical tests show that the method can solve the equation
stably and preserves the total energy to 16-digit accuracy throughout the
simulation. It is also shown that parallelization of the method yields up to
2.8 times speedup using 3 computational nodes.

Title: Multilevel spectral coarsening for graph Laplacian problems with
  application to reservoir simulation
Authors: Andrew T. Barker, Stephan V. Gelever, Chak S. Lee, Sarah V. Osborn,
  Panayot S. Vassilevski
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We extend previously developed two-level coarsening procedures for graph
Laplacian problems written in a mixed saddle point form to the fully recursive
multilevel case. The resulting hierarchy of discretizations gives rise to a
hierarchy of upscaled models, in the sense that they provide approximation in
the natural norms (in the mixed setting). This property enables us to utilize
them in three applications: (i) as an accurate reduced model, (ii) as a tool in
multilevel Monte Carlo simulations (in application to finite volume
discretizations), and (iii) for providing a sequence of nonlinear operators in
FAS (full approximation scheme) for solving nonlinear pressure equations
discretized by the conservative two-point flux approximation. We illustrate the
potential of the proposed multilevel technique in all three applications on a
number of popular benchmark problems used in reservoir simulation.

\\
  We introduce the concept of data-driven finite element methods. These are
finite-element discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs) that
resolve quantities of interest with striking accuracy, regardless of the
underlying mesh size. The methods are obtained within a machine-learning
framework during which the parameters defining the method are tuned against
available training data. In particular, we use a stable parametric
Petrov-Galerkin method that is equivalent to a minimal-residual formulation
using a weighted norm. While the trial space is a standard finite element
space, the test space has parameters that are tuned in an off-line stage.
Finding the optimal test space therefore amounts to obtaining a goal-oriented
discretization that is completely tailored towards the quantity of interest. As
is natural in deep learning, we use an artificial neural network to define the
parametric family of test spaces. Using numerical examples for the Laplacian
and advection equation in one and two dimensions, we demonstrate that the
data-driven finite element method has superior approximation of quantities of

ACM-class: G.1.8
\\
  We present a reduced basis (RB) method for parametrized linear elliptic
partial differential equations (PDEs) in a least-squares finite element
framework. A rigorous and reliable error estimate is developed, and is shown to
bound the error with respect to the exact solution of the PDE, in contrast to
estimates that measure error with respect to a finite-dimensional
(high-fidelity) approximation. It is shown that the first-order formulation of
the least-squares finite element is a key ingredient. The method is
demonstrated using numerical examples.

Title: A mixed finite element discretization of dynamical optimal transport
Authors: Andrea Natale (LMO), Gabriele Todeschi (MOKAPLAN)
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  In this paper we introduce a new class of finite element discretizations of
the quadratic optimal transport problem based on its dynamical formulation.
These generalize to the finite element setting the finite difference scheme
proposed by Papadakis et al. [SIAM J Imaging Sci, 7(1):212--238,2014]. We solve
the discrete problem using a proximal-splitting approach and we show how to
modify this in the presence of regularization terms which are relevant for
imaging applications.

Title: Balanced truncation for parametric linear systems using interpolation of
  Gramians: a comparison of algebraic and geometric approaches

MSC-class: 93C08
\\
  When balanced truncation is used for model order reduction, one has to solve
a pair of Lyapunov equations for two Gramians and uses them to construct a
reduced-order model. Although advances in solving such equations have been
made, it is still the most expensive step of this reduction method. Parametric
model order reduction aims to determine reduced-order models for
parameter-dependent systems. Popular techniques for parametric model order
reduction rely on interpolation. Nevertheless, the interpolation of Gramians is
rarely mentioned, most probably due to the fact that Gramians are symmetric
positive semidefinite matrices, a property that should be preserved by the
interpolation method. In this contribution, we propose and compare two
approaches for Gramian interpolation. In the first approach, the interpolated
Gramian is computed as a linear combination of the data Gramians with positive
coefficients. Even though positive semidefiniteness is guaranteed in this
method, the rank of the interpolated Gramian can be significantly larger than
that of the data Gramians. The second approach aims to tackle this issue by
performing the interpolation on the manifold of fixed-rank positive
semidefinite matrices. The results of the interpolation step are then used to
construct parametric reduced-order models, which are compared numerically on
two benchmark problems.

Title: A Meshfree Lagrangian Method for Flow on Manifolds
Authors: Pratik Suchde
Categories: math.NA cs.NA physics.flu-dyn
\\
  In this paper, we present a novel meshfree framework for fluid flow
simulations on arbitrarily curved surfaces. First, we introduce a new meshfree
Lagrangian framework to model flow on surfaces. Meshfree points or particles,
which are used to discretize the domain, move in a Lagrangian sense along the
given surface. This is done without discretizing the bulk around the surface,
without parametrizing the surface, and without a background mesh. A key novelty
that is introduced is the handling of flow with evolving free boundaries on a
curved surface. The use of this framework to model flow on moving and deforming
surfaces is also introduced. Then, we present the application of this framework
to solve fluid flow problems defined on surfaces numerically. In combination
with a meshfree Generalized Finite Difference Method (GFDM), we introduce a
strong form meshfree collocation scheme to solve the Navier-Stokes equations
posed on manifolds. Benchmark examples are proposed to validate the Lagrangian
framework and the surface Navier-Stokes equations with the presence of free
boundaries.

Title: Off-diagonal Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
Authors: Fran\c{c}ois Moutier, Arnaud Vandaele, Nicolas Gillis
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.OC
Comments: 22 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables
\\
  Symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (symNMF) is a variant of
nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) that allows to handle symmetric input
matrices and has been shown to be particularly well suited for clustering
tasks. In this paper, we present a new model, dubbed off-diagonal symNMF
(ODsymNMF), that does not take into account the diagonal entries of the input
matrix in the objective function. ODsymNMF has three key advantages compared to
symNMF. First, ODsymNMF is theoretically much more sound as there always exists
an exact factorization of size at most $\nicefrac{n(n-1)}{2}$ where $n$ is the
dimension of the input matrix. Second, it makes more sense in practice as
diagonal entries of the input matrix typically correspond to the similarity
between an item and itself, not bringing much information. Third, it makes the
optimization problem much easier to solve. In particular, it will allow us to
design an algorithm based on coordinate descent that minimizes the
component-wise $\ell_1$ norm between the input matrix and its approximation. We
prove that this norm is much better suited for binary input matrices often
encountered in practice. We also derive a coordinate descent method for the
component-wise $\ell_2$ norm, and compare the two approaches with symNMF on
synthetic and document data sets.

Title: Automating Representation Discovery with MAP-Elites
Authors: Adam Gaier, Alexander Asteroth, Jean-Baptiste Mouret
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to GECCO 2020
\\
  The way solutions are represented, or encoded, is usually the result of
domain knowledge and experience. In this work, we combine MAP-Elites with
Variational Autoencoders to learn a Data-Driven Encoding (DDE) that captures
the essence of the highest-performing solutions while still able to encode a
wide array of solutions. Our approach learns this data-driven encoding during
optimization by balancing between exploiting the DDE to generalize the
knowledge contained in the current archive of elites and exploring new
representations that are not yet captured by the DDE. Learning representation
during optimization allows the algorithm to solve high-dimensional problems,
and provides a low-dimensional representation which can be then be re-used. We
evaluate the DDE approach by evolving solutions for inverse kinematics of a
planar arm (200 joint angles) and for gaits of a 6-legged robot in action space
(a sequence of 60 positions for each of the 12 joints). We show that the DDE
approach not only accelerates and improves optimization, but produces a
powerful encoding that captures a bias for high performance while expressing a
variety of solutions.

Title: Quality Diversity for Multi-task Optimization
Authors: Jean-Baptiste Mouret, Glenn Maguire
Categories: cs.NE cs.RO
\\
  Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms are a recent family of optimization
algorithms that search for a large set of diverse but high-performing
solutions. Interestingly, they can solve multiple tasks at once. For instance,
they can find the joint positions required for a robotic arm to reach a set of
points, which can also be solved by running a classic optimizer for each target
point. However, they cannot solve multiple tasks when the fitness needs to be
evaluated independently for each task (e.g., optimizing policies to grasp many
different objects). In this paper, we propose an extension of the MAP-Elites
algorithm, called Multi-task MAP-Elites, that solves multiple tasks when the
fitness function depends on the task. We evaluate it on a simulated
parametrized planar arm (10-dimensional search space; 5000 tasks) and on a
6-legged robot with legs of different lengths (36-dimensional search space;
2000 tasks). The results show that in both cases our algorithm outperforms the
optimization of each task separately with the CMA-ES algorithm.

Title: Indirect and Direct Training of Spiking Neural Networks for End-to-End
  Control of a Lane-Keeping Vehicle
Authors: Zhenshan Bing, Claus Meschede, Guang Chen, Alois Knoll, Kai Huang
Categories: cs.NE
Journal-ref: Neural Networks, 2020
DOI: 10.1016/j.neunet.2019.05.019
\\
  Building spiking neural networks (SNNs) based on biological synaptic
plasticities holds a promising potential for accomplishing fast and
energy-efficient computing, which is beneficial to mobile robotic applications.
However, the implementations of SNNs in robotic fields are limited due to the
lack of practical training methods. In this paper, we therefore introduce both
indirect and direct end-to-end training methods of SNNs for a lane-keeping
vehicle. First, we adopt a policy learned using the \textcolor{black}{Deep
Q-Learning} (DQN) algorithm and then subsequently transfer it to an SNN using
supervised learning. Second, we adopt the reward-modulated
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) for training SNNs directly, since it
combines the advantages of both reinforcement learning and the well-known
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We examine the proposed approaches in
three scenarios in which a robot is controlled to keep within lane markings by
using an event-based neuromorphic vision sensor. We further demonstrate the
advantages of the R-STDP approach in terms of the lateral localization accuracy
and training time steps by comparing them with other three algorithms presented
in this paper.

Title: Neural Networks are Surprisingly Modular
Authors: Daniel Filan, Shlomi Hod, Cody Wild, Andrew Critch, Stuart Russell
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG
Comments: 22 pages, 13 figures
\\
  The learned weights of a neural network are often considered devoid of
scrutable internal structure. In order to attempt to discern structure in these
weights, we introduce a measurable notion of modularity for multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), and investigate the modular structure of MLPs trained on
datasets of small images. Our notion of modularity comes from the graph
clustering literature: a "module" is a set of neurons with strong internal
connectivity but weak external connectivity. We find that MLPs that undergo
training and weight pruning are often significantly more modular than random
networks with the same distribution of weights. Interestingly, they are much
more modular when trained with dropout. Further analysis shows that this
modularity seems to arise mostly for networks trained on learnable datasets. We
also present exploratory analyses of the importance of different modules for
performance and how modules depend on each other. Understanding the modular
structure of neural networks, when such structure exists, will hopefully render
their inner workings more interpretable to engineers.

Title: Performance Analysis of Message Dissemination Techniques in VANET using
  Fog Computing
Authors: Anirudh Paranjothi
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) is a derived subclass of Mobile Ad-hoc
Networks (MANET) with vehicles as mobile nodes. VANET facilitate vehicles to
share safety and non-safety information through messages. Safety information
includes road accidents, natural hazards, roadblocks, etc. Non-safety
information includes tolling information, traveler information, etc. The main
goal behind sharing this information is to enhance road safety and reduce road
accidents by alerting the driver about the unexpected hazards. However, routing
of messages in VANET is challenging due to packet delays arising from high
mobility of vehicles, frequently changing topology and high density of
vehicles, leading to frequent route breakages and packet losses. This report
summarizes the performance analysis of safety and non-safety message
dissemination techniques in VANET based on the fog computing technique. Three
main metrics to improve the performance of message dissemination are: 1) delay,
2) probability of message delivery, and 3) throughput. Analysis of such metrics
plays an important role to improve the performance of existing message
dissemination techniques. Simulations are usually conducted based on the
metrics using ns-2 and Java discrete event simulator. The above three
performance metrics and results published in literature help one to understand
and increase the performance of various message dissemination techniques in a
VANET environment.

Title: Communication-Efficient Massive UAV Online Path Control: Federated
  Learning Meets Mean-Field Game Theory
Authors: Hamid Shiri, Jihong Park, and Mehdi Bennis
Categories: cs.NI cs.LG eess.SP
\\
  This paper investigates the control of a massive population of UAVs such as
drones. The straightforward method of control of UAVs by considering the
interactions among them to make a flock requires a huge inter-UAV communication
which is impossible to implement in real-time applications. One method of
control is to apply the mean-field game (MFG) framework which substantially
reduces communications among the UAVs. However, to realize this framework,
powerful processors are required to obtain the control laws at different UAVs.
This requirement limits the usage of the MFG framework for real-time
applications such as massive UAV control. Thus, a function approximator based
on neural networks (NN) is utilized to approximate the solutions of
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations.
Nevertheless, using an approximate solution can violate the conditions for
convergence of the MFG framework. Therefore, the federated learning (FL)
approach which can share the model parameters of NNs at drones, is proposed
with NN based MFG to satisfy the required conditions. The stability analysis of
the NN based MFG approach is presented and the performance of the proposed
FL-MFG is elaborated by the simulations.

\\
  uRLLC and eMBB are two influential services of the emerging 5G cellular
network. Latency and reliability are major concerns for uRLLC applications,
whereas eMBB services claim for the maximum data rates. Owing to the trade-off
among latency, reliability and spectral efficiency, sharing of radio resources
between eMBB and uRLLC services, heads to a challenging scheduling dilemma. In
this paper, we study the co-scheduling problem of eMBB and uRLLC traffic based
upon the puncturing technique. Precisely, we formulate an optimization problem
aiming to maximize the MEAR of eMBB UEs while fulfilling the provisions of the
uRLLC traffic. We decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, namely
scheduling problem of eMBB UEs and uRLLC UEs while prevailing objective
unchanged. Radio resources are scheduled among the eMBB UEs on a time slot
basis, whereas it is handled for uRLLC UEs on a mini-slot basis. Moreover, for
resolving the scheduling issue of eMBB UEs, we use PSUM based algorithm,
whereas the optimal TM is adopted for solving the same problem of uRLLC UEs.
Furthermore, a heuristic algorithm is also provided to solve the first
sub-problem with lower complexity. Finally, the significance of the proposed
approach over other baseline approaches is established through numerical
analysis in terms of the MEAR and fairness scores of the eMBB UEs.

  All computing infrastructure suffers from performance variability, be it
bare-metal or virtualized. This phenomenon originates from many sources: some
transient, such as noisy neighbors, and others more permanent but sudden, such
as changes or wear in hardware, changes in the underlying hypervisor stack, or
even undocumented interactions between the policies of the computing resource
provider and the active workloads. Thus, performance measurements obtained on
clouds, HPC facilities, and, more generally, datacenter environments are almost
guaranteed to exhibit performance regimes that evolve over time, which leads to
undesirable nonstationarities in application performance. In this paper, we
present our analysis of performance of the bare-metal hardware available on the
CloudLab testbed where we focus on quantifying the evolving performance regimes
using changepoint detection. We describe our findings, backed by a dataset with
nearly 6.9M benchmark results collected from over 1600 machines over a period
of 2 years and 9 months. These findings yield a comprehensive characterization
of real-world performance variability patterns in one computing facility, a
methodology for studying such patterns on other infrastructures, and contribute
to a better understanding of performance variability in general.

Comments: Github: https://github.com/GiggleLiu/NiLang.jl
\\
  This paper considers the source-to-source automatic differentiation (AD) in a
reversible language. We start by reviewing the limitations of traditional AD
frameworks. To solve the issues in these frameworks, we developed a reversible
eDSL NiLang in Julia that can differentiate a general program while being
compatible with Julia's ecosystem. It empowers users the flexibility to
tradeoff time, space, and energy so that one can use it to obtain gradients and
Hessians ranging for elementary mathematical functions, sparse matrix
operations, and linear algebra that are widely used in scientific programming.
We demonstrate that a source-to-source AD framework can achieve the
state-of-the-art performance by showing and benchmarking several examples.
Finally, we will discuss the challenges that we face towards rigorous
reversible programming, mainly from the instruction and hardware perspective.

  Rapid progress in embedded computing hardware increasingly enables on-board
image processing on small robots. This development opens the path to replacing
costly sensors with sophisticated computer vision techniques. A case in point
is the prediction of scene depth information from a monocular camera for
autonomous navigation. Motivated by the aim to develop a robot swarm suitable
for sensing, monitoring, and search applications in forests, we have collected
a set of RGB images and corresponding depth maps. Over 100k images were
recorded with a custom rig from the perspective of a small ground rover moving
through a forest. Taken under different weather and lighting conditions, the
images include scenes with grass, bushes, standing and fallen trees, tree
branches, leafs, and dirt. In addition GPS, IMU, and wheel encoder data was
recorded. From the calibrated, synchronized, aligned and timestamped frames
about 9700 image-depth map pairs were selected for sharpness and variety. We
provide this dataset to the community to fill a need identified in our own
research and hope it will accelerate progress in robots navigating the
challenging forest environment. This paper describes our custom hardware and
methodology to collect the data, subsequent processing and quality of the data,
and how to access it.

  Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have penetrated multiple domains over
the past years. In GNSS-denied or indoor environments, aerial robots require a
robust and stable localization system, often with external feedback, in order
to fly safely. Motion capture systems are typically utilized indoors when
accurate localization is needed. However, these systems are expensive and most
require a fixed setup. Recently, visual-inertial odometry and similar methods
have advanced to a point where autonomous UAVs can rely on them for
localization. The main limitation in this case comes from the environment, as
well as in long-term autonomy due to accumulating error if loop closure cannot
be performed efficiently. For instance, the impact of low visibility due to
dust or smoke in post-disaster scenarios might render the odometry methods
inapplicable. In this paper, we study and characterize an ultra-wideband (UWB)
system for navigation and localization of aerial robots indoors based on
Decawave's DWM1001 UWB node. The system is portable, inexpensive and can be
battery powered in its totality. We show the viability of this system for
autonomous flight of UAVs, and provide open-source methods and data that enable
its widespread application even with movable anchor systems. We characterize
the accuracy based on the position of the UAV with respect to the anchors, its
altitude and speed, and the distribution of the anchors in space. Finally, we
analyze the accuracy of the self-calibration of the anchors' positions.

\\
  Models used in modern planning problems to simulate outcomes of real world
action executions are becoming increasingly complex, ranging from simulators
that do physics-based reasoning to precomputed analytical motion primitives.
However, robots operating in the real world often face situations not modeled
by these models before execution. This imperfect modeling can lead to highly
suboptimal or even incomplete behavior during execution. In this paper, we
propose an approach for interleaving planning and execution that adapts online
using real world execution and accounts for any discrepancies in dynamics
during planning, without requiring updates to the dynamics of the model. This
is achieved by biasing the planner away from transitions whose dynamics are
discovered to be inaccurately modeled, thereby leading to robot behavior that
tries to complete the task despite having an inaccurate model. We provide
provable guarantees on the completeness and efficiency of the proposed planning
and execution framework under specific assumptions on the model, for both small
and large state spaces. Our approach is shown to be efficient empirically in
simulated robotic tasks including 4D planar pushing, and in real robotic
experiments using PR2 involving a 3D pick-and-place task where the mass of the
object is incorrectly modeled, and a 7D arm planning task where one of the
joints is not operational leading to discrepancy in dynamics. Video can be

Title: Signal-based self-organization of a chain of UAVs for subterranean

Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Miniature multi-rotors are promising robots for navigating subterranean
networks, but maintaining a radio connection underground is challenging. In
this paper, we introduce a distributed algorithm, called U-Chain (for
Underground-chain), that coordinates a chain of flying robots between an
exploration drone and an operator. Our algorithm only uses the measurement of
the signal quality between two successive robots as well as an estimate of the

Title: CMetric: A Driving Behavior Measure Using Centrality Functions
Authors: Rohan Chandra, Uttaran Bhattacharya, Trisha Mittal, Aniket Bera,

Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Submitted to IROS 2020
\\
  We present a new measure, CMetric, to classify driver behaviors using
centrality functions. Our formulation combines concepts from computational
graph theory and social traffic psychology to quantify and classify the
behavior of human drivers. CMetric is used to compute the probability of a
vehicle executing a driving style, as well as the intensity used to execute the
style. Our approach is designed for realtime autonomous driving applications,
where the trajectory of each vehicle or road-agent is extracted from a video.
We compute a dynamic geometric graph (DGG) based on the positions and proximity
of the road-agents and centrality functions corresponding to closeness and
degree. These functions are used to compute the CMetric based on style
likelihood and style intensity estimates. Our approach is general and makes no
assumption about traffic density, heterogeneity, or how driving behaviors
change over time. We present efficient techniques to compute CMetric and
demonstrate its performance on well-known autonomous driving datasets. We
evaluate the accuracy of CMetric and compare with ground truth behavior labels
and with that of a human observer by performing a user study over over a long
vehicle trajectory.

Title: Learning a generative model for robot control using visual feedback
Authors: Nishad Gothoskar, Miguel L\'azaro-Gredilla, Abhishek Agarwal, Yasemin
  Bekiroglu, Dileep George
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  We introduce a novel formulation for incorporating visual feedback in
controlling robots. We define a generative model from actions to image
observations of features on the end-effector. Inference in the model allows us
to infer the robot state corresponding to target locations of the features.
This, in turn, guides motion of the robot and allows for matching the target
locations of the features in significantly fewer steps than state-of-the-art
visual servoing methods. The training procedure for our model enables effective
learning of the kinematics, feature structure, and camera parameters,
simultaneously. This can be done with no prior information about the robot,
structure, and cameras that observe it. Learning is done sample-efficiently and
shows strong generalization to test data. Since our formulation is modular, we
can modify components of our setup, like cameras and objects, and relearn them
quickly online. Our method can handle noise in the observed state and noise in
the controllers that we interact with. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method by executing grasping and tight-fit insertions on robots with inaccurate
controllers.

Title: 3D printed cable-driven continuum robots with generally routed cables:
  modeling and experiments

\\
  Continuum robots are becoming increasingly popular for applications which
require the robots to deform and change shape, while also being compliant. A
cable-driven continuum robot is one of the most commonly used type. Typical
cable driven continuum robots consist of a flexible backbone with spacer disks
attached to the backbone and cables passing through the holes in the spacer
disks from the fixed base to a free end. In most such robots, the routing of
the cables are straight or a smooth helical curve. In this paper, we analyze
the experimental and theoretical deformations of a 3D printed continuum robot,
for 6 different kinds of cable routings. The results are compared for discrete
optimization based kinematic modelling as well as static modelling using
Cosserat rod theory. It is shown that the experimental results match the
theoretical results with an error margin of 2%. It is also shown that the
optimization based approach is faster than the one based on Cosserat rod
theory. We also present a three-fingered gripper prototype where each of the
fingers are 3D printed continuum robots with general cable routing. It is
demonstrated that the prototype can be used for gripping objects and for its
manipulation.

Title: ASV-Swarm: a high-performance simulator for the dynamics of a swarm of
  autonomous marine vehicles in waves
Authors: Toby Thomas, David M. Bossens and Danesh Tarapore
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Submission for IROS-2020, Las Vegas. Page limit of 6 pages
\\
  The energy of ocean waves is the key distinguishing factor of a marine
environment compared to other aquatic environments. Waves have a significant
impact on the dynamics of marine vehicles. Hence, it is imperative to model
waves and the dynamics of vehicles in waves when developing efficient control
strategies for autonomous marine vehicles. However, most marine simulators
available open-source exclude the realistic modelling of ocean waves and the
efficient computation of wave forces on surface vehicles. This paper presents
ASV-Swarm, a simulator which provides high fidelity and computationally
efficient model of ocean waves and vehicle dynamics in waves. The simulator is
suitable for applications requiring high run-time performance, such as with
swarms of autonomous marine vehicles, or in developing optimal vehicle control
strategies using reinforcement learning techniques. ASV-Swarm also has a low
computational overhead making it ideal for onboard simulation for applications
such as online learning for adaptation to changes in the environment.

Title: Whole-Body Walking Generation using Contact Parametrization: A
  Non-Linear Trajectory Optimization Approach
Authors: Stefano Dafarra, Giulio Romualdi, Giorgio Metta, and Daniele Pucci
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Accepted to ICRA2020
\\
  In this paper, we describe a planner capable of generating walking
trajectories by using the centroidal dynamics and the full kinematics of a
humanoid robot model. The interaction between the robot and the walking surface
is modeled explicitly through a novel contact parametrization. The approach is
complementarity-free and does not need a predefined contact sequence. By
solving an optimal control problem we obtain walking trajectories. In
particular, through a set of constraints and dynamic equations, we model the
robot in contact with the ground. We describe the objective the robot needs to
achieve with a set of tasks. The whole optimal control problem is transcribed
into an optimization problem via a Direct Multiple Shooting approach and solved
with an off-the-shelf solver. We show that it is possible to achieve walking
motions automatically by specifying a minimal set of references, such as a
constant desired Center of Mass velocity and a reference point on the ground.

Title: Fast Online Adaptation in Robotics through Meta-Learning Embeddings of
  Simulated Priors
Authors: Rituraj Kaushik, Timoth\'ee Anne and Jean-Baptiste Mouret
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Under review | Video: http://tiny.cc/famle_video
\\
  Meta-learning algorithms can accelerate the model-based reinforcement
learning (MBRL) algorithms by finding an initial set of parameters for the
dynamical model such that the model can be trained to match the actual dynamics
of the system with only a few data-points. However, in the real world, a robot
might encounter any situation starting from motor failures to finding itself in
a rocky terrain where the dynamics of the robot can be significantly different
from one another. In this paper, first, we show that when meta-training
situations (the prior situations) have such diverse dynamics, using a single
set of meta-trained parameters as a starting point still requires a large
number of observations from the real system to learn a useful model of the
dynamics. Second, we propose an algorithm called FAMLE that mitigates this
limitation by meta-training several initial starting points (i.e., initial
parameters) for training the model and allows the robot to select the most
suitable starting point to adapt the model to the current situation with only a
few gradient steps. We compare FAMLE to MBRL, MBRL with a meta-trained model
with MAML, and model-free policy search algorithm PPO for various simulated and
real robotic tasks, and show that FAMLE allows the robots to adapt to novel
damages in significantly fewer time-steps than the baselines.

Title: Look Around You: Sequence-based Radar Place Recognition with Learned
  Rotational Invariance
Authors: Matthew Gadd, Daniele De Martini, Paul Newman
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: accepted for publication at the IEEE/ION Position, Location and
  Navigation Symposium (PLANS) 2020
\\
  This paper details an application which yields significant improvements to
the adeptness of place recognition with Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave
radar - a commercially promising sensor poised for exploitation in mobile
autonomy. We show how a rotationally-invariant metric embedding for radar scans
can be integrated into sequence-based trajectory matching systems typically
applied to videos taken by visual sensors. Due to the complete horizontal field
of view inherent to the radar scan formation process, we show how this
off-the-shelf sequence-based trajectory matching system can be manipulated to
detect place matches when the vehicle is travelling down a previously visited
stretch of road in the opposite direction. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
approach on 26 km of challenging urban driving taken from the largest
radar-focused urban autonomy dataset released to date -- showing a boost of 30%
in recall at high levels of precision over a nearest neighbour approach.

Categories: cs.RO
Comments: accepted for publication at the IEEE/ION Position, Location and
  Navigation Symposium (PLANS) 2020

  This paper presents a system for improving the robustness of LiDAR lateral
localisation systems. This is made possible by including detections of road
boundaries which are invisible to the sensor (due to occlusion, e.g. traffic)
but can be located by our Occluded Road Boundary Inference Deep Neural Network.
We show an example application in which fusion of a camera stream is used to
initialise the lateral localisation. We demonstrate over four driven forays
through central Oxford - totalling 40 km of driving - a gain in performance
that inferring of occluded road boundaries brings.

Title: UFOMap: An Efficient Probabilistic 3D Mapping Framework That Embraces
  the Unknown
Authors: Daniel Duberg and Patric Jensfelt
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Project page: https://github.com/danielduberg/UFOMap
\\
  3D models are an essential part of many robotic applications. In applications
where the environment is unknown a-priori, or where only a part of the
environment is known, it is important that the 3D model can handle the unknown
space efficiently. Path planning, exploration, and reconstruction all fall into
this category. In this paper we present an extension to OctoMap which we call
UFOMap. UFOMap uses an explicit representation of all three states in the map,
i.e., occupied, free, and unknown. This gives, surprisingly, a more memory
efficient representation. Furthermore, we provide methods that allow for
significantly faster insertions into the octree. This enables real-time colored
volumetric mapping at high resolution (below 1 cm). UFOMap is contributed as a
C++ library that can be used standalone but is also integrated into ROS.

Comments: Submitted to IROS 2020
\\
  We present a method to reconstruct the 3D trajectory of an airborne robotic
system only from videos recorded with cameras that are unsynchronized, may
feature rolling shutter distortion, and whose viewpoints are unknown. Our
approach enables robust and accurate outside-in tracking of dynamically flying
targets, with cheap and easy-to-deploy equipment. We show that, in spite of the
weakly constrained setting, recent developments in computer vision make it
possible to reconstruct trajectories in 3D from unsynchronized, uncalibrated
networks of consumer cameras, and validate the proposed method in a realistic
field experiment. We make our code available along with the data, including
cm-accurate ground-truth from differential GNSS navigation.

Title: Undefined-behavior guarantee by switching to model-based controller
  according to the embedded dynamics in Recurrent Neural Network
Authors: Kanata Suzuki, Hiroki Mori, Tetsuya Ogata
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8pages
\\
  For robotic applications, its task performance and operation must be
guaranteed. In usual robot control, achieving robustness to various tasks as
well as controller stability is difficult. This is similar to the problem of
the generalization performance of machine learning. Although deep learning is a
promising approach to complex tasks that are difficult to achieve using a
conventional model-based control method, guaranteeing the output result of the
model is still difficult. In this study, we propose an approach to compensate
for the undefined behavior in the learning-based control method by using a
model-based controller. Our method switches between two controllers according
to the internal representation of a recurrent neural network that established
the dynamics of task behaviors. We applied our method to a real robot and
performed an error-recovery operation. To evaluate our model, we designed a
pick--place task, and induced external disturbances. We present results in
simulation and on a real robot.

Title: Optimization-Based Hierarchical Motion Planning for Autonomous Racing
Authors: Jos\'e L. V\'azquez, Marius Br\"uhlmeier, Alexander Liniger, Alisa

Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY math.OC
Comments: Submitted to IROS
\\
  In this paper we propose a hierarchical controller for autonomous racing
where the same vehicle model is used in a two level optimization framework for
motion planning. The high-level controller computes a trajectory that minimizes
the lap time, and the low-level nonlinear model predictive path following
controller tracks the computed trajectory online. Following a computed optimal
trajectory avoids online planning and enables fast computational times. The
efficiency is further enhanced by the coupling of the two levels through a
terminal constraint, computed in the high-level controller. Including this
constraint in the real-time optimization level ensures that the prediction
horizon can be shortened, while safety is guaranteed. This proves crucial for
the experimental validation of the approach on a full size driverless race car.
The vehicle in question won two international student racing competitions using
the proposed framework; moreover, our hierarchical controller achieved an
improvement of 20% in the lap time compared to the state of the art result
achieved using a very similar car and track.

\\
  Recently, an increasingly growing number of companies is focusing on
achieving self-driving systems towards SAE level 3 and higher. Such systems
will have much more complex capabilities than today's advanced driver
assistance systems (ADAS) like adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping
assistance. For complex software systems in the Web-application domain, the
logical successor for Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) is known as
Continuous Experimentation (CE), where product owners jointly with engineers
systematically run A/B experiments on possible new features to get quantifiable
data about a feature's adoption from the users. While this methodology is
increasingly adopted in software-intensive companies, our study is set out to
explore advantages and challenges when applying CE during the development and
roll-out of functionalities required for self-driving vehicles. This paper
reports about the design and results from a multiple case study that was
conducted at four companies including two automotive OEMs with a long history
of developing vehicles, a Tier-1 supplier, and a start-up company within the
area of automated driving systems. Unanimously, all expect higher quality and
fast roll-out cycles to the fleet; as major challenges, however, safety
concerns next to organizational structures are mentioned.

Title: Engineering Human Values in Software through Value Programming
Authors: Davoud Mougouei
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Ignoring human values in software development may disadvantage users by
breaching their values and introducing biases in software. This can be
mitigated by informing developers about the value implications of their choices
and taking initiatives to account for human values in software. To this end, we
propose the notion of Value Programming with three principles: (P1) annotating
source code and related artifacts with respect to values; (P2) inspecting
source code to detect conditions that lead to biases and value breaches in
software, i.e., (P3) making recommendations to mitigate biases and value
breaches. To facilitate value programming, we propose a framework that allows
for automated annotation of software code with respect to human values. The
proposed framework lays a solid foundation for inspecting human values in code
and making recommendations to overcome biases and value breaches in software.

Title: Refactoring Graphs: Assessing Refactoring over Time

  Evolution and Reengineering (SANER), 11 pages, 2020
\\
  Refactoring is an essential activity during software evolution. Frequently,
practitioners rely on such transformations to improve source code
maintainability and quality. As a consequence, this process may produce new
source code entities or change the structure of existing ones. Sometimes, the
transformations are atomic, i.e., performed in a single commit. In other cases,
they generate sequences of modifications performed over time. To study and
reason about refactorings over time, in this paper, we propose a novel concept
called refactoring graphs and provide an algorithm to build such graphs. Then,
we investigate the history of 10 popular open-source Java-based projects. After
eliminating trivial graphs, we characterize a large sample of 1,150 refactoring
graphs, providing quantitative data on their size, commits, age, refactoring
composition, and developers. We conclude by discussing applications and
implications of refactoring graphs, for example, to improve code comprehension,
detect refactoring patterns, and support software evolution studies.

Title: An Integer Programming Model for Embedding Social Values into Software
  Requirement Selection
Authors: Davoud Mougouei
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.01824
\\
  The existing software requirement selection methods have mainly focused on
optimizing the economic value of a software product while ignoring its social
values and their long-term impacts on the society. Social values however, are
also important and need to be taken into account in software requirement
selection. Moreover, social values of software requirements may change in the
presence or absence of other requirements due to the value dependencies among
those requirements. These dependencies are imprecise and hard to specify in
software projects. This paper presents an Integer Programming (IP) model for
the integration of social values and dependencies among them into software
requirement selection. We further, account for the imprecision of social values
and dependencies among them using the algebraic structure of fuzzy graphs.

  Context: GitHub hosts an impressive number of high-quality OSS projects.
However, selecting "the right tool for the job" is a challenging task, because
we do not have precise information about those high-quality projects.
Objective: In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to measure the
level of maintenance activity of GitHub projects. Our goal is to alert users
about the risks of using unmaintained projects and possibly motivate other
developers to assume the maintenance of such projects. Method: We train machine
learning models to define a metric to express the level of maintenance activity
of GitHub projects. Next, we analyze the historical evolution of 2,927 active
projects in the time frame of one year. Results: From 2,927 active projects,
16% become unmaintained in the interval of one year. We also found that
Objective-C projects tend to have lower maintenance activity than projects
implemented in other languages. Finally, software tools---such as compilers and
editors---have the highest maintenance activity over time. Conclusions: A
metric about the level of maintenance activity of GitHub projects can help
developers to select open source projects.

Title: REST vs GraphQL: A Controlled Experiment
Authors: Gleison Brito and Marco Tulio Valente
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  GraphQL is a novel query language for implementing service-based software
architectures. The language is gaining momentum and it is now used by major
software companies, such as Facebook and GitHub. However, we still lack
empirical evidence on the real gains achieved by GraphQL, particularly in terms
of the effort required to implement queries in this language. Therefore, in
this paper we describe a controlled experiment with 22 students (10
undergraduate and 12 graduate), who were asked to implement eight queries for
accessing a web service, using GraphQL and REST. Our results show that GraphQL
requires less effort to implement remote service queries when compared to REST
(9 vs 6 minutes, median times). These gains increase when REST queries include
more complex endpoints, with several parameters. Interestingly, GraphQL
outperforms REST even among more experienced participants (as is the case of
graduate students) and among participants with previous experience in REST, but
no previous experience in GraphQL.

  Applications

Categories: cs.SE
Comments: 29 pages
\\
  Software developers usually start coding an application with no formal
architecture in mind and relying on intuition and experience instead of on
well-known design patters. A different approach is recommended for the
development of IoT smart applications due to its high complexity that combines
sensors, actuators, communication technologies, and big data analytics, as well
as its distributed nature that spans for different layers of field, fog, and
cloud infrastructure. Literature reports many experiences of software
development for IoT smart applications. However, architectural solutions are
presented with no rationale for the choice of software components and the way
they relate to each other. This paper proposes a classification for software
components and their relationships in order to model a software architecture
for a particular IoT smart application. Three smart applications for cities,
buildings, and agriculture were selected as examples of using some components,
connectors, and well-known design patterns. Finally, the problems and
challenges involved in the choice of software architectures for IoT are
discussed.

Title: A Fuzzy-Based Optimization Method for Integrating Value Dependencies
  into Software Requirement Selection
Authors: Davoud Mougouei and David Powers
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Software requirement selection aims to find an optimal subset of the
requirements with the highest value while respecting the budget. But the value
of a requirement may depend on the presence or absence of other requirements in
the optimal subset. Existing requirement selection methods, however, do not
consider Value Dependencies, thus increasing the risk of value loss. To address
this, we have proposed Dependency-Aware Requirement Selection (DARS) method
with two main components: (i) a fuzzy-based technique for identifying and
modeling value dependencies, and (ii) an Integer Programming model that takes
into account value dependencies in software requirement selection. We have
further, proposed an alternative optimization model for situations where
quantifying value dependencies is hard. The scalability of DARS and its
effectiveness in reducing the risk of value loss are demonstrated through
exhaustive simulations.

  Many real-world applications can be modelled as complex networks, and such
networks include the Internet, epidemic disease networks, transport networks,
power grids, protein-folding structures and others. Network integrity and
robustness are important to ensure that crucial networks are protected and
undesired harmful networks can be dismantled. Network structure and integrity
can be controlled by a set of key nodes, and to find the optimal combination of
nodes in a network to ensure network structure and integrity can be an
NP-complete problem. Despite extensive studies, existing methods have many
limitations and there are still many unresolved problems. This paper presents a
probabilistic approach based on neighborhood information and node importance,
namely, neighborhood information-based probabilistic algorithm (NIPA). We also
define a new centrality-based importance measure (IM), which combines the
contribution ratios of the neighbor nodes of each target node and two-hop node
information. Our proposed NIPA has been tested for different network benchmarks
and compared with three other methods: optimal attack strategy (OAS), high
betweenness first (HBF) and high degree first (HDF). Experiments suggest that
the proposed NIPA is most effective among all four methods. In general, NIPA
can identify the most crucial node combination with higher effectiveness, and
the set of optimal key nodes found by our proposed NIPA is much smaller than
that by heuristic centrality prediction. In addition, many previously neglected
weakly connected nodes are identified, which become a crucial part of the newly
identified optimal nodes. Thus, revised strategies for protection are
recommended to ensure the safeguard of network integrity. Further key issues
and future research topics are also discussed.

  Learning graph representations of n-ary relational data has a number of real
world applications like anti-money laundering, fraud detection, risk assessment
etc. Graph Neural Networks have been shown to be effective in predicting links
with few or no node features. While a number of datasets exist for link
prediction, their features are considerably different from real world
applications. Temporal information on entities and relations are often
unavailable. We introduce a new dataset with 10 subgraphs, 20912 nodes, 67564
links, 70 attributes and 9 relation types. We also present novel improvements
to graph models to adapt them for industry scale applications.

Title: Machine Learning-based Approach for Depression Detection in Twitter
  Using Content and Activity Features

  Social media channels, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, have altered
our world forever. People are now increasingly connected than ever and reveal a
sort of digital persona. Although social media certainly has several remarkable
features, the demerits are undeniable as well. Recent studies have indicated a
correlation between high usage of social media sites and increased depression.
The present study aims to exploit machine learning techniques for detecting a
probable depressed Twitter user based on both, his/her network behavior and
tweets. For this purpose, we trained and tested classifiers to distinguish
whether a user is depressed or not using features extracted from his/ her
activities in the network and tweets. The results showed that the more features
are used, the higher are the accuracy and F-measure scores in detecting
depressed users. This method is a data-driven, predictive approach for early
detection of depression or other mental illnesses. This study's main
contribution is the exploration part of the features and its impact on
detecting the depression level.

Title: Sampling on networks: estimating spectral centrality measures and their
  impact in evaluating other relevant network measures
Authors: Nicol\`o Ruggeri and Caterina De Bacco
Categories: cs.SI physics.data-an physics.soc-ph
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We perform an extensive analysis of how sampling impacts the estimate of
several relevant network measures.
  In particular, we focus on how a sampling strategy optimized to recover a
particular spectral centrality measure impacts other topological quantities.
Our goal is on one hand to extend the analysis of the behavior of TCEC
[Ruggeri2019], a theoretically-grounded sampling method for eigenvector
centrality estimation.
  On the other hand, to demonstrate more broadly how sampling can impact the
estimation of relevant network properties like centrality measures different
than the one aimed at optimizing, community structure and node attribute
distribution.
  Finally, we adapt the theoretical framework behind TCEC for the case of
PageRank centrality and propose a sampling algorithm aimed at optimizing its
estimation. We show that, while the theoretical derivation can be suitably
adapted to cover this case, the resulting algorithm suffers of a high
computational complexity that requires further approximations compared to the
eigenvector centrality case.

Comments: Submitted to the 23rd IEEE International Conference on Intelligent
  Transportation Systems (ITSC'20)
\\
  This paper studies congestion-aware route-planning policies for Autonomous
Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, whereby a fleet of autonomous vehicles
provides on-demand mobility under mixed traffic conditions. Specifically, we
first devise a network flow model to optimize the AMoD routing and rebalancing
strategies in a congestion-aware fashion by accounting for the endogenous
impact of AMoD flows on travel time. Second, we capture reactive exogenous
traffic consisting of private vehicles selfishly adapting to the AMoD flows in
a user-centric fashion by leveraging an iterative approach. Finally, we
showcase the effectiveness of our framework with two case-studies considering
the transportation sub-networks in Eastern Massachusetts and New York City. Our
results suggest that for high levels of demand, pure AMoD travel can be
detrimental due to the additional traffic stemming from its rebalancing flows,
while the combination of AMoD with walking or micromobility options can
significantly improve the overall system performance.

Title: Predefined-Time Consensus of High-Order Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: J. Armando Colunga, H\'ector M. Becerra, Carlos R. V\'azquez,

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  This paper addresses the distributed predefined-time leader-following
consensus problem for a class of high-order multi-agent systems (MAS) with
perturbed nonlinear agents' dynamics and where the topology of the network
contains a directed spanning tree, with the leader as the root. The proposed
control method exhibits three main advantages: first, to our best knowledge, it
is the first time that predefined-time convergence in a consensus problem is
achieved for agents with high-order nonlinear dynamics, using a robust
leader-following protocol, which allows an effective rejection of matched
disturbances in the agents model. Second, the proposed controller provides
continuous and smooth control signals of lower magnitude than existing
approaches. Third, the proposed consensus protocol does not have parameters to
be adjusted depending on the connectivity of the considered communication
graph.

  In this paper, estimation of optimal capacity and location of installation of
wind, solar and fuel cell sources in distribution systems to reduce loss and
improve voltage profile, by considering load changes, is carried out with
Lightning Search Algorithm (LSA). Studies have been conducted on the standard
IEEE 33 bus power system in two scenarios. In the first scenario, study is done
with the assumption that the load remains constant throughout the project
period and in the second scenario with the load growth. The results of the
simulation, indicated that the puissance of load changes on distributed
generations (DGs) placement studies. Also, the results confirm the performance
of the proposed algorithm in reducing the objective function.

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In this paper, we re-examine the notion of string stability as it relates to
safety by providing an upper bound on the maximum spacing error of any vehicle
in a homogeneous platoon in terms of the input of the leading vehicle. We
reinforce our previous work on lossy CACC platoons by accommodating for
burst-noise behavior in the V2V link. Further, through Monte Carlo type
simulations, we demonstrate that connectivity can enhance traffic mobility and
safety in a CACC string even when the deceleration capabilities of the vehicles
in the platoon are heterogeneous.

Title: On the sensitivity of the H-infinity norm of systems described by delay

\\
  We consider delay differential algebraic equations (DDAEs) to model
interconnected systems with time-delays. The DDAE framework does not require
any elimination techniques and can directly deal with any interconnection of
systems and controllers with time-delays. In this framework, we analyze the
properties of the H-infinity norm of systems described by delay differential
algebraic equations. We show that the standard H-infinity norm may be sensitive
to arbitrarily small delay perturbations. We introduce the strong H-infinity
norm which is insensitive to small delay perturbations and describe its
properties. We conclude that the strong H-infinity norm is more appropriate in
any practical control application compared to the standard H-infinity norm for
systems with time-delays whenever there are high-frequency paths in control
loops.

  In this work we investigate the behavior of P-time event graphs, a class of
time Petri nets with nondeterministic timing of places. Our approach is based
on combined linear descriptions in both (max,+) and (min,+) semirings, where
lower bounds on the state vector are (max,+)-linear and upper bounds are
(min,+)-linear. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of extremal (fastest and slowest) periodic trajectories that are
derived from the new description. The results are illustrated by a realistic
example of an electroplating process.

  An inevitable consequence of the global power system transition towards
nearly 100% renewable-based generation is the loss of conventional bulk
generation by synchronous machines, their inertia, and accompanying frequency
and voltage control mechanisms. This gradual transformation of the power system
to a low-inertia system leads to critical challenges in maintaining system
stability. Novel control techniques for converters, so-called grid-forming
strategies, are expected to address these challenges and replicate
functionalities that so far have been provided by synchronous machines. This
article presents a low-inertia case study that includes synchronous machines
and converters controlled under various grid-forming techniques. In this work
1) the positive impact of the grid-forming converters on the frequency
stability of synchronous machines is highlighted, 2) a qualitative analysis
which provides insights into the frequency stability of the system is
presented, 3) we explore the behavior of the grid-forming controls when
imposing the converter dc and ac current limitations, 4) the importance of the
dc dynamics in grid-forming control design as well as the critical need for an
effective ac current limitation scheme are reported, and lastly 5) we analyze
how and when the interaction between the fast grid-forming converter and the
slow synchronous machine dynamics can contribute to the system instability

  The pseudospectra of a linear time-invariant system are the sets in the
complex plane consisting of all the roots of the characteristic equation when
the system matrices are subjected to all possible perturbations with a given
upper bound. The pseudospectral abscissa are defined as the maximum real part
of the characteristic roots in the pseudospectra and, therefore, they are for
instance important from a robust stability point of view. In this paper we
present a numerical method for the computation of the pseudospectral abscissa
of retarded delay differential equations with discrete pointwise delays. Our
approach is based on the connections between the pseudospectra and the level
sets of an appropriately defined complex function. These connections lead us to
a bisection algorithm for the computation of the pseudospectral abscissa, where
each step relies on checking the presence of imaginary axis eigenvalues of an
appropriately defined operator. Because this operator is infinite-dimensional a
predictor-corrector approach is taken. In the predictor step the bisection
algorithm is applied where the operator is discretized into a matrix, yielding
approximations for the pseudospectral abscissa. The effect of the
discretization is fully characterized in the paper. In the corrector step, the
approximate pseudospectral abscissa are corrected to any given accuracy, by
solving a set of nonlinear equations that characterize extreme points in the
pseudospectra contours.

\\
  The design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the design of AV-enabled mobility
systems are closely coupled. Indeed, knowledge about the intended service of
AVs would impact their design and deployment process, whilst insights about
their technological development could significantly affect transportation
management decisions. This calls for tools to study such a coupling and
co-design AVs and AV-enabled mobility systems in terms of different objectives.
In this paper, we instantiate a framework to address such co-design problems.
In particular, we leverage the recently developed theory of co-design to frame
and solve the problem of designing and deploying an intermodal Autonomous
Mobility-on-Demand system, whereby AVs service travel demands jointly with
public transit, in terms of fleet sizing, vehicle autonomy, and public transit
service frequency. Our framework is modular and compositional, allowing one to
describe the design problem as the interconnection of its individual components
and to tackle it from a system-level perspective. To showcase our methodology,
we present a real-world case study for Washington D.C., USA. Our work suggests
that it is possible to create user-friendly optimization tools to
systematically assess costs and benefits of interventions, and that such
analytical techniques might gain a momentous role in policy-making in the
future.

Title: An Introduction to Disk Margins
Authors: Peter Seiler and Andrew Packard and Pascal Gahinet
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  This paper provides a tutorial introduction to disk margins. These are robust
stability measures that account for simultaneous gain and phase perturbations
in a feedback system. The paper first reviews the classical (gain-only and
phase-only) margins and their limitations. This motivates the use of disk
margins which are defined using a set of perturbations that have simultaneous
gain and phase variations. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided to
compute the disk margin for a single-input, single-output feedback system.
Frequency-dependent disk margins can also be computed yielding additional
insight. The paper concludes with a discussion of stability margins for
multiple-input, multiple output (MIMO) feedback systems. A typical approach is
to assess robust stability ``loop-at-a-time'' with a perturbation introduced
into a single channel and all other channels held at their nominal values. MIMO
disk margins provide a useful extension to consider simultaneous variations in
multiple channels. This multiple-loop analysis can provide a more accurate
robustness assessment as compared to the loop-at-a-time approach.

pricing agent, which sends price signals to the customers and contributes to
shifting the customer demand to periods of high renewable energy generation. We
propose an implementation of a pricing agent with a reinforcement learning

Title: Sharp Composition Bounds for Gaussian Differential Privacy via Edgeworth
  Expansion
Authors: Qinqing Zheng, Jinshuo Dong, Qi Long, Weijie J. Su
Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.CR cs.LG stat.ME
\\
  Datasets containing sensitive information are often sequentially analyzed by
many algorithms and, accordingly, a fundamental question in differential
privacy is concerned with how the overall privacy bound degrades under
composition. To address this question, we introduce a family of analytical and
sharp privacy bounds under composition using the Edgeworth expansion in the
framework of the recently proposed f-differential privacy. In contrast to the
existing composition theorems using the central limit theorem, our new privacy
bounds under composition gain improved tightness by leveraging the refined
approximation accuracy of the Edgeworth expansion. Our approach is easy to
implement and computationally efficient for any number of compositions. The
superiority of these new bounds is confirmed by an asymptotic error analysis
and an application to quantifying the overall privacy guarantees of noisy
stochastic gradient descent used in training private deep neural networks.

  Gradient boosted trees and other regression tree models perform well in a
wide range of real-world, industrial applications. These tree models (i) offer
insight into important prediction features, (ii) effectively manage sparse
data, and (iii) have excellent prediction capabilities. Despite their
advantages, they are generally unpopular for decision-making tasks and
black-box optimization, which is due to their difficult-to-optimize structure
and the lack of a reliable uncertainty measure. ENTMOOT is our new framework
for integrating (already trained) tree models into larger optimization
problems. The contributions of ENTMOOT include: (i) explicitly introducing a
reliable uncertainty measure that is compatible with tree models, (ii) solving
the larger optimization problems that incorporate these uncertainty aware tree
models, (iii) proving that the solutions are globally optimal, i.e. no better
solution exists. In particular, we show how the ENTMOOT approach allows a
simple integration of tree models into decision-making and black-box
optimization, where it proves as a strong competitor to commonly-used
frameworks.

Title: On the computational complexity of uncapacitated multi-plant lot-sizing
  problems
Authors: J. O. Cunha, H. H. Kramer, R. A. Melo
Categories: math.OC cs.CC
\\
  Production and inventory planning have become crucial and challenging in
nowadays competitive industrial and commercial sectors, especially when
multiple plants or warehouses are involved. In this context, this paper
addresses the complexity of uncapacitated multi-plant lot-sizing problems. We
consider a multi-item uncapacitated multi-plant lot-sizing problem with fixed
transfer costs and show that two of its very restricted special cases are
already NP-hard. Namely, we show that the single-item uncapacitated multi-plant
lot-sizing problem with a single period and the multi-item uncapacitated
two-plant lot-sizing problem with fixed transfer costs are NP-hard.
Furthermore, as a direct implication of the proven results, we also show that a
two-echelon multi-item lot-sizing with joint setup costs on transportation is
NP-hard.

Title: Elder-rule-staircodes for Augmented Metric Spaces
Authors: Chen Cai, Woojin Kim, Facundo Memoli, Yusu Wang
Categories: math.AT cs.CG
Comments: 34 pages, 15 figures, this is the full version of the paper to appear
  in the Proceedings of the 36th International Symposium on Computational
  Geometry (SoCG 2020)
\\
  An augmented metric space $(X, d_X, f_X)$ is a metric space $(X, d_X)$
equipped with a function $f_X: X \to \mathbb{R}$. It arises commonly in
practice, e.g, a point cloud $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where each point $x\in X$
has a density function value $f_X(x)$ associated to it. Such an augmented
metric space naturally gives rise to a 2-parameter filtration. However, the
resulting 2-parameter persistence module could still be of wild representation
type, and may not have simple indecomposables.
  In this paper, motivated by the elder-rule for the zeroth homology of a
1-parameter filtration, we propose a barcode-like summary, called the
elder-rule-staircode, as a way to encode the zeroth homology of the 2-parameter
filtration induced by a finite augmented metric space. Specifically, given a
finite $(X, d_X, f_X)$, its elder-rule-staircode consists of $n = |X|$ number
of staircase-like blocks in the plane. We show that the fibered barcode, the
fibered merge tree, and the graded Betti numbers associated to the zeroth
homology of the 2-parameter filtration induced by $(X, d_X, f_X)$ can all be
efficiently computed once the elder-rule-staircode is given. Furthermore, for
certain special cases, this staircode corresponds exactly to the set of
indecomposables of the zeroth homology of the 2-parameter filtration. Finally,
we develop and implement an efficient algorithm to compute the
elder-rule-staircode in $O(n^2\log n)$ time, which can be improved to
$O(n^2\alpha(n))$ if $X$ is from a fixed dimensional Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.

Title: On the coexistence of competing languages
Authors: Jean-Marc Luck and Anita Mehta
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech cs.CL
Comments: 18 pages, 12 figures, 47 references. To appear in EPJ B
\\
  We investigate the evolution of competing languages, a subject where much
previous literature suggests that the outcome is always the domination of one
language over all the others. Since coexistence of languages is observed in
reality, we here revisit the question of language competition, with an emphasis
on uncovering the ways in which coexistence might emerge. We find that this
emergence is related to symmetry breaking, and explore two particular scenarios
-- the first relating to an imbalance in the population dynamics of language
speakers in a single geographical area, and the second to do with spatial
heterogeneity, where language preferences are specific to different
geographical regions. For each of these, the investigation of paradigmatic
situations leads us to a quantitative understanding of the conditions leading
to language coexistence. We also obtain predictions of the number of surviving
languages as a function of various model parameters.

Title: Automatic segmentation of spinal multiple sclerosis lesions: How to
  generalize across MRI contrasts?
Authors: Olivier Vincent, Charley Gros, Joseph Paul Cohen, Julien Cohen-Adad
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, MIDL 2020 submission
\\
  Despite recent improvements in medical image segmentation, the ability to
generalize across imaging contrasts remains an open issue. To tackle this
challenge, we implement Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to leverage
physics knowledge within the segmentation model and learn the characteristics
of each contrast. Interestingly, a well-optimised U-Net reached the same
performance as our FiLMed-Unet on a multi-contrast dataset (0.72 of Dice
score), which suggests that there is a bottleneck in spinal MS lesion
segmentation different from the generalization across varying contrasts. This
bottleneck likely stems from inter-rater variability, which is estimated at
0.61 of Dice score in our dataset.

Title: Spine intervertebral disc labeling using a fully convolutional redundant
  counting model
Authors: Lucas Rouhier, Francisco Perdigon Romero, Joseph Paul Cohen, Julien

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: MIDL 2020
\\
  Labeling intervertebral discs is relevant as it notably enables clinicians to
understand the relationship between a patient's symptoms (pain, paralysis) and
the exact level of spinal cord injury. However manually labeling those discs is
a tedious and user-biased task which would benefit from automated methods.
While some automated methods already exist for MRI and CT-scan, they are either
not publicly available, or fail to generalize across various imaging contrasts.
In this paper we combine a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with inception
modules to localize and label intervertebral discs. We demonstrate a
proof-of-concept application in a publicly-available multi-center and
multi-contrast MRI database (n=235 subjects). The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/neuropoly/vertebral-labeling-deep-learning.

\\
  Spitzoid lesions may be largely categorized into Spitz Nevus, Atypical Spitz
Tumors, and Spitz Melanomas. Classifying a lesion precisely as Atypical Spitz
Tumors or AST is challenging and often requires the integration of clinical,
histological, and immunohistochemical features to differentiate AST from
regular Spitz nevus and malignant Spitz melanomas. Specifically, this paper
aims to test several artificial intelligence techniques so as to build a
computer aided diagnosis system. A proposed three-phase approach is being
implemented. In Phase I, collected data are preprocessed with an effective
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique or SMOTE-based method being
implemented to treat the imbalance data problem. Then, a feature selection
mechanism using genetic algorithm (GA) is applied in Phase II. Finally, in
Phase III, a ten-fold cross-validation method is used to compare the
performance of seven machine-learning algorithms for classification. Results
obtained with SMOTE-Multilayer Perceptron with GA-based 14 features show the
highest classification accuracy (0.98), a sensitivity of 0.99, and a
specificity of 0.98, outperforming other Spitzoid lesions classification
algorithms.

Title: Weighted Encoding Based Image Interpolation With Nonlocal Linear
  Regression Model
Authors: Junchao Zhang
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Image interpolation is a special case of image super-resolution, where the
low-resolution image is directly down-sampled from its high-resolution
counterpart without blurring and noise. Therefore, assumptions adopted in
super-resolution models are not valid for image interpolation. To address this
problem, we propose a novel image interpolation model based on sparse
representation. Two widely used priors including sparsity and nonlocal
self-similarity are used as the regularization terms to enhance the stability
of interpolation model. Meanwhile, we incorporate the nonlocal linear
regression into this model since nonlocal similar patches could provide a
better approximation to a given patch. Moreover, we propose a new approach to
learn adaptive sub-dictionary online instead of clustering. For each patch,
similar patches are grouped to learn adaptive sub-dictionary, generating a more
sparse and accurate representation. Finally, the weighted encoding is
introduced to suppress tailing of fitting residuals in data fidelity. Abundant
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative measures and visual quality.

\\
  This paper discusses the hardware and software components of the Grid
Computing system used to implement the Locus Algorithm to identify optimum
pointings for differential photometry of 61,662,376 stars and 23,799 quasars.
The scale of the data, together with initial operational assessments demanded a
High Performance Computing (HPC) system to complete the data analysis. Grid
computing was chosen as the HPC solution as the optimum choice available within
this project. The physical and logical structure of the National Grid computing
Infrastructure informed the approach that was taken. That approach was one of
layered separation of the different project components to enable maximum
flexibility and extensibility.

Title: A Catalogue of Locus Algorithm Pointings for Optimal Differential
  Photometry for 23,779 Quasars
Authors: Ois\'in Creaner, Kevin Nolan, David Grennan, Niall Smith and Eugene
  Hickey
Categories: astro-ph.GA astro-ph.IM cs.DC cs.DL

ACM-class: J.2; E.5
\\
  This paper presents a catalogue of optimised pointings for differential
photometry of 23,779 quasars extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
Catalogue and a score for each indicating the quality of the Field of View
(FoV) associated with that pointing. Observation of millimagnitude variability
on a timescale of minutes typically requires differential observations with
reference to an ensemble of reference stars. For optimal performance, these
reference stars should have similar colour and magnitude to the target quasar.
In addition, the greatest quantity and quality of suitable reference stars may
be found by using a telescope pointing which offsets the target object from the
centre of the field of view. By comparing each quasar with the stars which
appear close to it on the sky in the SDSS Catalogue, an optimum pointing can be
calculated, and a figure of merit, referred to as the "score" calculated for
that pointing. Highly flexible software has been developed to enable this
process to be automated and implemented in a distributed computing paradigm,
which enables the creation of catalogues of pointings given a set of input
targets. Applying this technique to a sample of 40,000 targets from the 4th
SDSS quasar catalogue resulted in the production of pointings and scores for
23,779 quasars. This catalogue is a useful resource for observers planning
differential photometry studies and surveys of quasars to select those which
have many suitable celestial neighbours for differential photometry

Title: On the balanceability of some graph classes
Authors: Antoine Dailly, Adriana Hansberg, Denae Ventura
Categories: math.CO cs.DM
Comments: 14 pages
\\
  Given a graph $G$, a 2-coloring of the edges of $K_n$ is said to contain a
balanced copy of $G$ if we can find a copy of $G$ such that half of its edges
are in each color class. If there exists an integer $k$ such that, for $n$
sufficiently large, every 2-coloring of $K_n$ with more than $k$ edges in each
color class contains a balanced copy of $G$, then we say that $G$ is
balanceable. Balanceability was introduced by Caro, Hansberg and Montejano, who
also gave a structural characterization of balanceable graphs.
  In this paper, we extend the study of balanceability by finding new
sufficient conditions for a graph to be balanceable or not. We use those
conditions to fully characterize the balanceability of graph classes such as
circulant graphs, rectangular and triangular grids.

Title: Moving Target Monte Carlo
Authors: Haoyun Ying, Keheng Mao, Klaus Mosegaard
Categories: stat.CO cs.DS math.OC math.PR stat.ML
\\
  The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are popular when considering
sampling from a high-dimensional random variable $\mathbf{x}$ with possibly
unnormalised probability density $p$ and observed data $\mathbf{d}$. However,
MCMC requires evaluating the posterior distribution $p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{d})$
of the proposed candidate $\mathbf{x}$ at each iteration when constructing the
acceptance rate. This is costly when such evaluations are intractable. In this
paper, we introduce a new non-Markovian sampling algorithm called Moving Target
Monte Carlo (MTMC). The acceptance rate at $n$-th iteration is constructed
using an iteratively updated approximation of the posterior distribution
$a_n(\mathbf{x})$ instead of $p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{d})$. The true value of the
posterior $p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{d})$ is only calculated if the candidate
$\mathbf{x}$ is accepted. The approximation $a_n$ utilises these evaluations
and converges to $p$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. A proof of convergence and
estimation of convergence rate in different situations are given.

Title: Model for Thermal Comfort and Energy Saving Based on Individual
  Sensation Estimation
Authors: Guillaume Lopez, Takuya Aoki, Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu, and Anna Yokokubo
Categories: eess.SP cs.HC
\\
  In office spaces, the ratio of energy consumption of air conditioning and
lighting for maintaining the environment comfort is about 70%. On the other
hand, many people claim being dissatisfied with the temperature of the air
conditioning. Therefore, there is concern about work efficiency reduction
caused by the current air conditioning control. In this research, we propose an
automatic control system that improves both energy-saving and thermal comfort
of all indoor users by quantifying individual differences in thermal comfort
from vital information, on the basis of which the optimal settings of both air
conditioning and wearable systems that can directly heat and cool individuals
are determined. Various environments were simulated with different room sizes,
numbers of users in a room, and heating/cooling conditions. The simulation
results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed system for both energy
saving and comfort maximization.

  For space-based laser communications, when the mean photon number per
received optical pulse is much smaller than one, there is a large gap between
communications capacity---measured in bits communicated per pulse---achievable
with a receiver that detects (converts from optical to electrical domain) each
modulated pulse one at a time, versus with the quantum-optimal joint-detection
receiver that acts on a long codeword comprised of $n$ modulated pulses; an
effect often termed superadditive capacity. The action of this receiver cannot
be described as the detection of each individual pulse, interspersed with
classical feedforward and soft-information post-processing. In this paper, we
consider the simplest scenario where a large superadditive capacity is known: a
pure-loss channel with a coherent-state binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK)
modulation. The two BPSK states can be mapped conceptually to two
non-orthogonal states of a single qubit, described by an inner product that is
a function of the mean photon number of each BPSK pulse. Using this map, we
derive an explicit construction of the quantum circuit of a joint-detection
receiver based on a recent idea of belief-propagation with quantum messages
(BPQM) [arXiv:1607.04833]. We analyze this scheme rigorously and show that it
achieves the quantum limit of minimum average error probability in
discriminating $8$ (BPSK) codewords of a length-$5$ binary linear code with a
tree factor graph. We quantify its performance improvement over the (Dolinar)
receiver that optimally detects one pulse at a time. Our result suggests that a
BPQM-receiver might attain the Holevo capacity, the quantum limit of classical
communication capacity, of this BPSK-modulated pure-loss channel. This suggests
a new application for a small, special-purpose, photonic quantum computer
capable of so-called cat-basis universal qubit logic.

Comments: 23 pages 10 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with

\\
  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems require downlink
channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) to achieve spatial
diversity and multiplexing gains. In a frequency division duplex (FDD)
multiuser massive MIMO network, each user needs to compress and feedback its
downlink CSI to the BS. The CSI overhead scales with the numbers of antennas,
users and subcarriers, and becomes a major bottleneck for the overall spectral
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based CSI
compression scheme, called DeepCMC, composed of convolutional layers followed
by quantization and entropy coding blocks. In comparison with previous deep
learning DL-based CSI reduction structures, DeepCMC includes quantization and
entropy coding blocks and minimizes a weighted rate-distortion cost which
enables a trade-off between the CSI quality and its feedback overhead.
Simulation results demonstrate that DeepCMC outperforms the state of the art
CSI compression schemes in terms of the reconstruction quality of CSI for the
same compression rate. We also propose a distributed version of DeepCMC for a
multi-user MIMO scenario to encode and reconstruct the CSI from multiple users
in a distributed manner. Distributed DeepCMC not only utilizes the inherent CSI
structures of a single MIMO user for compression, but also benefits from the
correlations among the channel matrices of nearby users to further improve the
performance in comparison with DeepCMC.

Title: UPR: A Model-Driven Architecture for Deep Phase Retrieval

Categories: eess.SP cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  The problem of phase retrieval has been intriguing researchers for decades
due to its appearance in a wide range of applications. The task of a phase
retrieval algorithm is typically to recover a signal from linear phase-less
measurements. In this paper, we approach the problem by proposing a hybrid
model-based data-driven deep architecture, referred to as the Unfolded Phase
Retrieval (UPR), that shows potential in improving the performance of the
state-of-the-art phase retrieval algorithms. Specifically, the proposed method
benefits from versatility and interpretability of well established model-based
algorithms, while simultaneously benefiting from the expressive power of deep
neural networks. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of such
hybrid deep architectures and showcase the untapped potential of data-aided
methodologies to enhance the existing phase retrieval algorithms.

DOI: 10.1145/3368555.3384454
\\
  The abundance of modern health data provides many opportunities for the use
of machine learning techniques to build better statistical models to improve
clinical decision making. Predicting time-to-event distributions, also known as
survival analysis, plays a key role in many clinical applications. We introduce
a variational time-to-event prediction model, named Variational Survival
Inference (VSI), which builds upon recent advances in distribution learning
techniques and deep neural networks. VSI addresses the challenges of
non-parametric distribution estimation by ($i$) relaxing the restrictive
modeling assumptions made in classical models, and ($ii$) efficiently handling
the censored observations, {\it i.e.}, events that occur outside the
observation window, all within the variational framework. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach, an extensive set of experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets is carried out, showing improved performance
relative to competing solutions.

Title: Topological Machine Learning for Mixed Numeric and Categorical Data
Authors: Chengyuan Wu, Carol Anne Hargreaves
Categories: math.AT cs.LG
Comments: 17 pages
\\
  Topological data analysis is a relatively new branch of machine learning that
excels in studying high dimensional data, and is theoretically known to be
robust against noise. Meanwhile, data objects with mixed numeric and
categorical attributes are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However,
topological methods are usually applied to point cloud data, and to the best of
our knowledge there is no available framework for the classification of mixed
data using topological methods. In this paper, we propose a novel topological
machine learning method for mixed data classification. In the proposed method,
we use theory from topological data analysis such as persistent homology,
persistence diagrams and Wasserstein distance to study mixed data. The
performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments on a
real-world heart disease dataset. Experimental results show that our
topological method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in the
prediction of heart disease.

Title: Time-varying Gaussian Process Bandit Optimization with Non-constant
  Evaluation Time

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  The Gaussian process bandit is a problem in which we want to find a maximizer
of a black-box function with the minimum number of function evaluations. If the
black-box function varies with time, then time-varying Bayesian optimization is
a promising framework. However, a drawback with current methods is in the
assumption that the evaluation time for every observation is constant, which
can be unrealistic for many practical applications, e.g., recommender systems
and environmental monitoring. As a result, the performance of current methods
can be degraded when this assumption is violated. To cope with this problem, we
propose a novel time-varying Bayesian optimization algorithm that can
effectively handle the non-constant evaluation time. Furthermore, we
theoretically establish a regret bound of our algorithm. Our bound elucidates
that a pattern of the evaluation time sequence can hugely affect the difficulty
of the problem. We also provide experimental results to validate the practical
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Communication-Efficient Distributed SGD with Error-Feedback, Revisited
Authors: Tran Thi Phuong, Le Trieu Phong
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
\\
  We show that the convergence proof of a recent algorithm called dist-EF-SGD
for distributed stochastic gradient descent with communication efficiency using
error-feedback of Zheng et al. (NeurIPS 2019) is problematic mathematically.
Concretely, the original error bound for arbitrary sequences of learning rate
is unfortunately incorrect, leading to an invalidated upper bound in the
convergence theorem for the algorithm. As evidences, we explicitly provide
several counter-examples, for both convex and non-convex cases, to show the
incorrectness of the error bound. We fix the issue by providing a new error
bound and its corresponding proof, leading to a new convergence theorem for the
dist-EF-SGD algorithm, and therefore recovering its mathematical analysis.

\\
  In this paper we explore speaker identification using electroencephalography
(EEG) signals. The performance of speaker identification systems degrades in
presence of background noise, this paper demonstrates that EEG features can be
used to enhance the performance of speaker identification systems operating in
presence and absence of background noise. The paper further demonstrates that
in presence of high background noise, speaker identification system using only
EEG features as input demonstrates better performance than the system using
only acoustic features as input.

Title: Pursuing Sources of Heterogeneity in Modeling Clustered Population
Authors: Yan Li, Chun Yu, Yize Zhao, Robert H. Aseltine, Weixin Yao, Kun Chen
Categories: stat.ME cs.LG stat.AP stat.CO
\\
  Researchers often have to deal with heterogeneous population with mixed
regression relationships, increasingly so in the era of data explosion. In such
problems, when there are many candidate predictors, it is not only of interest
to identify the predictors that are associated with the outcome, but also to
distinguish the true sources of heterogeneity, i.e., to identify the predictors
that have different effects among the clusters and thus are the true
contributors to the formation of the clusters. We clarify the concepts of the
source of heterogeneity that account for potential scale differences of the
clusters and propose a regularized finite mixture effects regression to achieve
heterogeneity pursuit and feature selection simultaneously. As the name
suggests, the problem is formulated under an effects-model parameterization, in
which the cluster labels are missing and the effect of each predictor on the
outcome is decomposed to a common effect term and a set of cluster-specific
terms. A constrained sparse estimation of these effects leads to the
identification of both the variables with common effects and those with
heterogeneous effects. We propose an efficient algorithm and show that our
approach can achieve both estimation and selection consistency. Simulation
studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method under various
practical scenarios. Three applications are presented, namely, an imaging
genetics study for linking genetic factors and brain neuroimaging traits in
Alzheimer's disease, a public health study for exploring the association
between suicide risk among adolescents and their school district
characteristics, and a sport analytics study for understanding how the salary
levels of baseball players are associated with their performance and
contractual status.

Title: Data Freshness and Energy-Efficient UAV Navigation Optimization: A Deep
  Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Sarder Fakhrul Abedin, Md. Shirajum Munir, Nguyen H. Tran, Zhu Han,

Categories: eess.SP cs.LG cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,
  Special Issue on Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management
\\
  In this paper, we design a navigation policy for multiple unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) where mobile base stations (BSs) are deployed to improve the
data freshness and connectivity to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. First,
we formulate an energy-efficient trajectory optimization problem in which the
objective is to maximize the energy efficiency by optimizing the UAV-BS
trajectory policy. We also incorporate different contextual information such as
energy and age of information (AoI) constraints to ensure the data freshness at
the ground BS. Second, we propose an agile deep reinforcement learning with
experience replay model to solve the formulated problem concerning the
contextual constraints for the UAV-BS navigation. Moreover, the proposed
approach is well-suited for solving the problem, since the state space of the
problem is extremely large and finding the best trajectory policy with useful
contextual features is too complex for the UAV-BSs. By applying the proposed
trained model, an effective real-time trajectory policy for the UAV-BSs
captures the observable network states over time. Finally, the simulation
results illustrate the proposed approach is 3.6% and 3.13% more energy
efficient than those of the greedy and baseline deep Q Network (DQN)
approaches.

Title: Explore and Exploit with Heterotic Line Bundle Models
Authors: Magdalena Larfors and Robin Schneider
Categories: hep-th cs.LG
Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures, python package
Report-no: UUITP-05/20
\\
  We use deep reinforcement learning to explore a class of heterotic $SU(5)$
GUT models constructed from line bundle sums over Complete Intersection Calabi
Yau (CICY) manifolds. We perform several experiments where A3C agents are
trained to search for such models. These agents significantly outperform random
exploration, in the most favourable settings by a factor of 1700 when it comes
to finding unique models. Furthermore, we find evidence that the trained agents
also outperform random walkers on new manifolds. We conclude that the agents
detect hidden structures in the compactification data, which is partly of
general nature. The experiments scale well with $h^{(1,1)}$, and may thus
provide the key to model building on CICYs with large $h^{(1,1)}$.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Mitigating Intermittent Interference in
  Terahertz Communication Networks
Authors: Reza Barazideh and Omid Semiari and Solmaz Niknam and Balasubramaniam

Categories: eess.SP cs.LG cs.NI

\\
  Emerging wireless services with extremely high data rate requirements, such
as real-time extended reality applications, mandate novel solutions to further
increase the capacity of future wireless networks. In this regard, leveraging
large available bandwidth at terahertz frequency bands is seen as a key
enabler. To overcome the large propagation loss at these very high frequencies,
it is inevitable to manage transmissions over highly directional links.
However, uncoordinated directional transmissions by a large number of users can
cause substantial interference in terahertz networks. While such interference
will be received over short random time intervals, the received power can be
large. In this work, a new framework based on reinforcement learning is
proposed that uses an adaptive multi-thresholding strategy to efficiently
detect and mitigate the intermittent interference from directional links in the
time domain. To find the optimal thresholds, the problem is formulated as a
multidimensional multi-armed bandit system. Then, an algorithm is proposed that
allows the receiver to learn the optimal thresholds with very low complexity.
Another key advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not rely on any
prior knowledge about the interference statistics, and hence, it is suitable
for interference mitigation in dynamic scenarios. Simulation results confirm
the superior bit-error-rate performance of the proposed method compared with
two traditional time-domain interference mitigation approaches.

Title: Stationary distributions of persistent ecological systems

\\
  We analyze ecological systems that are influenced by random environmental
fluctuations. We first provide general conditions which ensure that the species
coexist and the system converges to a unique invariant probability measure
(stationary distribution). Since it is usually impossible to characterize this
invariant probability measure analytically, we develop a powerful method for
numerically approximating invariant probability measures. This allows us to
shed light upon how the various parameters of the ecosystem impact the
stationary distribution.
  We analyze different types of environmental fluctuations. At first we study
ecosystems modeled by stochastic differential equations. In the second setting
we look at piecewise deterministic Markov processes. These are processes where
one follows a system of differential equations for a random time, after which
the environmental state changes, and one follows a different set of
differential equations -- this procedure then gets repeated indefinitely.
Finally, we look at stochastic differential equations with switching, which
take into account both the white noise fluctuations and the random
environmental switches. Many natural systems exhibit dynamics on multiple time
scales. We study how different time scales can influence our persistence
results.
  As applications of our theoretical and numerical analysis, we look at
competitive Lotka--Volterra, Beddington-DeAngelis predator-prey, and
rock-paper-scissors dynamics. We highlight new biological insights by analyzing
the stationary distributions of the ecosystems and by seeing how various types
of environmental fluctuations influence the long term fate of populations.

Title: Mean Field Games and Applications: Numerical Aspects
Authors: Yves Achdou and Mathieu Lauri\`ere
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
Comments: This work is part of the C.I.M.E. Lecture Notes to be published in
  the Springer series "Lecture Notes in Mathematics", corresponding to the
  course taught by the first author in Cetraro in June 2019
\\
  The theory of mean field games aims at studying deterministic or stochastic
differential games (Nash equilibria) as the number of agents tends to infinity.
Since very few mean field games have explicit or semi-explicit solutions,
numerical simulations play a crucial role in obtaining quantitative information
from this class of models. They may lead to systems of evolutive partial
differential equations coupling a backward Bellman equation and a forward
Fokker-Planck equation. In the present survey, we focus on such systems. The
forward-backward structure is an important feature of this system, which makes
it necessary to design unusual strategies for mathematical analysis and
numerical approximation. In this survey, several aspects of a finite difference
method used to approximate the previously mentioned system of PDEs are
discussed, including convergence, variational aspects and algorithms for
solving the resulting systems of nonlinear equations. Finally, we discuss in
details two applications of mean field games to the study of crowd motion and
to macroeconomics, a comparison with mean field type control, and present
numerical simulations.

Title: Superiorized method for metal artifact reduction
Authors: T. Humphries, J. Wang
Categories: physics.med-ph cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 29 pages, five figures
\\
  Metal artifact reduction (MAR) is a challenging problem in computed
tomography (CT) imaging. A popular class of MAR methods replace sinogram
measurements that are corrupted by metal with artificial data. While these
``projection completion'' approaches are successful in eliminating severe
artifacts, secondary artifacts may be introduced by the artificial data. In
this paper, we propose an approach which uses projection completion to generate
a prior image, which is then incorporated into an iterative reconstruction
algorithm based on the superiorization framework. The prior image is
reconstructed using normalized metal artifact reduction (NMAR), a popular
projection completion approach. The iterative algorithm is a modified version
of the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), which reduces
artifacts by incorporating a polyenergetic forward model, least-squares
weighting, and superiorization. The penalty function used for superiorization
is a weighted average between a total variation (TV) term and a term promoting
similarity with the prior image, similar to penalty functions used in prior
image constrained compressive sensing. Because the prior is largely free of
severe metal artifacts, these artifacts are discouraged from arising during
iterative reconstruction; additionally, because the iterative approach uses the
original projection data, it is able to recover information that is lost during
the NMAR process. We perform numerical experiments modeling a simple geometric
object, as well as several more realistic scenarios such as metal pins,
bilateral hip implants, and dental fillings placed within an anatomical
phantom. The proposed iterative algorithm is largely successful at eliminating
severe metal artifacts as well as secondary artifacts introduced by the NMAR
process, especially lost edges of bone structures in the neighborhood of the
metal regions.

Title: Phase-field modeling of geologic shear fracture
Authors: Fan Fei, Jinhyun Choo
Categories: physics.geo-ph cs.NA math.NA
\\
  Geologic shear fractures such as faults and slip surfaces involve marked
friction along the discontinuities as they are subjected to significant
confining pressures. This friction plays a critical role in the growth of these
shear fractures, as revealed by the fracture mechanics theory of Palmer and
Rice decades ago. In this paper, we develop a novel phase-field model of shear
fracture in pressure-sensitive geomaterials, honoring the role of friction in
the fracture propagation mechanism. Building on a recently proposed phase-field
method for frictional interfaces, we formulate a set of governing equations for
different contact conditions (or lack thereof) in which frictional energy
dissipation emerges in the crack driving force during slip. We then derive the
degradation function and the threshold fracture energy of the phase-field model
such that the stress-strain behavior is insensitive to the length parameter for
phase-field regularization. This derivation procedure extends a methodology
used in recent phase-field models of cohesive tensile fracture to shear
fracture in frictional materials in which peak and residual strengths coexist
and evolve by confining pressure. The resulting phase-field formulation is
demonstrably consistent with the theory of Palmer and Rice. Numerical examples
showcase that the proposed phase-field model is a physically sound and
numerically efficient method for simulating shear fracture processes in
geomaterials, such as faulting and slip surface growth.

Title: The Locus Algorithm IV: Performance metrics of a grid computing system

\\
  This paper discusses the requirements for and performance metrics of the the
Grid Computing system used to implement the Locus Algorithm to identify optimum
pointings for differential photometry of 61,662,376 stars and 23,779 quasars.
Initial operational tests indicated a need for a software system to analyse the
data and a High Performance Computing system to run that software in a scalable
manner. Practical assessments of the performance of the software in a serial
computing environment were used to provide a benchmark against which the
performance metrics of the HPC solution could be compared, as well as to
indicate any bottlenecks in performance. These performance metrics indicated a
distinct split in the performance dictated more by differences in the input
data than by differences in the design of the systems used. This indicates a
need for experimental analysis of system performance, and suggests that
algorithmic complexity analyses may lead to incorrect or naive conclusions,
especially in systems with high data I/O overhead such as grid computing.
Further, it implies that systems which reduce or eliminate this bottleneck such
as in-memory processing could lead to a substantial increase in performance.

Title: Development of Automatic Speech Recognition for Kazakh Language using
  Transfer Learning

Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: 9 pages, 3 fig., 1 table
\\
  Development of Automatic Speech Recognition system for Kazakh language is
very challenging due to a lack of data.Existing data of kazakh speech with its
corresponding transcriptions are heavily accessed and not enough to gain a
worth mentioning results.For this reason, speech recognition of Kazakh language
has not been explored well.There are only few works that investigate this area
with traditional methods Hidden Markov Model, Gaussian Mixture Model, but they
are suffering from poor outcome and lack of enough data.In our work we suggest
a new method that takes pre-trained model of Russian language and applies its
knowledge as a starting point to our neural network structure, which means that
we are transferring the weights of pre-trained model to our neural network.The
main reason we chose Russian model is that pronunciation of kazakh and russian
languages are quite similar because they share 78 percent letters and there are
quite large corpus of russian speech dataset. We have collected a dataset of
Kazakh speech with transcriptions in the base of Suleyman Demirel University
with 50 native speakers each having around 400 sentences.Data have been chosen
from famous Kazakh books.
  We have considered 4 different scenarios in our experiment. First, we trained
our neural network without using a pre-trained Russian model with 2 LSTM layers
and 2 BiLSTM .Second, we have trained the same 2 LSTM layered and 2 BiLSTM
layered using a pre-trained model. As a result, we have improved our models
training cost and Label Error Rate by using external Russian speech recognition
model up to 24 percent and 32 percent respectively.Pre-trained Russian language
model has trained on 100 hours of data with the same neural network
architecture.

Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  We present two data-driven distributionally robust optimization formulations
for the look-ahead economic dispatch (LAED) problem with uncertain renewable
energy generation. In particular, the goal is to minimize the cost of
conventional energy generation subject to uncertain operational constraints.
Furthermore, these constraints are required to hold for a family of
distributions with similar characteristics as the observed past samples of the
uncertain parameters. First, we present a tractable convex reformulation of the
problem when the uncertain constraints are defined via the
conditional-value-at-risk. Then, we develop a scalable robust optimization
formulation to approximately solve the distributionally robust
chance-constrained formulation of the LAED problem. Numerical results
illustrate the effectiveness and the robustness-performance trade-offs for the
proposed techniques.
