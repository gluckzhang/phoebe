Title: Shared Mobile-Cloud Inference for Collaborative Intelligence
Authors: Mateen Ulhaq and Ivan V. Baji\'c
Categories: cs.AI eess.IV
Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures
\\
  As AI applications for mobile devices become more prevalent, there is an
increasing need for faster execution and lower energy consumption for neural
model inference. Historically, the models run on mobile devices have been
smaller and simpler in comparison to large state-of-the-art research models,
which can only run on the cloud. However, cloud-only inference has drawbacks
such as increased network bandwidth consumption and higher latency. In
addition, cloud-only inference requires the input data (images, audio) to be
fully transferred to the cloud, creating concerns about potential privacy
breaches. We demonstrate an alternative approach: shared mobile-cloud
inference. Partial inference is performed on the mobile in order to reduce the
dimensionality of the input data and arrive at a compact feature tensor, which
is a latent space representation of the input signal. The feature tensor is
then transmitted to the server for further inference. This strategy can improve
inference latency, energy consumption, and network bandwidth usage, as well as
provide privacy protection, because the original signal never leaves the
mobile. Further performance gain can be achieved by compressing the feature
tensor before its transmission.

Title: Dialogue-based simulation for cultural awareness training
Authors: Sodiq Adewole, Erfaneh Gharavi, Benjamin Shpringer, Martin Bolger,
  Vaibhav Sharma, Sung Ming Yang, Donald E. Brown
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Existing simulations designed for cultural and interpersonal skill training
rely on pre-defined responses with a menu option selection interface. Using a
multiple-choice interface and restricting trainees' responses may limit the
trainees' ability to apply the lessons in real life situations. This systems
also uses a simplistic evaluation model, where trainees' selected options are
marked as either correct or incorrect. This model may not capture sufficient
information that could drive an adaptive feedback mechanism to improve
trainees' cultural awareness. This paper describes the design of a
dialogue-based simulation for cultural awareness training. The simulation,
built around a disaster management scenario involving a joint coalition between
the US and the Chinese armies. Trainees were able to engage in realistic
dialogue with the Chinese agent. Their responses, at different points, get
evaluated by different multi-label classification models. Based on training on
our dataset, the models score the trainees' responses for cultural awareness in
the Chinese culture. Trainees also get feedback that informs the cultural
appropriateness of their responses. The result of this work showed the
following; i) A feature-based evaluation model improves the design, modeling
and computation of dialogue-based training simulation systems; ii) Output from
current automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems gave comparable end results
compared with the output from manual transcription; iii) A multi-label
classification model trained as a cultural expert gave results which were
comparable with scores assigned by human annotators.

Title: Bayesian Networks in Healthcare: Distribution by Medical Condition
Authors: Scott McLachlan, Kudakwashe Dube, Graham A Hitman, Norman E Fenton,
  Evangelia Kyrimi
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Bayesian networks (BNs) have received increasing research attention that is
not matched by adoption in practice and yet have potential to significantly
benefit healthcare. Hitherto, research works have not investigated the types of
medical conditions being modelled with BNs, nor whether any differences exist
in how and why they are applied to different conditions. This research seeks to
identify and quantify the range of medical conditions for which
healthcare-related BN models have been proposed, and the differences in
approach between the most common medical conditions to which they have been
applied. We found that almost two-thirds of all healthcare BNs are focused on
four conditions: cardiac, cancer, psychological and lung disorders. We believe
that a lack of understanding regarding how BNs work and what they are capable
of exists, and that it is only with greater understanding and promotion that we
may ever realise the full potential of BNs to effect positive change in daily
healthcare practice.

Title: Solving Billion-Scale Knapsack Problems
Authors: Xingwen Zhang, Feng Qi, Zhigang Hua, Shuang Yang
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Knapsack problems (KPs) are common in industry, but solving KPs is known to
be NP-hard and has been tractable only at a relatively small scale. This paper
examines KPs in a slightly generalized form and shows that they can be solved
nearly optimally at scale via distributed algorithms. The proposed approach can
be implemented fairly easily with off-the-shelf distributed computing
frameworks (e.g. MPI, Hadoop, Spark). As an example, our implementation leads
to one of the most efficient KP solvers known to date -- capable to solve KPs
at an unprecedented scale (e.g., KPs with 1 billion decision variables and 1
billion constraints can be solved within 1 hour). The system has been deployed
to production and called on a daily basis, yielding significant business
impacts at Ant Financial.

Title: Interpretability of Blackbox Machine Learning Models through Dataview
  Extraction and Shadow Model creation

\\
  Deep learning models trained using massive amounts of data tend to capture
one view of the data and its associated mapping. Different deep learning models
built on the same training data may capture different views of the data based
on the underlying techniques used. For explaining the decisions arrived by
blackbox deep learning models, we argue that it is essential to reproduce that
model's view of the training data faithfully. This faithful reproduction can
then be used for explanation generation. We investigate two methods for data
view extraction: hill-climbing approach and a GAN-driven approach. We then use
this synthesized data for creating shadow models for explanation generation:
Decision-Tree model and Formal Concept Analysis based model. We evaluate these
approaches on a Blackbox model trained on public datasets and show its
usefulness in explanation generation.

Title: An Experimental Study of Formula Embeddings for Automated Theorem
  Proving in First-Order Logic
Authors: Ibrahim Abdelaziz, Veronika Thost, Maxwell Crouse, Achille Fokoue
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  Automated theorem proving in first-order logic is an active research area
which is successfully supported by machine learning. While there have been
various proposals for encoding logical formulas into numerical vectors -- from
simple strings to much more involved graph-based embeddings --, little is known
about how these different encodings compare. In this paper, we study and
experimentally compare pattern-based embeddings that are applied in current
systems with popular graph-based encodings, most of which have not been
considered in the theorem proving context before. Our experiments show that
some graph-based encodings help finding much shorter proofs and may yield
better performance in terms of number of completed proofs. However, as
expected, a detailed analysis shows the trade-offs in terms of runtime.

Title: Uncertainty Weighted Causal Graphs
Authors: Eduardo C. Garrido-Merch\'an, C. Puente, A. Sobrino, J.A. Olivas
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Causality has traditionally been a scientific way to generate knowledge by
relating causes to effects. From an imaginery point of view, causal graphs are
a helpful tool for representing and infering new causal information. In
previous works, we have generated automatically causal graphs associated to a
given concept by analyzing sets of documents and extracting and representing
the found causal information in that visual way. The retrieved information
shows that causality is frequently imperfect rather than exact, feature
gathered by the graph. In this work we will attempt to go a step further
modelling the uncertainty in the graph through probabilistic improving the
management of the imprecision in the quoted graph.

Title: Integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning with Model-based Path Planners
  for Automated Driving
Authors: Ekim Yurtsever, Linda Capito, Keith Redmill, Umit Ozguner
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Automated driving in urban settings is challenging chiefly due to the
indeterministic nature of the human participants of the traffic. These
behaviors are difficult to model, and conventional, rule-based Automated
Driving Systems (ADSs) tend to fail when they face unmodeled dynamics. On the
other hand, the more recent, end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based
ADSs have shown promising results. However, pure learning-based approaches lack
the hard-coded safety measures of model-based methods. Here we propose a hybrid
approach that integrates a model-based path planner into a vision based DRL
framework to alleviate the shortcomings of both worlds. In summary, the DRL
agent learns to overrule the model-based planner's decisions if it predicts
that better future rewards can be obtained while doing so, e.g., avoiding an
accident. Otherwise, the DRL agent tends to follow the model-based planner as
close as possible. This logic is learned, i.e., no switching model is designed
here. The agent learns this by considering two penalties: the penalty of
straying away from the model-based path planner and the penalty of having a
collision. The latter has precedence over the former, i.e., the penalty is
greater. Therefore, after training, the agent learns to follow the model-based
planner when it is safe to do so, otherwise, it gets penalized. However, it
also learns to sacrifice positive rewards for following the model-based planner
to avoid a potential big negative penalty for making a collision in the future.
Experimental results show that the proposed method can plan its path and
navigate while avoiding obstacles between randomly chosen origin-destination
points in CARLA, a dynamic urban simulation environment. Our code is
open-source and available online.

Title: Fair Allocation Based Soft Load Shedding

Comments: Accepted to Intelligent Systems Conference (IntelliSys) 2020
\\
  Renewable sources are taking center stage in electricity generation. Due to
the intermittent nature of these renewable resources, the problem of the
demand-supply gap arises. To solve this problem, several techniques have been
proposed in the literature in terms of cost (adding peaker plants),
availability of data (Demand Side Management "DSM"), hardware infrastructure
(appliance controlling DSM) and safety (voltage reduction). However, these
solutions are not fair in terms of electricity distribution. In many cases,
although the available supply may not match the demand in peak hours, however,
the total aggregated demand remains less than the total supply for the whole
day. Load shedding (complete blackout) is a commonly used solution to deal with
the demand-supply gap, which can cause substantial economic losses. To solve
the demand-supply gap problem, we propose a solution called Soft Load Shedding
(SLS), which assigns electricity quota to each household in a fair way. We
measure the fairness of SLS by defining a function for household satisfaction
level. We model the household utilities by parametric function and formulate
the problem of SLS as a social welfare problem. We also consider revenue
generated from the fair allocation as a performance measure. To evaluate our
approach, extensive experiments have been performed on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, and our model is compared with several baselines to show
its effectiveness in terms of fair allocation and revenue generation.

Title: A Machine Consciousness architecture based on Deep Learning and Gaussian
  Processes
Authors: Eduardo C. Garrido Merch\'an, Mart\'in Molina
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Recent developments in machine learning have pushed the tasks that machines
can do outside the boundaries of what was thought to be possible years ago.
Methodologies such as deep learning or generative models have achieved complex
tasks such as generating art pictures or literature automatically. On the other
hand, symbolic resources have also been developed further and behave well in
problems such as the ones proposed by common sense reasoning. Machine
Consciousness is a field that has been deeply studied and several theories
based in the functionalism philosophical theory like the global workspace
theory or information integration have been proposed that try to explain the
ariseness of consciousness in machines. In this work, we propose an
architecture that may arise consciousness in a machine based in the global
workspace theory and in the assumption that consciousness appear in machines
that has cognitive processes and exhibit conscious behaviour. This architecture
is based in processes that use the recent developments in artificial
intelligence models which output are these correlated activities. For every one
of the modules of this architecture, we provide detailed explanations of the
models involved and how they communicate with each other to create the
cognitive architecture.

Title: Explain Graph Neural Networks to Understand Weighted Graph Features in
  Node Classification
Authors: Xiaoxiao Li and Joao Saude
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Real data collected from different applications that have additional
topological structures and connection information are amenable to be
represented as a weighted graph. Considering the node labeling problem, Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) is a powerful tool, which can mimic experts' decision on
node labeling. GNNs combine node features, connection patterns, and graph
structure by using a neural network to embed node information and pass it
through edges in the graph. We want to identify the patterns in the input data
used by the GNN model to make a decision and examine if the model works as we
desire. However, due to the complex data representation and non-linear
transformations, explaining decisions made by GNNs is challenging. In this
work, we propose new graph features' explanation methods to identify the
informative components and important node features. Besides, we propose a
pipeline to identify the key factors used for node classification. We use four
datasets (two synthetic and two real) to validate our methods. Our results
demonstrate that our explanation approach can mimic data patterns used for node
classification by human interpretation and disentangle different features in
the graphs. Furthermore, our explanation methods can be used for understanding
data, debugging GNN models, and examine model decisions.

Title: Linear predictor on linearly-generated data with missing values: non
  consistency and solutions

  We consider building predictors when the data have missing values. We study
the seemingly-simple case where the target to predict is a linear function of
the fully-observed data and we show that, in the presence of missing values,
the optimal predictor may not be linear. In the particular Gaussian case, it
can be written as a linear function of multiway interactions between the
observed data and the various missing-value indicators. Due to its intrinsic
complexity, we study a simple approximation and prove generalization bounds
with finite samples, highlighting regimes for which each method performs best.
We then show that multilayer perceptrons with ReLU activation functions can be
consistent, and can explore good trade-offs between the true model and
approximations. Our study highlights the interesting family of models that are
beneficial to fit with missing values depending on the amount of data
available.

\\
  Automated decision making based on big data and machine learning (ML)
algorithms can result in discriminatory decisions against certain protected
groups defined upon personal data like gender, race, sexual orientation etc.
Such algorithms designed to discover patterns in big data might not only pick
up any encoded societal biases in the training data, but even worse, they might
reinforce such biases resulting in more severe discrimination. The majority of
thus far proposed fairness-aware machine learning approaches focus solely on
the pre-, in- or post-processing steps of the machine learning process, that
is, input data, learning algorithms or derived models, respectively. However,
the fairness problem cannot be isolated to a single step of the ML process.
Rather, discrimination is often a result of complex interactions between big
data and algorithms, and therefore, a more holistic approach is required. The
proposed FAE (Fairness-Aware Ensemble) framework combines fairness-related
interventions at both pre- and postprocessing steps of the data analysis
process. In the preprocessing step, we tackle the problems of
under-representation of the protected group (group imbalance) and of
class-imbalance by generating balanced training samples. In the post-processing
step, we tackle the problem of class overlapping by shifting the decision
boundary in the direction of fairness.

Title: CryptoSPN: Privacy-preserving Sum-Product Network Inference
Authors: Amos Treiber and Alejandro Molina and Christian Weinert and Thomas

Comments: Accepted for publication at ECAI'20. Please cite the conference
  version of this paper
\\
  AI algorithms, and machine learning (ML) techniques in particular, are
increasingly important to individuals' lives, but have caused a range of
privacy concerns addressed by, e.g., the European GDPR. Using cryptographic
techniques, it is possible to perform inference tasks remotely on sensitive
client data in a privacy-preserving way: the server learns nothing about the
input data and the model predictions, while the client learns nothing about the
ML model (which is often considered intellectual property and might contain
traces of sensitive data). While such privacy-preserving solutions are
relatively efficient, they are mostly targeted at neural networks, can degrade
the predictive accuracy, and usually reveal the network's topology.
Furthermore, existing solutions are not readily accessible to ML experts, as
prototype implementations are not well-integrated into ML frameworks and
require extensive cryptographic knowledge.
  In this paper, we present CryptoSPN, a framework for privacy-preserving
inference of sum-product networks (SPNs). SPNs are a tractable probabilistic
graphical model that allows a range of exact inference queries in linear time.
Specifically, we show how to efficiently perform SPN inference via secure
multi-party computation (SMPC) without accuracy degradation while hiding
sensitive client and training information with provable security guarantees.
Next to foundations, CryptoSPN encompasses tools to easily transform existing
SPNs into privacy-preserving executables. Our empirical results demonstrate
that CryptoSPN achieves highly efficient and accurate inference in the order of
seconds for medium-sized SPNs.

Title: Optimizing Correlated Graspability Score and Grasp Regression for Better
  Grasp Prediction
Authors: Amaury Depierre (imagine), Emmanuel Dellandr\'ea (imagine), Liming
  Chen (imagine)
Categories: cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  Grasping objects is one of the most important abilities to master for a robot
in order to interact with its environment. Current state-of-the-art methods
rely on deep neural networks trained to predict a graspability score jointly
but separately from regression of an offset of grasp reference parameters,
although the predicted offset could decrease the graspability score. In this
paper, we extend a state-of-the-art neural network with a scorer which
evaluates the graspability of a given position and introduce a novel loss
function which correlates regression of grasp parameters with graspability
score. We show that this novel architecture improves the performance from
81.95% for a state-of-the-art grasp detection network to 85.74% on Jacquard
dataset. Because real-life applications generally feature scenes of multiple
objects laid on a variable decor, we also introduce Jacquard+, a test-only
extension of Jacquard dataset. Its role is to complete the traditional real
robot evaluation by benchmarking the adaptability of a learned grasp prediction
model on a different data distribution than the training one while remaining in
totally reproducible conditions. Using this novel benchmark and evaluated
through the Simulated Grasp Trial criterion, our proposed model outperforms a
state-of-the-art one by 7 points.

  This work proposes a fault injection methodology where Hardware Description
Language (HDL) code slicing is exploited to prune fault injection locations,
thus enabling more efficient campaigns for safety mechanisms evaluation. In
particular, the dynamic HDL slicing technique provides for a highly collapsed
critical fault list and allows avoiding injections at redundant locations or
time-steps. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology integrated
into commercial tool flow doubles the simulation speed when comparing to the
state-of-the-art industrial-grade EDA tool flows.

\\
  We provide a general technique to turn a conditional lower bound result based
on the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis (OVH) into one for the indexed version of
the same problem. This consists of two results that hold under OVH: (i) the
Orthogonal Vectors (OV) problem cannot be indexed in polynomial time to support
sub-quadratic time queries, and (ii) any problem to which OV reduces with a
natural property also cannot be indexed in polynomial time to support fast
queries. We demonstrate the power of this technique on the problem of exact
string matching on graphs, deriving the first, and tight, conditional lower
bound for its indexed version. The result has an interesting corollary for
automata theory: Unless OVH is false, there is no polynomial determinisation
algorithm of a finite automaton, even for an acyclic non-deterministic automata
whose only non-deterministic transitions are from the start state. For another
example of the use of the technique, we apply it to the reduction by Backurs
and Indyk (STOC 2015) on edit distance. This results into the first tight
conditional indexing lower bound for approximate string matching. This
strengthens the recent tailored reduction by Cohen-Addad, Feuilloley and
Starikovskaya (SODA 2019), but with a slightly different boundary condition.

Title: The Computational Complexity of Plethysm Coefficients
Authors: Nick Fischer and Christian Ikenmeyer
Categories: cs.CC math.RT
MSC-class: 68Q17, 05E10
ACM-class: F.1.3
\\
  In two papers, B\"urgisser and Ikenmeyer (STOC 2011, STOC 2013) used an
adaption of the geometric complexity theory (GCT) approach by Mulmuley and
Sohoni (Siam J Comput 2001, 2008) to prove lower bounds on the border rank of
the matrix multiplication tensor. A key ingredient was information about
certain Kronecker coefficients. While tensors are an interesting test bed for
GCT ideas, the far-away goal is the separation of algebraic complexity classes.
The role of the Kronecker coefficients in that setting is taken by the
so-called plethysm coefficients: These are the multiplicities in the coordinate
rings of spaces of polynomials. Even though several hardness results for
Kronecker coefficients are known, there are almost no results about the
complexity of computing the plethysm coefficients or even deciding their
positivity.
  In this paper we show that deciding positivity of plethysm coefficients is
NP-hard, and that computing plethysm coefficients is #P-hard. In fact, both
problems remain hard even if the inner parameter of the plethysm coefficient is
fixed. In this way we obtain an inner versus outer contrast: If the outer
parameter of the plethysm coefficient is fixed, then the plethysm coefficient
can be computed in polynomial time.
  Moreover, we derive new lower and upper bounds and in special cases even
combinatorial descriptions for plethysm coefficients, which we consider to be
of independent interest. Our technique uses discrete tomography in a more
refined way than the recent work on Kronecker coefficients by Ikenmeyer,
Mulmuley, and Walter (Comput Compl 2017). This makes our work the first to
apply techniques from discrete tomography to the study of plethysm
coefficients. Quite surprisingly, that interpretation also leads to new
equalities between certain plethysm coefficients and Kronecker coefficients.

Title: Machine learning in quantum computers via general Boltzmann Machines:
  Generative and Discriminative training through annealing
Authors: Siddhartha Srivastava, Veera Sundararaghavan
Categories: cs.CE math.PR
\\
  We present a Hybrid-Quantum-classical method for learning Boltzmann machines
(BM) for generative and discriminative tasks. Boltzmann machines are undirected
graphs that form the building block of many learning architectures such as
Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM's) and Deep Boltzmann machines (DBM's). They
have a network of visible and hidden nodes where the former are used as the
reading sites while the latter are used to manipulate the probability of the
visible states. BM's are versatile machines that can be used for both learning
distributions as a generative task as well as for performing classification or
function approximation as a discriminative task. We show that minimizing
KL-divergence works best for training BM for applications of function
approximation. In our approach, we use Quantum annealers for sampling Boltzmann
states. These states are used to approximate gradients in a stochastic gradient
descent scheme. The approach is used to demonstrate logic circuits in the
discriminative sense and a specialized two-phase distribution using generative
BM.

Title: Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction Across Writing Systems
Authors: Parker Riley and Daniel Gildea
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Recent embedding-based methods in unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction
have shown good results, but generally have not leveraged orthographic
(spelling) information, which can be helpful for pairs of related languages.
This work augments a state-of-the-art method with orthographic features, and
extends prior work in this space by proposing methods that can learn and
utilize orthographic correspondences even between languages with different
scripts. We demonstrate this by experimenting on three language pairs with
different scripts and varying degrees of lexical similarity.

Title: Improving Domain-Adapted Sentiment Classification by Deep Adversarial
  Mutual Learning
Authors: Qianming Xue, Wei Zhang, Hongyuan Zha
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to appear in AAAI'20
\\
  Domain-adapted sentiment classification refers to training on a labeled
source domain to well infer document-level sentiment on an unlabeled target
domain. Most existing relevant models involve a feature extractor and a
sentiment classifier, where the feature extractor works towards learning
domain-invariant features from both domains, and the sentiment classifier is
trained only on the source domain to guide the feature extractor. As such, they
lack a mechanism to use sentiment polarity lying in the target domain. To
improve domain-adapted sentiment classification by learning sentiment from the
target domain as well, we devise a novel deep adversarial mutual learning
approach involving two groups of feature extractors, domain discriminators,
sentiment classifiers, and label probers. The domain discriminators enable the
feature extractors to obtain domain-invariant features. Meanwhile, the label
prober in each group explores document sentiment polarity of the target domain
through the sentiment prediction generated by the classifier in the peer group,
and guides the learning of the feature extractor in its own group. The proposed
approach achieves the mutual learning of the two groups in an end-to-end
manner. Experiments on multiple public datasets indicate our method obtains the
state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of mutual learning
through label probers.

Comments: Accepted by AAAI2020 DSTC8 workshop. Ranked 1st in DSTC8-AVSD track
\\
  Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialog (AVSD) is a task to generate responses when
chatting about a given video, which is organized as a track of the 8th Dialog
System Technology Challenge (DSTC8). To solve the task, we propose a universal
multimodal transformer and introduce the multi-task learning method to learn
joint representations among different modalities as well as generate
informative and fluent responses. Our method extends the natural language
generation pre-trained model to multimodal dialogue generation task. Our system
achieves the best performance in both objective and subjective evaluations in
the challenge.

Title: Novel Language Resources for Hindi: An Aesthetics Text Corpus and a
  Comprehensive Stop Lemma List
Authors: Gayatri Venugopal-Wairagade, Jatinderkumar R. Saini, Dhanya Pramod
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures
\\
  This paper is an effort to complement the contributions made by researchers
working toward the inclusion of non-English languages in natural language
processing studies. Two novel Hindi language resources have been created and
released for public consumption. The first resource is a corpus consisting of
nearly thousand pre-processed fictional and nonfictional texts spanning over
hundred years. The second resource is an exhaustive list of stop lemmas created
from 12 corpora across multiple domains, consisting of over 13 million words,
from which more than 200,000 lemmas were generated, and 11 publicly available
stop word lists comprising over 1000 words, from which nearly 400 unique lemmas
were generated. This research lays emphasis on the use of stop lemmas instead
of stop words owing to the presence of various, but not all morphological forms
of a word in stop word lists, as opposed to the presence of only the root form
of the word, from which variations could be derived if required. It was also
observed that stop lemmas were more consistent across multiple sources as
compared to stop words. In order to generate a stop lemma list, the parts of
speech of the lemmas were investigated but rejected as it was found that there
was no significant correlation between the rank of a word in the frequency list
and its part of speech. The stop lemma list was assessed using a comparative
method. A formal evaluation method is suggested as future work arising from
this study.

\\
  Image Captioning, the task of automatic generation of image captions, has
attracted attentions from researchers in many fields of computer science, being
computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning in recent
years. This paper contributes to research on Image Captioning task in terms of
extending dataset to a different language - Vietnamese. So far, there is no
existed Image Captioning dataset for Vietnamese language, so this is the
foremost fundamental step for developing Vietnamese Image Captioning. In this
scope, we first build a dataset which contains manually written captions for
images from Microsoft COCO dataset relating to sports played with balls, we
called this dataset UIT-ViIC. UIT-ViIC consists of 19,250 Vietnamese captions
for 3,850 images. Following that, we evaluate our dataset on deep neural
network models and do comparisons with English dataset and two Vietnamese
datasets built by different methods. UIT-ViIC is published on our lab website
for research purposes.

Title: Fine-Tuning BERT for Schema-Guided Zero-Shot Dialogue State Tracking
Authors: Yu-Ping Ruan, Zhen-Hua Ling, Jia-Chen Gu, Quan Liu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Present on the DSTC8 Workshop @ AAAI-2020
\\
  We present our work on Track 4 in the Dialogue System Technology Challenges 8
(DSTC8). The DSTC8-Track 4 aims to perform dialogue state tracking (DST) under
the zero-shot settings, in which the model needs to generalize on unseen
service APIs given a schema definition of these target APIs. Serving as the
core for many virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, the
DST keeps track of the user's goal and what happened in the dialogue history,
mainly including intent prediction, slot filling, and user state tracking,
which tests models' ability of natural language understanding. Recently, the
pretrained language models have achieved state-of-the-art results and shown
impressive generalization ability on various NLP tasks, which provide a
promising way to perform zero-shot learning for language understanding. Based
on this, we propose a schema-guided paradigm for zero-shot dialogue state
tracking (SGP-DST) by fine-tuning BERT, one of the most popular pretrained
language models. The SGP-DST system contains four modules for intent
prediction, slot prediction, slot transfer prediction, and user state
summarizing respectively. According to the official evaluation results, our
SGP-DST (team12) ranked 3rd on the joint goal accuracy (primary evaluation
metric for ranking submissions) and 1st on the requsted slots F1 among 25
participant teams.

Title: Transforming Spectrum and Prosody for Emotional Voice Conversion with
  Non-Parallel Training Data
Authors: Kun Zhou, Berrak Sisman, Haizhou Li
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Submitted to Speaker Odyssey 2020
\\
  Emotional voice conversion is to convert the spectrum and prosody to change
the emotional patterns of speech, while preserving the speaker identity and
linguistic content. Many studies require parallel speech data between different
emotional patterns, which is not practical in real life. Moreover, they often
model the conversion of fundamental frequency (F0) with a simple linear
transform. As F0 is a key aspect of intonation that is hierarchical in nature,
we believe that it is more adequate to model F0 in different temporal scales by
using wavelet transform. We propose a CycleGAN network to find an optimal
pseudo pair from non-parallel training data by learning forward and inverse
mappings simultaneously using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. We also
study the use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to decompose F0 into ten
temporal scales, that describes speech prosody at different time resolution,
for effective F0 conversion. Experimental results show that our proposed
framework outperforms the baselines both in objective and subjective
evaluations.

Title: Deep segmental phonetic posterior-grams based discovery of
  non-categories in L2 English speech
Authors: Xu Li, Xixin Wu, Xunying Liu, Helen Meng
Categories: cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  Second language (L2) speech is often labeled with the native, phone
categories. However, in many cases, it is difficult to decide on a categorical
phone that an L2 segment belongs to. These segments are regarded as
non-categories. Most existing approaches for Mispronunciation Detection and
Diagnosis (MDD) are only concerned with categorical errors, i.e. a phone
category is inserted, deleted or substituted by another. However,
non-categorical errors are not considered. To model these non-categorical
errors, this work aims at exploring non-categorical patterns to extend the
categorical phone set. We apply a phonetic segment classifier to generate
segmental phonetic posterior-grams (SPPGs) to represent phone segment-level
information. And then we explore the non-categories by looking for the SPPGs
with more than one peak. Compared with the baseline system, this approach
explores more non-categorical patterns, and also perceptual experimental
results show that the explored non-categories are more accurate with increased
confusion degree by 7.3% and 7.5% under two different measures. Finally, we
preliminarily analyze the reason behind those non-categories.

Title: Beat the AI: Investigating Adversarial Human Annotations for Reading
  Comprehension
Authors: Max Bartolo, Alastair Roberts, Johannes Welbl, Sebastian Riedel,
  Pontus Stenetorp
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 21 pages including appendices
\\
  Innovations in annotation methodology have been a propellant for Reading
Comprehension (RC) datasets and models. One recent trend to challenge current
RC models is to involve a model in the annotation process: humans create
questions adversarially, such that the model fails to answer them correctly. In
this work we investigate this annotation approach and apply it in three
different settings, collecting a total of 36,000 samples with progressively
stronger models in the annotation loop. This allows us to explore questions
such as the reproducibility of the adversarial effect, transfer from data
collected with varying model-in-the-loop strengths, and generalisation to data
collected without a model. We find that training on adversarially collected
samples leads to strong generalisation to non-adversarially collected datasets,
yet with progressive deterioration as the model-in-the-loop strength increases.
Furthermore we find that stronger models can still learn from datasets
collected with substantially weaker models in the loop: When trained on data
collected with a BiDAF model in the loop, RoBERTa achieves 36.0F1 on questions
that it cannot answer when trained on SQuAD - only marginally lower than when
trained on data collected using RoBERTa itself.

\\
  We introduce the task of citation text generation: given a pair of scientific
documents, explain their relationship in natural language text in the manner of
a citation from one text to the other. This task encourages systems to learn
rich relationships between scientific texts and to express them concretely in
natural language. Models for citation text generation will require robust
document understanding including the capacity to quickly adapt to new
vocabulary and to reason about document content. We believe this challenging
direction of research will benefit high-impact applications such as automatic
literature review or scientific writing assistance systems. In this paper we
establish the task of citation text generation with a standard evaluation
corpus and explore several baseline models.

  Human knowledge provides a formal understanding of the world. Knowledge
graphs that represent structural relations between entities have become an
increasingly popular research direction towards cognition and human-level
intelligence. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review on knowledge
graph covering overall research topics about 1) knowledge graph representation
learning, 2) knowledge acquisition and completion, 3) temporal knowledge graph,
and 4) knowledge-aware applications, and summarize recent breakthroughs and
perspective directions to facilitate future research. We propose a full-view
categorization and new taxonomies on these topics. Knowledge graph embedding is
organized from four aspects of representation space, scoring function, encoding
models and auxiliary information. For knowledge acquisition, especially
knowledge graph completion, embedding methods, path inference and logical rule
reasoning are reviewed. We further explore several emerging topics including
meta relational learning, commonsense reasoning, and temporal knowledge graphs.
To facilitate future research on knowledge graphs, we also provide a curated
collection of datasets and open-source libraries on different tasks. In the
end, we have a thorough outlook on several promising research directions.

Title: WaveTTS: Tacotron-based TTS with Joint Time-Frequency Domain Loss
Authors: Rui Liu, Berrak Sisman, Feilong Bao, Guanglai Gao, Haizhou Li
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: submitted to Odyssey 2020, Tokyo, Japan
\\
  Tacotron-based text-to-speech (TTS) systems directly synthesize speech from
text input. Such frameworks typically consist of a feature prediction network
that maps character sequences to frequency-domain acoustic features, followed
by a waveform reconstruction algorithm or a neural vocoder that generates the
time-domain waveform from acoustic features. As the loss function is usually
calculated only for frequency-domain acoustic features, that doesn't directly
control the quality of the generated time-domain waveform. To address this
problem, we propose a new training scheme for Tacotron-based TTS, referred to
as WaveTTS, that has 2 loss functions: 1) time-domain loss, denoted as the
waveform loss, that measures the distortion between the natural and generated
waveform; and 2) frequency-domain loss, that measures the Mel-scale acoustic
feature loss between the natural and generated acoustic features. WaveTTS
ensures both the quality of the acoustic features and the resulting speech
waveform. To our best knowledge, this is the first implementation of Tacotron
with joint time-frequency domain loss. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework outperforms the baselines and achieves high-quality
synthesized speech.

\\
  Phylogenetic methods have broad potential in linguistics beyond tree
inference. Here, we show how a phylogenetic approach opens the possibility of
gaining historical insights from entirely new kinds of linguistic data--in this
instance, statistical phonotactics. We extract phonotactic data from 128
Pama-Nyungan vocabularies and apply tests for phylogenetic signal, quantifying
the degree to which the data reflect phylogenetic history. We test three
datasets: (1) binary variables recording the presence or absence of biphones
(two-segment sequences) in a lexicon (2) frequencies of transitions between
segments, and (3) frequencies of transitions between natural sound classes.
Australian languages have been characterised as having a high degree of
phonotactic homogeneity. Nevertheless, we detect phylogenetic signal in all
datasets. Phylogenetic signal is higher in finer-grained frequency data than in
binary data, and highest in natural-class-based data. These results demonstrate
the viability of employing a new source of readily extractable data in
historical and comparative linguistics.

Title: End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition Integrated With CTC-Based Voice
  Activity Detection
Authors: Takenori Yoshimura, Tomoki Hayashi, Kazuya Takeda and Shinji Watanabe
Categories: cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: Submitted to ICASSP 2020
\\
  This paper integrates a voice activity detection (VAD) function with
end-to-end automatic speech recognition toward an online speech interface and
transcribing very long audio recordings. We focus on connectionist temporal
classification (CTC) and its extension of CTC/attention architectures. As
opposed to an attention-based architecture, input-synchronous label prediction
can be performed based on a greedy search with the CTC (pre-)softmax output.
This prediction includes consecutive long blank labels, which can be regarded
as a non-speech region. We use the labels as a cue for detecting speech
segments with simple thresholding. The threshold value is directly related to
the length of a non-speech region, which is more intuitive and easier to
control than conventional VAD hyperparameters. Experimental results on
unsegmented data show that the proposed method outperformed the baseline
methods using the conventional energy-based and neural-network-based VAD
methods and achieved an RTF less than 0.2. The proposed method is publicly
available.

Title: Bertrand-DR: Improving Text-to-SQL using a Discriminative Re-ranker
Authors: Amol Kelkar, Rohan Relan, Vaishali Bhardwaj, Saurabh Vaichal, Peter

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  To access data stored in relational databases, users need to understand the
database schema and write a query using a query language such as SQL. To
simplify this task, text-to-SQL models attempt to translate a user's natural
language question to corresponding SQL query. Recently, several generative
text-to-SQL models have been developed. We propose a novel discriminative
re-ranker to improve the performance of generative text-to-SQL models by
extracting the best SQL query from the beam output predicted by the text-to-SQL
generator, resulting in improved performance in the cases where the best query
was in the candidate list, but not at the top of the list. We build the
re-ranker as a schema agnostic BERT fine-tuned classifier. We analyze relative
strengths of the text-to-SQL and re-ranker models across different query
hardness levels, and suggest how to combine the two models for optimal

\\
  In text generation evaluation, many practical issues, such as inconsistent
experimental settings and metric implementations, are often ignored but lead to
unfair evaluation and untenable conclusions. We present CoTK, an open-source
toolkit aiming to support fast development and fair evaluation of text
generation. In model development, CoTK helps handle the cumbersome issues, such
as data processing, metric implementation, and reproduction. It standardizes
the development steps and reduces human errors which may lead to inconsistent
experimental settings. In model evaluation, CoTK provides implementation for
many commonly used metrics and benchmark models across different experimental
settings. As a unique feature, CoTK can signify when and which metric cannot be
fairly compared. We demonstrate that it is convenient to use CoTK for model
development and evaluation, particularly across different experimental
settings.

Title: How Far are We from Effective Context Modeling ? An Exploratory Study on
  Semantic Parsing in Context
Authors: Qian Liu, Bei Chen, Jiaqi Guo, Jian-Guang Lou, Bin Zhou, Dongmei Zhang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: 7 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Recently semantic parsing in context has received a considerable attention,
which is challenging since there are complex contextual phenomena. Previous
works verified their proposed methods in limited scenarios, which motivates us
to conduct an exploratory study on context modeling methods under real-world
semantic parsing in context. We present a grammar-based decoding semantic
parser and adapt typical context modeling methods on top of it. We evaluate 13
context modeling methods on two large complex cross-domain datasets, and our
best model achieves state-of-the-art performances on both datasets with
significant improvements. Furthermore, we summarize the most frequent
contextual phenomena, with a fine-grained analysis on representative models,
which may shed light on potential research directions.

Title: Introduction of Quantification in Frame Semantics

\\
  Feature Structures (FSs) are a widespread tool used for decompositional
frameworks of Attribute-Value associations. Even though they thrive in simple
systems, they lack a way of representing higher-order entities and relations.
This is however needed in Frame Semantics, where semantic dependencies should
be able to connect groups of individuals and their properties, especially to
model quantification. To answer this issue, this master report introduces
wrappings as a way to envelop a sub-FS and treat it as a node. Following the
work of [Kallmeyer, Osswald 2013], we extend its syntax, semantics and some
properties (translation to FOL, subsumption, unification). We can then expand
the proposed pipeline. Lexical minimal model sets are generated from formulas.
They unify by FS value equations obtained by LTAG parsing to an underspecified
sentence representation. The syntactic approach of quantifiers allows us to use
existing methods to produce any possible reading. Finally, we give a
transcription to type-logical formulas to interact with the context in the view
of dynamic semantics. Supported by ideas of Frame Types, this system provides a
workable and tractable tool for higher-order relations with FS.

Title: Traduction des Grammaires Cat\'egorielles de Lambek dans les Grammaires

\\
  Lambek Grammars (LG) are a computational modelling of natural language, based
on non-commutative compositional types. It has been widely studied, especially
for languages where the syntax plays a major role (like English). The goal of
this internship report is to demonstrate that every Lambek Grammar can be, not
entirely but efficiently, expressed in Abstract Categorial Grammars (ACG). The
latter is a novel modelling based on higher-order signature homomorphisms
(using $\lambda$-calculus), aiming at uniting the currently used models. The
main idea is to transform the type rewriting system of LGs into that of
Context-Free Grammars (CFG) by erasing introduction and elimination rules and
generating enough axioms so that the cut rule suffices. This iterative approach
preserves the derivations and enables us to stop the possible infinite
generative process at any step. Although the underlying algorithm was not fully
implemented, this proof provides another argument in favour of the relevance of
ACGs in Natural Language Processing.

Title: Reducing Noise from Competing Neighbours: Word Retrieval with Lateral
  Inhibition in Multilink
Authors: Aaron van Geffen
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Multilink is a computational model for word retrieval in monolingual and
multilingual individuals under different task circumstances (Dijkstra et al.,
2018). In the present study, we added lateral inhibition to Multilink's lexical
network. Parameters were fit on the basis of reaction times from the English,
British, and Dutch Lexicon Projects. We found a maximum correlation of 0.643
(N=1,205) on these data sets as a whole. Furthermore, the simulations
themselves became faster as a result of adding lateral inhibition. We tested
the fitted model to stimuli from a neighbourhood study (Mulder et al., 2018).
Lateral inhibition was found to improve Multilink's correlations for this
study, yielding an overall correlation of 0.67. Next, we explored the role of
lateral inhibition as part of the model's task/decision system by running
simulations on data from two studies concerning interlingual homographs
(Vanlangendonck et al., in press; Goertz, 2018). We found that, while lateral
inhibition plays a substantial part in the word selection process, this alone
is not enough to result in a correct response selection. To solve this problem,
we added a new task component to Multilink, especially designed to account for
the translation process of interlingual homographs, cognates, and
language-specific control words. The subsequent simulation results showed
patterns remarkably similar to those in the Goertz study. The isomorphicity of
the simulated data to the empirical data was further attested by an overall
correlation of 0.538 (N=254) between reaction times and simulated model cycle
times, as well as a condition pattern correlation of 0.853 (N=8). We conclude
that Multilink yields an excellent fit to empirical data, particularly when a
task-specific setting of the inhibition parameters is allowed.

Title: Generation-Distillation for Efficient Natural Language Understanding in
  Low-Data Settings
Authors: Luke Melas-Kyriazi, George Han, Celine Liang
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: EMNLP 2019 Workshop on Deep Learning for Low-resource NLP
\\
  Over the past year, the emergence of transfer learning with large-scale
language models (LM) has led to dramatic performance improvements across a
broad range of natural language understanding tasks. However, the size and
memory footprint of these large LMs makes them difficult to deploy in many
scenarios (e.g. on mobile phones). Recent research points to knowledge
distillation as a potential solution, showing that when training data for a
given task is abundant, it is possible to distill a large (teacher) LM into a
small task-specific (student) network with minimal loss of performance.
However, when such data is scarce, there remains a significant performance gap
between large pretrained LMs and smaller task-specific models, even when
training via distillation. In this paper, we bridge this gap with a novel
training approach, called generation-distillation, that leverages large
finetuned LMs in two ways: (1) to generate new (unlabeled) training examples,
and (2) to distill their knowledge into a small network using these examples.
Across three low-resource text classification datsets, we achieve comparable
performance to BERT while using 300x fewer parameters, and we outperform prior
approaches to distillation for text classification while using 3x fewer
parameters.

  The quantitative evaluation of quotations in the Russian Wiktionary was
performed using the developed Wiktionary parser. It was found that the number
of quotations in the dictionary is growing fast (51.5 thousands in 2011, 62
thousands in 2012). These quotations were extracted and saved in the relational
database of a machine-readable dictionary. For this database, tables related to
the quotations were designed. A histogram of distribution of quotations of
literary works written in different years was built. It was made an attempt to
explain the characteristics of the histogram by associating it with the years
of the most popular and cited (in the Russian Wiktionary) writers of the
nineteenth century. It was found that more than one-third of all the quotations
(the example sentences) contained in the Russian Wiktionary are taken by the
editors of a Wiktionary entry from the Russian National Corpus.

Title: Self-attention-based BiGRU and capsule network for named entity
  recognition
Authors: Jianfeng Deng and Lianglun Cheng and Zhuowei Wang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Named entity recognition(NER) is one of the tasks of natural language
processing(NLP). In view of the problem that the traditional character
representation ability is weak and the neural network method is unable to
capture the important sequence information. An self-attention-based
bidirectional gated recurrent unit(BiGRU) and capsule network(CapsNet) for NER
is proposed. This model generates character vectors through bidirectional
encoder representation of transformers(BERT) pre-trained model. BiGRU is used
to capture sequence context features, and self-attention mechanism is proposed
to give different focus on the information captured by hidden layer of BiGRU.
Finally, we propose to use CapsNet for entity recognition. We evaluated the
recognition performance of the model on two datasets. Experimental results show
that the model has better performance without relying on external dictionary
information.

  With the recent success and popularity of pre-trained language models (LMs)
in natural language processing, there has been a rise in efforts to understand
their inner workings. In line with such interest, we propose a novel method
that assists us in investigating the extent to which pre-trained LMs capture
the syntactic notion of constituency. Our method provides an effective way of
extracting constituency trees from the pre-trained LMs without training. In
addition, we report intriguing findings in the induced trees, including the
fact that pre-trained LMs outperform other approaches in correctly demarcating
adverb phrases in sentences.

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: to be published in IEEE ICSC 2020 proceedings
\\
  The dearth of clean textual data often acts as a bottleneck in several
natural language processing applications. The data available often lacks proper
case (uppercase or lowercase) information. This often comes up when text is
obtained from social media, messaging applications and other online platforms.
This paper attempts to solve this problem by restoring the correct case of
characters, commonly known as Truecasing. Doing so improves the accuracy of
several processing tasks further down in the NLP pipeline. Our proposed
architecture uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN),
bi-directional long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and conditional random
fields (CRF), which work at a character level without any explicit feature
engineering. In this study we compare our approach to previous statistical and
deep learning based approaches. Our method shows an increment of 0.83 in F1
score over the current state of the art. Since truecasing acts as a
preprocessing step in several applications, every increment in the F1 score
leads to a significant improvement in the language processing tasks.

Title: Unsupervised Multilingual Alignment using Wasserstein Barycenter

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Work in progress; comments welcome!
\\
  We study unsupervised multilingual alignment, the problem of finding
word-to-word translations between multiple languages without using any parallel
data. One popular strategy is to reduce multilingual alignment to the much
simplified bilingual setting, by picking one of the input languages as the
pivot language that we transit through. However, it is well-known that
transiting through a poorly chosen pivot language (such as English) may
severely degrade the translation quality, since the assumed transitive
relations among all pairs of languages may not be enforced in the training
process. Instead of going through a rather arbitrarily chosen pivot language,
we propose to use the Wasserstein barycenter as a more informative ''mean''
language: it encapsulates information from all languages and minimizes all
pairwise transportation costs. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks
and demonstrate state-of-the-art performances.

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Pre-trained models such as BERT are widely used in NLP tasks and are
fine-tuned to improve the performance of various NLP tasks consistently.
Nevertheless, the fine-tuned BERT model trained on our protocol corpus still
has a weak performance on the Entity Linking (EL) task. In this paper, we
propose a model that joints a fine-tuned language model with an RFC Domain
Model. Firstly, we design a Protocol Knowledge Base as the guideline for
protocol EL. Secondly, we propose a novel model, PEL-BERT, to link named
entities in protocols to categories in Protocol Knowledge Base. Finally, we
conduct a comprehensive study on the performance of pre-trained language models
on descriptive texts and abstract concepts. Experimental results demonstrate
that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in EL on our annotated
dataset, outperforming all the baselines.

Title: Structural-Aware Sentence Similarity with Recursive Optimal Transport
Authors: Zihao Wang, Yong Zhang, Hao Wu
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Measuring sentence similarity is a classic topic in natural language
processing. Light-weighted similarities are still of particular practical
significance even when deep learning models have succeeded in many other tasks.
Some light-weighted similarities with more theoretical insights have been
demonstrated to be even stronger than supervised deep learning approaches.
However, the successful light-weighted models such as Word Mover's Distance
[Kusner et al., 2015] or Smooth Inverse Frequency [Arora et al., 2017] failed
to detect the difference from the structure of sentences, i.e. order of words.
To address this issue, we present Recursive Optimal Transport (ROT) framework
to incorporate the structural information with the classic OT. Moreover, we
further develop Recursive Optimal Similarity (ROTS) for sentences with the
valuable semantic insights from the connections between cosine similarity of
weighted average of word vectors and optimal transport. ROTS is
structural-aware and with low time complexity compared to optimal transport.
Our experiments over 20 sentence textural similarity (STS) datasets show the
clear advantage of ROTS over all weakly supervised approaches. Detailed
ablation study demonstrate the effectiveness of ROT and the semantic insights.

  The role of conversational assistants has become more prevalent in helping
people increase their productivity. Document-centered assistance, for example
to help an individual quickly review a document, has seen less significant
progress, even though it has the potential to tremendously increase a user's
productivity. This type of document-centered assistance is the focus of this
paper. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We first present a survey to
understand the space of document-centered assistance and the capabilities
people expect in this scenario. (2) We investigate the types of queries that
users will pose while seeking assistance with documents, and show that
document-centered questions form the majority of these queries. (3) We present
a set of initial machine learned models that show that (a) we can accurately
detect document-centered questions, and (b) we can build reasonably accurate
models for answering such questions. These positive results are encouraging,
and suggest that even greater results may be attained with continued study of
this interesting and novel problem space. Our findings have implications for
the design of intelligent systems to support task completion via natural
interactions with documents.

\\
  The ability to ask questions is important in both human and machine
intelligence. Learning to ask questions helps knowledge acquisition, improves
question-answering and machine reading comprehension tasks, and helps a chatbot
to keep the conversation flowing with a human. Existing question generation
models are ineffective at generating a large amount of high-quality
question-answer pairs from unstructured text, since given an answer and an
input passage, question generation is inherently a one-to-many mapping. In this
paper, we propose Answer-Clue-Style-aware Question Generation (ACS-QG), which
aims at automatically generating high-quality and diverse question-answer pairs
from unlabeled text corpus at scale by imitating the way a human asks
questions. Our system consists of: i) an information extractor, which samples
from the text multiple types of assistive information to guide question
generation; ii) neural question generators, which generate diverse and
controllable questions, leveraging the extracted assistive information; and
iii) a neural quality controller, which removes low-quality generated data
based on text entailment. We compare our question generation models with
existing approaches and resort to voluntary human evaluation to assess the
quality of the generated question-answer pairs. The evaluation results suggest
that our system dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art neural question
generation models in terms of the generation quality, while being scalable in
the meantime. With models trained on a relatively smaller amount of data, we
can generate 2.8 million quality-assured question-answer pairs from a million
sentences found in Wikipedia.

  The quality of automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical to Dialogue
Systems as ASR errors propagate to and directly impact downstream tasks such as
language understanding (LU). In this paper, we propose multi-task neural
approaches to perform contextual language correction on ASR outputs jointly
with LU to improve the performance of both tasks simultaneously. To measure the
effectiveness of this approach we used a public benchmark, the 2nd Dialogue
State Tracking (DSTC2) corpus. As a baseline approach, we trained task-specific
Statistical Language Models (SLM) and fine-tuned state-of-the-art Generalized
Pre-training (GPT) Language Model to re-rank the n-best ASR hypotheses,
followed by a model to identify the dialog act and slots. i) We further trained
ranker models using GPT and Hierarchical CNN-RNN models with discriminatory
losses to detect the best output given n-best hypotheses. We extended these
ranker models to first select the best ASR output and then identify the
dialogue act and slots in an end to end fashion. ii) We also proposed a novel
joint ASR error correction and LU model, a word confusion pointer network
(WCN-Ptr) with multi-head self-attention on top, which consumes the word
confusions populated from the n-best. We show that the error rates of off the
shelf ASR and following LU systems can be reduced significantly by 14% relative
with joint models trained using small amounts of in-domain data.

Title: Benchmarking Popular Classification Models' Robustness to Random and

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Text classification models, especially neural networks based models, have
reached very high accuracy on many popular benchmark datasets. Yet, such models
when deployed in real world applications, tend to perform badly. The primary
reason is that these models are not tested against sufficient real world
natural data. Based on the application users, the vocabulary and the style of
the model's input may greatly vary. This emphasizes the need for a model
agnostic test dataset, which consists of various corruptions that are natural
to appear in the wild. Models trained and tested on such benchmark datasets,
will be more robust against real world data. However, such data sets are not
easily available. In this work, we address this problem, by extending the
benchmark datasets along naturally occurring corruptions such as Spelling
Errors, Text Noise and Synonyms and making them publicly available. Through
extensive experiments, we compare random and targeted corruption strategies
using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations(LIME). We report the
vulnerabilities in two popular text classification models along these
corruptions and also find that targeted corruptions can expose vulnerabilities
of a model better than random choices in most cases.

\\
  Hate-speech detection on social network language has become one of the main
researching fields recently due to the spreading of social networks like
Facebook and Twitter. In Vietnam, the threat of offensive and harassment cause
bad impacts for online user. The VLSP - Shared task about Hate Speech Detection
on social networks showed many proposed approaches for detecting whatever
comment is clean or not. However, this problem still needs further researching.
Consequently, we compare traditional machine learning and deep learning on a
large dataset about the user's comments on social network in Vietnamese and
find out what is the advantage and disadvantage of each model by comparing
their accuracy on F1-score, then we pick two models in which has highest
accuracy in traditional machine learning models and deep neural models
respectively. Next, we compare these two models capable of predicting the right
label by referencing their confusion matrices and considering the advantages
and disadvantages of each model. Finally, from the comparison result, we
propose our ensemble method that concentrates the abilities of traditional
methods and deep learning methods.

Title: FastWordBug: A Fast Method To Generate Adversarial Text Against NLP
  Applications
Authors: Dou Goodman and Lv Zhonghou and Wang minghua
Categories: cs.CL cs.CR
\\
  In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, FastWordBug, to efficiently
generate small text perturbations in a black-box setting that forces a
sentiment analysis or text classification mode to make an incorrect prediction.
By combining the part of speech attributes of words, we propose a scoring
method that can quickly identify important words that affect text
classification. We evaluate FastWordBug on three real-world text datasets and
two state-of-the-art machine learning models under black-box setting. The
results show that our method can significantly reduce the accuracy of the
model, and at the same time, we can call the model as little as possible, with
the highest attack efficiency. We also attack two popular real-world cloud
services of NLP, and the results show that our method works as well.

Title: Massively Multilingual Document Alignment with Cross-lingual
  Sentence-Mover's Distance
Authors: Ahmed El-Kishky, Francisco Guzm\'an
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Cross-lingual document alignment aims to identify pairs of documents in two
distinct languages that are of comparable content or translations of each
other. Such aligned data can be used for a variety of NLP tasks from training
cross-lingual representations to mining parallel bitexts for machine
translation training. In this paper we develop an unsupervised scoring function
that leverages cross-lingual sentence embeddings to compute the semantic
distance between documents in different languages. These semantic distances are
then used to guide a document alignment algorithm to properly pair
cross-lingual web documents across a variety of low, mid, and high-resource
language pairs. Recognizing that our proposed scoring function and other state
of the art methods are computationally intractable for long web documents, we
utilize a more tractable greedy algorithm that performs comparably. We
experimentally demonstrate that our distance metric performs better alignment
than current baselines outperforming them by 7% on high-resource language
pairs, 15% on mid-resource language pairs, and 22% on low-resource language
pairs

Title: Two-path Deep Semi-supervised Learning for Timely Fake News Detection
Authors: Xishuang Dong, Uboho Victor, and Lijun Qian
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG cs.SI
\\
  News in social media such as Twitter has been generated in high volume and
speed. However, very few of them are labeled (as fake or true news) by
professionals in near real time. In order to achieve timely detection of fake
news in social media, a novel framework of two-path deep semi-supervised
learning is proposed where one path is for supervised learning and the other is
for unsupervised learning. The supervised learning path learns on the limited
amount of labeled data while the unsupervised learning path is able to learn on
a huge amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, these two paths implemented with
convolutional neural networks (CNN) are jointly optimized to complete
semi-supervised learning. In addition, we build a shared CNN to extract the low
level features on both labeled data and unlabeled data to feed them into these
two paths. To verify this framework, we implement a Word CNN based
semi-supervised learning model and test it on two datasets, namely, LIAR and
PHEME. Experimental results demonstrate that the model built on the proposed
framework can recognize fake news effectively with very few labeled data.

Title: Modeling ASR Ambiguity for Dialogue State Tracking Using Word Confusion
  Networks
Authors: Vaishali Pal, Fabien Guillot, Jean-Michel Renders, Laurent Besacier
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: 5 pages
\\
  Spoken dialogue systems typically use a list of top-N ASR hypotheses for
inferring the semantic meaning and tracking the state of the dialogue. However
ASR graphs, such as confusion networks (confnets), provide a compact
representation of a richer hypothesis space than a top-N ASR list. In this
paper, we study the benefits of using confusion networks with a
state-of-the-art neural dialogue state tracker (DST). We encode the
2-dimensional confnet into a 1-dimensional sequence of embeddings using an
attentional confusion network encoder which can be used with any DST system.
Our confnet encoder is plugged into the state-of-the-art 'Global-locally
Self-Attentive Dialogue State Tacker' (GLAD) model for DST and obtains
significant improvements in both accuracy and inference time compared to using
top-N ASR hypotheses.

Title: Learning Contextualized Document Representations for Healthcare Answer
  Retrieval
Authors: Sebastian Arnold, Betty van Aken, Paul Grundmann, Felix A. Gers,

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: The Web Conference 2020 (WWW '20)
DOI: 10.1145/3366423.3380208
\\
  We present Contextual Discourse Vectors (CDV), a distributed document
representation for efficient answer retrieval from long healthcare documents.
Our approach is based on structured query tuples of entities and aspects from
free text and medical taxonomies. Our model leverages a dual encoder
architecture with hierarchical LSTM layers and multi-task training to encode
the position of clinical entities and aspects alongside the document discourse.
We use our continuous representations to resolve queries with short latency
using approximate nearest neighbor search on sentence level. We apply the CDV
model for retrieving coherent answer passages from nine English public health
resources from the Web, addressing both patients and medical professionals.
Because there is no end-to-end training data available for all application
scenarios, we train our model with self-supervised data from Wikipedia. We show
that our generalized model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art
baselines for healthcare passage ranking and is able to adapt to heterogeneous
domains without additional fine-tuning.

Title: Torch-Struct: Deep Structured Prediction Library
Authors: Alexander M. Rush
Categories: cs.CL cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  The literature on structured prediction for NLP describes a rich collection
of distributions and algorithms over sequences, segmentations, alignments, and
trees; however, these algorithms are difficult to utilize in deep learning
frameworks. We introduce Torch-Struct, a library for structured prediction
designed to take advantage of and integrate with vectorized,
auto-differentiation based frameworks. Torch-Struct includes a broad collection
of probabilistic structures accessed through a simple and flexible
distribution-based API that connects to any deep learning model. The library
utilizes batched, vectorized operations and exploits auto-differentiation to
produce readable, fast, and testable code. Internally, we also include a number
of general-purpose optimizations to provide cross-algorithm efficiency.
Experiments show significant performance gains over fast baselines and
case-studies demonstrate the benefits of the library. Torch-Struct is available
at https://github.com/harvardnlp/pytorch-struct.

Title: Battery draining attacks against edge computing nodes in IoT networks

\\
  Many IoT devices, especially those deployed at the network edge have limited
power resources. A number of attacks aim to exhaust these resources and drain
the batteries of such edge nodes. In this work, we study the effects of a
variety of battery draining attacks against edge nodes. Through simulation, we
clarify the extent to which such attacks are able to increase the usage and
hence waste the power resources of edge nodes. Specifically, we implement hello
flooding, packet flooding, selective forwarding, rank attack, and versioning
attack in ContikiOS and simulate them in the Cooja simulator, and measure and
report a number of time and power resource usage metrics including CPU time,
low power mode time, TX/RX time, and battery consumption. Besides, we test the
stretch attack with three different batteries as an extreme scenario. Our
extensive measurements enable us to compare the effectiveness of these attacks.
Our results show that Versioning attack is the most severe attack in terms of
draining the power resources of the network, followed by Packet Flooding and
Hello Flood attacks. Furthermore, we confirm that Selective Forwarding and Rank
attacks are not able to considerably increase the power resource usage in our
scenarios. By quantifying the effects of these attacks, we demonstrate that
under specific scenarios, Versioning attack can be three to four times as
effective as Packet Flooding and Hello Flood attacks in wasting network
resources, while Packet Flooding is generally comparable to Hello Flood in CPU
and TX time usage increase but twice as powerful in draining device batteries.

Title: Model Extraction Attacks against Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Tatsuya Takemura and Naoto Yanai and Toru Fujiwara
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Model extraction attacks are a kind of attacks in which an adversary obtains
a new model, whose performance is equivalent to that of a target model, via
query access to the target model efficiently, i.e., fewer datasets and
computational resources than those of the target model. Existing works have
dealt with only simple deep neural networks (DNNs), e.g., only three layers, as
targets of model extraction attacks, and hence are not aware of the
effectiveness of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in dealing with time-series
data. In this work, we shed light on the threats of model extraction attacks
against RNNs. We discuss whether a model with a higher accuracy can be
extracted with a simple RNN from a long short-term memory (LSTM), which is a
more complicated and powerful RNN. Specifically, we tackle the following
problems. First, in a case of a classification problem, such as image
recognition, extraction of an RNN model without final outputs from an LSTM
model is presented by utilizing outputs halfway through the sequence. Next, in
a case of a regression problem. such as in weather forecasting, a new attack by
newly configuring a loss function is presented. We conduct experiments on our
model extraction attacks against an RNN and an LSTM trained with publicly
available academic datasets. We then show that a model with a higher accuracy
can be extracted efficiently, especially through configuring a loss function
and a more complex architecture different from the target model.

Title: Permissioned Blockchain-Based Security for SDN in IoT Cloud Networks
Authors: Safi Faizullah, Muhammad Asad Khan, Ali Alzahrani, Imdadullah Khan
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: Accepted to International Conference on Advances in the Emerging
  Computing Technologies (AECT) 2020
\\
  The advancement in cloud networks has enabled connectivity of both
traditional networked elements and new devices from all walks of life, thereby
forming the Internet of Things (IoT). In an IoT setting, improving and scaling
network components as well as reducing cost is essential to sustain exponential
growth. In this domain, software-defined networking (SDN) is revolutionizing
the network infrastructure with a new paradigm. SDN splits the control/routing
logic from the data transfer/forwarding. This splitting causes many issues in
SDN, such as vulnerabilities of DDoS attacks. Many solutions (including
blockchain based) have been proposed to overcome these problems. In this work,
we offer a blockchain-based solution that is provided in redundant SDN
(load-balanced) to service millions of IoT devices. Blockchain is considered as
tamper-proof and impossible to corrupt due to the replication of the ledger and
consensus for verification and addition to the ledger. Therefore, it is a
perfect fit for SDN in IoT Networks. Blockchain technology provides everyone
with a working proof of decentralized trust. The experimental results show gain
and efficiency with respect to the accuracy, update process, and bandwidth
utilization.

Title: GhostKnight: Breaching Data Integrity via Speculative Execution
Authors: Zhi Zhang, Yueqiang Cheng, Yinqian Zhang and Surya Nepal
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: The paper is subject to change
\\
  Existing speculative execution attacks are limited to breaching
confidentiality of data beyond privilege boundary, the so-called spectre-type
attacks. All of them utilize the changes in microarchitectural buffers made by
the speculative execution to leak data. We show that the speculative execution
can be abused to break data integrity. We observe that the speculative
execution not only leaves traces in the microarchitectural buffers but also
induces side effects within DRAM, that is, the speculative execution can
trigger an access to an illegitimate address in DRAM. If the access to DRAM is
frequent enough, then architectural changes (i.e., permanent bit flips in DRAM)
will occur, which we term GhostKnight. With the power of of GhostKnight, an
attacker is essentially able to cross different privilege boundaries and write
exploitable bits to other privilege domains. In our future work, we will
develop a GhostKnight-based exploit to cross a trusted execution environment,
defeat a 1024-bit RSA exponentiation implementation and obtain a controllable
signature.

Title: Private Summation in the Multi-Message Shuffle Model
Authors: Borja Balle, James Bell, Adria Gascon, Kobbi Nissim
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  The shuffle model of differential privacy (Erlingsson et al. SODA 2019; Cheu
et al. EUROCRYPT 2019) and its close relative encode-shuffle-analyze (Bittau et
al. SOSP 2017) provide a fertile middle ground between the well-known local and
central models. Similarly to the local model, the shuffle model assumes an
untrusted data collector who receives privatized messages from users, but in
this case a secure shuffler is used to transmit messages from users to the
collector in a way that hides which messages came from which user. An
interesting feature of the shuffle model is that increasing the amount of
messages sent by each user can lead to protocols with accuracies comparable to
the ones achievable in the central model. In particular, for the problem of
privately computing the sum of $n$ bounded real values held by $n$ different
users, Cheu et al. showed that $O(\sqrt{n})$ messages per user suffice to
achieve $O(1)$ error (the optimal rate in the central model), while Balle et
al. (CRYPTO 2019) recently showed that a single message per user leads to
$\Theta(n^{1/3})$ MSE (mean squared error), a rate strictly in-between what is
achievable in the local and central models.
  This paper introduces two new protocols for summation in the shuffle model
with improved accuracy and communication trade-offs. Our first contribution is
a recursive construction based on the protocol from Balle et al. mentioned
above, providing $\mathrm{poly}(\log \log n)$ error with $O(\log \log n)$
messages per user. The second contribution is a protocol with $O(1)$ error and
$O(1)$ messages per user based on a novel analysis of the reduction from secure
summation to shuffling introduced by Ishai et al. (FOCS 2006) (the original
reduction required $O(\log n)$ messages per user).

Title: Analysis of Gender Inequality In Face Recognition Accuracy
Authors: V\'itor Albiero, Krishnapriya K.S., Kushal Vangara, Kai Zhang, Michael
  C. King, and Kevin W. Bowyer
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Paper will appear at The 2nd Workshop on Demographic Variation in the
  Performance of Biometric Systems at WACV 2020
\\
  We present a comprehensive analysis of how and why face recognition accuracy
differs between men and women. We show that accuracy is lower for women due to
the combination of (1) the impostor distribution for women having a skew toward
higher similarity scores, and (2) the genuine distribution for women having a
skew toward lower similarity scores. We show that this phenomenon of the
impostor and genuine distributions for women shifting closer towards each other
is general across datasets of African-American, Caucasian, and Asian faces. We
show that the distribution of facial expressions may differ between
male/female, but that the accuracy difference persists for image subsets rated
confidently as neutral expression. The accuracy difference also persists for
image subsets rated as close to zero pitch angle. Even when removing images
with forehead partially occluded by hair/hat, the same impostor/genuine
accuracy difference persists. We show that the female genuine distribution
improves when only female images without facial cosmetics are used, but that
the female impostor distribution also degrades at the same time. Lastly, we
show that the accuracy difference persists even if a state-of-the-art deep
learning method is trained from scratch using training data explicitly balanced
between male and female images and subjects.

Title: Hybrid Graph Neural Networks for Crowd Counting
Authors: Ao Luo, Fan Yang, Xin Li, Dong Nie, Zhicheng Jiao, Shangchen Zhou and
  Hong Cheng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To appear in AAAI 2020
\\
  Crowd counting is an important yet challenging task due to the large scale
and density variation. Recent investigations have shown that distilling rich
relations among multi-scale features and exploiting useful information from the
auxiliary task, i.e., localization, are vital for this task. Nevertheless, how
to comprehensively leverage these relations within a unified network
architecture is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel
network structure called Hybrid Graph Neural Network (HyGnn) which targets to
relieve the problem by interweaving the multi-scale features for crowd density
as well as its auxiliary task (localization) together and performing joint
reasoning over a graph. Specifically, HyGnn integrates a hybrid graph to
jointly represent the task-specific feature maps of different scales as nodes,
and two types of relations as edges:(i) multi-scale relations for capturing the
feature dependencies across scales and (ii) mutual beneficial relations
building bridges for the cooperation between counting and localization. Thus,
through message passing, HyGnn can distill rich relations between the nodes to
obtain more powerful representations, leading to robust and accurate results.
Our HyGnn performs significantly well on four challenging datasets:
ShanghaiTech Part A, ShanghaiTech Part B, UCF_CC_50 and UCF_QNRF, outperforming
the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.

Title: Near-Lossless Post-Training Quantization of Deep Neural Networks via a
  Piecewise Linear Approximation
Authors: Jun Fang, Ali Shafiee, Hamzah Abdel-Aziz, David Thorsley, Georgios
  Georgiadis, Joseph Hassoun
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Quantization plays an important role for energy-efficient deployment of deep
neural networks (DNNs) on resource-limited devices. Post-training quantization
is crucial since it does not require retraining or accessibility to the full
training dataset. The conventional post-training uniform quantization scheme
achieves satisfactory results by converting DNNs from full-precision to 8-bit
integers, however, it suffers from significant performance degradation when
quantizing to lower precision such as 4 bits.
  In this paper, we propose a piecewise linear quantization method to enable
accurate post-training quantization. Inspired from the fact that the weight
tensors have bell-shaped distributions with long tails, our approach breaks the
entire quantization range into two non-overlapping regions for each tensor,
with each region being assigned an equal number of quantization levels. The
optimal break-point that divides the entire range is found by minimizing the
quantization error. Extensive results show that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on image classification, semantic segmentation and
object detection. It is possible to quantize weights to 4 bits without
retraining while nearly maintaining the performance of the original
full-precision model.

Title: Better Compression with Deep Pre-Editing
Authors: Hossein Talebi, Damien Kelly, Xiyang Luo, Ignacio Garcia Dorado, Feng
  Yang, Peyman Milanfar and Michael Elad
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Could we compress images via standard codecs while avoiding artifacts? The
answer is obvious -- this is doable as long as the bit budget is generous
enough. What if the allocated bit-rate for compression is insufficient? Then
unfortunately, artifacts are a fact of life. Many attempts were made over the
years to fight this phenomenon, with various degrees of success. In this work
we aim to break the unholy connection between bit-rate and image quality, and
propose a way to circumvent compression artifacts by pre-editing the incoming
image and modifying its content to fit the given bits. We design this editing
operation as a learned convolutional neural network, and formulate an
optimization problem for its training. Our loss takes into account a proximity
between the original image and the edited one, a bit-budget penalty over the
proposed image, and a no-reference image quality measure for forcing the
outcome to be visually pleasing. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the
popular JPEG compression, showing savings in bits and/or improvements in visual
quality, obtained with intricate editing effects.

Title: AdvectiveNet: An Eulerian-Lagrangian Fluidic reservoir for Point Cloud
  Processing
Authors: Xingzhe He, Helen Lu Cao, Bo Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  This paper presents a novel physics-inspired deep learning approach for point
cloud processing motivated by the natural flow phenomena in fluid mechanics.
Our learning architecture jointly defines data in an Eulerian world space,
using a static background grid, and a Lagrangian material space, using moving
particles. By introducing this Eulerian-Lagrangian representation, we are able
to naturally evolve and accumulate particle features using flow velocities
generated from a generalized, high-dimensional force field. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this system by solving various point cloud classification and
segmentation problems with state-of-the-art performance. The entire geometric
reservoir and data flow mimics the pipeline of the classic PIC/FLIP scheme in
modeling natural flow, bridging the disciplines of geometric machine learning
and physical simulation.

Title: Global Texture Enhancement for Fake Face Detection in the Wild
Authors: Zhengzhe Liu, Xiaojuan Qi, Jiaya Jia, Philip Torr
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate realistic fake face
images that can easily fool human beings.On the contrary, a common
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) discriminator can achieve more than 99.9%
accuracyin discerning fake/real images. In this paper, we conduct an empirical
study on fake/real faces, and have two important observations: firstly, the
texture of fake faces is substantially different from real ones; secondly,
global texture statistics are more robust to image editing and transferable to
fake faces from different GANs and datasets. Motivated by the above
observations, we propose a new architecture coined as Gram-Net, which leverages
global image texture representations for robust fake image detection.
Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our Gram-Net
outperforms existing approaches. Especially, our Gram-Netis more robust to
image editings, e.g. down-sampling, JPEG compression, blur, and noise. More
importantly, our Gram-Net generalizes significantly better in detecting fake
faces from GAN models not seen in the training phase and can perform decently
in detecting fake natural images.

Title: Training-free Monocular 3D Event Detection System for Traffic
  Surveillance
Authors: Lijun Yu, Peng Chen, Wenhe Liu, Guoliang Kang, Alexander G. Hauptmann
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To be published in 2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data
  (Big Data), IEEE
\\
  We focus on the problem of detecting traffic events in a surveillance
scenario, including the detection of both vehicle actions and traffic
collisions. Existing event detection systems are mostly learning-based and have
achieved convincing performance when a large amount of training data is
available. However, in real-world scenarios, collecting sufficient labeled
training data is expensive and sometimes impossible (e.g. for traffic collision
detection). Moreover, the conventional 2D representation of surveillance views
is easily affected by occlusions and different camera views in nature. To deal
with the aforementioned problems, in this paper, we propose a training-free
monocular 3D event detection system for traffic surveillance. Our system
firstly projects the vehicles into the 3D Euclidean space and estimates their
kinematic states. Then we develop multiple simple yet effective ways to
identify the events based on the kinematic patterns, which need no further
training. Consequently, our system is robust to the occlusions and the
viewpoint changes. Exclusive experiments report the superior result of our

Title: Towards Evaluating Gaussian Blurring in Perceptual Hashing as a Facial
  Image Filter
Authors: Yigit Alparslan, Mannika Kshettry, Louis Kratz

\\
  With the growth in social media, there is a huge amount of images of faces
available on the internet. Often, people use other people's pictures on their
own profile. Perceptual hashing is often used to detect whether two images are
identical. Therefore, it can be used to detect whether people are misusing
others' pictures. In perceptual hashing, a hash is calculated for a given
image, and a new test image is mapped to one of the existing hashes if
duplicate features are present. Therefore, it can be used as an image filter to
flag banned image content or adversarial attacks --which are modifications that
are made on purpose to deceive the filter-- even though the content might be
changed to deceive the filters. For this reason, it is critical for perceptual
hashing to be robust enough to take transformations such as resizing, cropping,
and slight pixel modifications into account. In this paper, we would like to
propose to experiment with effect of gaussian blurring in perceptual hashing
for detecting misuse of personal images specifically for face images. We
hypothesize that use of gaussian blurring on the image before calculating its
hash will increase the accuracy of our filter that detects adversarial attacks
which consist of image cropping, adding text annotation, and image rotation.

Title: Asymmetric Distribution Measure for Few-shot Learning
Authors: Wenbin Li, Lei Wang, Jing Huo, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao, and Jiebo Luo
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  The core idea of metric-based few-shot image classification is to directly
measure the relations between query images and support classes to learn
transferable feature embeddings. Previous work mainly focuses on image-level
feature representations, which actually cannot effectively estimate a class's
distribution due to the scarcity of samples. Some recent work shows that local
descriptor based representations can achieve richer representations than
image-level based representations. However, such works are still based on a
less effective instance-level metric, especially a symmetric metric, to measure
the relations between query images and support classes. Given the natural
asymmetric relation between a query image and a support class, we argue that an
asymmetric measure is more suitable for metric-based few-shot learning. To that
end, we propose a novel Asymmetric Distribution Measure (ADM) network for
few-shot learning by calculating a joint local and global asymmetric measure
between two multivariate local distributions of queries and classes. Moreover,
a task-aware Contrastive Measure Strategy (CMS) is proposed to further enhance
the measure function. On popular miniImageNet and tieredImageNet, we achieve
$3.02\%$ and $1.56\%$ gains over the state-of-the-art method on the $5$-way
$1$-shot task, respectively, validating our innovative design of asymmetric
distribution measures for few-shot learning.

Title: Deep Multi-View Enhancement Hashing for Image Retrieval
Authors: Chenggang Yan, Biao Gong, Yuxuan Wei, Yue Gao
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Hashing is an efficient method for nearest neighbor search in large-scale
data space by embedding high-dimensional feature descriptors into a similarity
preserving Hamming space with a low dimension. However, large-scale high-speed
retrieval through binary code has a certain degree of reduction in retrieval
accuracy compared to traditional retrieval methods. We have noticed that
multi-view methods can well preserve the diverse characteristics of data.
Therefore, we try to introduce the multi-view deep neural network into the hash
learning field, and design an efficient and innovative retrieval model, which
has achieved a significant improvement in retrieval performance. In this paper,
we propose a supervised multi-view hash model which can enhance the multi-view
information through neural networks. This is a completely new hash learning
method that combines multi-view and deep learning methods. The proposed method
utilizes an effective view stability evaluation method to actively explore the
relationship among views, which will affect the optimization direction of the
entire network. We have also designed a variety of multi-data fusion methods in
the Hamming space to preserve the advantages of both convolution and
multi-view. In order to avoid excessive computing resources on the enhancement
procedure during retrieval, we set up a separate structure called memory
network which participates in training together. The proposed method is
systematically evaluated on the CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and MS-COCO datasets, and
the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
single-view and multi-view hashing methods.

Title: Unbiased Scene Graph Generation via Rich and Fair Semantic Extraction
Authors: Bin Wen, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Lei Huang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Extracting graph representation of visual scenes in image is a challenging
task in computer vision. Although there has been encouraging progress of scene
graph generation in the past decade, we surprisingly find that the performance
of existing approaches is largely limited by the strong biases, which mainly
stem from (1) unconsciously assuming relations with certain semantic properties
such as symmetric and (2) imbalanced annotations over different relations. To
alleviate the negative effects of these biases, we proposed a new and simple
architecture named Rich and Fair semantic extraction network (RiFa for short),
to not only capture rich semantic properties of the relations, but also fairly
predict relations with different scale of annotations. Using pseudo-siamese
networks, RiFa embeds the subject and object respectively to distinguish their
semantic differences and meanwhile preserve their underlying semantic
properties. Then, it further predicts subject-object relations based on both
the visual and semantic features of entities under certain contextual area, and
fairly ranks the relation predictions for those with a few annotations.
Experiments on the popular Visual Genome dataset show that RiFa achieves
state-of-the-art performance under several challenging settings of scene graph
task. Especially, it performs significantly better on capturing different
semantic properties of relations, and obtains the best overall per relation
performance.

Title: AdvJND: Generating Adversarial Examples with Just Noticeable Difference
Authors: Zifei Zhang, Kai Qiao, Lingyun Jiang, Linyuan Wang, and Bin Yan
Categories: cs.CV cs.CR
Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Compared with traditional machine learning models, deep neural networks
perform better, especially in image classification tasks. However, they are
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adding small perturbations on examples
causes a good-performance model to misclassify the crafted examples, without
category differences in the human eyes, and fools deep models successfully.
There are two requirements for generating adversarial examples: the attack
success rate and image fidelity metrics. Generally, perturbations are increased
to ensure the adversarial examples' high attack success rate; however, the
adversarial examples obtained have poor concealment. To alleviate the tradeoff
between the attack success rate and image fidelity, we propose a method named
AdvJND, adding visual model coefficients, just noticeable difference
coefficients, in the constraint of a distortion function when generating
adversarial examples. In fact, the visual subjective feeling of the human eyes
is added as a priori information, which decides the distribution of
perturbations, to improve the image quality of adversarial examples. We tested
our method on the FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and MiniImageNet datasets. Adversarial
examples generated by our AdvJND algorithm yield gradient distributions that
are similar to those of the original inputs. Hence, the crafted noise can be
hidden in the original inputs, thus improving the attack concealment
significantly.

Title: Deeply Activated Salient Region for Instance Search
Authors: Hui-Chu Xiao and Wan-Lei Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Due to the lack of suitable feature representation, effective solution to the
instance search is still slow to occur. In this paper, a novel instance-level
feature descriptor is proposed. The feature is built upon the salient instance
region that is activated by a layer-wise back-propagation process. Such kind of
region usually covers the major part an instance and represents the common
patterns shared among instances of the same category. The back-propagation
starts from the last convolution layer of pre-trained CNN that is originally
used for classification. This makes the feature representation remain effective
for instances from both known and unknown categories. Moreover, experiments
show that it is effective for instance as well as image search tasks.

Title: Large Hole Image Inpainting With Compress-Decompression Network
Authors: Zhenghang Wu, Yidong Cui
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Image inpainting technology can patch images with missing pixels. Existing
methods propose convolutional neural networks to repair corrupted images. The
networks focus on the valid pixels around the missing pixels, use the
encoder-decoder structure to extract valuable information, and use the
information to fix the vacancy. However, if the missing part is too large to
provide useful information, the result will exist blur, color mixing, and
object confusion. In order to patch the large hole image, we study the existing
approaches and propose a new network, the compression-decompression network.
The compression network takes responsibility for inpainting and generating a
down-sample image. The decompression network takes responsibility for extending
the down-sample image into the original resolution. We construct the
compression network with the residual network and propose a similar texture
selection algorithm to extend the image that is better than using the
super-resolution network. We evaluate our model over Places2 and CelebA data
set and use the similarity ratio as the metric. The result shows that our model
has better performance when the inpainting task has many conflicts.

Title: Domain segmentation and adjustment for generalized zero-shot learning
Authors: Xinsheng Wang, Shanmin Pang, Jihua Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In the generalized zero-shot learning, synthesizing unseen data with
generative models has been the most popular method to address the imbalance of
training data between seen and unseen classes. However, this method requires
that the unseen semantic information is available during the training stage,
and training generative models is not trivial. Given that the generator of
these models can only be trained with seen classes, we argue that synthesizing
unseen data may not be an ideal approach for addressing the domain shift caused
by the imbalance of the training data. In this paper, we propose to realize the
generalized zero-shot recognition in different domains. Thus, unseen (seen)
classes can avoid the effect of the seen (unseen) classes. In practice, we
propose a threshold and probabilistic distribution joint method to segment the
testing instances into seen, unseen and uncertain domains. Moreover, the
uncertain domain is further adjusted to alleviate the domain shift. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed method exhibits
competitive performance compared with that based on generative models.

Title: Rigidity Properties of the Blum Medial Axis

MSC-class: Primary: 11S90, 32S25, 55R80, Secondary: 57T15, 14M12, 20G05
\\
  We consider the Blum medial axis of a region in $\mathbb R^n$ with piecewise
smooth boundary and examine its "rigidity properties", by which we mean
properties preserved under diffeomorphisms of the regions preserving the medial
axis. There are several possible versions of rigidity depending on what
features of the Blum medial axis we wish to retain. We use a form of the cross
ratio from projective geometry to show that in the case of four smooth sheets
of the medial axis meeting along a branching submanifold, the cross ratio
defines a function on the branching sheet which must be preserved under any
diffeomorphism of the medial axis with another. Second, we show in the generic
case, along a Y-branching submanifold that there are three cross ratios
involving the three limiting tangent planes of the three smooth sheets and each
of the hyperplanes defined by one of the radial lines and the tangent space to
the Y-branching submanifold at the point, which again must be preserved.
Moreover, the triple of cross ratios then locally uniquely determines the
angles between the smooth sheets. Third, we observe that for a diffeomorphism
of the region preserving the Blum medial axis and the infinitesimal directions
of the radial lines, the second derivative of the diffeomorphism at points of
the medial axis must satisfy a condition relating the radial shape operators
and hence the differential geometry of the boundaries at corresponding boundary
points.

Segmenter (PBAS) modified for RGB-D data support. The simultaneous use of
colour (RGB) and depth (D) data allows to improve segmentation accuracy,
especially in case of colour camouflage, illumination changes and occurrence of

Jetson TX2 (Maxwell architecture), mobile NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050m (Pascal

accuracy comparable to previously published works was obtained. Moreover, the
use of a GPU platform allowed to get real-time image processing. In addition,
the system has been adapted to work with two RGB-D sensors: RealSense D415 and
D435 from Intel.

Title: Few-Shot Scene Adaptive Crowd Counting Using Meta-Learning
Authors: Mahesh Kumar Krishna Reddy, Mohammad Hossain, Mrigank Rochan and Yang
  Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to WACV 2020
\\
  We consider the problem of few-shot scene adaptive crowd counting. Given a
target camera scene, our goal is to adapt a model to this specific scene with
only a few labeled images of that scene. The solution to this problem has
potential applications in numerous real-world scenarios, where we ideally like
to deploy a crowd counting model specially adapted to a target camera. We
accomplish this challenge by taking inspiration from the recently introduced
learning-to-learn paradigm in the context of few-shot regime. In training, our
method learns the model parameters in a way that facilitates the fast
adaptation to the target scene. At test time, given a target scene with a small
number of labeled data, our method quickly adapts to that scene with a few
gradient updates to the learned parameters. Our extensive experimental results
show that the proposed approach outperforms other alternatives in few-shot
scene adaptive crowd counting.

Title: 3D Object Detection on Point Clouds using Local Ground-aware and
  Adaptive Representation of scenes' surface
Authors: Arun CS Kumar, Disha Ahuja, Ashwath Aithal
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  A novel, adaptive ground-aware, and cost-effective 3D Object Detection
pipeline is proposed. The ground surface representation introduced in this
paper, in comparison to its uni-planar counterparts (methods that model the
surface of a whole 3D scene using single plane), is far more accurate while
being ~10x faster. The novelty of the ground representation lies both in the
way in which the ground surface of the scene is represented in Lidar perception
problems, as well as in the (cost-efficient) way in which it is computed.
Furthermore, the proposed object detection pipeline builds on the traditional
two-stage object detection models by incorporating the ability to dynamically
reason the surface of the scene, ultimately achieving a new state-of-the-art 3D
object detection performance among the two-stage Lidar Object Detection
pipelines.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This work presents a generative adversarial architecture for generating
three-dimensional shapes based on signed distance representations. While the
deep generation of shapes has been mostly tackled by voxel and surface point
cloud approaches, our generator learns to approximate the signed distance for
any point in space given prior latent information. Although structurally
similar to generative point cloud approaches, this formulation can be evaluated
with arbitrary point density during inference, leading to fine-grained details
in generated outputs. Furthermore, we study the effects of using either
progressively growing voxel- or point-processing networks as discriminators,
and propose a refinement scheme to strengthen the generator's capabilities in
modeling the zero iso-surface decision boundary of shapes. We train our
approach on the ShapeNet benchmark dataset and validate, both quantitatively
and qualitatively, its performance in generating realistic 3D shapes.

is that the networks have actually learned underneath a given classification

3D convolutional networks and convolutional LSTM networks learn features across
temporally dependent frames. This is the first comparison of two video models
that both convolve to learn spatial features but that have principally
different methods of modeling time. Additionally, we extend the concept of
meaningful perturbation introduced by Fong & Vedaldi (2017) to the temporal
dimension to search for the most meaningful part of a sequence for a
classification decision.

\\
  Pedestrian trajectory prediction in dynamic scenes remains a challenging and
critical problem in numerous applications, such as self-driving cars and
socially aware robots. Challenges concentrate on capturing pedestrians' social
interactions and handling their future uncertainties. Pedestrians' head
orientations can be used as an oracle that indicates relevant pedestrians[1],
thus is beneficial to model social interactions. Moreover, latent variable
distributions of pedestrians'future trajectories can be termed as another
oracle. However, few works fully utilize these oracle information for an
improved prediction performance. In this work, we propose GTPPO (Graph-based
Trajectory Predictor with Pseudo Oracle), which is a generative model-based
trajectory predictor. Pedestrians'social interactions are captured by the
proposed GA2T (Graph Attention social Attention neTwork) module. Social
attention is calculated on the basis of pedestrians' moving directions, which
are termed as a pseudo oracle. Moreover, we propose a latent variable predictor
to learn the latent variable distribution from observed trajectories. Such
latent variable distribution reflects pedestrians'future trajectories, and
therefore can be taken as another pseudo oracle. We compare the performance of
GTPPO with several recently proposed methods on benchmarking datasets.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that GTPPO outperforms state-of-the-art
methods with lower average and final displacement errors. Qualitative
evaluations show that GTPPO successfully recognizes the sudden motion changes
since the estimated latent variable reflects the future trajectories.

DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-30642-7_41
\\
  The semantic segmentation of 3D shapes with a high-density of vertices could
be impractical due to large memory requirements. To make this problem
computationally tractable, we propose a neural-network based approach that
produces 3D augmented views of the 3D shape to solve the whole segmentation as
sub-segmentation problems. 3D augmented views are obtained by projecting
vertices and normals of a 3D shape onto 2D regular grids taken from different
viewpoints around the shape. These 3D views are then processed by a
Convolutional Neural Network to produce a probability distribution function
(pdf) over the set of the semantic classes for each vertex. These pdfs are then
re-projected on the original 3D shape and postprocessed using contextual
information through Conditional Random Fields. We validate our approach using
3D shapes of publicly available datasets and of real objects that are
reconstructed using photogrammetry techniques. We compare our approach against
state-of-the-art alternatives.

in a supervised manner which faithfully follows the domain knowledge in
fashion. We create the EVALUATION3 dataset which is annotated with judgment,
the decisive reason for the judgment, and all corresponding attributes (e.g.
print, silhouette, and material \etc.). In the training process, features of
all attributes in an outfit are first extracted and then concatenated as the
input for the intra-factor compatibility net. Then, the inter-factor
compatibility net is used to compute the loss for judgment. We penalize the
gradient of judgment loss of so that our Grad-CAM-like reason is regularized to
be consistent with the labeled reason. In inference, according to the obtained
information of judgment, reason, and attributes, a user-friendly explanation
sentence is generated by the pre-defined templates. The experimental results
show that the obtained network combines the advantages of high precision and
good interpretation.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Electromyography (EMG) signals have been successfully employed for driving
prosthetic limbs of a single or double degree of freedom. This principle works
by using the amplitude of the EMG signals to decide between one or two simpler
movements. This method underperforms as compare to the contemporary advances
done at the mechanical, electronics, and robotics end, and it lacks intuition.
Recently, research on myoelectric control based on pattern recognition (PR)
shows promising results with the aid of machine learning classifiers. Using the
approach termed as, EMG-PR, EMG signals are divided into analysis windows, and
features are extracted for each window. These features are then fed to the
machine learning classifiers as input. By offering multiple class movements and
intuitive control, this method has the potential to power an amputated subject
to perform everyday life movements. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
the analysis window and feature selection on classification accuracy of
different hand and wrist movements using time-domain features. We show that
effective data preprocessing and optimum feature selection helps to improve the
classification accuracy of hand movements. We use publicly available hand and
wrist gesture dataset of $40$ intact subjects for experimentation. Results
computed using different classification algorithms show that the proposed
preprocessing and features selection outperforms the baseline and achieve up to
$98\%$ classification accuracy.

generative adversarial networks (GANs) methods. However, the training process
of GANs remains challenging, suffering from instability issues such as mode
collapse and vanishing gradients. In this paper, by adopting non-adversarial
generative networks, a novel decoder-encoder framework is proposed for novelty
detection task, insteading of classical encoder-decoder style. Under the
non-adversarial framework, both latent space and image reconstruction space are
jointly optimized, leading to a more stable training process with super fast
convergence and lower training losses. During inference, inspired by cycleGAN,
we design a new testing scheme to conduct image reconstruction, which is the
reverse way of training sequence. Experiments show that our model has the clear
superiority over cutting-edge novelty detectors and achieves the
state-of-the-art results on the datasets.

Title: Automatic Pruning for Quantized Neural Networks
Authors: Luis Guerra, Bohan Zhuang, Ian Reid, Tom Drummond
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Neural network quantization and pruning are two techniques commonly used to
reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of these models for
deployment. However, most existing pruning strategies operate on full-precision
and cannot be directly applied to discrete parameter distributions after
quantization. In contrast, we study a combination of these two techniques to
achieve further network compression. In particular, we propose an effective
pruning strategy for selecting redundant low-precision filters. Furthermore, we
leverage Bayesian optimization to efficiently determine the pruning ratio for
each layer. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with
various architectures and precisions. In particular, for ResNet-18 on ImageNet,
we prune 26.12% of the model size with Binarized Neural Network quantization,
achieving a top-1 classification accuracy of 47.32% in a model of 2.47 MB and
59.30% with a 2-bit DoReFa-Net in 4.36 MB.

Title: Towards High Performance Human Keypoint Detection

\\
  Human keypoint detection from a single image is very challenging due to
occlusion, blur, illumination and scale variance. In this paper, we address
this problem from three aspects by devising an efficient network structure,
proposing three effective training strategies, and exploiting four useful
postprocessing techniques. First, we find that context information plays an
important role in reasoning human body configuration and invisible keypoints.
Inspired by this, we propose a cascaded context mixer (CCM), which efficiently
integrates spatial and channel context information and progressively refines
them. Then, to maximize CCM's representation capability, we develop a
hard-negative person detection mining strategy and a joint-training strategy by
exploiting abundant unlabeled data. It enables CCM to learn discriminative
features from massive diverse poses. Third, we present several sub-pixel
refinement techniques for postprocessing keypoint predictions to improve
detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO keypoint detection
benchmark demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over
representative state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our single model achieves
comparable performance with the winner of the 2018 COCO Keypoint Detection
Challenge. The final ensemble model sets a new SOTA on this benchmark.

Title: Widening and Squeezing: Towards Accurate and Efficient QNNs
Authors: Chuanjian Liu, Kai Han, Yunhe Wang, Hanting Chen, Chunjing Xu, Qi Tian
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Tech report
\\
  Quantization neural networks (QNNs) are very attractive to the industry
because their extremely cheap calculation and storage overhead, but their
performance is still worse than that of networks with full-precision
parameters. Most of existing methods aim to enhance performance of QNNs
especially binary neural networks by exploiting more effective training
techniques. However, we find the representation capability of quantization
features is far weaker than full-precision features by experiments. We address
this problem by projecting features in original full-precision networks to
high-dimensional quantization features. Simultaneously, redundant quantization
features will be eliminated in order to avoid unrestricted growth of dimensions
for some datasets. Then, a compact quantization neural network but with
sufficient representation ability will be established. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to establish
QNNs with much less parameters and calculations but almost the same performance
as that of full-precision baseline models, e.g. $29.9\%$ top-1 error of binary
ResNet-18 on the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 dataset.

Title: DiverseDepth: Affine-invariant Depth Prediction Using Diverse Data
Authors: Wei Yin, Xinlong Wang, Chunhua Shen, Yifan Liu, Zhi Tian, Songcen Xu,
  Changming Sun, Dou Renyin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present a method for depth estimation with monocular images, which can
predict high-quality depth on diverse scenes up to an affine transformation,
thus preserving accurate shapes of a scene. Previous methods that predict
metric depth often work well only for a specific scene. In contrast, learning
relative depth (information of being closer or further) can enjoy better
generalization, with the price of failing to recover the accurate geometric
shape of the scene. In this work, we propose a dataset and methods to tackle
this dilemma, aiming to predict accurate depth up to an affine transformation
with good generalization to diverse scenes. First we construct a large-scale
and diverse dataset, termed Diverse Scene Depth dataset (DiverseDepth), which
has a broad range of scenes and foreground contents. Compared with previous
learning objectives, i.e., learning metric depth or relative depth, we propose
to learn the affine-invariant depth using our diverse dataset to ensure both
generalization and high-quality geometric shapes of scenes. Furthermore, in
order to train the model on the complex dataset effectively, we propose a
multi-curriculum learning method. Experiments show that our method outperforms
previous methods on 8 datasets by a large margin with the zero-shot test
setting, demonstrating the excellent generalization capacity of the learned
model to diverse scenes. The reconstructed point clouds with the predicted
depth show that our method can recover high-quality 3D shapes.

Title: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Object Detection using Forward-Backward
  Cyclic Adaptation
Authors: Siqi Yang, Lin Wu, Arnold Wiliem and Brian C. Lovell
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present a novel approach to perform the unsupervised domain adaptation for
object detection through forward-backward cyclic (FBC) training. Recent
adversarial training based domain adaptation methods have shown their
effectiveness on minimizing domain discrepancy via marginal feature
distributions alignment. However, aligning the marginal feature distributions
does not guarantee the alignment of class conditional distributions. This
limitation is more evident when adapting object detectors as the domain
discrepancy is larger compared to the image classification task, e.g. various
number of objects exist in one image and the majority of content in an image is
the background. This motivates us to learn domain invariance for category level
semantics via gradient alignment. Intuitively, if the gradients of two domains
point in similar directions, then the learning of one domain can improve that
of another domain. To achieve gradient alignment, we propose Forward-Backward
Cyclic Adaptation, which iteratively computes adaptation from source to target
via backward hopping and from target to source via forward passing. In
addition, we align low-level features for adapting holistic color/texture via
adversarial training. However, the detector performs well on both domains is
not ideal for target domain. As such, in each cycle, domain diversity is
enforced by maximum entropy regularization on the source domain to penalize
confident source-specific learning and minimum entropy regularization on target
domain to intrigue target-specific learning. Theoretical analysis of the
training process is provided, and extensive experiments on challenging
cross-domain object detection datasets have shown the superiority of our
approach over the state-of-the-art.

\\
  Super-resolution aims at increasing image resolution by algorithmic means and
has progressed over the recent years due to advances in the fields of computer
vision and deep learning. Convolutional Neural Networks based on a variety of
architectures have been applied to the problem, e.g. autoencoders and residual
networks. While most research focuses on the processing of photographs
consisting only of RGB color channels, little work can be found concentrating
on multi-band, analytic satellite imagery. Satellite images often include a
panchromatic band, which has higher spatial resolution but lower spectral
resolution than the other bands. In the field of remote sensing, there is a
long tradition of applying pan-sharpening to satellite images, i.e. bringing
the multispectral bands to the higher spatial resolution by merging them with
the panchromatic band. To our knowledge there are so far no approaches to
super-resolution which take advantage of the panchromatic band. In this paper
we propose a method to train state-of-the-art CNNs using pairs of
lower-resolution multispectral and high-resolution pan-sharpened image tiles in
order to create super-resolved analytic images. The derived quality metrics
show that the method improves information content of the processed images. We
compare the results created by four CNN architectures, with RedNet30 performing
best.

Title: Regularizers for Single-step Adversarial Training
Authors: B.S. Vivek, R. Venkatesh Babu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The progress in the last decade has enabled machine learning models to
achieve impressive performance across a wide range of tasks in Computer Vision.
However, a plethora of works have demonstrated the susceptibility of these
models to adversarial samples. Adversarial training procedure has been proposed
to defend against such adversarial attacks. Adversarial training methods
augment mini-batches with adversarial samples, and typically single-step
(non-iterative) methods are used for generating these adversarial samples.
However, models trained using single-step adversarial training converge to
degenerative minima where the model merely appears to be robust. The pseudo
robustness of these models is due to the gradient masking effect. Although
multi-step adversarial training helps to learn robust models, they are hard to
scale due to the use of iterative methods for generating adversarial samples.
To address these issues, we propose three different types of regularizers that
help to learn robust models using single-step adversarial training methods. The
proposed regularizers mitigate the effect of gradient masking by harnessing on
properties that differentiate a robust model from that of a pseudo robust
model. Performance of models trained using the proposed regularizers is on par
with models trained using computationally expensive multi-step adversarial
training methods.

Title: Pix2Pix-based Stain-to-Stain Translation: A Solution for Robust Stain
  Normalization in Histopathology Images Analysis

\\
  The diagnosis of cancer is mainly performed by visual analysis of the
pathologists, through examining the morphology of the tissue slices and the
spatial arrangement of the cells. If the microscopic image of a specimen is not
stained, it will look colorless and textured. Therefore, chemical staining is
required to create contrast and help identify specific tissue components.
During tissue preparation due to differences in chemicals, scanners, cutting
thicknesses, and laboratory protocols, similar tissues are usually varied
significantly in appearance. This diversity in staining, in addition to
Interpretive disparity among pathologists more is one of the main challenges in
designing robust and flexible systems for automated analysis. To address the
staining color variations, several methods for normalizing stain have been
proposed. In our proposed method, a Stain-to-Stain Translation (STST) approach
is used to stain normalization for Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained
histopathology images, which learns not only the specific color distribution
but also the preserves corresponding histopathological pattern. We perform the
process of translation based on the pix2pix framework, which uses the
conditional generator adversarial networks (cGANs). Our approach showed
excellent results, both mathematically and experimentally against the state of
the art methods. We have made the source code publicly available.

  We present our approach to unsupervised domain adaptation for single-stage
object detectors on top-view grid maps in automated driving scenarios. Our goal
is to train a robust object detector on grid maps generated from custom sensor
data and setups. We first introduce a single-stage object detector for grid
maps based on RetinaNet. We then extend our model by image- and instance-level
domain classifiers at different feature pyramid levels which are trained in an
adversarial manner. This allows us to train robust object detectors for
unlabeled domains. We evaluate our approach quantitatively on the nuScenes and
KITTI benchmarks and present qualitative domain adaptation results for
unlabeled measurements recorded by our experimental vehicle. Our results
demonstrate that object detection accuracy for unlabeled domains can be
improved by applying our domain adaptation strategy.

Title: A Novel Incremental Cross-Modal Hashing Approach
Authors: Devraj Mandal, Soma Biswas
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 20 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Cross-modal retrieval deals with retrieving relevant items from one modality,
when provided with a search query from another modality. Hashing techniques,
where the data is represented as binary bits have specifically gained
importance due to the ease of storage, fast computations and high accuracy. In
real world, the number of data categories is continuously increasing, which
requires algorithms capable of handling this dynamic scenario. In this work, we
propose a novel incremental cross-modal hashing algorithm termed "iCMH", which
can adapt itself to handle incoming data of new categories. The proposed
approach consists of two sequential stages, namely, learning the hash codes and
training the hash functions. At every stage, a small amount of old category
data termed "exemplars" is is used so as not to forget the old data while
trying to learn for the new incoming data, i.e. to avoid catastrophic
forgetting. In the first stage, the hash codes for the exemplars is used, and
simultaneously, hash codes for the new data is computed such that it maintains
the semantic relations with the existing data. For the second stage, we propose
both a non-deep and deep architectures to learn the hash functions effectively.
Extensive experiments across a variety of cross-modal datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art cross-modal algorithms shows the usefulness of our
approach.

Title: Modeling the Background for Incremental Learning in Semantic
  Segmentation
Authors: Fabio Cermelli, Massimiliano Mancini, Samuel Rota Bul\`o, Elisa Ricci,
  Barbara Caputo
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Despite their effectiveness in a wide range of tasks, deep architectures
suffer from some important limitations. In particular, they are vulnerable to
catastrophic forgetting, i.e. they perform poorly when they are required to
update their model as new classes are available but the original training set
is not retained. This paper addresses this problem in the context of semantic
segmentation. Current strategies fail on this task because they do not consider
a peculiar aspect of semantic segmentation: since each training step provides
annotation only for a subset of all possible classes, pixels of the background
class (i.e. pixels that do not belong to any other classes) exhibit a semantic
distribution shift. In this work we revisit classical incremental learning
methods, proposing a new distillation-based framework which explicitly accounts
for this shift. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy to initialize
classifier's parameters, thus preventing biased predictions toward the
background class. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
extensive evaluation on the Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, significantly
outperforming state of the art incremental learning methods.

Comments: AAAI 2020 paper
\\
  Visual storytelling is a task of creating a short story based on photo
streams. Unlike existing visual captioning, storytelling aims to contain not
only factual descriptions, but also human-like narration and semantics.
However, the VIST dataset consists only of a small, fixed number of photos per
story. Therefore, the main challenge of visual storytelling is to fill in the
visual gap between photos with narrative and imaginative story. In this paper,
we propose to explicitly learn to imagine a storyline that bridges the visual
gap. During training, one or more photos is randomly omitted from the input
stack, and we train the network to produce a full plausible story even with
missing photo(s). Furthermore, we propose for visual storytelling a
hide-and-tell model, which is designed to learn non-local relations across the
photo streams and to refine and improve conventional RNN-based models. In
experiments, we show that our scheme of hide-and-tell, and the network design
are indeed effective at storytelling, and that our model outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in automatic metrics. Finally, we qualitatively show
the learned ability to interpolate storyline over visual gaps.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Understanding on-road vehicle behaviour from a temporal sequence of sensor
data is gaining in popularity. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for
understanding vehicle behaviour from a monocular image sequence or video. A
monocular sequence along with scene semantics, optical flow and object labels
are used to get spatial information about the object (vehicle) of interest and
other objects (semantically contiguous set of locations) in the scene. This
spatial information is encoded by a Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional
Network (MR-GCN), and a temporal sequence of such encodings is fed to a
recurrent network to label vehicle behaviours. The proposed framework can
classify a variety of vehicle behaviours to high fidelity on datasets that are
diverse and include European, Chinese and Indian on-road scenes. The framework
also provides for seamless transfer of models across datasets without entailing
re-annotation, retraining and even fine-tuning. We show comparative performance
gain over baseline Spatio-temporal classifiers and detail a variety of
ablations to showcase the efficacy of the framework.

Title: Syn2Real: Forgery Classification via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Authors: Akash Kumar, Arnav Bhavasar
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In recent years, image manipulation is becoming increasingly more accessible,
yielding more natural-looking images, owing to the modern tools in image
processing and computer vision techniques. The task of the identification of
forged images has become very challenging. Amongst different types of
forgeries, the cases of Copy-Move forgery are increasing manifold, due to the
difficulties involved to detect this tampering. To tackle such problems,
publicly available datasets are insufficient. In this paper, we propose to
create a synthetic forged dataset using deep semantic image inpainting and
copy-move forgery algorithm. However, models trained on these datasets have a
significant drop in performance when tested on more realistic data. To
alleviate this problem, we use unsupervised domain adaptation networks to
detect copy-move forgery in new domains by mapping the feature space from our
synthetically generated dataset. Furthermore, we improvised the F1 score on
CASIA and CoMoFoD dataset to 80.3% and 78.8%, respectively. Our approach can be
helpful in those cases where the classification of data is unavailable.

Title: Learning Extremal Representations with Deep Archetypal Analysis

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Under review for publication at the International Journal of Computer
  Vision (IJCV). Extended version of our GCPR2019 paper "Deep Archetypal
  Analysis"
\\
  Archetypes are typical population representatives in an extremal sense, where
typicality is understood as the most extreme manifestation of a trait or
feature. In linear feature space, archetypes approximate the data convex hull
allowing all data points to be expressed as convex mixtures of archetypes.
However, it might not always be possible to identify meaningful archetypes in a
given feature space. Learning an appropriate feature space and identifying
suitable archetypes simultaneously addresses this problem. This paper
introduces a generative formulation of the linear archetype model,
parameterized by neural networks. By introducing the distance-dependent
archetype loss, the linear archetype model can be integrated into the latent
space of a variational autoencoder, and an optimal representation with respect
to the unknown archetypes can be learned end-to-end. The reformulation of
linear Archetypal Analysis as deep variational information bottleneck, allows
the incorporation of arbitrarily complex side information during training.
Furthermore, an alternative prior, based on a modified Dirichlet distribution,
is proposed. The real-world applicability of the proposed method is
demonstrated by exploring archetypes of female facial expressions while using
multi-rater based emotion scores of these expressions as side information. A
second application illustrates the exploration of the chemical space of small
organic molecules. In this experiment, it is demonstrated that exchanging the
side information but keeping the same set of molecules, e. g. using as side
information the heat capacity of each molecule instead of the band gap energy,
will result in the identification of different archetypes. As an application,
these learned representations of chemical space might reveal distinct starting
points for de novo molecular design.

Title: Deep Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Free-Hand Sketch
Authors: Peng Xu, Zeyu Song, Qiyue Yin, Yi-Zhe Song, Liang Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we tackle for the first time, the problem of self-supervised
representation learning for free-hand sketches. This importantly addresses a
common problem faced by the sketch community -- that annotated supervisory data
are difficult to obtain. This problem is very challenging in that sketches are
highly abstract and subject to different drawing styles, making existing
solutions tailored for photos unsuitable. Key for the success of our
self-supervised learning paradigm lies with our sketch-specific designs: (i) we
propose a set of pretext tasks specifically designed for sketches that mimic
different drawing styles, and (ii) we further exploit the use of a textual
convolution network (TCN) in a dual-branch architecture for sketch feature
learning, as means to accommodate the sequential stroke nature of sketches. We
demonstrate the superiority of our sketch-specific designs through two
sketch-related applications (retrieval and recognition) on a million-scale
sketch dataset, and show that the proposed approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art unsupervised representation learning methods, and
significantly narrows the performance gap between with supervised
representation learning.

\\
  There is a growing interest on the affective computing research nowadays
given its crucial role in bridging humans with computers. This progress has
been recently accelerated due to the emergence of big data. One recent advance
in this field is the use of adversarial learning to improve model learning
through augmented samples. However, the use of latent features, which is
feasible through adversarial learning, is not largely explored yet. This
technique may also improve the performance of affective models, as analogously
demonstrated in related fields, such as computer vision. To expand this
analysis, in this work, we explore the use of latent features through our
proposed adversarial-based networks for valence and arousal recognition in the
wild. Specifically, our models operate by aggregating several modalities to our
discriminator, which is further conditioned to the extracted latent features by
the generator. Our experiments on the recently released SEWA dataset suggest
the progressive improvements of our results. Finally, we show our competitive
results on the Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) challenge
dataset.

Title: Effect of top-down connections in Hierarchical Sparse Coding
Authors: Victor Boutin, Angelo Franciosini, Franck Ruffier, Laurent Perrinet
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Hierarchical Sparse Coding (HSC) is a powerful model to efficiently represent
multi-dimensional, structured data such as images. The simplest solution to
solve this computationally hard problem is to decompose it into independent
layer-wise subproblems. However, neuroscientific evidence would suggest
inter-connecting these subproblems as in the Predictive Coding (PC) theory,
which adds top-down connections between consecutive layers. In this study, a
new model called 2-Layers Sparse Predictive Coding (2L-SPC) is introduced to
assess the impact of this inter-layer feedback connection. In particular, the
2L-SPC is compared with a Hierarchical Lasso (Hi-La) network made out of a
sequence of independent Lasso layers. The 2L-SPC and the 2-layers Hi-La
networks are trained on 4 different databases and with different sparsity
parameters on each layer. First, we show that the overall prediction error
generated by 2L-SPC is lower thanks to the feedback mechanism as it transfers
prediction error between layers. Second, we demonstrate that the inference
stage of the 2L-SPC is faster to converge than for the Hi-La model. Third, we
show that the 2L-SPC also accelerates the learning process. Finally, the
qualitative analysis of both models dictionaries, supported by their activation
probability, show that the 2L-SPC features are more generic and informative.

Title: EGO-CH: Dataset and Fundamental Tasks for Visitors
  BehavioralUnderstanding using Egocentric Vision

\\
  Equipping visitors of a cultural site with a wearable device allows to easily
collect information about their preferences which can be exploited to improve
the fruition of cultural goods with augmented reality. Moreover, egocentric
video can be processed using computer vision and machine learning to enable an
automated analysis of visitors' behavior. The inferred information can be used
both online to assist the visitor and offline to support the manager of the
site. Despite the positive impact such technologies can have in cultural
heritage, the topic is currently understudied due to the limited number of
public datasets suitable to study the considered problems. To address this
issue, in this paper we propose EGOcentric-Cultural Heritage (EGO-CH), the
first dataset of egocentric videos for visitors' behavior understanding in
cultural sites. The dataset has been collected in two cultural sites and
includes more than $27$ hours of video acquired by $70$ subjects, with labels
for $26$ environments and over $200$ different Points of Interest. A large
subset of the dataset, consisting of $60$ videos, is associated with surveys
filled out by real visitors. To encourage research on the topic, we propose $4$
challenging tasks (room-based localization, point of interest/object
recognition, object retrieval and survey prediction) useful to understand
visitors' behavior and report baseline results on the dataset.

Title: YOLOff: You Only Learn Offsets for robust 6DoF object pose estimation
Authors: Mathieu Gonzalez, Amine Kacete, Albert Murienne, Eric Marchand
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Estimating the 3D translation and orientation of an object is a challenging
task that can be considered within augmented reality or robotic applications.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to perform 6 DoF object pose
estimation from a single RGB-D image in cluttered scenes. We adopt an hybrid
pipeline in two stages: data-driven and geometric respectively. The first
data-driven step consists of a classification CNN to estimate the object 2D
location in the image from local patches, followed by a regression CNN trained
to predict the 3D location of a set of keypoints in the camera coordinate
system. We robustly perform local voting to recover the location of each
keypoint in the camera coordinate system. To extract the pose information, the
geometric step consists in aligning the 3D points in the camera coordinate
system with the corresponding 3D points in world coordinate system by
minimizing a registration error, thus computing the pose. Our experiments on
the standard dataset LineMod show that our approach more robust and accurate
than state-of-the-art methods.

Categories: cs.CY
Comments: Accepted for the seventh World Congress of the International Society
  of Business, Economics, and Ethics (ISBEE) 2020
\\
  Artificial intelligent (AI) was initially developed as an implicit moral
agent to solve simple and clearly defined tasks where all options are
predictable. However, it is now part of our daily life powering cell phones,
cameras, watches, thermostats, vacuums, cars, and much more. This has raised
numerous concerns and some scholars and practitioners stress the dangers of AI
and argue against its development as moral agents that can reason about ethics
(e.g., Bryson 2008; Johnson and Miller 2008; Sharkey 2017; Tonkens 2009; van
Wynsberghe and Robbins 2019). Even though we acknowledge the potential threat,
in line with most other scholars (e.g., Anderson and Anderson 2010; Moor 2006;
Scheutz 2016; Wallach 2010), we argue that AI advancements cannot be stopped
and developers need to prepare AI to sustain explicit moral agents and face
ethical dilemmas in complex and morally salient environments.

Title: Property of Innovation Under Different Group Size in an Open-ended
  Fitness Landscape: Demonstration Through Evolutionary Logical Circuits
Authors: Masaki Suyama and Kosuke Sato
Categories: cs.CY
Comments: This document is a preprint. We expect changes in the peer review
  process
\\
  Open-ended fitness landscape or architectural innovation is a key
characteristic of combinatorial technological evolution. Though many have
argued that this feature is important, many models were created in a closed
fitness landscape. In this article, we modified a simulation by Arthur and
Polak (2006) that used a computer simulation that builds logical circuits with
circuits that were built in earlier trials. We used this simulation to
investigate (1) whether the speed of innovation is increased by increasing
group size and (2) if the nature of innovation would differ when innovation was
separated by invention (new innovation that serves a purpose that never was
used before) and improvement (already made innovation but is more efficient).
The results indicated that indeed group size increases the speed of innovations
but is limited than expected. Also, when innovation was separated with
invention and improvement, the nature of the two differed. In improvement, the
trajectory followed a convex function with productivity of one agent decreasing
as group size increased. In invention, the trajectory showed a continuous
pattern of rapid increase followed by a plateau. In sum, the results indicated
that group size does increase both innovation and improvement, but the effect
diminishes as group size increase in an open-ended fitness landscape and when
innovation was split, invention resembled a technology s-curve.

Title: Measuring relative opinion from location-based social media: A case
  study of the 2016 U.S. presidential election
Authors: Zhaoya Gong, Tengteng Cai, Jean-Claude Thill, Scott Hale, Mark Graham
Categories: cs.CY
\\
  Social media has become an emerging alternative to opinion polls for public
opinion collection, while it is still posing many challenges as a passive data
source, such as structurelessness, quantifiability, and representativeness.
Social media data with geotags provide new opportunities to unveil the
geographic locations of users expressing their opinions. This paper aims to
answer two questions: 1) whether quantifiable measurement of public opinion can
be obtained from social media and 2) whether it can produce better or
complementary measures compared to opinion polls. This research proposes a
novel approach to measure the relative opinion of Twitter users towards public
issues in order to accommodate more complex opinion structures and take
advantage of the geography pertaining to the public issues. To ensure that this
new measure is technically feasible, a modeling framework is developed
including building a training dataset by adopting a state-of-the-art approach
and devising a new deep learning method called Opinion-Oriented Word Embedding.
With a case study of the tweets selected for the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, we demonstrate the predictive superiority of our relative opinion
approach and we show how it can aid visual analytics and support opinion
predictions. Although the relative opinion measure is proved to be more robust
compared to polling, our study also suggests that the former can advantageously
complement the later in opinion prediction.

Title: Stop Tracking Me Bro! Differential Tracking Of User Demographics On
  Hyper-partisan Websites
Authors: Pushkal Agarwal, Sagar Joglekar, Panagiotis Papadopoulos, Nishanth
  Sastry, Nicolas Kourtellis
Categories: cs.CY cs.CR
ACM-class: K.4.2
\\
  Websites with hyper-partisan, left or right-leaning focus offer content that
is typically biased towards the expectations of their target audience. Such
content often polarizes users, who are repeatedly primed to specific (extreme)
content, usually reflecting hard party lines on political and socio-economic
topics. Though this polarization has been extensively studied with respect to
content, it is still unknown how it associates with the online tracking
experienced by browsing users, especially when they exhibit certain demographic
characteristics. For example, it is unclear how such websites enable the
ad-ecosystem to track users based on their gender or age. In this paper, we
take a first step to shed light and measure such potential differences in
tracking imposed on users when visiting specific party-line's websites. For
this, we design and deploy a methodology to systematically probe such websites
and measure differences in user tracking. This methodology allows us to create
user personas with specific attributes like gender and age and automate their
browsing behavior in a consistent and repeatable manner. Thus, we
systematically study how personas are being tracked by these websites and their
third parties, especially if they exhibit particular demographic properties.
Overall, we test 9 personas on 556 hyper-partisan websites and find that
right-leaning websites tend to track users more intensely than left-leaning,
depending on user demographics, using both cookies and cookie synchronization
methods and leading to more costly delivered ads.

Title: Approximate Summaries for Why and Why-not Provenance (Extended Version)
Authors: Seokki Lee, Bertram Ludaescher, Boris Glavic
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  Why and why-not provenance have been studied extensively in recent years.
However, why-not provenance, and to a lesser degree why provenance, can be very
large resulting in severe scalability and usability challenges. In this paper,
we introduce a novel approximate summarization technique for provenance which
overcomes these challenges. Our approach uses patterns to encode (why-not)
provenance concisely. We develop techniques for efficiently computing
provenance summaries balancing informativeness, conciseness, and completeness.
To achieve scalability, we integrate sampling techniques into provenance
capture and summarization. Our approach is the first to scale to large datasets
and to generate comprehensive and meaningful summaries.

Title: ResilientDB: Global Scale Resilient Blockchain Fabric
Authors: Suyash Gupta, Sajjad Rahnama, Jelle Hellings, Mohammad Sadoghi
Categories: cs.DB cs.DC
Comments: To appear in Proceedings of PVLDB 2020
\\
  Recent developments in blockchain technology have inspired innovative new
designs in distributed resilient database systems. At their core, these
database systems typically use Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols to
maintain a common state across all replicas, even if some replicas are faulty
or malicious. Unfortunately, existing consensus protocols are not designed to
deal with geo-scale deployments in which many replicas spread across a
geographically large area participate in consensus. To address this, we present
the Geo-Scale Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus protocol (GeoBFT). GeoBFT is
designed for excellent scalability by using a topological-aware grouping of
replicas in local clusters, by introducing parallelization of consensus at the
local level, and by minimizing communication between clusters. To validate our
vision of high-performance geo-scale resilient database systems using GeoBFT,
we implement GeoBFT in our efficient ResilientDB blockchain and database
fabric. We show that GeoBFT is not only sound and provides great scalability,
but also outperforms state-of-the-art consensus protocols by a factor of six in
geo-scale deployments.

Title: Optimizing Query Predicates with Disjunctions for Column Stores
Authors: Albert Kim, Atalay Mert Ileri, Sam Madden
Categories: cs.DB cs.DS
\\
  Since its inception, database research has given limited attention to
optimizing predicates with disjunctions. What little past work there is has
focused on optimizations for traditional row-oriented databases. A key
difference in predicate evaluation for row stores and column stores is that
while row stores apply predicates to one record at a time, column stores apply
predicates to sets of records. Not only must the execution engine decide the
order in which to apply the predicates, but it must also decide how many times
each predicate should be applied and on which sets of records it should be
applied to. In our work, we tackle exactly this problem. We formulate, analyze,
and solve the predicate evaluation problem for column stores. Our results
include proofs about various properties of the problem, and in turn, these
properties have allowed us to derive the first polynomial-time (i.e., O(n log
n)) algorithm ShallowFish which evaluates predicates optimally for all
predicate expressions with a depth of 2 or less. We capture the exact property
which makes the problem more difficult for predicate expressions of depth 3 or
greater and propose an approximate algorithm DeepFish which outperforms
ShallowFish in these situations. Finally, we show that both ShallowFish and
DeepFish outperform the corresponding state of the art by two orders of
magnitude.

Title: To pipeline or not to pipeline, that is the question
Authors: Harshad Deshmukh, Bruhathi Sundarmurthy, Jignesh M. Patel
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  In designing query processing primitives, a crucial design choice is the
method for data transfer between two operators in a query plan. As we were
considering this critical design mechanism for an in-memory database system
that we are building, we quickly realized that (surprisingly) there isn't a
clear definition of this concept. Papers are full or ad hoc use of terms like
pipelining and blocking, but as these terms are not crisply defined, it is hard
to fully understand the results attributed to these concepts. To address this
limitation, we introduce a clear terminology for how to think about data
transfer between operators in a query pipeline. We show that there isn't a
clear definition of pipelining and blocking, and that there is a full spectrum
of techniques based on a simple concept called unit-of-transfer. Next, we
develop an analytical model for inter-operator communication, and highlight the
key parameters that impact performance (for in-memory database settings). Armed
with this model, we then apply it to the system we are designing and highlight
the insights we gathered from this exercise. We find that the gap between
pipelining and non-pipelining query execution, w.r.t. key factors such as
performance and memory footprint is quite narrow, and thus system designers
should likely rethink the notion of pipelining vs. blocking for in-memory
database systems.

Title: SciChain: Trustworthy Scientific Data Provenance
Authors: Abdullah Al-Mamun and Dongfang Zhao
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  The state-of-the-art for auditing and reproducing scientific applications on
high-performance computing (HPC) systems is through a data provenance
subsystem. While recent advances in data provenance lie in reducing the
performance overhead and improving the user's query flexibility, the fidelity
of data provenance is often overlooked: there is no such a way to ensure that
the provenance data itself has not been fabricated or falsified. This paper
advocates to leverage blockchains to deliver immutable and autonomous data
provenance services such that scientific data are trustworthy. The challenges
for adopting blockchains to HPC include designing a new blockchain architecture
compatible with the HPC platforms and, more importantly, a set of new consensus
protocols for scientific applications atop blockchains. To this end, we have
designed the proof-of-scalable-traceability (POST) protocol and implemented it
in a blockchain prototype, namely SciChain, the very first blockchain system
for HPC. We evaluated SciChain by comparing it with multiple state-of-the-art
systems; Experimental results showed that SciChain guaranteed trustworthy data
while incurring orders of magnitude lower overhead.

\\
  This paper presents PALPATINE, the first in-memory application-level cache
for Distributed Key-Value (DKV) data stores, capable of prefetching data that
is likely to be accessed in an immediate future. To predict data accesses,
PALPATINE continuously captures frequent access patterns to the back store by
means of data mining techniques. With these patterns, PALPATINE builds a
stochastic graph of accessed items, and makes prefetching decisions based on
it.
  Experimental evaluation indicates that PALPATINE can improve the latency of a
specific DKV store by more that an order of magnitude.

  This paper analyses the influence of geographic distance on knowledge flows,
measured through citations to scientific publications. Previous works using the
same approach are limited to single disciplines. In this study, we analyse the
Italian scientific production in all disciplines matured in the period
2010-2012. To calculate the geographic distances between citing and cited
publications, each one is associated with a "prevalent" territory on the basis
of the authors' affiliations. The results of the application of a gravity
model, estimated using ordinary least squares regression, show that despite the
spread of IT, geographic distance continues to be an influential factor in the
process of knowledge flows between territories. In particular, the analysis
reveals that the effect of geographic distance on knowledge flows is
significant at the national level, not negligible at the continental level, but
completely irrelevant at the intercontinental level.

Title: Algorithmic Aspects of Some Variants of Domination in Graphs

\\
  A set $S \subseteq V$ is a \textit{dominating set} in $G$ if for every $u \in
V \setminus S$, there exists $v \in S$ such that $(u,v) \in E$, i.e., $N[S] =
V$. A dominating set $S$ is an \emph{Isolate Dominating Set} (\textit{IDS}) if
the induced subgraph $G[S]$ has at least one isolated vertex. It is known that
Isolate Domination Decision problem (IDOM) is NP-complete for bipartite graphs.
In this paper, we extend this by showing that the IDOM is NP-complete for split
graphs and perfect elimination bipartite graphs, a subclass of bipartite
graphs. A set $S \subseteq V$ is an \textit{independent set} if $G[S]$ has no
edge. A set $S \subseteq V$ is a \textit{secure dominating set} of $G$ if, for
each vertex $u \in V \setminus S$, there exists a vertex $v \in S$ such that $
(u,v) \in E $ and $(S \setminus \{v\}) \cup \{u\}$ is a dominating set of $G$.
In addition, we initiate the study of a new domination parameter called,
\textit{independent secure domination}. A set $S\subseteq V$ is an
\textit{Independent Secure Dominating Set} (\textit{InSDS}) if $S$ is an
independent set and a secure dominating set of $G$. The minimum size of an
InSDS in $G$ is called the \textit{independent secure domination number} of $G$
and is denoted by $\gamma_{is}(G)$. Given a graph $ G$ and a positive integer $
k,$ the InSDM problem is to check whether $ G $ has an independent secure
dominating set of size at most $ k.$ We prove that InSDM is NP-complete for
bipartite graphs and linear time solvable for bounded tree-width graphs and
threshold graphs, a subclass of split graphs. The MInSDS problem is to find an
independent secure dominating set of minimum size, in the input graph. Finally,
we prove that the MInSDS problem is APX-hard for graphs with maximum degree
$5.$

Title: Parameterized Algorithms for Matrix Completion With Radius Constraints
Authors: Tomohiro Koana, Vincent Froese, Rolf Niedermeier
Categories: cs.DM
ACM-class: F.2.2
\\
  Considering matrices with missing entries, we study NP-hard matrix completion
problems where the resulting completed matrix shall have limited (local)
radius. In the pure radius version, this means that the goal is to fill in the
entries such that there exists a 'center string' which has Hamming distance to
all matrix rows as small as possible. In stringology, this problem is also
known as Closest String with Wildcards. In the local radius version, the
requested center string must be one of the rows of the completed matrix.
Hermelin and Rozenberg [CPM 2014, TCS 2016] performed parameterized complexity
studies for Closest String with Wildcards. We answer one of their open
questions, fix a bug concerning a fixed-parameter tractability result in their
work, and improve some upper running time bounds. For the local radius case, we
reveal a computational complexity dichotomy. In general, our results indicate
that, although being NP-hard as well, this variant often allows for faster
(fixed-parameter) algorithms.

\\
  Let $G = (V,E)$ be a simple, undirected and connected graph. A connected
(total) dominating set $S \subseteq V$ is a secure connected (total) dominating
set of $G$, if for each $ u \in V \setminus S$, there exists $v \in S$ such
that $uv \in E$ and $(S \setminus \lbrace v \rbrace) \cup \lbrace u \rbrace $
is a connected (total) dominating set of $G$. The minimum cardinality of a
secure connected (total) dominating set of $G$ denoted by $ \gamma_{sc} (G)
(\gamma_{st}(G))$, is called the secure connected (total) domination number of
$G$. In this paper, we show that the decision problems corresponding to secure
connected domination number and secure total domination number are NP-complete
even when restricted to split graphs or bipartite graphs. The NP-complete
reductions also show that these problems are w[2]-hard. We also prove that the
secure connected domination problem is linear time solvable in block graphs and
threshold graphs.

items of stochastic size are packed into $m$ bins of unit capacity. In contrast
to the classical bin packing problem, the number of bins is fixed and they can
be extended at extra cost. This problem plays an important role in stochastic
environments such as in surgery scheduling: Patients must be assigned to
operating rooms beforehand, such that the regular capacity is fully utilized
while the amount of overtime is as small as possible.
  This paper focuses on essential ratios between different classes of policies:
First, we consider the price of non-splittability, in which we compare the
optimal non-anticipatory policy against the optimal fractional assignment
policy. We show that this ratio has a tight upper bound of $2$. Moreover, we
develop an analysis of a fixed assignment variant of the LEPT rule yielding a
tight approximation ratio of $(1+e^{-1}) \approx 1.368$.
  Furthermore, we prove that the price of fixed assignments, related to the
benefit of adaptivity, which describes the loss when restricting to fixed
assignment policies, is within the same factor. This shows that in some sense,
LEPT is the best fixed assignment policy we can hope for. We also provide a
lower bound on the performance of this policy comparing against an optimal
fixed assignment policy. Finally, we obtain improved bounds for the case where
the processing times are drawn from a particular family of distributions, with
either a bounded Pietra index or when the familly is stochastically dominated
at the second order.

Title: Rigorous Guarantees for Tyler's M-estimator via quantum expansion
Authors: Cole Franks, Ankur Moitra
Categories: cs.DS math.ST stat.TH
\\
  Estimating the shape of an elliptical distribution is a fundamental problem
in statistics. One estimator for the shape matrix, Tyler's M-estimator, has
been shown to have many appealing asymptotic properties. It performs well in
numerical experiments and can be quickly computed in practice by a simple
iterative procedure. Despite the many years the estimator has been studied in
the statistics community, there was neither a non-asymptotic bound on the rate
of the estimator nor a proof that the iterative procedure converges in
polynomially many steps.
  Here we observe a surprising connection between Tyler's M-estimator and
operator scaling, which has been intensively studied in recent years in part
because of its connections to the Brascamp-Lieb inequality in analysis. We use
this connection, together with novel results on quantum expanders, to show that
Tyler's M-estimator has the optimal rate up to factors logarithmic in the
dimension, and that in the generative model the iterative procedure has a
linear convergence rate even without regularization.

Title: Solving the Joint Order Batching and Picker Routing Problem for Large
  Instances

\\
  In this work, we investigate the problem of order batching and picker routing
in warehouse storage areas. These problems are known to be capital and labour
intensive, and often contribute to a sizable fraction of warehouse operating
costs. Here, we consider the case of online grocery shopping where orders may
consist of dozens of items.
  We present the problem introduced and tackle the issue of solving the problem
heuristically with proposed methods of solving that utilize batching and
routing heuristics. Instances with up to 50 orders were solved heuristically in
large simulated warehouse instances consisting of 8 to 30 aisles, with 1 to 4
blocks. The proposed methods were shown to have relatively short computation
times as compared to optimally solving the problem in. In particular, we showed
that a proposed method which utilizes an optimal solver for routing yielded
poorer results than methods that utilize routing heuristics.

Title: Edge-cuts Optimized for Average Weight: a new alternative to Ford and

\\
  Let $G$ be a directed graph associated with a weight $w: E(G) \rightarrow
R^+$. For an edge-cut $Q$ of $G$, the average weight of $Q$ is denoted and
defined as $w_{ave}(Q)=\frac{\sum_{e\in Q}w(e)}{|Q|}$. An edge-cut of optimal
average weight is an edge-cut $Q$ such that $w_{ave}(Q)$ is maximum among all
edge-cuts (or minimum, symmetrically). In this paper, a polynomial algorithm
for this problem is proved for finding such an optimal edge-cut in a rooted
tree, separating the root and the set of all leafs. This algorithm enables us
to develop an automatic clustering method with more accurate detection of
communities embedded in a hierarchy tree structure.

Title: Faster Fully Dynamic Transitive Closure in Practice
Authors: Kathrin Hanauer, Monika Henzinger, Christian Schulz
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  The fully dynamic transitive closure problem asks to maintain reachability
information in a directed graph between arbitrary pairs of vertices, while the
graph undergoes a sequence of edge insertions and deletions. The problem has
been thoroughly investigated in theory and many specialized algorithms for
solving it have been proposed in the last decades. In two large studies
[Frigioni ea, 2001; Krommidas and Zaroliagis, 2008], a number of these
algorithms have been evaluated experimentally against simple static algorithms
for graph traversal, showing the competitiveness and even superiority of the
simple algorithms in practice, except for very dense random graphs or very high
ratios of queries. A major drawback of those studies is that only small and
mostly randomly generated graphs are considered.
  In this paper, we engineer new algorithms to maintain all-pairs reachability
information which are simple and space-efficient. Moreover, we perform an
extensive experimental evaluation on both generated and real-world instances
that are several orders of magnitude larger than those in the previous studies.
Our results indicate that our new algorithms outperform all state-of-the-art
algorithms on all types of input considerably in practice.

Title: Optimum multiplexer design in quantum-dot cellular automata
Authors: Esam Alkaldy, Ali H. Majeed, Mohd Shamian Zainal, Danial Md. Nor
Categories: cs.ET quant-ph
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is one of the most important computing
technologies for the future and will be the alternative candidate for current
CMOS technology. QCA is attracting a lot of researchers due to many features
such as high speed, small size, and low power consumption. QCA has two main
building blocks (majority gate and inverter) used for design any Boolean
function. QCA also has an inherent capability that used to design many
important gates such as XOR and Multiplexer in optimal form without following
any Boolean function. This paper presents a novel design 2:1 QCA-Multiplexer in
two forms. The proposed design is very simple, highly efficient and can be used
to produce many logical functions. The proposed design output comes from the
inherent capabilities of quantum technology. New 4:1 QCA-Multiplexer has been
built using the proposed structure. The output waveforms showed the wonderful
performance of the proposed design in terms of the number of cells, area, and
latency.

Title: Modular Simulation Framework for Process Variation Analysis of
  MRAM-based Deep Belief Networks
Authors: Paul Wood, Hossein Pourmeidani, and Ronald F. DeMara
Categories: cs.ET cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Magnetic Random-Access Memory (MRAM) based p-bit neuromorphic computing
devices are garnering increasing interest as a means to compactly and
efficiently realize machine learning operations in Restricted Boltzmann
Machines (RBMs). When embedded within an RBM resistive crossbar array, the
p-bit based neuron realizes a tunable sigmoidal activation function. Since the
stochasticity of activation is dependent on the energy barrier of the MRAM
device, it is essential to assess the impact of process variation on the
voltage-dependent behavior of the sigmoid function. Other influential
performance factors arise from varying energy barriers on power consumption
requiring a simulation environment to facilitate the multi-objective
optimization of device and network parameters. Herein, transportable Python
scripts are developed to analyze the output variation under changes in device
dimensions on the accuracy of machine learning applications. Evaluation with
RBM circuits using the MNIST dataset reveal impacts and limits for processing
variation of device fabrication in terms of the resulting energy vs. accuracy
tradeoffs, and the resulting simulation framework is available via a Creative
Commons license.

Title: Fast 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis with Discrete and Exact Layout Pattern
  Extraction
Authors: Song-Hai Zhang, Shao-Kui Zhang, Wei-Yu Xie, Cheng-Yang Luo, Hong-Bo Fu
Categories: cs.GR
\\
  We present a fast framework for indoor scene synthesis, given a room geometry
and a list of objects with learnt priors. Unlike existing data-driven
solutions, which often extract priors by co-occurrence analysis and statistical
model fitting, our method measures the strengths of spatial relations by tests
for complete spatial randomness (CSR), and extracts complex priors based on
samples with the ability to accurately represent discrete layout patterns. With
the extracted priors, our method achieves both acceleration and plausibility by
partitioning input objects into disjoint groups, followed by layout
optimization based on the Hausdorff metric. Extensive experiments show that our
framework is capable of measuring more reasonable relations among objects and
simultaneously generating varied arrangements in seconds.

Title: Sample Complexity of Incentivized Exploration
Authors: Mark Sellke, Aleksandrs Slivkins
Categories: cs.GT cs.DS cs.LG
\\
  We consider incentivized exploration: a version of multi-armed bandits where
the choice of actions is controlled by self-interested agents, and the
algorithm can only issue recommendations. The algorithm controls the flow of
information, and the information asymmetry can incentivize the agents to
explore. Prior work matches the optimal regret rates for bandits up to
"constant" multiplicative factors determined by the Bayesian prior. However,
the dependence on the prior in prior work could be arbitrarily large, and the
dependence on the number of arms K could be exponential. The optimal dependence
on the prior and K is very unclear. We make progress on these issues. Our first
result is that Thompson sampling is incentive-compatible if initialized with
enough data points. Thus, we reduce the problem of designing
incentive-compatible algorithms to that of sample complexity:
  (i) How many data points are needed to incentivize Thompson sampling?
  (ii) How many rounds does it take to collect these samples?
  We address both questions, providing upper bounds on sample complexity that
are typically polynomial in K and lower bounds that are polynomially matching.

Title: On the Complexity of Destructive Bribery in Approval-Based Multi-winner
  Voting
Authors: Yongjie Yang
Categories: cs.GT cs.MA
Comments: 19pages, to appear in AAMAS 2020
\\
  A variety of constructive manipulation, control, and bribery for
approval-based multi-winner voting have been extensively studied very recently.
However, their destructive counterparts seem to be less studied in the
literature so far. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring the complexity
of several destructive bribery problems under five prestigious approval-based
multi-winner voting rules. Generally speaking, these problems are to determine
if a number of given candidates can be excluded from any winning committees by
performing a series of modification operations yet without exceeding a given
budget. We consider five operations. We offer a complete landscape of the
complexity of the problems studied in this paper, and for NP-hard problems we
study their parameterized complexity with respect to meaningful parameters.

Title: Design Principles and Clinician Preferences for Pharmacogenomic Clinical
  Decision Support Alerts
Authors: Timothy M. Herr, PhD and Therese A. Nelson, AM, LSW and Justin B.
  Starren, MD, PhD, FACMI
Categories: cs.HC q-bio.GN
\\
  OBJECTIVE: To better understand clinician needs and preferences for the
display of pharmacogenomic (PGx) information in clinical decision support (CDS)
tools.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a semi-structured interview to collect
feedback and preferences in six key areas of PGx CDS design, from clinicians
who had prior experience with live PGx CDS tools. Eight clinicians from
Northwestern Medicine's (NM) General Internal Medicine clinic participated in
the study.
  RESULTS: Clinicians expressed preference for interruptive pop-up alerts
during order entry, brief descriptions of relevant drug-gene interactions, and
a clear and specific recommended alternative course of action when a medication
is contraindicated. They did not wish to see detailed genetic data, preferring
phenotypic information predicted from the genotype. Nor did they wish to be
interrupted when genetic test results do not indicate a change in treatment
plan. Clinicians reported little familiarity with Clinical Pharmacogenetic
Implementation Consortium prescribing recommendations but reported trusting
recommendations of their professional societies and resources like UpToDate.
Analysis of unstructured comments concurred with structured results, indicating
a general uncertainty among participants around how to interpret and apply PGx
information in practice.
  DISCUSSION: Results point to several underlying principles that can inform
future PGx CDS alert designs: Be Specific and Actionable; Be Brief; Display
Phenotypes not Genotypes; Rely on Sources Clinicians Already Trust; and, Be
Adaptable to Learning Effects.
  CONCLUSION: This study is part of a broader socio-technical design approach
to PGx CDS design underway at NM and provides a baseline for future PGx CDS
development. Designs based on these results have the potential to improve
clinician education and adherence levels, and to improve patient outcomes.

\\
  OBJECTIVE: To design and evaluate new pharmacogenomic (PGx) clinical decision
support (CDS) alerts, built to adhere to PGx CDS design principles developed
through socio-technical approaches.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on previously identified design principles, we
created 11 new PGx CDS alert designs and developed an interactive web
application containing realistic clinical scenarios and user workflows that
mimicked a real-world EHR system. We recruited General Internal Medicine and
Cardiology clinicians from Northwestern Medicine and recorded their
interactions with the original and new designs. We measured clinician response,
satisfaction, speed, and confidence through questionnaires and analysis of the
recordings.
  RESULTS: The study included 12 clinicians. Participants were significantly
more satisfied (p=0.0000001), faster (p=0.009), and more confident (p<.05) with
the new designs than the original ones. The study lacked statistical power to
determine whether prescribing accuracy was improved, but participants were no
less accurate, and clinical actions were more concordant with alert
interactions (p=0.004) with the new designs. We found a significant learning
curve associated with the original designs, which was eliminated with the new
designs.
  DISCUSSION: This study successfully demonstrates that socio-technical and
user-centered design techniques can improve PGx CDS alert designs. Best
practices for PGx CDS design are limited in the literature, with few
effectiveness studies available. These results can help guide future PGx CDS
implementations to be more clinician friendly and less time-consuming.
  CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the PGx CDS design principles
we proposed in previous work. As a next step, the new designs should be
implemented in a live setting for further validation.

Title: Using Inaudible Audio to Improve Indoor-Localization- and
  Proximity-Aware Intelligent Applications
Authors: Scott A. Carter, Daniel Avrahami, Nami Tokunaga
Categories: cs.HC
ACM-class: H.5.m
\\
  While it is often critical for indoor-location- and proximity-aware
applications to know whether a user is in a space or not (e.g., a specific room
or office), a key challenge is that the difference between standing on one side
or another of a doorway or wall is well within the error range of most RF-based
approaches. In this work, we address this challenge by augmenting RF-based
localization and proximity detection with active ultrasonic sensing, taking
advantage of the limited propagation of sound waves. This simple and
cost-effective approach can allow, for example, a Bluetooth smart-lock to
discern whether a user is inside or outside their home in order to lock or
unlock doors automatically. We describe a configurable architecture for our
solution and present experiments that validate this approach but also
demonstrate that different user behavior and application needs can impact
system configuration decisions. Finally, we describe applications that could
benefit from our solution and address privacy concerns.

  Smart city is synchronized with digital environment and its transportation is
system is vitalized with RFID sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial

ultimate usefulness of smart mobility cannot be achieved. This paper aims to
formulate the research framework for prediction of antecedents of smart
mobility by using SEM-Neural hybrid approach towards preliminary data analysis.
This research undertook smart mobility services adoption in Malaysia as study
perspective and applied the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as theoretical
basis. An extended TAM model was hypothesized with five external factors
(digital dexterity, IoT service quality, intrusiveness concerns, social
electronic word of mouth and subjective norm). The data was collected through a
pilot survey in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Then responses were analyzed for
reliability, validity and accuracy of model. Finally, the causal relationship
was explained by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Artificial Neural
Networking (ANN). The paper will share better understanding of road technology
acceptance to all stakeholders to refine, revise and update their policies. The
proposed framework will suggest a broader approach to individual level
technology acceptance.

\\
  MSstatsQC [3] is an open-source software that provides longitudinal system
suitability monitoring tools in the form of control charts for proteomic
experiments. It includes simultaneous tools for the mean and dispersion of
suitability metrics and presents alternative methods of monitoring through
different tabs that are designed in the interface. This research focuses on
investigating the usability of MSstatsQC software and the interpretability of
the designed plots.
  In this study, we ask 4 test users, from the proteomics field, to complete a
series of tasks and questionnaires. The tasks are designed to test the
usability of the software in terms of importing data files, selecting
appropriate metrics, guide set, and peptides, and finally creating decision
rules (tasks 1 and 3 in appendix). The questionnaires ask about
interpretability of the plots including control charts, box plots, heat maps,
river plots, and radar plots (tasks 1 and 4 in appendix). The goal of the
questions is to determine if the test users understand the plots and can
interpret them.
  Results show limitations in usability and plot interpretability, especially
in the data import section. We suggest the following modifications. I)
providing conspicuous guides close to the window related to up-loading a data
?file as well as providing error messages that pop-up when the data set has a
wrong format II) providing plot descriptions, hints to interpret plots, plot
titles and appropriate axis labels, and, III) Numbering tabs to show the flow
of procedures in the software.

Title: A novel approach to classify natural grasp actions by estimating muscle

Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures, conference
\\
  Developing electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI)
systems is challenging. In this study, we analyzed natural grasp actions from
EEG. Ten healthy subjects participated in this experiment. They executed and
imagined three sustained grasp actions. We proposed a novel approach which
estimates muscle activity patterns from EEG signals to improve the overall
classification accuracy. For implementation, we have recorded EEG and
electromyogram (EMG) simultaneously. Using the similarity of the estimated
pattern from EEG signals compare to the activity pattern from EMG signals
showed higher classification accuracy than competitive methods. As a result, we
obtained the average classification accuracy of 63.89($\pm$7.54)% for actual
movement and 46.96($\pm$15.30)% for motor imagery. These are 21.59% and 5.66%
higher than the result of the competitive model, respectively. This result is
encouraging, and the proposed method could potentially be used in future
applications, such as a BCI-driven robot control for handling various daily use
objects.

DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2019.2945960
\\
  The multidimensional nature of spatial data poses a challenge for
visualization. In this paper, we introduce Phoenixmap, a simple abstract
visualization method to address the issue of visualizing multiple spatial
distributions at once. The Phoenixmap approach starts by identifying the
enclosed outline of the point collection, then assigns different widths to
outline segments according to the segments' corresponding inside regions. Thus,
one 2D distribution is represented as an outline with varied thicknesses.
Phoenixmap is capable of overlaying multiple outlines and comparing them across
categories of objects in a 2D space. We chose heatmap as a benchmark spatial
visualization method and conducted user studies to compare performances among
Phoenixmap, heatmap, and dot distribution map. Based on the analysis and
participant feedback, we demonstrate that Phoenixmap 1) allows users to
perceive and compare spatial distribution data efficiently; 2) frees up
graphics space with a concise form that can provide visualization design
possibilities like overlapping; and 3) provides a good quantitative perceptual
estimating capability given the proper legends. Finally, we discuss several
possible applications of Phoenixmap and present one visualization of multiple
species of birds' active regions in a nature preserve.

  The future of transportation is driven by the use of artificial intelligence
to improve living and transportation. This paper presents a neural
network-based system for driver identification using data collected by a
smartphone. This system identifies the driver automatically, reliably and in
real-time without the need for facial recognition and also does not violate
privacy. The system architecture consists of three modules data collection,
preprocessing and identification. In the data collection module, the data of
the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors are collected using a smartphone. The
preprocessing module includes noise removal, data cleaning, and segmentation.
In this module, lost values will be retrieved and data of stopped vehicle will
be deleted. Finally, effective statistical properties are extracted from

used to identify drivers' patterns. According to experiments, the best
algorithm for driver identification is MLP with a maximum accuracy of 96%. This
solution can be used in future transportation to develop driver-based insurance
systems as well as the development of systems used to apply penalties and
incentives.

Title: Evaluating Saliency Map Explanations for Convolutional Neural Networks:
  A User Study

\\
  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer great machine learning performance
over a range of applications, but their operation is hard to interpret, even
for experts. Various explanation algorithms have been proposed to address this
issue, yet limited research effort has been reported concerning their user
evaluation. In this paper, we report on an online between-group user study
designed to evaluate the performance of "saliency maps" - a popular explanation
algorithm for image classification applications of CNNs. Our results indicate
that saliency maps produced by the LRP algorithm helped participants to learn
about some specific image features the system is sensitive to. However, the
maps seem to provide very limited help for participants to anticipate the
network's output for new images. Drawing on our findings, we highlight
implications for design and further research on explainable AI. In particular,
we argue the HCI and AI communities should look beyond instance-level
explanations.

  We introduce a novel multimodal mobile database called Hu-MIdb (Human Mobile
Interaction database) that comprises 14 mobile sensors acquired from 600 users.
The heterogene-ous flow of data generated during the interaction with the
smartphones can be used to model human behavior when in-teracting with the
technology. Based on this new dataset, we explore the capacity of smartphone
sensors to improve bot detection. We propose a CAPTCHA method based on the
analysis of the information obtained during a single drag and drop task. We
evaluate the method generating fake samples synthesized with Generative
Adversarial Neural Networks and handcrafted methods. Our results suggest the
potential of mobile sensors to characterize the human behavior and de-velop a
new generation of CAPTCHAs.

\\
  Studies combining psychotherapy with psychedelic drugs (PsiDs) have
demonstrated positive outcomes that are often associated with PsiDs' ability to
induce 'mystical-type' experiences (MTEs) - i.e., subjective experiences whose
characteristics include a sense of connectedness, transcendence, and
ineffability. We suggest that both PsiDs and virtual reality can be situated on
a broader spectrum of psychedelic technologies. To test this hypothesis, we
used concepts, methods, and analysis strategies from PsiD research to design
and evaluate 'Isness', a multi-person VR journey where participants experience
the collective emergence, fluctuation, and dissipation of their bodies as
energetic essences. A study (N=57) analyzing participant responses to a
commonly used PsiD experience questionnaire (MEQ30) indicates that Isness
participants had MTEs comparable to those reported in double-blind clinical
studies after high doses of psilocybin & LSD. Within a supportive setting and
conceptual framework, VR phenomenology can create the conditions for MTEs from
which participants derive insight and meaning.

  When working with any sort of knowledge base (KB) one has to make sure it is
as complete and also as up-to-date as possible. Both tasks are non-trivial as
they require recall-oriented efforts to determine which entities and
relationships are missing from the KB. As such they require a significant
amount of labor. Tables on the Web, on the other hand, are abundant and have
the distinct potential to assist with these tasks. In particular, we can
leverage the content in such tables to discover new entities, properties, and
relationships. Because web tables typically only contain raw textual content we
first need to determine which cells refer to which known entities---a task we
dub table-to-KB matching. This first task aims to infer table semantics by
linking table cells and heading columns to elements of a KB. Then second task
builds upon these linked entities and properties to not only identify novel
ones in the same table but also to bootstrap their type and additional
relationships. We refer to this process as novel entity discovery and, to the
best of our knowledge, it is the first endeavor on mining the unlinked cells in
web tables. Our method identifies not only out-of-KB (``novel'') information
but also novel aliases for in-KB (``known'') entities. When evaluated using
three purpose-built test collections, we find that our proposed approaches
obtain a marked improvement in terms of precision over our baselines whilst
keeping recall stable.

A vast number of tables can be found on the Web, which represents a valuable

Title: Safe Exploration for Optimizing Contextual Bandits
Authors: Rolf Jagerman and Ilya Markov and Maarten de Rijke
Categories: cs.IR
Comments: 23 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Contextual bandit problems are a natural fit for many information retrieval
tasks, such as learning to rank, text classification, recommendation, etc.
However, existing learning methods for contextual bandit problems have one of
two drawbacks: they either do not explore the space of all possible document
rankings (i.e., actions) and, thus, may miss the optimal ranking, or they
present suboptimal rankings to a user and, thus, may harm the user experience.
We introduce a new learning method for contextual bandit problems, Safe
Exploration Algorithm (SEA), which overcomes the above drawbacks. SEA starts by
using a baseline (or production) ranking system (i.e., policy), which does not
harm the user experience and, thus, is safe to execute, but has suboptimal
performance and, thus, needs to be improved. Then SEA uses counterfactual
learning to learn a new policy based on the behavior of the baseline policy.
SEA also uses high-confidence off-policy evaluation to estimate the performance
of the newly learned policy. Once the performance of the newly learned policy
is at least as good as the performance of the baseline policy, SEA starts using
the new policy to execute new actions, allowing it to actively explore
favorable regions of the action space. This way, SEA never performs worse than
the baseline policy and, thus, does not harm the user experience, while still
exploring the action space and, thus, being able to find an optimal policy. Our
experiments using text classification and document retrieval confirm the above
by comparing SEA (and a boundless variant called BSEA) to online and offline
learning methods for contextual bandit problems.

Title: IART: Intent-aware Response Ranking with Transformers in
  Information-seeking Conversation Systems
Authors: Liu Yang, Minghui Qiu, Chen Qu, Cen Chen, Jiafeng Guo, Yongfeng Zhang,

Categories: cs.IR
Comments: Accepted by WWW2020
\\
  Personal assistant systems, such as Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon
Alexa, and Microsoft Cortana, are becoming ever more widely used. Understanding
user intent such as clarification questions, potential answers and user
feedback in information-seeking conversations is critical for retrieving good
responses. In this paper, we analyze user intent patterns in
information-seeking conversations and propose an intent-aware neural response
ranking model "IART", which refers to "Intent-Aware Ranking with Transformers".
IART is built on top of the integration of user intent modeling and language
representation learning with the Transformer architecture, which relies
entirely on a self-attention mechanism instead of recurrent nets. It
incorporates intent-aware utterance attention to derive an importance weighting
scheme of utterances in conversation context with the aim of better
conversation history understanding. We conduct extensive experiments with three
information-seeking conversation data sets including both standard benchmarks
and commercial data. Our proposed model outperforms all baseline methods with
respect to a variety of metrics. We also perform case studies and analysis of
learned user intent and its impact on response ranking in information-seeking
conversations to provide interpretation of results.

Title: D\'ej\`a vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for
  Sequential Recommendation
Authors: Jibang Wu, Renqin Cai, Hongning Wang
Categories: cs.IR cs.AI
Comments: Key Words: Sequential Recommendation, Self-attention mechanism,
  Temporal Recommendation
\\
  Predicting users' preferences based on their sequential behaviors in history
is challenging and crucial for modern recommender systems. Most existing
sequential recommendation algorithms focus on transitional structure among the
sequential actions, but largely ignore the temporal and context information,
when modeling the influence of a historical event to current prediction.
  In this paper, we argue that the influence from the past events on a user's
current action should vary over the course of time and under different context.
Thus, we propose a Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism that learns to
weigh historical actions' influence on not only what action it is, but also
when and how the action took place. More specifically, to dynamically calibrate
the relative input dependence from the self-attention mechanism, we deploy
multiple parameterized kernel functions to learn various temporal dynamics, and
then use the context information to determine which of these reweighing kernels
to follow for each input. In empirical evaluations on two large public
recommendation datasets, our model consistently outperformed an extensive set
of state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.

  This tutorial paper focuses on the variants of the bottleneck problem taking
an information theoretic perspective and discusses practical methods to solve
it, as well as its connection to coding and learning aspects. The intimate
connections of this setting to remote source-coding under logarithmic loss
distortion measure, information combining, common reconstruction, the
Wyner-Ahlswede-Korner problem, the efficiency of investment information, as
well as, generalization, variational inference, representation learning,
autoencoders, and others are highlighted. We discuss its extension to the
distributed information bottleneck problem with emphasis on the Gaussian model
and highlight the basic connections to the uplink Cloud Radio Access Networks
(CRAN) with oblivious processing. For this model, the optimal trade-offs
between relevance (i.e., information) and complexity (i.e., rates) in the
discrete and vector Gaussian frameworks is determined. In the concluding
outlook, some interesting problems are mentioned such as the characterization
of the optimal inputs ("features") distributions under power limitations
maximizing the "relevance" for the Gaussian information bottleneck, under
"complexity" constraints.

Title: Exact and Robust Reconstruction of Integer Vectors Based on
  Multidimensional Chinese Remainder Theorem (MD-CRT)
Authors: Li Xiao, Xiang-Gen Xia, and Yu-Ping Wang
Categories: cs.IT cs.CR math.IT math.NT
\\
  The robust Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) has been recently proposed for
robustly reconstructing a large nonnegative integer from erroneous remainders.
It has found applications in signal processing, including phase unwrapping and
frequency estimation under sub-Nyquist sampling. Motivated by the applications
in multidimensional (MD) signal processing, in this paper we propose the MD-CRT
and robust MD-CRT for integer vectors. We derive the MD-CRT for integer vectors
with respect to a general set of moduli, which allows to uniquely reconstruct
an integer vector from its remainders, if it is in the fundamental
parallelepiped of the lattice generated by a least common right multiple of all
the moduli. For some special forms of moduli, we present explicit
reconstruction formulae. We derive the robust MD-CRT for integer vectors when
the remaining integer matrices of all the moduli left divided by their greatest
common left divisor (gcld) are pairwise commutative and coprime. Two different
reconstruction algorithms are proposed, and accordingly, two different
conditions on the remainder error bound for the reconstruction robustness are
obtained, which are related to a quarter of the minimum distance of the lattice
generated by the gcld of all the moduli or the Smith normal form of the gcld.

Title: Analysis and Optimization of an Intelligent Reflecting Surface-assisted
  System with Interference
Authors: Yuhang Jia, Chencheng Ye, Ying Cui
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IEEE ICC 2020
\\
  In this paper, we study an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted
system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) serves a single-antenna user
with the help of a multielement IRS in the presence of interference generated
by a multiantenna BS serving its own single-antenna user. The signal and
interference links via the IRS are modeled with Rician fading. To reduce phase
adjustment cost, we adopt quasi-static phase shift design where the phase
shifts do not change with the instantaneous channel state information (CSI).
Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) are adopted at the two BSs to enhance the
receive signals at their own users. First, we obtain a tractable expression of
the ergodic rate. Then, we maximize the ergodic rate with respect to the phase
shifts, leading to a non-convex optimization problem. We obtain a globally
optimal solution under certain system parameters, and propose an iterative
algorithm based on parallel coordinate descent (PCD), to obtain a stationary
point under arbitrary system parameters. Finally, we numerically verify the
analytical results and demonstrate the notable gains of the proposal solutions.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the analysis
and optimization of the ergodic rate of an IRS-assisted system in the presence
of interference.

Title: Performance Analysis of Mobile Cellular-Connected Drones under Practical
  Antenna Configurations
Authors: Ramy Amer and Walid Saad and Boris Galkin and Nicola Marchetti
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Providing seamless connectivity to unmanned aerial vehicle user equipments
(UAV-UEs) is very challenging due to the encountered line-of-sight interference
and reduced gains of down-tilted base station (BS) antennas. For instance, as
the altitude of UAV-UEs increases, their cell association and handover
procedure become driven by the side-lobes of the BS antennas. In this paper,
the performance of cellular-connected UAV-UEs is studied under 3D practical
antenna configurations. Two scenarios are studied: scenarios with static,
hovering UAV- UEs and scenarios with mobile UAV-UEs. For both scenarios, the
UAV-UE coverage probability is characterized as a function of the system
parameters. The effects of the number of antenna elements on the UAV-UE
coverage probability and handover rate of mobile UAV-UEs are then investigated.
Results reveal that the UAV-UE coverage probability under a practical antenna
pattern is worse than that under a simple antenna model. Moreover,
vertically-mobile UAV-UEs are susceptible to altitude handover due to
consecutive crossings of the nulls and peaks of the antenna side-lobes.

MSC-class: 11T71, 14G50
\\
  We prove that families of polar codes with multiple kernels over certain
symmetric channels can be viewed as polar decreasing monomial-Cartesian codes,
offering a unified treatment for such codes, over any finite field. We define
decreasing monomial-Cartesian codes as the evaluation of a set of monomials
closed under divisibility over a Cartesian product. Polar decreasing
monomial-Cartesian codes are decreasing monomial-Cartesian codes whose sets of
monomials are closed respect a partial order inspired by the recent work of
Bardet, Dragoi, Otmani, and Tillich ["Algebraic properties of polar codes from
a new polynomial formalism," 2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information
Theory (ISIT)]. Extending the main theorem of Mori and Tanaka ["Source and
Channel Polarization Over Finite Fields and Reed-Solomon Matrices," in IEEE
Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 60, no. 5, pp. 2720--2736, May 2014],
we prove that any sequence of invertible matrices over an arbitrary field
satisfying certain conditions polarizes any symmetric over the field channel.
In addition, we prove that the dual of a decreasing monomial-Cartesian code is
monomially equivalent to a decreasing monomial-Cartesian code. Defining the
minimal generating set for a set of monomials, we use it to describe the
length, dimension and minimum distance of a decreasing monomial-Cartesian code.

Title: Reflection Resource Management for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided
  Wireless Networks
Authors: Yulan Gao, Chao Yong, Zehui Xiong, Jun Zhao, Yue Xiao, Dusit Niyato
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Please feel free to contact us for questions or remarks
\\
  In this paper, the adoption of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for
multiple single-antenna source terminal (ST)-DT pairs in two-hop networks is
investigated. Different from the previous studies on IRS that merely focused on
tuning the reflection coefficient of all the reflection elements at IRS, in
this paper, we consider the true reflection resource management. Specifically,
the true reflection resource management can be realized via trigger module
selection based on our proposed IRS architecture that all the reflection
elements are partially controlled by multiple parallel switches of controller.
As the number of reflection elements increases, the true reflection resource
management will become urgently needed in this context, which is due to the
non-ignorable energy consumption. Moreover, the proposed modular architecture
of IRS is designed to make the reflection elements part independent and
controllable. As such, our goal is to maximize the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at DTs via a joint trigger
module subset selection, transmit power allocation of STs, and the
corresponding passive beamforming of the trigger modules, subject to per ST
power budgets and module size constraint. Whereas this problem is NP-hard due
to the module size constraint, to deal with it, we transform the hard module
size constraint into the group sparse constraint by introducing the mixed row
block norm, which yields a suitable semidefinite relaxation. Additionally, the
parallel alternating direction method of multipliers (PADMM) is proposed to
identify the trigger module subset, and then subsequently the transmit power
allocation and passive beamforming can be obtained by solving the original
minimum SINR maximization problem without the group sparse constraint via
partial linearization for generalized fractional programs.

Title: Multiuser Scheduling for Minimizing Age of Information in Uplink MIMO
  Systems
Authors: He Chen, Qian Wang, Zheng Dong, Ning Zhang
Categories: cs.IT cs.NI math.IT
\\
  This paper concerns the user scheduling problem in a multiuser multiple-input
multi-output (MIMO) status update system, in which multiple single-antenna
devices aim to send their latest statuses to a multiple-antenna
information-fusion access point (AP) via a shared wireless channel. The
information freshness in the considered system is quantified by a recently
proposed metric, termed age of information (AoI). Thanks to the extra spatial
degrees-of-freedom brought about by the multiple antennas at the AP, multiple
devices can be granted to transmit simultaneously in each time slot. We aim to
seek the optimal scheduling policy that can minimize the network-wide AoI by
optimally deciding which device or group of devices to be scheduled for
transmission in each slot given the instantaneous AoI values of all devices at
the beginning of the said slot. To that end, we formulate the multiuser
scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). We attain the optimal
policy by resolving the formulated MDP problem and develop a low-complexity
sub-optimal policy. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal and
sub-optimal policies significantly outperform the state-of-the-art benchmark
schemes.

  In this work, we present a cloud-aided uplink framework for multi-way

simultaneously transmit to each other aided by relays. We also investigate
relay selection techniques for the proposed cloud-aided uplink framework that

develop a novel multi-way relay selection protocol based on the selection of
the best link, denoted as Multi-Way Cloud-Aided Best-User-Link
(MWC-Best-User-Link). We then devise the maximum minimum distance relay
selection criterion along with the algorithm that is incorporated into the

outperforms previous works in terms of average delay, sum-rate and bit error

Title: InfoCommit: Information-Theoretic Polynomial Commitment and Verification
Authors: Saeid Sahraei and Salman Avestimehr
Categories: cs.IT cs.CR math.IT
\\
  We introduce InfoCommit, a protocol for polynomial commitment and
verification. InfoCommit consists of two phases. An initial commitment phase
and an evaluation phase. During the commitment phase, the verifier and the
prover engage in a private two-party computation algorithm so that the verifier
extracts a private verification key. In the evaluation phase, the verifier is
interested in learning the evaluations of the polynomial at several input
points. InfoCommit has four main features. Firstly, the verifier is able to
detect, with high probability, if the prover has responded with evaluations of
the same polynomial that he has initially committed to. Secondly, InfoCommit
provides rigorous privacy guarantees for the prover: upon observing the initial
commitment and the response provided by the prover to $m$ evaluation requests,
the verifier only learns $O(m^2)$ symbols about the coefficients of the
polynomial. Thirdly, the verifiability guarantee is unconditional and without
the need for a trusted party, while "bounded storage" is the only assumption
underlying the privacy of the algorithm. In particular, both properties hold
regardless of the computation power of the two parties. Lastly, InfoCommit is
doubly-efficient in the sense that in the evaluation phase, the verifier runs
in $O(\sqrt{d})$ and the prover runs in $O(d)$, where $d-1$ is the degree of
the polynomial.

Title: Common Information Components Analysis
Authors: Michael Gastpar and Erixhen Sula
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure. Presented at the 2020 Information Theory and
  Applications (ITA) Workshop, San Diego, CA, USA, February 2-7, 2020
\\
  We give an information-theoretic interpretation of Canonical Correlation
Analysis (CCA) via (relaxed) Wyner's common information. CCA permits to extract
from two high-dimensional data sets low-dimensional descriptions (features)
that capture the commonalities between the data sets, using a framework of
correlations and linear transforms. Our interpretation first extracts the
common information up to a pre-selected resolution level, and then projects
this back onto each of the data sets. In the case of Gaussian statistics, this
procedure precisely reduces to CCA, where the resolution level specifies the
number of CCA components that are extracted. This also suggests a novel
algorithm, Common Information Components Analysis (CICA), with several
desirable features, including a natural extension to beyond just two data sets.

Title: Towards an Operational Definition of Group Network Codes
Authors: Fei Wei, Michael Langberg, Michelle Effros
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Group network codes are a generalization of linear codes that have seen
several studies over the last decade. When studying network codes, operations
performed at internal network nodes called local encoding functions, are of
significant interest. While local encoding functions of linear codes are well
understood (and of operational significance), no similar operational definition
exists for group network codes. To bridge this gap, we study the connections
between group network codes and a family of codes called Coordinate-Wise-Linear
(CWL) codes. CWL codes generalize linear codes and, in addition, can be defined
locally (i.e., operationally). In this work, we study the connection between
CWL codes and group codes from both a local and global encoding perspective. We
show that Abelian group codes can be expressed as CWL codes and, as a result,
they inherit an operational definition.

Title: Hypercomplex-Valued Recurrent Correlation Neural Networks
Authors: Marcos Eduardo Valle and Rodolfo Anibal Lobo
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  Recurrent correlation neural networks (RCNNs), introduced by Chiueh and
Goodman as an improved version of the bipolar correlation-based Hopfield neural
network, can be used to implement high-capacity associative memories. In this
paper, we extend the bipolar RCNNs for processing hypercomplex-valued data.
Precisely, we present the mathematical background for a broad class of
hypercomplex-valued RCNNs. Then, we provide the necessary conditions which
ensure that a hypercomplex-valued RCNN always settles at an equilibrium using
either synchronous or asynchronous update modes. Examples with bipolar,
complex, hyperbolic, quaternion, and octonion-valued RCNNs are given to
illustrate the theoretical results. Finally, computational experiments confirm
the potential application of hypercomplex-valued RCNNs as associative memories
designed for the storage and recall of gray-scale images.

Title: On Implicit Regularization in $\beta$-VAEs
Authors: Abhishek Kumar, Ben Poole
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  While the impact of variational inference (VI) on posterior inference in a
fixed generative model is well-characterized, its role in regularizing a
learned generative model when used in variational autoencoders (VAEs) is poorly
understood. We study the regularizing effects of variational distributions on
learning in generative models from two perspectives. First, we analyze the role
that the choice of variational family plays in imparting uniqueness to the
learned model by restricting the set of optimal generative models. Second, we
study the regularization effect of the variational family on the local geometry
of the decoding model. This analysis uncovers the regularizer implicit in the
$\beta$-VAE objective, and leads to an approximation consisting of a
deterministic autoencoding objective plus analytic regularizers that depend on
the Hessian or Jacobian of the decoding model, unifying VAEs with recent
heuristics proposed for training regularized autoencoders. We empirically
verify these findings, observing that the proposed deterministic objective
indeed exhibits similar behavior to the $\beta$-VAE in terms of objective value
and sample quality on CelebA and MNIST.

Title: Improving the Detection of Burnt Areas in Remote Sensing using
  Hyper-features Evolved by M3GP
Authors: Jo\~ao E. Batista, Sara Silva
Categories: cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML
\\
  One problem found when working with satellite images is the radiometric
variations across the image and different images. Intending to improve remote
sensing models for the classification of burnt areas, we set two objectives.
The first is to understand the relationship between feature spaces and the
predictive ability of the models, allowing us to explain the differences
between learning and generalization when training and testing in different
datasets. We find that training on datasets built from more than one image
provides models that generalize better. These results are explained by
visualizing the dispersion of values on the feature space. The second objective
is to evolve hyper-features that improve the performance of different
classifiers on a variety of test sets. We find the hyper-features to be
beneficial, and obtain the best models with XGBoost, even if the hyper-features
are optimized for a different method.

Title: Last Iterate is Slower than Averaged Iterate in Smooth Convex-Concave
  Saddle Point Problems
Authors: Noah Golowich, Sarath Pattathil, Constantinos Daskalakis, Asuman
  Ozdaglar
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
Comments: 25 pages
\\
  In this paper we study the smooth convex-concave saddle point problem.
Specifically, we analyze the last iterate convergence properties of the
Extragradient (EG) algorithm. It is well known that the ergodic (averaged)
iterates of EG converge at a rate of $O(1/T)$ (Nemirovski, 2004). In this
paper, we show that the last iterate of EG converges at a rate of
$O(1/\sqrt{T})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to
provide a convergence rate guarantee for the last iterate of EG for the smooth
convex-concave saddle point problem. Moreover, we show that this rate is tight
by proving a lower bound of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{T})$ for the last iterate. This
lower bound therefore shows a quadratic separation of the convergence rates of
ergodic and last iterates in smooth convex-concave saddle point problems.

Title: Evolving Loss Functions With Multivariate Taylor Polynomial
  Parameterizations
Authors: Santiago Gonzalez and Risto Miikkulainen
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  Loss function optimization for neural networks has recently emerged as a new
direction for metalearning, with Genetic Loss Optimization (GLO) providing a
general approach for the discovery and optimization of such functions. GLO
represents loss functions as trees that are evolved and further optimized using
evolutionary strategies. However, searching in this space is difficult because
most candidates are not valid loss functions. In this paper, a new technique,
Multivariate Taylor expansion-based genetic loss-function optimization
(TaylorGLO), is introduced to solve this problem. It represents functions using
a novel parameterization based on Taylor expansions, making the search more
effective. TaylorGLO is able to find new loss functions that outperform those
found by GLO in many fewer generations, demonstrating that loss function
optimization is a productive avenue for metalearning.

Title: Simultaneous Skull Conductivity and Focal Source Imaging from EEG
  Recordings with the help of Bayesian Uncertainty Modelling
Authors: Alexandra Koulouri and Ville Rimpilainen
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.AP stat.ML
\\
  The electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging problem is very sensitive to
the electrical modelling of the skull of the patient under examination.
Unfortunately, the currently available EEG devices and their embedded software
do not take this into account; instead, it is common to use a literature-based
skull conductivity parameter. In this paper, we propose a statistical method
based on the Bayesian approximation error approach to compensate for source
imaging errors due to the unknown skull conductivity and, simultaneously, to
compute a low-order estimate for the actual skull conductivity value. By using
simulated EEG data that corresponds to focal source activity, we demonstrate
the potential of the method to reconstruct the underlying focal sources and
low-order errors induced by the unknown skull conductivity. Subsequently, the
estimated errors are used to approximate the skull conductivity. The results
indicate clear improvements in the source localization accuracy and feasible
skull conductivity estimates.

  We study the problem of regret minimization in partially observable linear
quadratic control systems when the model dynamics are unknown a priori. We

Markov parameters and then follows the principle of optimism in the face of
uncertainty to design a controller. We propose a novel way to decompose the
regret and provide an end-to-end sublinear regret upper bound for partially

and establish a regret upper bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ for
ExpCommit, where $T$ is the time horizon of the problem.

Title: Physics-Guided Deep Neural Networks for PowerFlow Analysis
Authors: Xinyue Hu, Haoji Hu, Saurabh Verma, Zhi-Li Zhang
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Solving power flow (PF) equations is the basis of power flow analysis, which
is important in determining the best operation of existing systems, performing
security analysis, etc. However, PF equations can be out-of-date or even
unavailable due to system dynamics and uncertainties, making traditional
numerical approaches infeasible. To address these concerns, researchers have
proposed data-driven approaches to solve the PF problem by learning the mapping
rules from historical system operation data. Nevertheless, prior data-driven
approaches suffer from poor performance and generalizability, due to overly
simplified assumptions of the PF problem or ignorance of physical laws
governing power systems. In this paper, we propose a physics-guided neural
network to solve the PF problem, with an auxiliary task to rebuild the PF
model. By encoding different granularity of Kirchhoff's laws and system
topology into the rebuilt PF model, our neural-network based PF solver is
regularized by the auxiliary task and constrained by the physical laws. The
simulation results show that our physics-guided neural network methods achieve
better performance and generalizability compared to existing unconstrained
data-driven approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the weight matrices of
our physics-guided neural networks embody power system physics by showing their
similarities with the bus admittance matrices.

\\
  Bundling, the practice of jointly selling two or more products at a discount,
is a widely used strategy in industry and a well examined concept in academia.
Historically, the focus has been on theoretical studies in the context of
monopolistic firms and assumed product relationships, e.g., complementarity in
usage. We develop a new machine-learning-driven methodology for designing
bundles in a large-scale, cross-category retail setting. We leverage historical
purchases and consideration sets created from clickstream data to generate
dense continuous representations of products called embeddings. We then put
minimal structure on these embeddings and develop heuristics for
complementarity and substitutability among products. Subsequently, we use the
heuristics to create multiple bundles for each product and test their
performance using a field experiment with a large retailer. We combine the
results from the experiment with product embeddings using a hierarchical model
that maps bundle features to their purchase likelihood, as measured by the
add-to-cart rate. We find that our embeddings-based heuristics are strong
predictors of bundle success, robust across product categories, and generalize
well to the retailer's entire assortment.

Title: Periodic Intra-Ensemble Knowledge Distillation for Reinforcement
  Learning
Authors: Zhang-Wei Hong, Prabhat Nagarajan, Guilherme Maeda
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Off-policy ensemble reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated
impressive results across a range of RL benchmark tasks. Recent works suggest
that directly imitating experts' policies in a supervised manner before or
during the course of training enables faster policy improvement for an RL
agent. Motivated by these recent insights, we propose Periodic Intra-Ensemble
Knowledge Distillation (PIEKD). PIEKD is a learning framework that uses an
ensemble of policies to act in the environment while periodically sharing
knowledge amongst policies in the ensemble through knowledge distillation. Our
experiments demonstrate that PIEKD improves upon a state-of-the-art RL method
in sample efficiency on several challenging MuJoCo benchmark tasks.
Additionally, we perform ablation studies to better understand PIEKD.

Comments: 24 pages, including 2 pages of references and 10 pages of appendix
\\
  In machine learning, it is common to optimize the parameters of a
probabilistic model, modulated by a somewhat ad hoc regularization term that
penalizes some values of the parameters. Regularization terms appear naturally
in Variational Inference (VI), a tractable way to approximate Bayesian
posteriors: the loss to optimize contains a Kullback--Leibler divergence term
between the approximate posterior and a Bayesian prior. We fully characterize
which regularizers can arise this way, and provide a systematic way to compute
the corresponding prior. This viewpoint also provides a prediction for useful
values of the regularization factor in neural networks. We apply this framework
to regularizers such as L1 or group-Lasso.

\\
  Granger causality is a fundamental technique for causal inference in time
series data, commonly used in the social and biological sciences. Typical
operationalizations of Granger causality make a strong assumption that every
time point of the effect time series is influenced by a combination of other
time series with a fixed time delay. The assumption of fixed time delay also
exists in Transfer Entropy, which is considered to be a non-linear version of
Granger causality. However, the assumption of the fixed time delay does not
hold in many applications, such as collective behavior, financial markets, and
many natural phenomena. To address this issue, we develop variable-lag Granger
causality and Transfer Entropy, generalizations of both Granger causality and
Transfer Entropy that relax the assumption of the fixed time delay and allows
causes to influence effects with arbitrary time delays. In addition, we propose
a method for inferring both variable-lag Granger causality and Transfer Entropy
relations. We demonstrate our approach on an application for studying
coordinated collective behavior and other real-world casual-inference datasets
and show that our proposed approaches perform better than several existing
methods in both simulated and real-world datasets. Our approach can be applied
in any domain of time series analysis. The software of this work is available
in the R package: VLTimeSeriesCausality.

Title: Learning to Detect Malicious Clients for Robust Federated Learning
Authors: Suyi Li, Yong Cheng, Wei Wang, Yang Liu, Tianjian Chen
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Federated learning systems are vulnerable to attacks from malicious clients.
As the central server in the system cannot govern the behaviors of the clients,
a rogue client may initiate an attack by sending malicious model updates to the
server, so as to degrade the learning performance or enforce targeted model
poisoning attacks (a.k.a. backdoor attacks). Therefore, timely detecting these
malicious model updates and the underlying attackers becomes critically
important. In this work, we propose a new framework for robust federated
learning where the central server learns to detect and remove the malicious
model updates using a powerful detection model, leading to targeted defense. We
evaluate our solution in both image classification and sentiment analysis tasks
with a variety of machine learning models. Experimental results show that our
solution ensures robust federated learning that is resilient to both the
Byzantine attacks and the targeted model poisoning attacks.

Title: Thompson Sampling Algorithms for Mean-Variance Bandits
Authors: Qiuyu Zhu and Vincent Y. F. Tan
Categories: cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
Comments: 26 pages, 10 figures
\\
  The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a classical learning task that
exemplifies the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. However, standard
formulations do not take into account risk. In online decision making systems,
risk is a primary concern. In this regard, the mean-variance risk measure is
one of the most common objective functions. Existing algorithms for
mean-variance optimization in the context of MAB problems have unrealistic
assumptions on the reward distributions. We develop Thompson Sampling-style
algorithms for mean-variance MAB and provide comprehensive regret analyses for
Gaussian and Bernoulli bandits with fewer assumptions. Our algorithms achieve
the best known regret bounds for mean-variance MABs and also attain the
information-theoretic bounds in some parameter regimes. Empirical simulations
show that our algorithms significantly outperform existing LCB-based algorithms
for all risk tolerances.

  Graph neural networks are currently leading the performance charts in
learning-based molecule property prediction and classification. Computational
chemistry has, therefore, become the a prominent testbed for generic graph
neural networks, as well as for specialized message passing methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that the replacement of the underlying networks with
hypernetworks leads to a boost in performance, obtaining state of the art
results in various benchmarks. A major difficulty in the application of
hypernetworks is their lack of stability. We tackle this by combining the
current message and the first message. A recent work has tackled the training
instability of hypernetworks in the context of error correcting codes, by
replacing the activation function of the message passing network with a
low-order Taylor approximation of it. We demonstrate that our generic solution
can replace this domain-specific solution.

\\
  A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic
relationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with
statistical techniques, the graphical model has several advantages for data
analysis. One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it
readily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian
network can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to
gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of
intervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and probabilistic
semantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which
often comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in
conjunction with Bayesian networks offer an efficient and principled approach
for avoiding the overfitting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for
constructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian
statistical methods for using data to improve these models. With regard to the
latter task, we describe methods for learning both the parameters and structure
of a Bayesian network, including techniques for learning with incomplete data.
In addition, we relate Bayesian-network methods for learning to techniques for
supervised and unsupervised learning. We illustrate the graphical-modeling
approach using a real-world case study.

Title: A Corrective View of Neural Networks: Representation, Memorization and
  Learning
Authors: Guy Bresler and Dheeraj Nagaraj
Categories: cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
Comments: Contains 2 figures (you heard that right!)
\\
  We develop a corrective mechanism for neural network approximation: the total
available non-linear units are divided into multiple groups and the first group
approximates the function under consideration, the second group approximates
the error in approximation produced by the first group and corrects it, the
third group approximates the error produced by the first and second groups
together and so on. This technique yields several new representation and
learning results for neural networks. First, we show that two-layer neural
networks in the random features regime (RF) can memorize arbitrary labels for
arbitrary points under under Euclidean distance separation condition using
$\tilde{O}(n)$ ReLU or Step activation functions which is optimal in $n$ up to
logarithmic factors. Next, we give a powerful representation result for
two-layer neural networks with ReLU and smoothed ReLU units which can achieve a
squared error of at most $\epsilon$ with $O(C(a,d)\epsilon^{-1/(a+1)})$ for $a
\in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ when the function is smooth enough (roughly when it
has $\Theta(ad)$ bounded derivatives). In certain cases $d$ can be replaced
with effective dimension $q \ll d$. Previous results of this type implement
Taylor series approximation using deep architectures. We also consider
three-layer neural networks and show that the corrective mechanism yields
faster representation rates for smooth radial functions. Lastly, we obtain the
first $O(\mathrm{subpoly}(1/\epsilon))$ upper bound on the number of neurons
required for a two layer network to learn low degree polynomials up to squared
error $\epsilon$ via gradient descent. Even though deep networks can express
these polynomials with $O(\mathrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon))$ neurons, the best
learning bounds on this problem require $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ neurons.

education, medicine and psychology. However, for medium to large datasets,
contemporary solutions pose a tradeoff: either have bayesian, interpretable,
accurate estimates or have fast computation. We introduce variational inference
and deep generative models to Item Response Theory to offer the best of both
worlds. The resulting algorithm is (a) orders of magnitude faster when
inferring on the classical model, (b) naturally extends to more complicated
input than binary correct/incorrect, and more expressive deep bayesian models
of responses. Applying this method to five large-scale item response datasets
from cognitive science and education, we find improvements in imputing missing
data and better log likelihoods. The open-source algorithm is immediately
usable.

Title: Efficient and Robust Algorithms for Adversarial Linear Contextual
  Bandits
Authors: Gergely Neu, Julia Olkhovskaya
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We consider an adversarial variant of the classic $K$-armed linear contextual
bandit problem where the sequence of loss functions associated with each arm
are allowed to change without restriction over time. Under the assumption that
the $d$-dimensional contexts are generated i.i.d.~at random from a known
distributions, we develop computationally efficient algorithms based on the
classic Exp3 algorithm. Our first algorithm, RealLinExp3, is shown to achieve a
regret guarantee of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{KdT})$ over $T$ rounds, which matches
the best available bound for this problem. Our second algorithm, RobustLinExp3,
is shown to be robust to misspecification, in that it achieves a regret bound
of $\widetilde{O}((Kd)^{1/3}T^{2/3}) + \varepsilon \sqrt{d} T$ if the true
reward function is linear up to an additive nonlinear error uniformly bounded
in absolute value by $\varepsilon$. To our knowledge, our performance
guarantees constitute the very first results on this problem setting.

Title: Brainstorming Generative Adversarial Networks (BGANs): Towards
  Multi-Agent Generative Models with Distributed Private Datasets
Authors: Aidin Ferdowsi and Walid Saad
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables
\\
  To achieve a high learning accuracy, generative adversarial networks (GANs)
must be fed by large datasets that adequately represent the data space.
However, in many scenarios, the available datasets may be limited and
distributed across multiple agents, each of which is seeking to learn the
distribution of the data on its own. In such scenarios, the local datasets are
inherently private and agents often do not wish to share them. In this paper,
to address this multi-agent GAN problem, a novel brainstorming GAN (BGAN)
architecture is proposed using which multiple agents can generate real-like
data samples while operating in a fully distributed manner and preserving their
data privacy. BGAN allows the agents to gain information from other agents
without sharing their real datasets but by "brainstorming" via the sharing of
their generated data samples. Therefore, the proposed BGAN yields a higher
accuracy compared with a standalone GAN model and its architecture is fully
distributed and does not need any centralized controller. Moreover, BGANs are
shown to be scalable and not dependent on the hyperparameters of the agents'
deep neural networks (DNNs) thus enabling the agents to have different DNN
architectures. Theoretically, the interactions between BGAN agents are analyzed
as a game whose unique Nash equilibrium is derived. Experimental results show
that BGAN can generate real-like data samples with higher quality compared to
other distributed GAN architectures.

Title: A Closer Look at Small-loss Bounds for Bandits with Graph Feedback
Authors: Chung-Wei Lee, Haipeng Luo, Mengxiao Zhang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We study small-loss bounds for the adversarial multi-armed bandits problem
with graph feedback, that is, adaptive regret bounds that depend on the loss of
the best arm or related quantities, instead of the total number of rounds. We
derive the first small-loss bound for general strongly observable graphs,
resolving an open problem proposed in (Lykouris et al., 2018). Specifically, we
develop an algorithm with regret $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{\kappa L_*})$ where
$\kappa$ is the clique partition number and $L_*$ is the loss of the best arm,
and for the special case where every arm has a self-loop, we improve the regret
to $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\min\{\sqrt{\alpha T}, \sqrt{\kappa L_*}\})$ where
$\alpha \leq \kappa$ is the independence number. Our results significantly
improve and extend those by Lykouris et al. (2018) who only consider self-aware
undirected graphs.
  Furthermore, we also take the first attempt at deriving small-loss bounds for
weakly observable graphs. We first prove that no typical small-loss bounds are
achievable in this case, and then propose algorithms with alternative
small-loss bounds in terms of the loss of some specific subset of arms. A
surprising side result is that $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret is
achievable even for weakly observable graphs as long as the best arm has a
self-loop.
  Our algorithms are based on the Online Mirror Descent framework but require a
suite of novel techniques that might be of independent interest. Moreover, all
our algorithms can be made parameter-free without the knowledge of the
environment.

Title: EM Algorithm is Sample-Optimal for Learning Mixtures of Well-Separated
  Gaussians
Authors: Jeongyeol Kwon, Constantine Caramanis
Categories: cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
Comments: 56 pages
\\
  We consider the problem of spherical Gaussian Mixture models with $k \geq 3$
components when the components are well separated. A fundamental previous
result established that separation of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log k})$ is necessary and
sufficient for identifiability of the parameters with polynomial sample
complexity (Regev and Vijayaraghavan, 2017). We show that
$\tilde{O}(kd/\epsilon^2)$ samples suffice, closing the gap from polynomial to
linear, and thus giving the first sample-optimal upper bound for the parameter
estimation of well-separated Gaussian mixtures (up to logarithmic factors). We
accomplish this by proving a new result for the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm: we show that EM converges locally, under separation
$\Omega(\sqrt{\log k})$. The previous best-known guarantee required
$\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ separation (Yan, et al., 2017). Unlike prior work, our
results do not assume or use prior knowledge of the (potentially different)
mixing weights or variances of the Gaussian components. Furthermore, our
results show that the finite-sample error of EM does not depend on
non-universal quantities such as pairwise distances between means of Gaussian
components.

Title: SQWA: Stochastic Quantized Weight Averaging for Improving the
  Generalization Capability of Low-Precision Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Sungho Shin, Yoonho Boo, Wonyong Sung
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Designing a deep neural network (DNN) with good generalization capability is
a complex process especially when the weights are severely quantized. Model
averaging is a promising approach for achieving the good generalization
capability of DNNs, especially when the loss surface for training contains many
sharp minima. We present a new quantized neural network optimization approach,
stochastic quantized weight averaging (SQWA), to design low-precision DNNs with
good generalization capability using model averaging. The proposed approach
includes (1) floating-point model training, (2) direct quantization of weights,
(3) capturing multiple low-precision models during retraining with cyclical
learning rates, (4) averaging the captured models, and (5) re-quantizing the
averaged model and fine-tuning it with low-learning rates. Additionally, we
present a loss-visualization technique on the quantized weight domain to
clearly elucidate the behavior of the proposed method. Visualization results
indicate that a quantized DNN (QDNN) optimized with the proposed approach is
located near the center of the flat minimum in the loss surface. With SQWA
training, we achieved state-of-the-art results for 2-bit QDNNs on CIFAR-100 and
ImageNet datasets. Although we only employed a uniform quantization scheme for
the sake of implementation in VLSI or low-precision neural processing units,
the performance achieved exceeded those of previous studies employing
non-uniform quantization.

\\
  In adversarial imitation learning, a discriminator is trained to
differentiate agent episodes from expert demonstrations representing the
desired behavior. However, as the trained policy learns to be more successful,
the negative examples (the ones produced by the agent) become increasingly
similar to expert ones. Despite the fact that the task is successfully
accomplished in some of the agent's trajectories, the discriminator is trained
to output low values for them. We hypothesize that this inconsistent training
signal for the discriminator can impede its learning, and consequently leads to
worse overall performance of the agent. We show experimental evidence for this
hypothesis and that the 'False Negatives' (i.e. successful agent episodes)
significantly hinder adversarial imitation learning, which is the first
contribution of this paper. Then, we propose a method to alleviate the impact
of false negatives and test it on the BabyAI environment. This method
consistently improves sample efficiency over the baselines by at least an order
of magnitude.

Title: Choice Set Optimization Under Discrete Choice Models of Group Decisions
Authors: Kiran Tomlinson and Austin R. Benson
Categories: cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML
\\
  The way that people make choices or exhibit preferences can be strongly
affected by the set of available alternatives, often called the choice set.
Furthermore, there are usually heterogeneous preferences, either at an
individual level within small groups or within sub-populations of large groups.
Given the availability of choice data, there are now many models that capture
this behavior in order to make effective predictions. However, there is little
work in understanding how directly changing the choice set can be used to
influence a group's preferences or decisions. Here, we use discrete choice
modeling to develop an optimization framework of such interventions for several
problems of group influence, including maximizing agreement or disagreement and
promoting a particular choice. We show that these problems are NP-hard in
general but imposing restrictions reveals a fundamental boundary: promoting an
item is easier than maximizing agreement or disagreement. After, we design
approximation algorithms for the hard problems and show that they work
extremely well for real-world choice data.

Title: Overfitting Can Be Harmless for Basis Pursuit: Only to a Degree
Authors: Peizhong Ju, Xiaojun Lin, Jia Liu
Categories: cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  Recently, there have been significant interests in studying the
generalization power of linear regression models in the overparameterized
regime, with the hope that such analysis may provide the first step towards
understanding why overparameterized deep neural networks generalize well even
when they overfit the training data. Studies on min $\ell_2$-norm solutions
that overfit the training data have suggested that such solutions exhibit the
"double-descent" behavior, i.e., the test error decreases with the number of
features $p$ in the overparameterized regime when $p$ is larger than the number
of samples $n$. However, for linear models with i.i.d. Gaussian features, for
large $p$ the model errors of such min $\ell_2$-norm solutions approach the
"null risk," i.e., the error of a trivial estimator that always outputs zero,
even when the noise is very low. In contrast, we studied the overfitting
solution of min $\ell_1$-norm, which is known as Basis Pursuit (BP) in the
compressed sensing literature. Under a sparse true linear model with i.i.d.
Gaussian features, we show that for a large range of $p$ up to a limit that
grows exponentially with $n$, with high probability the model error of BP is
upper bounded by a value that decreases with $p$ and is proportional to the
noise level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result in the
literature showing that, without any explicit regularization in such settings
where both $p$ and the dimension of data are much larger than $n$, the test
errors of a practical-to-compute overfitting solution can exhibit
double-descent and approach the order of the noise level independently of the
null risk. Our upper bound also reveals a descent floor for BP that is
proportional to the noise level. Further, this descent floor is independent of
$n$ and the null risk, but increases with the sparsity level of the true model.

Title: Active Learning for Identification of Linear Dynamical Systems
Authors: Andrew Wagenmaker and Kevin Jamieson
Categories: cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
\\
  We propose an algorithm to actively estimate the parameters of a linear
dynamical system. Given complete control over the system's input, our algorithm
adaptively chooses the inputs to accelerate estimation. We show a finite time
bound quantifying the estimation rate our algorithm attains and prove matching
upper and lower bounds which guarantee its asymptotic optimality, up to
constants. In addition, we show that this optimal rate is unattainable when
using Gaussian noise to excite the system, even with optimally tuned
covariance, and analyze several examples where our algorithm provably improves
over rates obtained by playing noise. Our analysis critically relies on a novel
result quantifying the error in estimating the parameters of a dynamical system
when arbitrary periodic inputs are being played. We conclude with numerical
examples that illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in practice.

Title: Accelerating Cooperative Planning for Automated Vehicles with Learned
  Heuristics and Monte Carlo Tree Search
Authors: Karl Kurzer, Marcus Fechner and J. Marius Z\"ollner
Categories: cs.LG cs.MA cs.RO stat.ML
\\
  Efficient driving in urban traffic scenarios requires foresight. The
observation of other traffic participants, and the inference of their possible
next actions depending on the own action is considered cooperative prediction
and planning. Humans are well equipped with the capability to predict the
actions of multiple interacting traffic participants and plan accordingly,
without the need to directly communicate with others. Prior work has shown that
it is possible to achieve effective cooperative planning without the need for
explicit communication. However, the search space for cooperative plans is so
large that the vast amount of the computational budget is spent on exploring
the search space in unpromising regions that are far away from the solution. To
accelerate the planning process, we combined learned heuristics with a
cooperative planning method in order to guide the search towards regions with
promising actions, yielding better results at lower computational costs.

Title: Robust saliency maps with decoy-enhanced saliency score
Authors: Yang Lu, Wenbo Guo, Xinyu Xing, William Stafford Noble
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Saliency methods help to make deep neural network predictions more
interpretable by identifying particular features, such as pixels in an image,
that contribute most strongly to the network's prediction. Unfortunately,
recent evidence suggests that many saliency methods perform poorly when
gradients are saturated or in the presence of strong inter-feature dependence
or noise injected by an adversarial attack. In this work, we propose to infer
robust saliency scores by integrating the saliency scores of a set of decoys
with a novel decoy-enhanced saliency score, in which the decoys are generated
by either solving an optimization problem or blurring the original input. We
theoretically analyze that our method compensates for gradient saturation and
considers joint activation patterns of pixels. We also apply our method to
three different CNNs---VGGNet, AlexNet, and ResNet trained on ImageNet data
set. The empirical results show both qualitatively and quantitatively that our
method outperforms raw scores produced by three existing saliency methods, even
in the presence of adversarial attacks.

  Winograd's minimal filtering algorithm has been widely used in Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) to reduce the number of multiplications for faster
processing. However, it is only effective on convolutions with kernel size as
3x3 and stride as 1, because it suffers from significantly increased FLOPs and
numerical accuracy problem for kernel size larger than 3x3 and fails on
convolution with stride larger than 1. In this paper, we propose a novel
Decomposable Winograd Method (DWM), which breaks through the limitation of
original Winograd's minimal filtering algorithm to a wide and general
convolutions. DWM decomposes kernels with large size or large stride to several
small kernels with stride as 1 for further applying Winograd method, so that
DWM can reduce the number of multiplications while keeping the numerical
accuracy. It enables the fast exploring of larger kernel size and larger stride
value in CNNs for high performance and accuracy and even the potential for new
CNNs. Comparing against the original Winograd, the proposed DWM is able to
support all kinds of convolutions with a speedup of ~2, without affecting the
numerical accuracy.

\\
  Recent years have witnessed an abundance of new publications and approaches
on meta-learning. This community-wide enthusiasm has sparked great insights but
has also created a plethora of seemingly different frameworks, which can be
hard to compare and evaluate. In this paper, we aim to provide a principled,
unifying framework by revisiting and strengthening the connection between
meta-learning and traditional supervised learning. By treating pairs of
task-specific data sets and target models as (feature, label) samples, we can
reduce many meta-learning algorithms to instances of supervised learning. This
view not only unifies meta-learning into an intuitive and practical framework
but also allows us to transfer insights from supervised learning directly to
improve meta-learning. For example, we obtain a better understanding of
generalization properties, and we can readily transfer well-understood
techniques, such as model ensemble, pre-training, joint training, data
augmentation, and even nearest neighbor based methods. We provide an intuitive
analogy of these methods in the context of meta-learning and show that they
give rise to significant improvements in model performance on few-shot
learning.

Title: Prophet: Proactive Candidate-Selection for Federated Learning by
  Predicting the Qualities of Training and Reporting Phases
Authors: Huawei Huang, Kangying Lin, Song Guo, Pan Zhou, Zibin Zheng
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Federated Learning (FL) is viewed as a promising technique for future
distributed machine learning. It permits a large number of mobile devices
participating in the training of a global model collaboratively without having
to expose their local private data. Although the challenge of the network
connection will be much relieved in 5G/B5G era, the training latency is still
an obstacle preventing FL from being largely adopted. One of the most
fundamental problems that leads to large training latency is the bad
candidate-selection of FL participants. To the best of our knowledge, the
existing candidate-selection algorithms belong to the reactive manner. Under
such reactive selection, the FL parameter server only knows the
currently-observed resources of all candidates. In the dynamic FL environment,
the mobile devices selected by the reactive candidate-selection algorithms very
possibly fail to complete the training and reporting phases of FL. To this end,
we study the proactive candidate-selection for FL in this paper. We first let
each candidate device locally predict the qualities of both its training and
reporting phases using the LSTM network. Then, the proposed candidate-selection
algorithm is implemented by the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework,
which can adapt to the dynamically varying factors in the metropolitan edge
computing environment. Finally, the real-world trace-driven experiments prove
that the proposed proactive approach outperforms the existing reactive
algorithms with respect to the ratio of valid participants and the test
accuracy of the aggregated global FL model.

Title: Effective Diversity in Population-Based Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Jack Parker-Holder and Aldo Pacchiano and Krzysztof Choromanski and
  Stephen Roberts
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Maintaining a population of solutions has been shown to increase exploration
in reinforcement learning, typically attributed to the greater diversity of
behaviors considered. One such class of methods, novelty search, considers
further boosting diversity across agents via a multi-objective optimization
formulation. Despite the intuitive appeal, these mechanisms have several
shortcomings. First, they make use of mean field updates, which induce cycling
behaviors. Second, they often rely on handcrafted behavior characterizations,
which require domain knowledge. Furthermore, boosting diversity often has a
detrimental impact on optimizing already fruitful behaviors for rewards.
Setting the relative importance of novelty- versus reward-factor is usually
hardcoded or requires tedious tuning/annealing. In this paper, we introduce a
novel measure of population-wide diversity, leveraging ideas from Determinantal
Point Processes. We combine this in a principled fashion with the reward
function to adapt to the degree of diversity during training, borrowing ideas
from online learning. Combined with task-agnostic behavioral embeddings, we
show this approach outperforms previous methods for multi-objective
optimization, as well as vanilla algorithms solely optimizing for rewards.

Title: Dynamic Parameter Allocation in Parameter Servers
Authors: Alexander Renz-Wieland, Rainer Gemulla, Steffen Zeuch, Volker Markl
Categories: cs.LG cs.DB cs.DC stat.ML
\\
  To keep up with increasing dataset sizes and model complexity, distributed
training has become a necessity for large machine learning tasks. Parameter
servers ease the implementation of distributed parameter management---a key
concern in distributed training---, but can induce severe communication
overhead. To reduce communication overhead, distributed machine learning
algorithms use techniques to increase parameter access locality (PAL),
achieving up to linear speed-ups. We found that existing parameter servers
provide only limited support for PAL techniques, however, and therefore prevent
efficient training. In this paper, we explore whether and to what extent PAL
techniques can be supported, and whether such support is beneficial. We propose
to integrate dynamic parameter allocation into parameter servers, describe an
efficient implementation of such a parameter server called Lapse, and
experimentally compare its performance to existing parameter servers across a
number of machine learning tasks. We found that Lapse provides near linear
scaling and can be orders of magnitude faster than existing parameter servers.

(ESC-CNN) for time series forecasting task, which builds the network
architecture adaptively. The ESC strategy suggests that random filters and
neurons of the error-feedback fully connected layer are incrementally added in
a manner that they can steadily compensate the prediction error during the
construction process, and a filter selection strategy is introduced to secure
that ESC-CNN holds the universal approximation property, providing helpful
information at each iterative process for the prediction. The performance of
ESC-CNN is justified on its prediction accuracy for one-step-ahead and
multi-step-ahead forecasting tasks. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic
dataset and two real-world datasets show that the proposed ESC-CNN not only
outperforms the state-of-art random neural networks, but also exhibits strong
predictive power in comparison to trained Convolution Neural Networks and Long
Short-Term Memory models, demonstrating the effectiveness of ESC-CNN in time
series forecasting.

Title: Elaborating on Learned Demonstrations with Temporal Logic Specifications
Authors: Craig Innes, Subramanian Ramamoorthy
Categories: cs.LG cs.RO stat.ML
\\
  Most current methods for learning from demonstrations assume that those
demonstrations alone are sufficient to learn the underlying task. This is often
untrue, especially if extra safety specifications exist which were not present
in the original demonstrations. In this paper, we allow an expert to elaborate
on their original demonstration with additional specification information using
linear temporal logic (LTL). Our system converts LTL specifications into a
differentiable loss. This loss is then used to learn a dynamic movement
primitive that satisfies the underlying specification, while remaining close to
the original demonstration. Further, by leveraging adversarial training, our
system learns to robustly satisfy the given LTL specification on unseen inputs,
not just those seen in training. We show that our method is expressive enough
to work across a variety of common movement specification patterns such as
obstacle avoidance, patrolling, keeping steady, and speed limitation. In
addition, we show that our system can modify a base demonstration with complex
specifications by incrementally composing multiple simpler specifications. We
also implement our system on a PR-2 robot to show how a demonstrator can start
with an initial (sub-optimal) demonstration, then interactively improve task
success by including additional specifications enforced with our differentiable
LTL loss.

Title: Explainable Subgraphs with Surprising Densities: A Subgroup Discovery
  Approach
Authors: Junning Deng, Bo Kang, Jefrey Lijffijt, Tijl De Bie
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The connectivity structure of graphs is typically related to the attributes
of the nodes. In social networks for example, the probability of a friendship
between two people depends on their attributes, such as their age, address, and
hobbies. The connectivity of a graph can thus possibly be understood in terms
of patterns of the form 'the subgroup of individuals with properties X are
often (or rarely) friends with individuals in another subgroup with properties
Y'. Such rules present potentially actionable and generalizable insights into
the graph. We present a method that finds pairs of node subgroups between which
the edge density is interestingly high or low, using an information-theoretic
definition of interestingness. This interestingness is quantified subjectively,
to contrast with prior information an analyst may have about the graph. This
view immediately enables iterative mining of such patterns. Our work
generalizes prior work on dense subgraph mining (i.e. subgraphs induced by a
single subgroup). Moreover, not only is the proposed method more general, we
also demonstrate considerable practical advantages for the single subgroup
special case.

  One goal in Bayesian machine learning is to encode prior knowledge into prior
distributions, to model data efficiently. We consider prior knowledge from
systems of linear (partial and ordinary) differential equations together with
their boundary conditions. We construct multi-output Gaussian process priors
with realizations dense in the solution set of such systems, in particular any
solution (and only such solutions) can be represented to arbitrary precision by
Gaussian process regression. The construction is fully algorithmic via
Gr\"obner bases and it does not employ any approximation. It builds these
priors combining two parametrizations via a pullback: the first parametrizes
the solutions for the system of differential equations and the second
parametrizes all functions adhering to the boundary conditions.

Title: Knowledge Graph Embedding for Link Prediction: A Comparative Analysis

Categories: cs.LG cs.DB stat.ML
\\
  Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have found many applications in industry and academic
settings, which in turn, have motivated considerable research efforts towards
large-scale information extraction from a variety of sources. Despite such
efforts, it is well known that even state-of-the-art KGs suffer from
incompleteness. Link Prediction (LP), the task of predicting missing facts
among entities already a KG, is a promising and widely studied task aimed at
addressing KG incompleteness. Among the recent LP techniques, those based on KG
embeddings have achieved very promising performances in some benchmarks.
Despite the fast growing literature in the subject, insufficient attention has
been paid to the effect of the various design choices in those methods.
Moreover, the standard practice in this area is to report accuracy by
aggregating over a large number of test facts in which some entities are
over-represented; this allows LP methods to exhibit good performance by just
attending to structural properties that include such entities, while ignoring
the remaining majority of the KG. This analysis provides a comprehensive
comparison of embedding-based LP methods, extending the dimensions of analysis
beyond what is commonly available in the literature. We experimentally compare
effectiveness and efficiency of 16 state-of-the-art methods, consider a
rule-based baseline, and report detailed analysis over the most popular
benchmarks in the literature.

  Stochastic Approximation (SA) is a popular approach for solving fixed point
equations where the information is corrupted by noise. In this paper, we
consider an SA involving a contraction mapping with respect to an arbitrary
norm, and show its finite-sample bound for using either constant or diminishing
step sizes. The idea is to construct a smooth Lyapunov function using the
generalized Moreau envelope, and show that the iterates of SA are contracting
in expectation with respect to that Lyapunov function. The result is applicable
to various Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. In particular, we use it to
establish the first-known convergence rate of the V-trace algorithm for the
off-policy TD-Learning [15], and improve the existing bound for the tabular
$Q$-Learning algorithm. Further, for these two applications, our construction
of the Lyapunov functions results in only a logarithmic dependence of the
convergence bound on the state-space dimension.

\\
  Non-volatile memory, such as resistive RAM (RRAM), is an emerging
energy-efficient storage, especially for low-power machine learning models on
the edge. It is reported, however, that the bit error rate of RRAMs can be up
to 3.3% in the ultra low-power setting, which might be crucial for many use
cases. Binary neural networks (BNNs), a resource efficient variant of neural
networks (NNs), can tolerate a certain percentage of errors without a loss in
accuracy and demand lower resources in computation and storage. The bit error
tolerance (BET) in BNNs can be achieved by flipping the weight signs during
training, as proposed by Hirtzlin et al., but their method has a significant
drawback, especially for fully connected neural networks (FCNN): The FCNNs
overfit to the error rate used in training, which leads to low accuracy under
lower error rates. In addition, the underlying principles of BET are not
investigated. In this work, we improve the training for BET of BNNs and aim to
explain this property. We propose straight-through gradient approximation to
improve the weight-sign-flip training, by which BNNs adapt less to the bit
error rates. To explain the achieved robustness, we define a metric that aims
to measure BET without fault injection. We evaluate the metric and find that it
correlates with accuracy over error rate for all FCNNs tested. Finally, we
explore the influence of a novel regularizer that optimizes with respect to
this metric, with the aim of providing a configurable trade-off in accuracy and
BET.

  We study the system IFP of intuitionistic fixed point logic, an extension of
intuitionistic first-order logic by strictly positive inductive and coinductive
definitions. We define a realizability interpretation of IFP and use it to
extract computational content from proofs about abstract structures specified
by arbitrary classically true disjunction free formulas. The interpretation is
shown to be sound with respect to a domain-theoretic denotational semantics and
a corresponding lazy operational semantics of a functional language for
extracted programs. We also show how extracted programs can be translated into
Haskell. As an application we extract a program converting the signed digit
representation of real numbers to infinite Gray-code from a proof of inclusion
of the corresponding coinductive predicates.

Title: Treating for-Loops as First-Class Citizens in Proofs
Authors: Nathan Wasser and Dominic Steinh\"ofel
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  Indexed loop scopes have been shown to be a helpful tool in creating sound
loop invariant rules in dynamic logic for programming languages with abrupt
completion, such as Java. These rules do not require program transformation of
the loop body, as other approaches to dealing with abrupt completion do.
However, indexed loop scopes were designed specifically to provide a loop
invariant rule for while loops and work rather opaquely. Here we propose
replacing indexed loop scopes with a more transparent solution, which also lets
us extend this idea from while loops to for loops. We further present sound
loop unrolling rules for while, do and for loops, which require neither program
transformation of the loop body, nor the use of nested modalities. This
approach allows for loops to be treated as first-class citizens in proofs --
rather than the usual approach of transforming for loops into while loops --
which makes semi-automated proofs more transparent and easier to follow for the
user, whose interactions may be required in order to close the proofs.

Title: Multi-Modal Music Information Retrieval: Augmenting Audio-Analysis with
  Visual Computing for Improved Music Video Analysis
Authors: Alexander Schindler
Categories: cs.MM cs.CV cs.IR cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: Dissertation at TU Wien
\\
  This thesis combines audio-analysis with computer vision to approach Music
Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks from a multi-modal perspective. This thesis
focuses on the information provided by the visual layer of music videos and how
it can be harnessed to augment and improve tasks of the MIR research domain.
The main hypothesis of this work is based on the observation that certain
expressive categories such as genre or theme can be recognized on the basis of
the visual content alone, without the sound being heard. This leads to the
hypothesis that there exists a visual language that is used to express mood or
genre. In a further consequence it can be concluded that this visual
information is music related and thus should be beneficial for the
corresponding MIR tasks such as music genre classification or mood recognition.
A series of comprehensive experiments and evaluations are conducted which are
focused on the extraction of visual information and its application in
different MIR tasks. A custom dataset is created, suitable to develop and test
visual features which are able to represent music related information.
Evaluations range from low-level visual features to high-level concepts
retrieved by means of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Additionally, new
visual features are introduced capturing rhythmic visual patterns. In all of
these experiments the audio-based results serve as benchmark for the visual and
audio-visual approaches. The experiments are conducted for three MIR tasks
Artist Identification, Music Genre Classification and Cross-Genre
Classification. Experiments show that an audio-visual approach harnessing
high-level semantic information gained from visual concept detection,
outperforms audio-only genre-classification accuracy by 16.43%.

Title: Optimal Transport Based Seismic Inversion: Beyond Cycle Skipping
Authors: Bjorn Engquist and Yunan Yang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.OC
Comments: 36 pages, 20 figures; paper submitted
\\
  Full waveform inversion (FWI) is today a standard process for the inverse
problem of seismic imaging. PDE-constrained optimization is used to determine
unknown parameters in a wave equation that represent geophysical properties.
The objective function measures the misfit between the observed data and the
calculated synthetic data, and it has traditionally been the least-squares
norm. In a sequence of papers, we introduced the Wasserstein metric from
optimal transport as an alternative misfit function for mitigating the
so-called cycle skipping, which is the trapping of the optimization process in
local minima. In this paper, we first give a sharper theorem regarding the
convexity of the Wasserstein metric as the objective function. We then focus on
two new issues beyond cycle skipping. One is the necessary normalization of
turning a seismic signal into probability measure, and the other is inversion
for parameters below reflecting interfaces. For the first, we propose a class
of normalizations and prove several favorable properties for this class. For
the latter, we demonstrate that FWI using optimal transport can recover
geophysical properties from domains where no seismic waves travel through. We
finally illustrate these properties by the realistic application of imaging
salt inclusions, which has been a significant challenge in exploration
geophysics.

Title: An embedded variable step IMEX scheme for the incompressible

Authors: Victor DeCaria and Michael Schneier
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 25 pages, 8 figures
\\
  This report presents a series of implicit-explicit (IMEX) variable timestep
algorithms for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). With the
advent of new computer architectures there has been growing demand for low
memory solvers of this type. The addition of time adaptivity improves the
accuracy and greatly enhances the efficiency of the algorithm. We prove energy
stability of an embedded first-second order IMEX pair. For the first order
member of the pair, we prove stability for variable stepsizes, and analyze
convergence. We believe this to be the first proof of this type for a variable
step IMEX scheme for the incompressible NSE. We then define and test a variable
stepsize, variable order IMEX scheme using these methods. Our work contributes
several firsts for IMEX NSE schemes, including an energy argument and error
analysis of a two-step, variable stepsize method, and embedded error estimation
for an IMEX multi-step method.

Authors: Tim Mitchell
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.OC
Comments: Initial version
\\
  We analyze existing methods for computing the numerical radius and introduce
improved algorithms. Current methods include level-set and cutting-plane based
approaches, but until now, no formal convergence rate results have been
established for these techniques. We first introduce an improved level-set
method that is often significantly faster than the existing approach of Mengi
and Overton. We then establish the first rate of convergence results for any
numerical radius method, showing how the convergence of Uhlig's cutting-plane
method varies from superlinear to linear based on the normalized curvature at
outermost points in the field of values. Moreover, we introduce a more
efficient cutting-plane method whose convergence rate we also derive. Finally,
as cutting-plane methods become very expensive when the field of values closely
resembles a circular disk centered at the origin, we introduce a third
algorithm combining both approaches to remain efficient in all cases.

eliminated, which drastically reduces the system size. We derive both the local

symmetric positive definite. The theoretical stability results are confirmed
with numerical experiments as is the accuracy of the method.

Title: Deep synthesis regularization of inverse problems
Authors: Daniel Obmann, Johannes Schwab and Markus Haltmeier
Categories: math.NA cs.LG cs.NA
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Trans. Image Processing
\\
  Recently, a large number of efficient deep learning methods for solving
inverse problems have been developed and show outstanding numerical
performance. For these deep learning methods, however, a solid theoretical
foundation in the form of reconstruction guarantees is missing. In contrast,
for classical reconstruction methods, such as convex variational and
frame-based regularization, theoretical convergence and convergence rate
results are well established. In this paper, we introduce deep synthesis
regularization (DESYRE) using neural networks as nonlinear synthesis operator
bridging the gap between these two worlds. The proposed method allows to
exploit the deep learning benefits of being well adjustable to available
training data and on the other hand comes with a solid mathematical foundation.
We present a complete convergence analysis with convergence rates for the
proposed deep synthesis regularization. We present a strategy for constructing
a synthesis network as part of an analysis-synthesis sequence together with an
appropriate training strategy. Numerical results show the plausibility of our
approach.

\\
  The exploration of complex physical or technological processes usually
requires exploiting available information from different sources: (i) physical
laws often represented as a family of parameter dependent partial differential
equations and (ii) data provided by measurement devices or sensors. The amount
of sensors is typically limited and data acquisition may be expensive and in
some cases even harmful. This article reviews some recent developments for this
"small-data" scenario where inversion is strongly aggravated by the typically
large parametric dimensionality. The proposed concepts may be viewed as
exploring alternatives to Bayesian inversion in favor of more deterministic
accuracy quantification related to the required computational complexity. We
discuss optimality criteria which delineate intrinsic information limits, and
highlight the role of reduced models for developing efficient computational
strategies. In particular, the need to adapt the reduced models -- not to a
specific (possibly noisy) data set but rather to the sensor system -- is a
central theme. This, in turn, is facilitated by exploiting geometric
perspectives based on proper stable variational formulations of the continuous
model.

Title: The generalized scalar auxiliary variable approach (G-SAV) for gradient
  flows
Authors: Qing Cheng
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We establish a general framework for developing, efficient energy stable
numerical schemes for gradient flows and develop three classes of generalized
scalar auxiliary variable approaches (G-SAV). Numerical schemes based on the
G-SAV approaches are as efficient as the original SAV schemes
\cite{SXY19,cheng2018multiple} for gradient flows, i.e., only require solving
linear equations with constant coefficients at each time step, can be
unconditionally energy stable. But G-SAV approaches remove the definition
restriction that auxiliary variables can only be square root function. The
definition form of auxiliary variable is applicable to any reversible function
for G-SAV approaches . Ample numerical results for phase field models are
presented to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed G-SAV
numerical schemes.

Title: A Kernel-Based Explicit Unconditionally Stable Scheme for
  Hamilton-Jacobi Equations on Nonuniform Meshes
Authors: Andrew Christlieb, William Sands and Hyoseon Yang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  In \cite{christlieb2019kernel}, the authors developed a class of high-order
numerical schemes for the Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equations, which are
unconditionally stable, yet take the form of an explicit scheme. This paper
extends such schemes, so that they are more effective at capturing sharp
gradients, especially on nonuniform meshes. In particular, we modify the
weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methodology in the previously
developed schemes by incorporating an exponential basis and adapting the
previously developed nonlinear filters used to control oscillations. The main
advantages of the proposed schemes are their effectiveness and simplicity,
since they can be easily implemented on higher-dimensional nonuniform meshes.
We perform numerical experiments on a collection of examples, including H-J
equations with linear, nonlinear, convex and non-convex Hamiltonians. To
demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed schemes, we also include test
problems defined on non-trivial geometry.

badly conditioned and have numerous additional degrees of freedom (DOF)
compared with the FEM because of introduction of enriched functions. In this
paper, we develop an approach to establish a subspace of a conventional
GFEM/XFEM approximation space using partition of unity (PU) techniques and
local least square procedures. The proposed GFEM is referred to as condensed
GFEM (CGFEM), which (i) possesses as many DOFs as the preliminary FEM, (ii)
enjoys similar approximation properties with the GFEM/XFEM, and (iii) is
well-conditioned in a sense that its conditioning is of the same order as that
of the FEM. The fundamental approximation properties of CGFEM is proven
mathematically. The CGFEM is applied to a problem of high order polynomial
approximations and a Poisson crack problem; optimal convergence orders of the
former are proven rigorously. The numerical experiments and comparisons with
the conventional GFEM/XFEM and FEM are made to verify the theory and
effectiveness of CGFEM.

Title: Asymptotic spectra of large (grid) graphs with a uniform local structure
Authors: Andrea Adriani, Davide Bianchi, Stefano Serra-Capizzano
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We are concerned with sequences of graphs having a grid geometry, with a
uniform local structure in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset {\mathbb R}^d$,
$d\ge 1$. We assume $\Omega$ to be Lebesgue measurable with regular boundary
and contained, for convenience, in the cube $[0,1]^d$. When $\Omega=[0,1]$,
such graphs include the standard Toeplitz graphs and, for $\Omega=[0,1]^d$, the
considered class includes $d$-level Toeplitz graphs. In the general case, the
underlying sequence of adjacency matrices has a canonical eigenvalue
distribution, in the Weyl sense, and we show that we can associate to it a
symbol $f$. The knowledge of the symbol and of its basic analytical features
provide many informations on the eigenvalue structure, of localization,
spectral gap, clustering, and distribution type. Few generalizations are also
considered in connection with the notion of generalized locally Toeplitz
sequences and applications are discussed, stemming e.g. from the approximation
of differential operators via numerical schemes.

  the work is written in the Julia programming language, and it can be

\\
  We introduce a new multilevel ensemble Kalman filtering method (MLEnKF) which
consists of a hierarchy of samples of the ensemble Kalman filter method (EnKF)
using local-level Kalman gains. This new MLEnKF method is fundamentally
different from the preexisting method introduced by Hoel, Law and Tempone in
2016, and it is also suitable for extensions towards multi-index Monte Carlo
based filtering methods. Robust theoretical analysis and supporting numerical
examples show that under appropriate regularity assumptions, the MLEnKF method
has better complexity asymptotically, in the large-ensemble and
small-numerical-resolution limit, for weak approximations of quantities of
interest than EnKF. The method is developed for discrete-time filtering
problems with a finite-dimensional state space and partial, linear observations
polluted by additive Gaussian noise.

Title: An explicit univariate and radical parametrization of the septic proper

Authors: Heinz-Joachim Rack, Robert Vajda

\\
  The problem of determining an explicit one-parameter power form
representation of the proper $n$-th degree Zolotarev polynomials on $[-1,1]$
can be traced back to P. L. Chebyshev. It turned out to be complicated, even
for small values of $n$. Such a representation was known to A. A. Markov (1889)
for $n=2$ and $n=3$. But already for $n=4$ it seems that nobody really believed
that an explicit form can be found. As a matter of fact it was, by V. A. Markov
in 1892, as A. Shadrin put it in 2004. The next higher degrees, $n=5$ and
$n=6$, were resolved only recently, by G. Grasegger and N. Th. Vo (2017)
respectively by the present authors (2019). In this paper we settle the case
$n=7$ using symbolic computation. The parametrization for the degrees $n\in
\{2,3,4\}$ is a rational one, whereas for $n\in \{5,6,7\}$ it is a radical one.
However, the case $n=7$ among the radical parametrizations requires special
attention, since it is not a simple radical one.

Title: Variational projector-augmented wave method: a full-potential approach
  for electronic structure calculations in solid-state physics
Authors: Mi-Song Dupuy
Categories: math.NA cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.NA math-ph math.MP
Comments: 29 pages, 4 figures
\\
  In solid-state physics, energies of crystals are usually computed with a
plane-wave discretization of Kohn-Sham equations. However the presence of
Coulomb singularities requires the use of large plane-wave cut-offs to produce
accurate numerical results. In this paper, an analysis of the plane-wave
convergence of the eigenvalues of periodic linear Hamiltonians with Coulomb
potentials using the variational projector-augmented wave (VPAW) method is
presented. In the VPAW method, an invertible transformation is applied to the
original eigenvalue problem, acting locally in balls centered at the
singularities. In this setting, a generalized eigenvalue problem needs to be
solved using plane-waves. We show that cusps of the eigenfunctions of the VPAW
eigenvalue problem at the positions of the nuclei are significantly reduced.
These eigenfunctions have however a higher-order derivative discontinuity at
the spheres centered at the nuclei. By balancing both sources of error, we show
that the VPAW method can drastically improve the plane-wave convergence of the
eigenvalues with a minor additional computational cost. Numerical tests are
provided confirming the efficiency of the method to treat Coulomb
singularities.

Title: A Relaxation Argument for Optimization in Neural Networks and Non-Convex
  Compressed Sensing
Authors: G. Welper
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 90C26, 94A12, 68T05
\\
  It has been observed in practical applications and in theoretical analysis
that over-parametrization helps to find good minima in neural network training.
Similarly, in this article we study widening and deepening neural networks by a
relaxation argument so that the enlarged networks are rich enough to run $r$
copies of parts of the original network in parallel, without necessarily
achieving zero training error as in over-parametrized scenarios. The partial
copies can be combined in $r^\theta$ possible ways for layer width $\theta$.
Therefore, the enlarged networks can potentially achieve the best training
error of $r^\theta$ random initializations, but it is not immediately clear if
this can be realized via gradient descent or similar training methods.
  The same construction can be applied to other optimization problems by
introducing a similar layered structure. We apply this idea to non-convex
compressed sensing, where we show that in some scenarios we can realize the
$r^\theta$ times increased chance to obtain a global optimum by solving a
convex optimization problem of dimension $r\theta$.

Title: Algorithms for 2D Mesh Decomposition in Distributed Design Optimization
Authors: Shuvodeep De, Rakesh K. Kapania
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 17 Pages, 11 figures, Parts presented in WCCM XIII
\\
  Optimization of thin-walled structures like an aircraft wing, aircraft
fuselage or submarine hull often involves dividing the shell surface into
numerous localized panels, each characterized by its own set of design
variables. The process of extracting information about a localized panel (nodal
coordinates, mesh connectivity) from a finite element model, input file is
usually a problem-specific task. In this work, a generalized process to extract
localized panels from the two-dimensional (2D) mesh is discussed. The process
employs set operations on elemental connectivity information and is independent
of nodal coordinates. Thus, it is capable of extracting panel of any shape
given the boundary and thus can be used during optimization of a wide range of
structures. A method to create stiffeners on the resulting local panels is also
presented, and the effect of stiffener element size on buckling is studied. The
local panel extraction process is demonstrated by integrating it into a
distributed MDO framework for optimization of an aircraft wing having
curvilinear spars and ribs (SpaRibs). A range of examples is included wherein
the process is used to create panels on the wing-skin, bounded by adjacent
SpaRibs.

Title: Semi-active $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ damping optimization by adaptive
  interpolation
Authors: Zoran Tomljanovi\'c and Matthias Voigt
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 93C15, 65F15
\\
  In this work we consider the problem of semi-active damping optimization of
mechanical systems with fixed damper positions. Our goal is to compute a
damping that is locally optimal with respect to the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm
of the transfer function from the exogenous inputs to the performance outputs.
We make use of a new greedy method for computing the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm
of a transfer function based on rational interpolation. In this paper, this
approach is adapted to parameter-dependent transfer functions. The
interpolation leads to parametric reduced-order models that can be optimized
more efficiently. At the optimizers we then take new interpolation points to
refine the reduced-order model and to obtain updated optimizers. In our
numerical examples we show that this approach normally converges fast and thus
can highly accelerate the optimization procedure. Another contribution of this
work are heuristics for choosing initial interpolation points.

poses the combined computational challenges of high oscillations and high
dimensions. This paper reviews and studies numerical approaches that are robust

continuous superpositions of both thawed and frozen Gaussians, and Wigner
function approaches to the direct computation of expectation values of
observables. Making good use of classical mechanics is essential for all these
approaches. The arising aspects of time integration and high-dimensional

  We consider the problem of reconstructing a nanocrystal at atomic resolution
from electron microscopy images taken at a few tilt angles. A popular
reconstruction approach called discrete tomography confines the atom locations
to a coarse spatial grid, which is inspired by the physical a priori knowledge
that atoms in a crystalline solid tend to form regular lattices. Although this
constraint has proven to be powerful for solving this very under-determined
inverse problem in many cases, its key limitation is that, in practice, defects
may occur that cause atoms to deviate from regular lattice positions. Here we
propose a grid-free discrete tomography algorithm that allows for continuous
deviations of the atom locations similar to super-resolution approaches for
microscopy. The new formulation allows us to define atomic interaction
potentials explicitly, which results in a both meaningful and powerful
incorporation of the available physical a priori knowledge about the crystal's
properties. In computational experiments, we compare the proposed grid-free
method to established grid-based approaches and show that our approach can
indeed recover the atom positions more accurately for common lattice defects.

  High-order discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs)
necessitate high-order time integration schemes capable of handling both stiff
and nonstiff operators in an efficient manner. Implicit-explicit (IMEX)
integration based on general linear methods (GLMs) offers an attractive
solution due to their high stage and method order, as well as excellent
stability properties. The IMEX characteristic allows stiff terms to be treated
implicitly and nonstiff terms to be efficiently integrated explicitly. This
work develops two systematic approaches for the development of IMEX GLMs of
arbitrary order with stages that can be solved in parallel. The first approach
is based on diagonally implicit multistage integration methods (DIMSIMs) of
types 3 and 4. The second is a parallel generalization of IMEX Euler and has
the interesting feature that the linear stability is independent of the order
of accuracy. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical rates of convergence
and reveal that the new schemes are more efficient than serial IMEX GLMs and
IMEX Runge-Kutta methods.

both natural and laser guide stars, as well as arbitrary aperture shapes. Based

Title: A power Schur complement Low-Rank correction preconditioner for general
  sparse linear systems
Authors: Qingqing Zheng, Yuanzhe Xi, Yousef Saad
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  An effective power based parallel preconditioner is proposed for general
large sparse linear systems. The preconditioner combines a power series
expansion method with some low-rank correction techniques, where the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula is utilized. A matrix splitting of the Schur
complement is proposed to expand the power series. The number of terms used in
the power series expansion can control the approximation accuracy of the
preconditioner to the inverse of the Schur complement. To construct the
preconditioner, graph partitioning is invoked to reorder the original
coefficient matrix, leading to a special block two-by-two matrix whose two
off-diagonal submatrices are block diagonal. Variables corresponding to
interface variables are obtained by solving a linear system with the coeffcient
matrix being the Schur complement. For the variables related to the interior
variables, one only needs to solve a block diagonal linear system. This can be
performed efficiently in parallel. Various numerical examples are provided to
illustrate that the efficiency of the proposed preconditioner.

\\
  Noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) decodes brain signals to
understand user intention. Recent advances have been developed for the
BCI-based drone control system as the demand for drone control increases.
Especially, drone swarm control based on brain signals could provide various
industries such as military service or industry disaster. This paper presents a
prototype of a brain swarm interface system for a variety of scenarios using a
visual imagery paradigm. We designed the experimental environment that could
acquire brain signals under a drone swarm control simulator environment.
Through the system, we collected the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with
respect to four different scenarios. Seven subjects participated in our
experiment and evaluated classification performances using the basic machine
learning algorithm. The grand average classification accuracy is higher than
the chance level accuracy. Hence, we could confirm the feasibility of the drone

  NeuroEvolution is one of the most competitive evolutionary learning
frameworks for designing novel neural networks for use in specific tasks, such
as logic circuit design and digital gaming. However, the application of
benchmark methods such as the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
remains a challenge, in terms of their computational cost and search time
inefficiency. This paper advances a method which incorporates a type of
topological edge coding, named Reverse Encoding Tree (RET), for evolving
scalable neural networks efficiently. Using RET, two types of approaches --
NEAT with Binary search encoding (Bi-NEAT) and NEAT with Golden-Section search
encoding (GS-NEAT) -- have been designed to solve problems in benchmark
continuous learning environments such as logic gates, Cartpole, and Lunar
Lander, and tested against classical NEAT and FS-NEAT as baselines.
Additionally, we conduct a robustness test to evaluate the resilience of the
proposed NEAT algorithms. The results show that the two proposed strategies
deliver an improved performance, characterized by (1) a higher accumulated
reward within a finite number of time steps; (2) using fewer episodes to solve
problems in targeted environments, and (3) maintaining adaptive robustness
under noisy perturbations, which outperform the baselines in all tested cases.
Our analysis also demonstrates that RET expends potential future research
directions in dynamic environments. Code is available from

Title: Adaptive strategy in differential evolution via explicit exploitation
  and exploration controls
Authors: Sheng Xin Zhang, Wing Shing Chan, Kit Sang Tang, Shao Yong Zheng
Categories: cs.NE
\\
  When introducing new strategies to the existing one, two key issues should be
addressed. One is to efficiently distribute computational resources so that the
appropriate strategy dominates. The other is to remedy or even eliminate the
drawback of inappropriate strategies. Adaptation is a popular and efficient
method for strategy adjustments and has been widely studied in the literature.
Existing methods commonly involve the trials of multiple strategies and then
reward better-performing one with more resources based on their previous
performance. As a result, it may not efficiently address those two key issues.
On the one hand, they are based on trial-and-error with inappropriate
strategies consuming resources. On the other hand, since multiple strategies
are involved in the trial, the inappropriate strategies could mislead the
search. In this paper, we propose an adaptive differential evolution (DE) with
explicit exploitation and exploration controls (Explicit adaptation DE, EaDE),
which is the first attempt using offline knowledge to separate multiple
strategies to exempt the optimization from trial-and-error. EaDE divides the
evolution process into several SCSS (Selective-candidate with similarity
selection) generations and adaptive generations. Exploitation and exploration
needs are learned in the SCSS generations by a relatively balanced strategy.
While in the adaptive generations, to meet these needs, two other alternative
strategies, an exploitative one or an explorative one is employed. Experimental
studies on 28 benchmark functions confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

  To reduce random access memory (RAM) requirements and to increase speed of
recognition algorithms we consider a weight discretization problem for trained
neural networks. We show that an exponential discretization is preferable to a
linear discretization since it allows one to achieve the same accuracy when the
number of bits is 1 or 2 less. The quality of the neural network VGG-16 is
already satisfactory (top5 accuracy 69%) in the case of 3 bit exponential
discretization. The ResNet50 neural network shows top5 accuracy 84% at 4 bits.
Other neural networks perform fairly well at 5 bits (top5 accuracies of
Xception, Inception-v3, and MobileNet-v2 top5 were 87%, 90%, and 77%,
respectively). At less number of bits, the accuracy decreases rapidly.

  Most decision tree induction algorithms are based on a greedy top-down

several methods for induction of decision trees and their ensembles based on
evolutionary algorithms. The main difference of our approach is using
real-valued vector representation of decision tree that allows to use a large
number of different optimization algorithms, as well as optimize the whole tree
or ensemble for avoiding local optima. Differential evolution and evolution
strategies were chosen as optimization algorithms, as they have good results in
reinforcement learning problems. We test the predictive performance of this
methods using several public UCI data sets, and the proposed methods show
better quality than classical methods.

  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to provide AI implementations with a
drastically reduced energy budget in comparison with standard artificial neural
networks (ANNs). Besides recurrent SNN modules that can be efficiently trained
on-chip, many AI applications require the use of feedforward convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) as preprocessors for visual or other sensory inputs. The
standard solution has been to train a CNN consisting of non-spiking neurons,
typically using the rectified linear ReLU function as activation function, and
then to translate these CNNs with ReLU neurons via rate coding into SNNs.
However this produces SNNs with long latency and small throughput, since the
number of spikes that a neuron has to emit is on the order of the number N of
output values of the corresponding CNN gate which subsequent layers need to be
able to distinguish. We introduce a new ANN-SNN conversion - called
FS-conversion - that needs only log N many time steps for that, which is
optimal from the perspective of information theory. This can be achieved with a
simple variation of the spiking neuron model that has no membrane leak but an
exponentially decreasing firing threshold. We show that for the classification
of images from ImageNet and CIFAR10 this new conversion reduces latency and
drastically increases the throughput compared with rate-based conversion, while
achieving almost the same classification performance as the ANN.

  Neuromorphic computing promises revolutionary improvements over conventional
systems for applications that process unstructured information. To fully
realize this potential, neuromorphic systems should exploit the biomimetic
behavior of emerging nanodevices. In particular, exceptional opportunities are
provided by the non-volatility and analog capabilities of spintronic devices.
While spintronic devices have previously been proposed that emulate neurons and
synapses, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices are required
to implement multilayer spintronic perceptron crossbars. This work therefore
proposes a new spintronic neuron that enables purely spintronic multilayer
perceptrons, eliminating the need for CMOS circuitry and simplifying
fabrication.

Title: Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Sustainable Multi-UAV
  based Random Access IoT Networks with NOMA
Authors: Sami Khairy, Prasanna Balaprakash, Lin X. Cai, Yu Cheng
Categories: cs.NI cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to IEEE JSAC Special Issue on Massive Access for 5G and
  Beyond
\\
  In this paper, we apply the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique
to improve the massive channel access of a wireless IoT network where
solar-powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) relay data from IoT devices to
remote servers. Specifically, IoT devices contend for accessing the shared
wireless channel using an adaptive $p$-persistent slotted Aloha protocol; and
the solar-powered UAVs adopt Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to
decode multiple received data from IoT devices to improve access efficiency. To
enable an energy-sustainable capacity-optimal network, we study the joint
problem of dynamic multi-UAV altitude control and multi-cell wireless channel
access management of IoT devices as a stochastic control problem with multiple
energy constraints. To learn an optimal control policy, we first formulate this
problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), and propose an online
model-free Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) algorithm based on
Lagrangian primal-dual policy optimization to solve the CMDP. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm learns a cooperative policy
among UAVs in which the altitude of UAVs and channel access probability of IoT
devices are dynamically and jointly controlled to attain the maximal long-term
network capacity while maintaining energy sustainability of UAVs. The proposed
algorithm outperforms Deep RL based solutions with reward shaping to account
for energy costs, and achieves a temporal average system capacity which is
$82.4\%$ higher than that of a feasible DRL based solution, and only $6.47\%$
lower compared to that of the energy-constraint-free system.

\\
  In this paper, X-Layer protocol is originated which executes mobility error
prediction (MEP) algorithm to calculate the remaining energy level of each
node. This X-Layer protocol structure employs the mobility aware protocol that
senses the mobility concerned to each node with the utilization of Ad-hoc
On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), which shares the information or data specific
to the distance among individual nodes. With the help of this theory, the
neighbour list will be updated only to those nodes which are mobile resulting
in less energy consumption when compared to all (static/mobile) other nodes in
the network. Apart from the MEP algorithm, clustering head (CH) election
algorithm has also been specified to identify the relevant clusters whether
they exists within the network region or not. Also clustering multi-hop routing
(CMHR) algorithm was implemented in which the node can identify the cluster to
which it belongs depending upon the distance from each cluster surrounding the
node. Finally comprising the AODV routing protocol with the Two-Ray Ground
method, we implement X-Layer protocol structure by considering MAC protocol in
accordance to IEEE 802.15.4 to obtain the best results in energy consumption
and also by reducing the energy wastage with respect to each node. The
effective results had been illustrated through Network Simulator-II platform.

Title: Alias Resolution Based on ICMP Rate Limiting
Authors: Kevin Vermeulen, Burim Ljuma, Vamsi Addanki, Matthieu Gouel, Olivier
  Fourmaux, Timur Friedman and Reza Rejaie
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: Preprint to appear in Proceedings of Passive and Active Measurement
  (PAM 2020) Conference, Eugene, OR, March 2020
\\
  Alias resolution techniques (e.g., Midar) associate, mostly through active
measurement, a set of IP addresses as belonging to a common router. These
techniques rely on distinct router features that can serve as a signature.
Their applicability is affected by router support of the features and the
robustness of the signature. This paper presents a new alias resolution tool
called Limited Ltd. that exploits ICMP rate limiting, a feature that is
increasingly supported by modern routers that has not previously been used for
alias resolution. It sends ICMP probes toward target interfaces in order to
trigger rate limiting, extracting features from the probe reply loss traces. It
uses a machine learning classifier to designate pairs of interfaces as aliases.
We describe the details of the algorithm used by Limited Ltd. and illustrate
its feasibility and accuracy. Limited Ltd. not only is the first tool that can
perform alias resolution on IPv6 routers that do not generate monotonically
increasing fragmentation IDs (e.g., Juniper routers) but it also complements
the state-of-the-art techniques for IPv4 alias resolution. All of our code and
the collected dataset are publicly available.

  Address Validation of Inbound Traffic
Authors: Maciej Korczy\'nski, Yevheniya Nosyk, Qasim Lone, Marcin Skwarek,

\\
  This paper concerns the problem of the absence of ingress filtering at the
network edge, one of the main causes of important network security issues.
Numerous network operators do not deploy the best current practice - Source
Address Validation (SAV) that aims at mitigating these issues. We perform the
first Internet-wide active measurement study to enumerate networks not
filtering incoming packets by their source address. The measurement method
consists of identifying closed and open DNS resolvers handling requests coming
from the outside of the network with the source address from the range assigned
inside the network under the test. The proposed method provides the most
complete picture of the inbound SAV deployment state at network providers. We
reveal that 32 673 Autonomous Systems (ASes) and 197 641 Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP) prefixes are vulnerable to spoofing of inbound traffic. Finally,
using the data from the Spoofer project and performing an open resolver scan,
we compare the filtering policies in both directions.

Title: A Classification Framework for TDMA Scheduling techniques in WSNs
Authors: Ashutosh Bhatia, R. C. Hansdah
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  One of the major challenges in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is the
mitigation of collisions due to simultaneous transmissions by multiple nodes
over a common channel which are located in a proximity. TDMA-based channel
access provides energy-efficient and collision-free transmissions. It is
especially suitable for traffic with periodic transmission patterns and
guaranteed QoS requirements. For that reason, a large number of TDMA-scheduling
algorithms are available in the literature, and consequently, a good number of
survey papers on TDMA-scheduling algorithms have been written. In this work, we
propose a novel classification framework to categorize the existing
TDMA-scheduling algorithms available for WSNs. As against existing survey
works, the proposed framework possess certain new dimensions (categories) to
classify existing TDMA-scheduling algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a
couple of new sub-categories for the existing classes which would help
researchers to even differentiate between two TDMA-Scheduling algorithms that
are assumed to be similar as per existing classification schemes. Finally, we
also discuss few important works in the context of proposed classification
scheme.

Title: METTEOR: Robust Multi-Traffic Topology Engineering for Commercial Data
  Center Networks
Authors: Min Yee Teh, Shizhen Zhao, Keren Bergman
Categories: cs.NI
ACM-class: C.2.1
\\
  Numerous optical circuit switched data center networks have been proposed
over the past decade for higher capacity, though commercial adoption of these
architectures have been minimal so far. One major challenge commonly facing
these architectures is the difficulty of handling bursty traffic with optical
circuit switches (OCS) with high switching latency. Prior works generally rely
on fast-switching OCS prototypes to better react to traffic changes via
frequent reconfigurations. This approach, unfortunately, adds further
complexity to the control plane. We propose METTEOR, an easily deployable
solution for optical circuit switched data centers, that is designed for the
current capabilities of commercial OCSs. Using multiple predicted traffic
matrices, METTEOR designs data center topologies that are less sensitive to
traffic changes, thus eliminating the need of frequently reconfiguring OCSs
upon traffic changes. Results based on extensive evaluations using production
traces show that METTEOR increases the percentage of direct-hop traffic by
about 80% over a fat tree at comparable cost, and by about 30% over a uniform
mesh, at comparable maximum link utilizations. Compared to ideal solutions that
reconfigure OCSs on every traffic matrix, METTEOR achieves close-to-optimal
bandwidth utilization even with biweekly reconfiguration. This drastically
lowers the controller and management complexity needed to perform METTEOR in
commercial settings.

Title: Relay Selection, Scheduling and Power Control in Wireless Powered
  Cooperative Communication Networks
Authors: Aysun Gurur Onalan, Elif Dilek Salik, Sinem Coleri
Categories: cs.NI cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Relay nodes are used to improve the throughput, delay and reliability
performance of energy harvesting networks by assisting both energy and
information transfer between information nodes and access point. Previous
studies on radio frequency energy harvesting networks are limited to single
source single/multiple relay networks. In this paper, a novel joint relay
selection, scheduling and power control problem for multiple source multiple
relay network is formulated with the objective of minimizing the total duration
of wireless power and information transfer. The formulated problem is
non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, and proven to be
NP-hard. We first formulate a sub-problem on scheduling and power control for a
given relay selection. We propose an efficient optimal algorithm based on a
bi-level optimization over power transfer time allocation. Then, for optimal
relay selection, we present optimal exponential-time Branch-and-Bound (BB)
based algorithm where the nodes are pruned with problem specific lower and
upper bounds. We also provide two BB-based heuristic approaches limiting the
number of branches generated from a BB-node, and a relay criterion based lower
complexity heuristic algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithms are
demonstrated to outperform conventional harvest-then-cooperate approaches with
up to $88\%$ lower schedule length for various network settings.

Title: Smart Contract-based Secure Spectrum Sharing in Multi-Operators Wireless
  Communication Networks
Authors: Shuang Zheng, Tao Han, Yuna Jiang, Xiaohu Ge
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Multiple-operators (multi-OPs) spectrum sharing mechanism can effectively
improve the spectrum utilization in fifth-generation (5G) wireless
communication networks. The secondary users are introduced to opportunistically
access the licensed spectrum of idle operators (OPs). However, the identity
privacy and data security issues raise great concerns about the secure spectrum
sharing among multi-OPs. To address these challenges, a consortium blockchain
trust framework is proposed for the spectrum sharing in multi-OPs wireless
communication networks in this paper. A real consortium blockchain is
constructed among multi-OPs. The Multi-Ops Spectrum Sharing (MOSS) smart
contract is designed on the constructed consortium blockchain to implement the
spectrum trading among multi-OPs. Without the need of trustless spectrum
broker, the MOSS smart contract enforces multi-OPs to share the spectrum
truthfully and designs a punishment mechanism to punish malicious OPs.
Simulation results tested on the Remix integrated development environment (IDE)
indicate the feasibility of the designed MOSS smart contract. The performance
analysis of the proposed consortium blockchain trust framework demonstrates
that the privacy, openness and fairness of the proposed solution are better
than traditional spectrum allocation solutions.

Title: Federated Learning under Channel Uncertainty: Joint Client Scheduling
  and Resource Allocation
Authors: Madhusanka Manimel Wadu, Sumudu Samarakoon, Mehdi Bennis
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  In this work, we propose a novel joint client scheduling and resource block
(RB) allocation policy to minimize the loss of accuracy in federated learning
(FL) over wireless compared to a centralized training-based solution, under
imperfect channel state information (CSI). First, the problem is cast as a
stochastic optimization problem over a predefined training duration and solved
using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In order to learn and track the
wireless channel, a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based channel prediction
method is leveraged and incorporated into the scheduling decision. The proposed
scheduling policies are evaluated via numerical simulations, under both perfect
and imperfect CSI. Results show that the proposed method reduces the loss of
accuracy up to 25.8% compared to state-of-the-art client scheduling and RB
allocation methods.

Title: Practical MIMO for Visible Light Communication
Authors: Piotr Gaw{\l}owicz and Elnaz Alizadeh Jarchlo and Anatolij Zubow
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Visible Light Communication (VLC) is seen as a complementary wireless
technology to Radio Frequency (RF). However, VLC is very sensitive to the
signal blockage and suffers from shadowing due to the high directionality of
the optical channel. Hence there is a big interest in researching novel
approaches for VLC like usage of multiple antenna techniques providing spatial
diversity which can be exploited as a way to combat signal blockage and fading.
We present a complete and low-cost MIMO-VLC transceiver system consisting of
COTS components. In particular, we show that COTS 802.11n (WiFi) devices can be
used so that the physical and data link layers of RF WiFi are reused for VLC.
In addition, this allows us to directly utilize the multiple antenna (spatial)
techniques available in 802.11n. Results from our measurement study show that
such techniques are highly effective at improving the robustness of VLC links
in the presence of obstacles and node mobility. Moreover, we show that multiple
antennas can also be used to increase the data rate of VLC by means of spatial
multiplexing.

Title: An Actor-Critic-Based UAV-BSs Deployment Method for Dynamic Environments
Authors: Zhiwei Chen, Yi Zhong, Xiaohu Ge, Yi Ma
Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
\\
  In this paper, the real-time deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as
flying base stations (BSs) for optimizing the throughput of mobile users is
investigated for UAV networks. This problem is formulated as a time-varying
mixed-integer non-convex programming (MINP) problem, which is challenging to
find an optimal solution in a short time with conventional optimization
techniques. Hence, we propose an actor-critic-based (AC-based) deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) method to find near-optimal UAV positions at every
moment. In the proposed method, the process searching for the solution
iteratively at a particular moment is modeled as a Markov decision process
(MDP). To handle infinite state and action spaces and improve the robustness of
the decision process, two powerful neural networks (NNs) are configured to
evaluate the UAV position adjustments and make decisions, respectively.
Compared with the heuristic algorithm, sequential least-squares programming and
fixed UAVs methods, simulation results have shown that the proposed method
outperforms these three benchmarks in terms of the throughput at every moment
in UAV networks.

Title: Is It Safe Living in the Vicinity of Cellular Towers? Analysis of
  Long-Term Human EMF Exposure at Population Scale
Authors: Luca Chiaraviglio, Cristian Di Paolo, Giuseppe Bianchi, Nicola
  Blefari-Melazzi
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  We focus on the ElectroMagnetic Field (EMF) exposure safety for people living
in the vicinity of cellular towers. To this aim, we analyze a large dataset of
long-term EMF measurements collected over almost 20 years in more than 2000
measurement points spread over an Italian region. We evaluate the relationship
between EMF exposure and the following factors: (i) distance from the closest
installation(s), (ii) type of EMF sources in the vicinity, (iii) Base Station
(BS) technology, and (iv) EMF regulation updates. Overall, the exposure levels
from BSs in the vicinity are below the Italian EMF limits, thus ensuring safety
for the population. Moreover, BSs represent the lowest exposure compared to
Radio/TV repeaters and other EMF sources. However, the BS EMF exposure in
proximity to users exhibits an increasing trend over the last years, which is
likely due to the pervasive deployment of multiple technologies and to the EMF
regulation updates. As a side consideration, if the EMF levels continue to
increase with the current trends, the EMF exposure in proximity to BSs will
saturate to the maximum EMF limit by the next 20 years at a distance of 30
meters from the closest BS.

Comments: Under review
\\
  With regard to formalizing mathematics in proof assistants, the hierarchy of
mathematical structure that allows for the sharing of notations and theories,
and makes subtyping of structures implicit, is a key ingredient of
infrastructure to support the users. The packed classes method is a generic
design pattern to define and combine mathematical structures in a dependent
type theory with records. The Coq proof assistant has mechanisms to enable
automated structure inference and subtyping with packed classes; that is,
implicit coercions and canonical structures. In this paper, we identify the
invariants of hierarchies that ensure the modularity of reasoning and the
predictability of inference with packed classes, propose checking tools for
those invariants, and show that our tools significantly improve the development
process of Mathematical Components, a formalized mathematics library for Coq.

Title: Bidirectional Trajectory Computation for Odometer-Aided Visual-Inertial
  SLAM
Authors: Jinxu Liu, Wei Gao, Zhanyi Hu
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Odometer-aided visual-inertial SLAM systems typically have a good performance
for navigation of wheeled platforms, while they usually suffer from degenerate
cases before the first turning. In this paper, firstly we perform an
observability analysis w.r.t. the extrinsic parameters before the first
turning, which is a complement of the existing results of observability
analyses. Secondly, inspired by the above observability analyses, we propose a
bidirectional trajectory computation method, by which the poses before the
first turning are refined in the backward computation thread, and the real-time
trajectory is adjusted accordingly. Experimental results prove that our
proposed method not only solves the problem of the unobservability of
accelerometer bias and extrinsic parameters before the first turning, but also
results in more accurate trajectories in comparison with the state-of-the-art
approaches.

  This work presents a probabilistic deep neural network that combines LiDAR

explicitly model uncertainties in the classification and regression tasks, and
leverage uncertainties to train the fusion network via a sampling mechanism. We
validate our method on three datasets with challenging real-world driving
scenarios. Experimental results show that the predicted uncertainties reflect
complex environmental uncertainty like difficulties of a human expert to label
objects. The results also show that our method consistently improves the
Average Precision by up to 7% compared to the baseline method. When sensors are
temporally misaligned, the sampling method improves the Average Precision by up
to 20%, showing its high robustness against noisy sensor inputs.

Title: Developments in Modern GNSS and Its Impact on Autonomous Vehicle
  Architectures
Authors: Niels Joubert, Tyler GR Reid, Fergus Noble
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: IEEE IV 2020 PrePrint
\\
  This paper surveys a number of recent developments in modern Global
Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and investigates the possible impact on
autonomous driving architectures. Modern GNSS now consist of four independent
global satellite constellations delivering modernized signals at multiple civil
frequencies. New ground monitoring infrastructure, mathematical models, and
internet services correct for errors in the GNSS signals at continent scale.
Mass-market automotive-grade receiver chipsets are available at low Cost, Size,
Weight, and Power (CSWaP). The result is that GNSS in 2020 delivers better than
lane-level accurate localization with 99.99999% integrity guarantees at over
95% availability. In autonomous driving, SAE Level 2 partially autonomous
vehicles are now available to consumers, capable of autonomously following
lanes and performing basic maneuvers under human supervision. Furthermore, the
first pilot programs of SAE Level 4 driverless vehicles are being demonstrated
on public roads.
  However, autonomous driving is not a solved problem. GNSS can help.
Specifically, incorporating high-integrity GNSS lane determination into
vision-based architectures can unlock lane-level maneuvers and provide
oversight to guarantee safety. Incorporating precision GNSS into LiDAR-based
systems can unlock robustness and additional fallbacks for safety and utility.
Lastly, GNSS provides interoperability through consistent timing and reference
frames for future V2X scenarios.

\\
  WiFi technology has been used pervasively in fine-grained indoor
localization, gesture recognition, and adaptive communication. Achieving better
performance in these tasks generally boils down to differentiating
Line-Of-Sight (LOS) from Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signal propagation reliably
which generally requires expensive/specialized hardware due to the complex
nature of indoor environments. Hence, the development of low-cost accurate
positioning systems that exploit available infrastructure is not entirely
solved. In this paper, we develop a framework for indoor localization and
tracking of ubiquitous mobile devices such as smartphones using on-board
sensors. We present a novel deep LOS/NLOS classifier which uses the Received
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and can classify the input signal with an
accuracy of 85\%. The proposed algorithm can globally localize and track a
smartphone (or robot) with a priori unknown location, and with a semi-accurate
prior map (error within 0.8 m) of the WiFi Access Points (AP). Through
simultaneously solving for the trajectory and the map of access points, we
recover a trajectory of the device and corrected locations for the access
points. Experimental evaluations of the framework show that localization
accuracy is increased by using the trained deep network; furthermore, the
system becomes robust to any error in the map of APs.

Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  In this paper we present a mission architecture and a robotic platform, the
Shapeshifter, that allow multi-domain and redundant mobility on Saturn's moon
Titan, and potentially other bodies with atmospheres. The Shapeshifter is a
collection of simple and affordable robotic units, called Cobots, comparable to
personal palm-size quadcopters. By attaching and detaching with each other,
multiple Cobots can shape-shift into novel structures, capable of (a) rolling
on the surface, to increase the traverse range, (b) flying in a flight array
formation, and (c) swimming on or under liquid. A ground station complements
the robotic platform, hosting science instrumentation and providing power to
recharge the batteries of the Cobots. In the first part of this paper we
experimentally show the flying, docking and rolling capabilities of a
Shapeshifter constituted by two Cobots, presenting ad-hoc control algorithms.
We additionally evaluate the energy-efficiency of the rolling-based mobility
strategy by deriving an analytic model of the power consumption and by
integrating it in a high-fidelity simulation environment. In the second part we
tailor our mission architecture to the exploration of Titan. We show that the
properties of the Shapeshifter allow the exploration of the possible

Title: Toward Autonomous Robotic Micro-Suturing using Optical Coherence
  Tomography Calibration and Path Planning

\\
  Robotic automation has the potential to assist human surgeons in performing
suturing tasks in microsurgery, and in order to do so a robot must be able to
guide a needle with sub-millimeter precision through soft tissue. This paper
presents a robotic suturing system that uses 3D optical coherence tomography
(OCT) system for imaging feedback. Calibration of the robot-OCT and
robot-needle transforms, wound detection, keypoint identification, and path
planning are all performed automatically. The calibration method handles pose
uncertainty when the needle is grasped using a variant of iterative closest
points. The path planner uses the identified wound shape to calculate needle
entry and exit points to yield an evenly-matched wound shape after closure.
Experiments on tissue phantoms and animal tissue demonstrate that the system
can pass a suture needle through wounds with 0.27 mm overall accuracy in
achieving the planned entry and exit points.

Title: WiSM: Windowing Surrogate Model for Evaluation of Curvature-Constrained
  Tours with Dubins vehicle
Authors: Jan Drchal and Jan Faigl and Petr V\'a\v{n}a
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.NE

\\
  Dubins tours represent a solution of the Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem
(DTSP) that is a variant of the optimization routing problem to determine a
curvature-constrained shortest path to visit a set of locations such that the
path is feasible for Dubins vehicle, which moves only forward and has a limited
turning radius. The DTSP combines the NP-hard combinatorial optimization to
determine the optimal sequence of visits to the locations, as in the regular
TSP, with the continuous optimization of the heading angles at the locations,
where the optimal heading values depend on the sequence of visits and vice
versa. We address the computationally challenging DTSP by fast evaluation of
the sequence of visits by the proposed Windowing Surrogate Model (WiSM) which
estimates the length of the optimal Dubins path connecting a sequence of
locations in a Dubins tour. The estimation is sped up by a regression model
trained using close to optimum solutions of small Dubins tours that are
generalized for large-scale instances of the addressed DTSP utilizing the
sliding window technique and a cache for already computed results. The reported
results support that the proposed WiSM enables a fast convergence of a
relatively simple evolutionary algorithm to high-quality solutions of the DTSP.
We show that with an increasing number of locations, our algorithm scales
significantly better than other state-of-the-art DTSP solvers.

Title: A Code for Unscented Kalman Filtering on Manifolds (UKF-M)
Authors: Martin Brossard (CAOR), Axel Barrau, Silvere Bonnabel
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  The present paper introduces a novel methodology for Unscented Kalman
Filtering (UKF) on manifolds that extends our previous work about UKF on Lie
groups. Beyond filtering performances, the main interests of the approach are
its versatility, as the method applies to numerous state estimation problems,
and its simplicity of implementation for practitioners not being necessarily
familiar with manifolds and Lie groups. We have developed the method on two
independent open-source Python and Matlab frameworks we call UKF-M, for quickly
implementing and testing the approach. The online repositories contain
tutorials, documentations, and various relevant robotics examples that the user
can readily reproduce and then adapt, for fast prototyping and benchmarking.
The code is available at https://github.com/CAOR-MINES-ParisTech/ukfm.

\\
  Human input has enabled autonomous systems to improve their capabilities and
achieve complex behaviors that are otherwise challenging to generate
automatically. Recent work focuses on how robots can use such input - like
demonstrations or corrections - to learn intended objectives. These techniques
assume that the human's desired objective already exists within the robot's
hypothesis space. In reality, this assumption is often inaccurate: there will
always be situations where the person might care about aspects of the task that
the robot does not know about. Without this knowledge, the robot cannot infer
the correct objective. Hence, when the robot's hypothesis space is
misspecified, even methods that keep track of uncertainty over the objective
fail because they reason about which hypothesis might be correct, and not
whether any of the hypotheses are correct. In this paper, we posit that the
robot should reason explicitly about how well it can explain human inputs given
its hypothesis space and use that situational confidence to inform how it
should incorporate human input. We demonstrate our method on a 7
degree-of-freedom robot manipulator in learning from two important types of
human input: demonstrations of manipulation tasks, and physical corrections
during the robot's task execution.

Title: Efficient q-Integer Linear Decomposition of Multivariate Polynomials
Authors: Mark Giesbrecht, Hui Huang, George Labahn, Eugene Zima
Categories: cs.SC math.RA
\\
  We present two new algorithms for the computation of the q-integer linear
decomposition of a multivariate polynomial. Such a decomposition is essential
in the q-analogous world of symbolic summation, for example, describing the
q-counterpart of Ore-Sato theory or determining the applicability of the
q-analogue of Zeilberger's algorithm to a q-hypergeometric term. Both of our
algorithms require only basic integer and polynomial arithmetic and work for
any unique factorization domain containing the ring of integers. Complete
complexity analyses are conducted for both our algorithms and two previous
algorithms in the case of multivariate integer polynomials, showing that our
algorithms have better theoretical performances. A Maple implementation is also
included which suggests that our algorithms are also much faster in practice
than previous algorithms.

Title: Multi-channel Acoustic Modeling using Mixed Bitrate OPUS Compression
Authors: Aparna Khare, Shiva Sundaram, Minhua Wu
Categories: cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  Recent literature has shown that a learned front end with multi-channel audio
input can outperform traditional beam-forming algorithms for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). In this paper, we present our study on multi-channel
acoustic modeling using OPUS compression with different bitrates for the
different channels. We analyze the degradation in word error rate (WER) as a
function of the audio encoding bitrate and show that the WER degrades by 12.6%
relative with 16kpbs as compared to uncompressed audio. We show that its always
preferable to have a multi-channel audio input over a single channel audio
input given limited bandwidth. Our results show that for the best WER, when one
of the two channels can be encoded with a bitrate higher than 32kbps, its
optimal to encode the other channel with the highest bitrate possible. For
bitrates lower than that, its preferable to distribute the bitrate equally
between the two channels. We further show that by training the acoustic model
on mixed bitrate input, up to 50% of the degradation can be recovered using a
single model.

Categories: cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS
Comments: To appear in ICASSP 2020
\\
  In this work, we investigated the teacher-student training paradigm to train
a fully learnable multi-channel acoustic model for far-field automatic speech
recognition (ASR). Using a large offline teacher model trained on beamformed
audio, we trained a simpler multi-channel student acoustic model used in the
speech recognition system. For the student, both multi-channel feature
extraction layers and the higher classification layers were jointly trained
using the logits from the teacher model. In our experiments, compared to a
baseline model trained on about 600 hours of transcribed data, a relative
word-error rate (WER) reduction of about 27.3% was achieved when using an
additional 1800 hours of untranscribed data. We also investigated the benefit
of pre-training the multi-channel front end to output the beamformed log-mel
filter bank energies (LFBE) using L2 loss. We find that pre-training improves
the word error rate by 10.7% when compared to a multi-channel model directly
initialized with a beamformer and mel-filter bank coefficients for the front
end. Finally, combining pre-training and teacher-student training produces a
WER reduction of 31% compared to our baseline.

Title: Pop Music Transformer: Generating Music with Rhythm and Harmony
Authors: Yu-Siang Huang, Yi-Hsuan Yang
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI eess.AS stat.ML
\\
  The task automatic music composition entails generative modeling of music in
symbolic formats such as the musical scores. By serializing a score as a
sequence of MIDI-like events, recent work has demonstrated that
state-of-the-art sequence models with self-attention work nicely for this task,
especially for composing music with long-range coherence. In this paper, we
show that sequence models can do even better when we improve the way a musical
score is converted into events. The new event set, dubbed "REMI" (REvamped
MIDI-derived events), provides sequence models a metric context for modeling
the rhythmic patterns of music, while allowing for local tempo changes.
Moreover, it explicitly sets up a harmonic structure and makes chord
progression controllable. It also facilitates coordinating different tracks of
a musical piece, such as the piano, bass and drums. With this new approach, we
build a Pop Music Transformer that composes Pop piano music with a more
plausible rhythmic structure than prior arts do. The code, data and pre-trained
model are publicly
available.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/YatingMusic/remi}}

Title: Single Channel Speech Enhancement Using Temporal Convolutional Recurrent
  Neural Networks
Authors: Jingdong Li, Hui Zhang, Xueliang Zhang, and Changliang Li
Categories: cs.SD cs.AI eess.AS
\\
  In recent decades, neural network based methods have significantly improved
the performace of speech enhancement. Most of them estimate time-frequency
(T-F) representation of target speech directly or indirectly, then resynthesize
waveform using the estimated T-F representation. In this work, we proposed the
temporal convolutional recurrent network (TCRN), an end-to-end model that
directly map noisy waveform to clean waveform. The TCRN, which is combined
convolution and recurrent neural network, is able to efficiently and
effectively leverage short-term ang long-term information. Futuremore, we
present the architecture that repeatedly downsample and upsample speech during
forward propagation. We show that our model is able to improve the performance
of model, compared with existing convolutional recurrent networks. Futuremore,
We present several key techniques to stabilize the training process. The
experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms existing
speech enhancement approaches, in terms of speech intelligibility and quality.

Title: DropClass and DropAdapt: Dropping classes for deep speaker
  representation learning
Authors: Chau Luu, Peter Bell, Steve Renals
Categories: cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS
Comments: Submitted to Speaker Odyssey 2020
\\
  Many recent works on deep speaker embeddings train their feature extraction
networks on large classification tasks, distinguishing between all speakers in
a training set. Empirically, this has been shown to produce
speaker-discriminative embeddings, even for unseen speakers. However, it is not
clear that this is the optimal means of training embeddings that generalize
well. This work proposes two approaches to learning embeddings, based on the
notion of dropping classes during training. We demonstrate that both approaches
can yield performance gains in speaker verification tasks. The first proposed
method, DropClass, works via periodically dropping a random subset of classes
from the training data and the output layer throughout training, resulting in a
feature extractor trained on many different classification tasks. Combined with
an additive angular margin loss, this method can yield a 7.9% relative
improvement in equal error rate (EER) over a strong baseline on VoxCeleb. The
second proposed method, DropAdapt, is a means of adapting a trained model to a
set of enrolment speakers in an unsupervised manner. This is performed by
fine-tuning a model on only those classes which produce high probability
predictions when the enrolment speakers are used as input, again also dropping
the relevant rows from the output layer. This method yields a large 13.2%
relative improvement in EER on VoxCeleb. The code for this paper has been made
publicly available.

Title: Sound Event Detection with Depthwise Separable and Dilated Convolutions
Authors: Konstantinos Drossos and Stylianos I. Mimilakis and Shayan Gharib and
  Yanxiong Li and Tuomas Virtanen
Categories: cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS
\\
  State-of-the-art sound event detection (SED) methods usually employ a series
of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract useful features from the
input audio signal, and then recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model longer
temporal context in the extracted features. The number of the channels of the
CNNs and size of the weight matrices of the RNNs have a direct effect on the
total amount of parameters of the SED method, which is to a couple of millions.
Additionally, the usually long sequences that are used as an input to an SED
method along with the employment of an RNN, introduce implications like
increased training time, difficulty at gradient flow, and impeding the
parallelization of the SED method. To tackle all these problems, we propose the
replacement of the CNNs with depthwise separable convolutions and the
replacement of the RNNs with dilated convolutions. We compare the proposed
method to a baseline convolutional neural network on a SED task, and achieve a
reduction of the amount of parameters by 85% and average training time per
epoch by 78%, and an increase the average frame-wise F1 score and reduction of
the average error rate by 4.6% and 3.8%, respectively.

\\
  In this paper, we address a convolutive blind source separation (BSS) problem
and propose a new extended framework of FastMNMF by introducing prior
information for joint diagonalization of the spatial covariance matrix model.
Recently, FastMNMF has been proposed as a fast version of multichannel
nonnegative matrix factorization under the assumption that the spatial
covariance matrices of multiple sources can be jointly diagonalized. However,
its source-separation performance was not improved and the physical meaning of
the joint-diagonalization process was unclear. To resolve these problems, we
first reveal a close relationship between the joint-diagonalization process and
the demixing system used in independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA). Next,
motivated by this fact, we propose a new regularized FastMNMF supported by
ILRMA and derive convergence-guaranteed parameter update rules. From BSS
experiments, we show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional
FastMNMF in source-separation accuracy with almost the same computation time.

Title: Oral Billiards
Authors: Elaine Y L Tsiang
Categories: cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: Companion paper to arxiv:1306.2593 16 pages, 2 tables, 6 figures
\\
  We propose a physical model of speech to explain its precision and
robustness. We begin by reducing the dynamics to the bare minimum of polygonal
billiards. The symbolic stability of the billiard trajectories against
variations in action and the oral cavity geometry forms the basis for precision
and robustness in articulation. This stability survives forcing and dissipation
to underpin reliable encoding of the trajectories into acoustic emissions. The
kinematics of oral billiards and the cyclical nature of the forcing mechanism
engender a grammar of the syllable independent of any language. The symbolic
dynamics of oral billiards is rendered nearly maximally observable by their
concomitant acoustic emissions. Speech recognition is the set of computations
on the sub-maximally informative acoustic observables from which the symbolic
dynamics of oral billiards may be inferred.

  This paper presents the outcome of a research collaboration between academia

interaction testing for an open-source tool for industrial-scale application.
The project helps promote flexibility in generating constrained interaction
test suites, executing them, and setting up a test oracle to report them--all
within the same tool called Avocado. Avocado employs a constraint solver with
computational algorithms to generate constrained interaction test suites. The
environment of the application under test can be set up to execute the
generated test suite with minimum effort. A test oracle can be set up by the
tool to report the status and the results of the executed test cases. Avocado
represents a comprehensive and flexible solution for conducting combinatorial
interaction testing (CIT) and constrained CIT on an industrial application. In
this paper, we present the structure of the tool and our method of implementing
the algorithms in detail.

  Smart TV application (app) is a new technological software app that can deal
with smart TV devices to add more functionality and features. Despite its
importance nowadays, far too little attention has been paid to present a
systematic approach to test this kind of app so far. In this paper, we present
a systematic model-based testing approach for smart TV app. We used our new
notion of model separation to use sub-models based on the user preference
instead of the exhaustive testing to generate the test cases. Based on the
constructed model, we generated a set of test cases to assess the selected
paths to the chosen destination in the app. We also defined new mutation
operators for smart TV app to assess our testing approach. The evaluation
results showed that our approach can generate more comprehensive models of
smart TV apps with less time as compared to manual exploratory testing. The
results also showed that our approach can generate effective test cases in term
of fault detection.

Title: Analyzing the evolution and diversity of SBES Program Committee
Authors: Fabio Pacheco, Igor Wiese, Bruno Cartaxo, Igor Steinmacher, Gustavo

\\
  The Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES) is one of the most
important Latin American Software Engineering conferences. It was first held in
1987, and in 2019 marks its 33rd edition. Over these years, many researchers
have participated in SBES, attending the conference, submitting, and reviewing
papers. The researchers who participate in the Program Committee (PC) and
perform the reviewers' role are fundamentally important to SBES, since their
evaluations (e.g., deciding whether a paper is accepted or not) have the
potential of drawing what SBES is now. Knowing that diversity is an important
aspect of any group work, we wanted to understand diversity in the SBES PC
community. We investigated a number of characteristics of SBES PC members,
including their gender and geographic location. We also analyzed the turnover
and renovation of the committee. Among the findings, we observed that although
the number of participants in the SBES PC has increased over the years, most of
them are men (~80%) and from the Southeast and Northeast of Brazil, with very
few members from the North region. We also observed that there is a small
turnover: during the 2010 decade, only 11% of new members were added to the PC.
Finally, we investigated the participation of the PC members publishing papers
at SBES. We observed that only 24% of the papers accepted to SBES were authored
by members who were not committee members of the respective year. Moreover,
committee members usually do not collaborate among themselves: a significant
number of the papers are authored by the PC members and students. This paper
may contribute to the SBES community, in particular, its special interest
group, in understanding the needs and challenges of the PC's participants.

Title: Supporting DNN Safety Analysis and Retraining through Heatmap-based
  Unsupervised Learning
Authors: Hazem Fahmy, Mojtaba Bagherzadeh, Fabrizio Pastore, Lionel Briand
Categories: cs.SE cs.LG
\\
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly critical in modern
safety-critical systems, for example in their perception layer to analyze
images. Unfortunately, there is a lack of methods to ensure the functional
safety of DNN-based components. The machine learning literature suggests one
should trust DNNs demonstrating high accuracy on test sets. In case of low
accuracy, DNNs should be retrained using additional inputs similar to the
error-inducing ones.
  We observe two major challenges with existing practices for safety-critical
systems: (1) scenarios that are underrepresented in the test set may represent
serious risks, which may lead to safety violations, and may not be noticed; (2)
debugging DNNs is poorly supported when error causes are difficult to visually
detect.
  To address these problems, we propose HUDD, an approach that automatically
supports the identification of root causes for DNN errors. We automatically
group error-inducing images whose results are due to common subsets of selected
DNN neurons. HUDD identifies root causes by applying a clustering algorithm to
matrices (i.e., heatmaps) capturing the relevance of every DNN neuron on the
DNN outcome. Also, HUDD retrains DNNs with images that are automatically
selected based on their relatedness to the identified image clusters.
  We have evaluated HUDD with DNNs from the automotive domain. The approach was
able to automatically identify all the distinct root causes of DNN errors, thus
supporting safety analysis. Also, our retraining approach has shown to be more
effective at improving DNN accuracy than existing approaches.

\\
  Our study aimed to approach validity issues that arise both in the case of
surveys and Facebook data. We conducted a novel parallel data collection
method, rarely used before, which combines a face-to-face survey with the
collection of personal FB data archives. We show the research potential of
using these alternative data sources together. We show that we can overcome
some validity issues by cross-validating the two data sources by each other. We
also show that if the researcher collaborates with the users instead of the
companies and gets access to a part of the users' social media data archive,
the problem of the leanness of social media data is eliminated. Our chosen
topic is music interest, a key indicator of cultural sociology. To our
knowledge, there are no previous studies on the rate at which any population is
categorized by Facebook to advertisers as interested in music genres, or on the
relationship between self-reported interest, digitally expressed interest and
ad-interest categories. Specific genres were detected which show remarkable
different pictures when measured these different ways. We studied also dynamic
patterns in FB users music interest. We hope our data collection method and the
presented validity approaches will initiate a future dialogue in digital data
research in social sciences.

Title: Mixing Patterns in Interdisciplinary Collaboration Networks: Assessing
  Interdisciplinarity Through Multiple Lenses
Authors: Shihui Feng and Alec Kirkley
Categories: cs.SI physics.soc-ph
\\
  There are inherent challenges to interdisciplinary research collaboration,
such as bridging cognitive gaps and balancing transaction costs with
collaborative benefits. This raises the question: Does interdisciplinary
research necessarily result in interdisciplinary collaborations? This study
aims to explore this question and assess collaboration preferences in
interdisciplinary research at the individual, dyadic, and team level by
examining mixing patterns in a collaboration network. Using a network of over
2,000 researchers from the field of artificial intelligence in education, we
find that "interdisciplinarity" is demonstrated by diverse research experiences
of individual researchers rather than diversity among researchers within
collaborations. We also examine intergroup mixing by applying a novel approach
to classify the active and non-active researchers in the collaboration network
based on participation in multiple teams. We find a significant difference in
indicators of academic performance and experience between the clusters of
active and non-active researchers, suggesting intergroup mixing as a key factor
in academic success. Our results shed light on the nature of team formation in
interdisciplinary research, as well as highlight the importance of
interdisciplinary programs.

Title: Estimation of Regional Economic Development Indicator from
  Transportation Network Analytics
Authors: Bin Li, Song Gao, Yunlei Liang, Yuhao Kang, Timothy Prestby, Yuqi Gao,

\\
  With the booming economy in China, many researches have pointed out that the
improvement of regional transportation infrastructure among other factors had
an important effect on economic growth. Utilizing a large-scale dataset which
includes 3.5 billion entry and exit records of vehicles along highways
generated from toll collection systems, we attempt to establish the relevance
of mid-distance land transport patterns to regional economic status through
transportation network analyses. We apply standard measurements of complex
networks to analyze the highway transportation networks. A set of traffic flow
features are computed and correlated to the regional economic development
indicator. The multi-linear regression models explain about 89% to 96% of the
variation of cities' GDP across three provinces in China. We then fit gravity
models using annual traffic volumes of cars, buses, and freight trucks between
pairs of cities for each province separately as well as for the whole dataset.
We find the temporal changes of distance-decay effects on spatial interactions
between cities in transportation networks, which link to the economic
development patterns of each province. We conclude that transportation big data
reveal the status of regional economic development and contain valuable
information of human mobility, production linkages, and logistics for regional
management and planning. Our research offers insights into the investigation of
regional economic development status using highway transportation big data.

Title: Influencing Opinion Dynamics in Networks with Limited Interaction
Authors: Anmol Gupta, Sharayu Moharir, Neeraja Sahasrabudhe
Categories: cs.SI cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 6 pages
\\
  The focus of this work is on designing influencing strategies to shape the
collective opinion of a network of individuals. We consider a variant of the
voter model where opinions evolve in one of two ways. In the absence of
external influence, opinions evolve via interactions between individuals in the
network, while, in the presence of external influence, opinions shift in the
direction preferred by the influencer. We focus on a finite time-horizon and an
influencing strategy is characterized by when it exerts influence in this
time-horizon given its budget constraints. Prior work on this opinion dynamics
model assumes that individuals take into account the opinion of all individuals
in the network. We generalize this and consider the setting where the opinion
evolution of an individual depends on a limited collection of opinions from the
network. We characterize the nature of optimal influencing strategies as a
function of the way in which this collection of opinions is formed.

Title: Finding large balanced subgraphs in signed networks
Authors: Bruno Ordozgoiti, Antonis Matakos, Aristides Gionis
Categories: cs.SI
Comments: 11 pages, 6 figures, The Web Conference 2020
\\
  Signed networks are graphs whose edges are labelled with either a positive or
a negative sign, and can be used to capture nuances in interactions that are
missed by their unsigned counterparts. The concept of balance in signed graph
theory determines whether a network can be partitioned into two perfectly
opposing subsets, and is therefore useful for modelling phenomena such as the
existence of polarized communities in social networks. While determining
whether a graph is balanced is easy, finding a large balanced subgraph is hard.
The few heuristics available in the literature for this purpose are either
ineffective or non-scalable. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm
for finding large balanced subgraphs in signed networks. The algorithm relies
on signed spectral theory and a novel bound for perturbations of the graph
Laplacian. In a wide variety of experiments on real-world data we show that our
algorithm can find balanced subgraphs much larger than those detected by
existing methods, and in addition, it is faster. We test its scalability on
graphs of up to 34 million edges.

Title: Ginger Cannot Cure Cancer: Battling Fake Health News with a
  Comprehensive Data Repository
Authors: Enyan Dai, Yiwei Sun, Suhang Wang
Categories: cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Nowadays, Internet is a primary source of attaining health information.
Massive fake health news which is spreading over the Internet, has become a
severe threat to public health. Numerous studies and research works have been
done in fake news detection domain, however, few of them are designed to cope
with the challenges in health news. For instance, the development of
explainable is required for fake health news detection. To mitigate these
problems, we construct a comprehensive repository, FakeHealth, which includes
news contents with rich features, news reviews with detailed explanations,
social engagements and a user-user social network. Moreover, exploratory
analyses are conducted to understand the characteristics of the datasets,
analyze useful patterns and validate the quality of the datasets for health
fake news detection. We also discuss the novel and potential future research
directions for the health fake news detection.

Title: Improving Generalizability of Fake News Detection Methods using
  Propensity Score Matching
Authors: Bo Ni, Zhichun Guo, Jianing Li, Meng Jiang
Categories: cs.SI cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Recently, due to the booming influence of online social networks, detecting
fake news is drawing significant attention from both academic communities and
general public. In this paper, we consider the existence of confounding
variables in the features of fake news and use Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
to select generalizable features in order to reduce the effects of the
confounding variables. Experimental results show that the generalizability of
fake news method is significantly better by using PSM than using raw frequency
to select features. We investigate multiple types of fake news methods
(classifiers) such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector
machines. We have consistent observations of performance improvement.

Title: Randomized Spectral Clustering in Large-Scale Stochastic Block Models
Authors: Hai Zhang and Xiao Guo and Xiangyu Chang
Categories: cs.SI cs.LG stat.ME stat.ML
\\
  Spectral clustering has been one of the widely used methods for community
detection in networks. However, large-scale networks bring computational
challenge to it. In this paper, we study spectral clustering using randomized
sketching algorithms from a statistical perspective, where we typically assume
the network data are generated from a stochastic block model. To do this, we
first use the recent developed sketching algorithms to derive two randomized
spectral clustering algorithms, namely, the random projection-based and the
random sampling-based spectral clustering. Then we study the theoretical bounds
of the resulting algorithms in terms of the approximation error for the
population adjacency matrix, the misclustering error, and the estimation error
for the link probability matrix. It turns out that, under mild conditions, the
randomized spectral clustering algorithms perform similarly to the original
one. We also conduct numerical experiments to support the theoretical findings.

Title: When Less is More: Systematic Analysis of Cascade-based Community
  Detection
Authors: Liudmila Prokhorenkova, Alexey Tikhonov, Nelly Litvak
Categories: cs.SI physics.soc-ph
\\
  Information diffusion, spreading of infectious diseases, and spreading of
rumors are fundamental processes occurring in real-life networks. In many
practical cases, one can observe when nodes become infected, but the underlying
network, over which a contagion or information propagates, is hidden. Inferring
properties of the underlying network is important since these properties can be
used for constraining infections, forecasting, viral marketing, etc. Moreover,
for many applications, it is sufficient to recover only coarse high-level
properties of this network rather than all its edges. In this paper, we conduct
a systematic and extensive analysis of the following problem: given only the
infection times, find communities of highly interconnected nodes. We carry out
a thorough comparison between existing and new approaches on several large
datasets and cover methodological challenges that are specific to this problem.
One of the main conclusions is that the most stable performance and the most
significant improvement on the current state-of-the-art are achieved by our
proposed simple heuristic approaches that are agnostic to a particular graph
structure and epidemic model. We also show that some well-known community
detection algorithms can be enhanced by including edge weights based on the
cascade data.

Title: cube2net: Efficient Query-Specific Network Construction with Data Cube
  Organization
Authors: Carl Yang, Mengxiong Liu, Frank He, Jian Peng, Jiawei Han
Categories: cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Full paper of the extended abstract published in ICDMW 2019
\\
  Networks are widely used to model objects with interactions and have enabled
various downstream applications. However, in the real world, network mining is
often done on particular query sets of objects, which does not require the
construction and computation of networks including all objects in the datasets.
In this work, for the first time, we propose to address the problem of
query-specific network construction, to break the efficiency bottlenecks of
existing network mining algorithms and facilitate various downstream tasks. To
deal with real-world massive networks with complex attributes, we propose to
leverage the well-developed data cube technology to organize network objects
w.r.t. their essential attributes. An efficient reinforcement learning
algorithm is then developed to automatically explore the data cube structures
and construct the optimal query-specific networks. With extensive experiments
of two classic network mining tasks on different real-world large datasets, we
show that our proposed cube2net pipeline is general, and much more effective
and efficient in query-specific network construction, compared with other
methods without the leverage of data cube or reinforcement learning.

Title: Mi YouTube es Su YouTube? Analyzing the Cultures using YouTube
  Thumbnails of Popular Videos
Authors: Songyang Zhang, Tolga Aktas, Jiebo Luo
Categories: cs.SI cs.CV cs.CY
\\
  YouTube, a world-famous video sharing website, maintains a list of the top
trending videos on the platform. Due to its huge amount of users, it enables
researchers to understand people's preference by analyzing the trending videos.
Trending videos vary from country to country. By analyzing such differences and
changes, we can tell how users' preferences differ over locations. Previous
work focuses on analyzing such culture preferences from videos' metadata, while
the culture information hidden within the visual content has not been
discovered. In this study, we explore culture preferences among countries using
the thumbnails of YouTube trending videos. We first process the thumbnail
images of the videos using object detectors. The collected object information
is then used for various statistical analysis. In particular, we examine the
data from three perspectives: geographical locations, video genres and users'
reactions. Experimental results indicate that the users from similar cultures
shares interests in watching similar videos on YouTube. Our study demonstrates
that discovering the culture preference through the thumbnails can be an
effective mechanism for video social media analysis.

\\
  Most of the current complex networks that are of interest to practitioners
possess a certain community structure that plays an important role in
understanding the properties of these networks. Moreover, many machine learning
algorithms and tools that are developed for complex networks try to take
advantage of the existence of communities to improve their performance or
speed. As a result, there are many competing algorithms for detecting
communities in large networks. Unfortunately, these algorithms are often quite
sensitive and so they cannot be fine-tuned for a given, but a constantly
changing, real-world network at hand. It is therefore important to test these
algorithms for various scenarios that can only be done using synthetic graphs
that have built-in community structure, power-law degree distribution, and
other typical properties observed in complex networks. The standard and
extensively used method for generating artificial networks is the LFR graph
generator. Unfortunately, this model has some scalability limitations and it is
challenging to analyze it theoretically. Finally, the mixing parameter $\mu$,
the main parameter of the model guiding the strength of the communities, has a
non-obvious interpretation and so can lead to unnaturally-defined networks. In
this paper, we provide an alternative random graph model with community
structure and power-law distribution for both degrees and community sizes, the
Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (ABCD). We show that the new model
solves the three issues identified above and more. The conclusion is that these
models produce comparable graphs but ABCD is fast, simple, and can be easily
tuned to allow the user to make a smooth transition between the two extremes:
pure (independent) communities and random graph with no community structure.

Title: DiffNet++: A Neural Influence and Interest Diffusion Network for Social
  Recommendation
Authors: Le Wu, Junwei Li, Peijie Sun, Yong Ge, Meng Wang
Categories: cs.SI cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: This paper has submitted to IEEE TKDE
\\
  Social recommendation has emerged to leverage social connections among users
for predicting users' unknown preferences, which could alleviate the data
sparsity issue in collaborative filtering based recommendation. Early
approaches relied on utilizing each user's first-order social neighbors'
interests for better user modeling, and failed to model the social influence
diffusion process from the global social network structure. Recently, we
propose a preliminary work of a neural influence diffusion network~(i.e.,
DiffNet) for social recommendation~(Diffnet), which models the recursive social
diffusion process to capture the higher-order relationships for each user.
However, we argue that, as users play a central role in both user-user social
network and user-item interest network, only modeling the influence diffusion
process in the social network would neglect the users' latent collaborative
interests in the user-item interest network. In this paper, we propose
DiffNet++, an improved algorithm of DiffNet that models the neural influence
diffusion and interest diffusion in a unified framework. By reformulating the
social recommendation as a heterogeneous graph with social network and interest
network as input, DiffNet++ advances DiffNet by injecting these two network
information for user embedding learning at the same time. This is achieved by
iteratively aggregating each user's embedding from three aspects: the user's
previous embedding, the influence aggregation of social neighbors from the
social network, and the interest aggregation of item neighbors from the
user-item interest network. Furthermore, we design a multi-level attention
network that learns how to attentively aggregate user embeddings from these
three aspects. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world
datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Title: On the Submodularity of Diffusion Models: Equivalent Conditions and
  Applications
Authors: Fangqi Li, Chong Di, Wenwen Xia
Categories: cs.SI math.CO
Comments: Conference pre-print
\\
  The diffusion model has been a crucial component in studies about social
networks. Many studies, especially these about influence maximization concern
the proof of the submodularity of particular diffusion models. Such proofs have
been model-dependent and are somewhat ad hoc. In this paper, we prove a theorem
that provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a diffusion model to be
submodular. This theorem can be used to justify the submodularity of an
arbitrary diffusion model. We also apply this theorem to build a projection
operator that maps an arbitrary diffusion model into a submodular one.
Moreover, we use the established theorem to propose a diffusion model of
multiple heterogeneous pieces of information that partially features
submodularity.

Title: Evidence of distrust and disorientation towards immunization on online
  social media after contrasting political communication on vaccines. Results
  from an analysis of Twitter data in Italy
Authors: Samantha Ajovalasit (1), Veronica Dorgali (2), Angelo Mazza (1),

Comments: 15 pages, 3 of appendix, 3 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Background. Recently, In Italy the vaccination coverage for key
immunizations, as MMR, has been declining, with measles outbreaks. In 2017, the
Italian Government expanded the number of mandatory immunizations establishing
penalties for families of unvaccinated children. During the 2018 elections
campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate, with the government
accusing oppositions of fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new government
established in 2018 temporarily relaxed penalties and announced the
introduction of flexibility.
  Objectives and Methods. By a sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian
during 2018, we aimed at (i) characterising the temporal flow of communication
on vaccines, (ii) evaluating the usefulness of Twitter data for estimating
vaccination parameters, and (iii) investigating whether the ambiguous political
communication might have originated disorientation among the public.
  Results. The population appeared to be mostly composed by "serial twitterers"
tweeting about everything including vaccines. Tweets favourable to vaccination
accounted for 75% of retained tweets, undecided for 14% and unfavourable for
11%. Twitter activity of the Italian public health institutions was negligible.
After smoothing the temporal pattern, an up-and-down trend in the favourable
proportion emerged, synchronized with the switch between governments, providing
clear evidence of disorientation.
  Conclusion. The reported evidence of disorientation documents that critical
health topics, as immunization, should never be used for political consensus.
This is especially true given the increasing role of online social media as
information source, which might yield to social pressures eventually harmful
for vaccine uptake, and is worsened by the lack of institutional presence on
Twitter. This calls for efforts to contrast misinformation and the ensuing
spread of hesitancy.

Title: A Dynamic and Cooperative Tracking System for Crowdfunding
Authors: Kai Zhang, Hongke Zhao, Qi Liu, Zhen Pan, Enhong Chen
Categories: cs.SI
Comments: 4 pages
\\
  Crowdfunding is an emerging finance platform for creators to fund their
efforts by soliciting relatively small contributions from a large number of
individuals using the Internet. Due to the unique rules, a campaign succeeds in
trading only when it collects adequate funds in a given time. To prevent
creators and backers from wasting time and efforts on failing campaigns,
dynamically estimating the success probability of a campaign is very important.
However, existing crowdfunding systems neither have the mechanism of dynamic
predictive tracking, nor provide the real-time campaign status for creators and
backers on the platform. To address these issues, we develop a novel system,
which contains a dynamic data-driven approach to tracking the success
probability and status. We demonstrate the following scenarios using our
system. First, users can utilize our system to analyze the emotion of
incremental reviews so as to understand backers' perspectives of the campaign
in time. Meanwhile, our system visualizes the statistic number of positive and
negative reviews. On this basis, our system can dynamically track the success
probability of each campaign.

\\
  Various methods to deal with graph data have been proposed in recent years.
However, most of these methods focus on graph feature aggregation rather than
graph pooling. Besides, the existing top-k selection graph pooling methods have
a few problems. First, to construct the pooled graph topology, current top-k
selection methods evaluate the importance of the node from a single perspective
only, which is simplistic and unobjective. Second, the feature information of
unselected nodes is directly lost during the pooling process, which inevitably
leads to a massive loss of graph feature information. To solve these problems
mentioned above, we propose a novel graph self-adaptive pooling method with the
following objectives: (1) to construct a reasonable pooled graph topology,
structure and feature information of the graph are considered simultaneously,
which provide additional veracity and objectivity in node selection; and (2) to
make the pooled nodes contain sufficiently effective graph information, node
feature information is aggregated before discarding the unimportant nodes;
thus, the selected nodes contain information from neighbor nodes, which can
enhance the use of features of the unselected nodes. Experimental results on
four different datasets demonstrate that our method is effective in graph
classification and outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods.

Comments: 32 pages, 27 figures
\\
  Social science research increasingly benefits from statistical methods for
understanding the structured nature of social life, including for social
network data. However, the application of statistical network models within
large-scale community research is hindered by too little understanding of the
validity of their inferences under realistic data collection conditions,
including sampled or missing network data. The autologistic actor attribute
model (ALAAM) is a statistical model based on the well-established exponential
random graph model (ERGM) for social networks. ALAAMs can be regarded as a
social influence model, predicting an individual-level outcome based on the
actor's network ties, concurrent outcomes of his/her network partners, and
attributes of the actor and his/her network partners. In particular, an ALAAM
can be used to measure contagion effects, that is, the propensity of two actors
connected by a social network tie to both have the same value of an attribute.
We investigate the effect of using simple random samples and snowball samples
of network data on ALAAM parameter inference, and find that parameter inference
can still work well even with a nontrivial fraction of missing nodes. However
it is safer to take a snowball sample of the network and estimate conditional
on the snowball sampling structure.

media. But text can be strategically manipulated and accounts reopened under
different aliases, suggesting that these approaches are inherently brittle. In
this work, we investigate an alternative modality that is naturally robust: the
pattern in which information propagates. Can the veracity of an unverified
rumor spreading online be discerned solely on the basis of its pattern of
diffusion through the social network?
  Using graph kernels to extract complex topological information from Twitter
cascade structures, we train accurate predictive models that are blind to
language, user identities, and time, demonstrating for the first time that such
"sanitized" diffusion patterns are highly informative of veracity. Our results
indicate that, with proper aggregation, the collective sharing pattern of the
crowd may reveal powerful signals of rumor truth or falsehood, even in the
early stages of propagation.

Title: Multiple string LED driver with flexible and high performance PWM
  dimming control
Authors: M. Tahan, T. Hu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 14 pages, 28 figures
Journal-ref: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics ( Volume: 32 , Issue: 12 ,
  Dec. 2017 )
DOI: 10.1109/TPEL.2017.2655884
\\
  The main objectives in driving multiple LED strings include achieving uniform
current control and high performance PWM dimming for all strings. This work
proposes a new multiple string LED driver to achieve not only current balance,
but also flexible and wide range PWM dimming ratio for each string. A compact
single-inductor multiple-output topology is adopted in the driver, accompanied
by synchronous integrators and variable dimming frequency, to achieve both high
efficiency and high performance dimming. By using the proposed variable dimming
frequency scheme, high dimming frequency is applied to a string with high
dimming ratio, which helps to maintain the deviation of LED string current in
an acceptable range, while low dimming frequency is applied to a string with
low dimming ratio, which helps to achieve rectangular LED current waveform.
Meanwhile, the new time multiplexing control scheme automatically optimizes the
LED string's bus voltages, thus minimizes each string's power loss. A three
string LED driver prototype is constructed to validate the effectiveness of the
peoposed control scheme, where the three strings can have different dimming
ratios between 4% and 100%.

Title: Resilient Finite Time Consensus: A Discontinuous Systems Approach
Authors: James Usevitch, Dimitra Panagou
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Accepted for presentation at the 2020 American Control Conference
\\
  Many algorithms have been proposed in prior literature to guarantee resilient
multi-agent consensus in the presence of adversarial attacks or faults. The
majority of prior work present excellent results that focus on discrete-time or
discretized continuous-time systems. Fewer authors have explored applying
similar resilient techniques to continuous-time systems without discretization.
These prior works typically consider asymptotic convergence and make
assumptions such as continuity of adversarial signals, the existence of a dwell
time between switching instances for the system dynamics, or the existence of
trusted agents that are do not misbehave. In this paper, we expand the study of
resilient continuous-time systems by removing many of these assumptions and
providing conditions for normally-behaving agents with nonlinear dynamics to
achieve consensus in finite time despite the presence of adversarial agents.
The use of discontinuous systems theory allows us to demonstrate these results
despite possible discontinuities in the adversarial signals. The efficacy of
the presented conditions is demonstrated through simulations.

Title: Event triggering control for dynamical systems with designable minimum
  inter-event time
Authors: Xing, Chu and Na, Huang and Zhiyong, Sun
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures, technical note
\\
  This paper presents a class of event-triggering rules for dynamical control
systems with guaranteed positive minimum inter-event time (MIET). We first
propose an event-based function design with guaranteed control performance
under a clock-like variable for general nonlinear systems, and later specify
them to general linear systems. Compared to the existing static and dynamic
triggering mechanisms, the proposed triggering rules hold the robust global
event-separation property, and can be easily implemented on practical digital
platform. Namely, it is shown that the minimum inter-event time can be flexibly
adapted to the various hardware limitations. Finally, several numerical
simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

Title: Adaptive Finite Time Stability of Delayed Systems With Applications to
  Network Synchronization
Authors: Xiwei Liu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  The finite time stability (FnTSta) theory of delayed systems has not been set
up until now. In this paper, we propose a two-phases-method (2PM), to achieve
this object. In the first phase, we prove that the time for norm of system
error evolving from initial values to 1 is finite; then in the second phase, we
prove that the time for norm of the error evolving from 1 to 0 is also finite,
thus FnTSta is obtained. Considering the cost and complexity of controller, we
use only two simple terms to realize this aim. For the proposed 2PM, time
delays can be the same or asynchronous, bounded or unbounded, etc; the norm can
be $2$-norm, $1$-norm, $\infty$-norm, which show that 2PM is powerful and has a
wide scope of applications. Furthermore, we also prove the adaptive finite time
stability (AFnTSta) theory of delayed systems using 2PM. As an application of
the obtained FnTSta theory, we consider the finite time outer synchronization
(FnTOSyn) for complex networks with asynchronous unbounded time delays,
corresponding criteria are also obtained. Finally, two numerical examples are
given to demonstrate the validity of our theories.

Title: Sensing and Communication Tradeoff Design for AoI Minimization in a
  Cellular Internet of UAVs
Authors: Shuhang Zhang, Hongliang Zhang, Lingyang Song, Zhu Han, and H. Vincent

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures
\\
  In this paper, we consider the cellular Internet of unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), where UAVs sense data for multiple tasks and transmit the data to the
base station (BS). To quantify the "freshness" of the data at the BS, we bring
in the concept of the age of information (AoI). The AoI is determined by the
time for UAV sensing and that for UAV transmission, and gives rise to a
trade-off within a given period. To minimize the AoI, we formulate a joint
sensing time, transmission time, UAV trajectory, and task scheduling
optimization problem. To solve this problem, we first propose an iterative
algorithm to optimize the sensing time, transmission time, and UAV trajectory
for completing a specific task. Afterwards, we design the order in which the
UAV performs data updates for multiple sensing tasks. The convergence and
complexity of the proposed algorithm, together with the trade-off between UAV
sensing and UAV transmission, are analyzed. Simulation results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Title: Adaptive Backstepping Control for Fractional-Order Nonlinear Systems
  with External Disturbance and Uncertain Parameters Using Smooth Control
Authors: Xinyao Li, Changyun Wen and Ying Zou
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In this paper, we consider controlling a class of single-input-single-output
(SISO) commensurate fractional-order nonlinear systems with parametric
uncertainty and external disturbance. Based on backstepping approach, an
adaptive controller is proposed with adaptive laws that are used to estimate
the unknown system parameters and the bound of unknown disturbance. Instead of
using discontinuous functions such as the $\mathrm{sign}$ function, an
auxiliary function is employed to obtain a smooth control input that is still
able to achieve perfect tracking in the presence of bounded disturbances.
Indeed, global boundedness of all closed-loop signals and asymptotic perfect
tracking of fractional-order system output to a given reference trajectory are
proved by using fractional directed Lyapunov method. To verify the
effectiveness of the proposed control method, simulation examples are
presented.

MSC-class: 93C55
\\
  In this paper, we provide a compositional framework for synthesizing hybrid
controllers for interconnected discrete-time control systems enforcing
specifications expressed by co-Buchi automata. In particular, we first
decompose the given specification to simpler reachability tasks based on
automata representing the complements of original co-Buchi automata. Then, we
provide a systematic approach to solve those simpler reachability tasks by
computing corresponding control barrier functions. We show that such control
barrier functions can be constructed compositionally by assuming some
small-gain type conditions and composing so-called local control barrier
functions computed for subsystems. We provide two systematic techniques to
search for local control barrier functions for subsystems based on the
sum-of-squares optimization program and counter-example guided inductive
synthesis approach. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our results
through two large-scale case studies.

Title: Data-Driven Stochastic Optimization for Power Grids Scheduling under
  High Wind Penetration
Authors: Yuan Yi, Wei Xie, Zhi Zhou, Keqi Wang
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 14 pages, 2 figures
\\
  To address the environmental concern and improve the economic efficiency, the
wind power is rapidly integrated into smart grids. However, the inherent
uncertainty of wind energy raises operational challenges. To ensure the
cost-efficient, reliable and robust operation, it is critically important to
find the optimal decision that can correctly hedge against all sources of
uncertainty. In this paper, we propose data-driven stochastic unit commitment
(SUC) to guide the power grids scheduling. Specifically, given the finite
historical data, the posterior predictive distribution is developed to quantify
the wind power prediction uncertainty accounting for both inherent stochastic
uncertainty of wind power generation and forecast model estimation error. To
further control the impact of finite sampling error induced by using the sample
average approximation (SAA) to estimate the expected cost in the planning
horizon, we propose a parallel computing based optimization solution
methodology, which can lead to a reliable and cost-efficient optimal unit
commitment decision hedging against various sources of uncertainty. The
empirical study over six-bus and 118-bus systems demonstrates that our approach
can provide better performance than the existing deterministic and stochastic
unit commitment approaches.

  We consider a cloud-based control architecture in which the local plants
outsource the control synthesis task to the cloud. In particular, we consider a
cloud-based reinforcement learning (RL), where updating the value function is
outsourced to the cloud. To achieve confidentiality, we implement computations
over Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). We use a CKKS encryption scheme and a
modified SARSA(0) reinforcement learning to incorporate the encryption-induced
delays. We then give a convergence result for the delayed updated rule of
SARSA(0) with a blocking mechanism. We finally present a numerical
demonstration via implementing on a classical pole-balancing problem.

Title: Efficiency Analysis of the Simplified Refined Instrumental Variable

Authors: Siqi Pan, James S. Welsh, Rodrigo A. Gonz\'alez and Cristian R. Rojas
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures. Preprint submitted to Automatica
\\
  In this paper, we derive the asymptotic Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for the
continuous-time output error model structure and provide an analysis of the
statistical efficiency of the Simplified Refined Instrumental Variable method
for Continuous-time systems (SRIVC) based on sampled data. It is shown that the
asymptotic Cram\'er-Rao lower bound is independent of the intersample behaviour
of the noise-free system output and hence only depends on the intersample
behaviour of the system input. We have also shown that, at the converging point
of the SRIVC algorithm, the estimates do not depend on the intersample
behaviour of the measured output. It is then proven that the SRIVC estimator is
asymptotically efficient for the output error model structure under mild
conditions. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to verify the asymptotic
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and the asymptotic covariance of the SRIVC estimates.

Title: Magnetometer-free inertial motion tracking of arbitrary joints with
  range of motion constraints
Authors: Dustin Lehmann, Daniel Laidig, Raphael Deimel, Thomas Seel
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: IFAC WC 2020 Submission
\\
  In motion tracking of connected multi-body systems Inertial Measurement Units
(IMUs) are used in a wide variety of applications, since they provide a
low-cost easy-to-use method for orientation estimation. However, in indoor
environments or near ferromagnetic material the magnetic field is inhomogeneous
which limits the accuracy of tracking algorithms using magnetometers. Methods
that use only accelerometers and gyroscopes on the other hand yield no
information on the absolute heading of the tracked object. For objects
connected by rotational joints with range of motion constraints we propose a
method that provides a magnetometer-free, long-term stable relative orientation
estimate based on a non-linear, window-based cost function. The method can be
used for real-time estimation as well as post-processing. It is validated
experimentally with a mechanical joint and compared to other methods that are
used in motion tracking. It is shown that for the used test object, the
proposed methods yields the best results with a total angle error of less than
4 degrees for all experiments.

Title: Overcoming Output Constraints in Iterative Learning Control Systems by
  Reference Adaptation
Authors: Michael Meindl, Fabio Molinari, J\"org Raisch, Thomas Seel
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Submitted to IFAC World Congress 2020
\\
  Iterative Learning Control (ILC) schemes can guarantee properties such as
asymptotic stability and monotonic error convergence, but do not, in general,
ensure adherence to output constraints. The topic of this paper is the design
of a reference-adapting ILC (RAILC) scheme, extending an existing ILC system
and capable of complying with output constraints. The underlying idea is to
scale the reference at every trial by using a conservative estimate of the
output's progression. Properties as the monotonic convergence above a threshold
and the respect of output constraints are formally proven. Numerical
simulations and experimental results reinforce our theoretical results.

  We consider linear differential-algebraic equations DAEs and the Kronecker
canonical form KCF of the corresponding matrix pencils. We also consider linear
control systems and their Morse canonical form MCF. For a linear DAE, a
procedure named explicitation is proposed, which attaches to any linear DAE a
linear control system defined up to a coordinates change, a feedback
transformation and an output injection. Then we compare subspaces associated to
a DAE in a geometric way with those associated (also in a geometric way) to a
control system, namely, we compare the Wong sequences of DAEs and invariant
subspaces of control systems. We prove that the KCF of linear DAEs and the MCF
of control systems have a perfect correspondence and that their invariants are
related. In this way, we connect the geometric analysis of linear DAEs with the
classical geometric linear control theory. Finally, we propose a concept named
internal equivalence for DAEs and discuss its relation with internal
regularity, i.e., the existence and uniqueness of solutions.

\\
  In this study, a heuristic dynamic programming controller is proposed to
control a boost converter. Conventional controllers such as proportional
integral-derivative (PID) or proportional integral (PI) are designed based on
the linearized small-signal model near the operating point. Therefore, the
performance of the controller during the start-up, the load change, or the
input voltage variation is not optimal since the system model changes by
varying the operating point. The heuristic dynamic programming controller
optimally controls the boost converter by following the approximate dynamic
programming. The advantage of the HDP is that the neural network based
characteristic of the proposed controller enables boost converters to easily
cope with large disturbances. An HDP with a well trained critic and action
networks can perform as an optimal controller for the boost converter. To
compare the effectiveness of the traditional PI-based and the HDP boost
converter, the simulation results are provided.

Title: Sparse Magnetometer-free Inertial Motion Tracking -- A Condition for
  Observability in Double Hinge Joint Systems
Authors: Karsten Eckhoff, Manon Kok, Sergio Lucia, Thomas Seel
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Inertial measurement units are commonly used in a growing number of
application fields to track or capture motions of kinematic chains, such as
human limbs, exoskeletons or robotic actuators. A major challenge is the
presence of magnetic disturbances that result in unreliable magnetometer
readings. Recent research revealed that this problem can be overcome by
exploitation of kinematic constraints. While typically each segment of the
kinematic chain is equipped with an IMU, a novel approach called sparse
inertial motion tracking aims at infering the complete motion states from
measurements of a reduced set of sensors. In the present contribution, we
combine the magnetometer-free and the sparse approach for real-time motion
tracking of double-hinge joint systems with non-parallel joint axes. Analyzing
the observability of the system, we find a condition which assures that the
relative orientations between all segments are uniquely determined by a
kinematic constraint, which contains only the gyroscope readings. Furthermore,
we propose a moving-horizon estimator and validate it in a simulation study of
three movements with different degrees of excitation. The results of this study
confirm all theoretical conjectures and demonstrate that magnetometer-free
sparse inertial real-time motion tracking is feasible under precise and simple
excitation conditions.

Title: Evaluation of Energy- and Capacity-Market Revenues from Lithium-ion
  Battery Systems for Offshore Wind Using Advanced Battery Models
Authors: Mehdi Jafari, Audun Botterud, Apurba Sakti
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 13pages
\\
  Revenue potential from offshore wind and energy storage systems for a Long
Island node in the New York ISO (NYISO) is examined using advanced lithium-ion
battery representations. These advanced mixed-integer-linear battery models
account for the dynamic performance, as well as the degradation behavior of the
batteries, which are usually not accounted for in power systems models.
Multiple hybrid offshore wind and battery system designs are investigated to
examine the impact of locating the battery offshore versus locating it onshore.
For the examined systems, we explore different battery usable state-of-charge
(SOC) windows, and corresponding dispatch of the battery to maximize energy-
and capacity-market revenues. The impacts of variability of offshore wind
output along with energy- and capacity-market prices are evaluated using
publicly available data from 2010 to 2013. Locating the battery onshore
resulted in higher revenues. For 2013, results highlight that without accurate
battery representations, models can overestimate battery revenues by up to
155%, resulting primarily from degradation-related costs. Using advanced
algorithms, net revenue can be increased by 29%. Results also indicate that
wider useable SOC windows could lead to higher net revenues from the energy
market, due to higher arbitrage opportunities that compensate for any
additional degradation-tied costs in higher DODs. The added value of a MWh of
energy storage varies from $2 to $3.5 per MWh of wind energy, which leads to a
breakeven cost range of $50-$95 per kWh for the battery systems studied. As
such, energy- and capacity-market revenues were found to be insufficient in
recovering the investment costs of current battery systems for the applications
considered in this analysis.

\\
  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful dynamical models for data with
complex temporal structure. However, training RNNs has traditionally proved
challenging due to exploding or vanishing of gradients. RNN models such as
LSTMs and GRUs (and their variants) significantly mitigate the issues
associated with training RNNs by introducing various types of {\it gating}
units into the architecture. While these gates empirically improve performance,
how the addition of gates influences the dynamics and trainability of GRUs and
LSTMs is not well understood. Here, we take the perspective of studying
randomly-initialized LSTMs and GRUs as dynamical systems, and ask how the
salient dynamical properties are shaped by the gates. We leverage tools from
random matrix theory and mean-field theory to study the state-to-state
Jacobians of GRUs and LSTMs. We show that the update gate in the GRU and the
forget gate in the LSTM can lead to an accumulation of slow modes in the
dynamics. Moreover, the GRU update gate can poise the system at a marginally
stable point. The reset gate in the GRU and the output and input gates in the
LSTM control the spectral radius of the Jacobian, and the GRU reset gate also
modulates the complexity of the landscape of fixed-points. Furthermore, for the
GRU we obtain a phase diagram describing the statistical properties of
fixed-points. Finally, we provide some preliminary comparison of training
performance to the various dynamical regimes, which will be investigated
elsewhere. The techniques introduced here can be generalized to other RNN
architectures to elucidate how various architectural choices influence the
dynamics and potentially discover novel architectures.

\\
  In this paper, we revisit the structure learning problem for dynamic Bayesian
networks and propose a method that simultaneously estimates contemporaneous
(intra-slice) and time-lagged (inter-slice) relationships between variables in
a time-series. Our approach is score-based, and revolves around minimizing a
penalized loss subject to an acyclicity constraint. To solve this problem, we
leverage a recent algebraic result characterizing the acyclicity constraint as
a smooth equality constraint. The resulting algorithm, which we call DYNOTEARS,
outperforms other methods on simulated data, especially in high-dimensions as
the number of variables increases. We also apply this algorithm on real
datasets from two different domains, finance and molecular biology, and analyze
the resulting output. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for learning dynamic
Bayesian networks, our method is both scalable and accurate on real data. The
simple formulation, and competitive performance of our method make it suitable
for a variety of problems where one seeks to learn connections between
variables across time.

\\
  Many important schemes in signal processing and communications, ranging from
the BCJR algorithm to the Kalman filter, are instances of factor graph methods.
This family of algorithms is based on recursive message passing-based
computations carried out over graphical models, representing a factorization of
the underlying statistics. Consequently, in order to implement these
algorithms, one must have accurate knowledge of the statistical model of the
considered signals. In this work we propose to implement factor graph methods
in a data-driven manner. In particular, we propose to use machine learning (ML)
tools to learn the factor graph, instead of the overall system task, which in
turn is used for inference by message passing over the learned graph. We apply
the proposed approach to learn the factor graph representing a finite-memory
channel, demonstrating the resulting ability to implement BCJR detection in a
data-driven fashion. We demonstrate that the proposed system, referred to as
BCJRNet, learns to implement the BCJR algorithm from a small training set, and
that the resulting receiver exhibits improved robustness to inaccurate training
compared to the conventional channel-model-based receiver operating under the
same level of uncertainty. Our results indicate that by utilizing ML tools to
learn factor graphs from labeled data, one can implement a broad range of
model-based algorithms, which traditionally require full knowledge of the
underlying statistics, in a data-driven fashion.

Title: Detection of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Using Features Extracted from
  Segmented Time-Series ECG Signals Using a One Dimensional Convolutional
  Neural Network

\\
  The study in this paper presents a one-dimensional convolutional neural
network (1DCNN) model, designed for the automated detection of obstructive
Sleep Apnoea (OSA) captured from single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG)
signals. The system provides mechanisms in clinical practice that help diagnose
patients suffering with OSA. Using the state-of-the-art in 1DCNNs, a model is
constructed using convolutional, max pooling layers and a fully connected
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) consisting of a hidden layer and SoftMax output for
classification. The 1DCNN extracts prominent features, which are used to train
an MLP. The model is trained using segmented ECG signals grouped into 5 unique
datasets of set window sizes. 35 ECG signal recordings were selected from an
annotated database containing 70 night-time ECG recordings. (Group A = a01 to
a20 (Apnoea breathing), Group B = b01 to b05 (moderate), and Group C = c01 to
c10 (normal). A total of 6514 minutes of Apnoea was recorded. Evaluation of the
model is performed using a set of standard metrics which show the proposed
model achieves high classification results in both training and validation
using our windowing strategy, particularly W=500 (Sensitivity 0.9705,
Specificity 0.9725, F1 Score 0.9717, Kappa Score 0.9430, Log Loss 0.0836,
ROCAUC 0.9945). This demonstrates the model can identify the presence of Apnoea
with a high degree of accuracy.

Title: A Neural-embedded Choice Model: TasteNet-MNL Modeling Taste
  Heterogeneity with Flexibility and Interpretability
Authors: Yafei Han, Christopher Zegras, Francisco Camara Pereira, Moshe
  Ben-Akiva
Categories: econ.EM cs.AI stat.ME
\\
  Discrete choice models (DCMs) and neural networks (NNs) can complement each
other. We propose a neural network embedded choice model - TasteNet-MNL, to
improve the flexibility in modeling taste heterogeneity while keeping model
interpretability. The hybrid model consists of a TasteNet module: a
feed-forward neural network that learns taste parameters as flexible functions
of individual characteristics; and a choice module: a multinomial logit model
(MNL) with manually specified utility. TasteNet and MNL are fully integrated
and jointly estimated. By embedding a neural network into a DCM, we exploit a
neural network's function approximation capacity to reduce specification bias.
Through special structure and parameter constraints, we incorporate expert
knowledge to regularize the neural network and maintain interpretability. On
synthetic data, we show that TasteNet-MNL can recover the underlying non-linear
utility function, and provide predictions and interpretations as accurate as
the true model; while examples of logit or random coefficient logit models with
misspecified utility functions result in large parameter bias and low
predictability. In the case study of Swissmetro mode choice, TasteNet-MNL
outperforms benchmarking MNLs' predictability; and discovers a wider spectrum
of taste variations within the population, and higher values of time on
average. This study takes an initial step towards developing a framework to
combine theory-based and data-driven approaches for discrete choice modeling.

Title: Radioactive data: tracing through training
Authors: Alexandre Sablayrolles, Matthijs Douze, Cordelia Schmid, Herv\'e

Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We want to detect whether a particular image dataset has been used to train a
model. We propose a new technique, \emph{radioactive data}, that makes
imperceptible changes to this dataset such that any model trained on it will
bear an identifiable mark. The mark is robust to strong variations such as
different architectures or optimization methods. Given a trained model, our
technique detects the use of radioactive data and provides a level of
confidence (p-value). Our experiments on large-scale benchmarks (Imagenet),
using standard architectures (Resnet-18, VGG-16, Densenet-121) and training
procedures, show that we can detect usage of radioactive data with high
confidence (p<10^-4) even when only 1% of the data used to trained our model is
radioactive. Our method is robust to data augmentation and the stochasticity of
deep network optimization. As a result, it offers a much higher signal-to-noise
ratio than data poisoning and backdoor methods.

Title: Tensor-to-Vector Regression for Multi-channel Speech Enhancement based

Journal-ref: IEEE ICASSP 2020
\\
  We propose a tensor-to-vector regression approach to multi-channel speech
enhancement in order to address the issue of input size explosion and
hidden-layer size expansion. The key idea is to cast the conventional deep
neural network (DNN) based vector-to-vector regression formulation under a
tensor-train network (TTN) framework. TTN is a recently emerged solution for
compact representation of deep models with fully connected hidden layers. Thus
TTN maintains DNN's expressive power yet involves a much smaller amount of
trainable parameters. Furthermore, TTN can handle a multi-dimensional tensor
input by design, which exactly matches the desired setting in multi-channel
speech enhancement. We first provide a theoretical extension from DNN to TTN
based regression. Next, we show that TTN can attain speech enhancement quality
comparable with that for DNN but with much fewer parameters, e.g., a reduction
from 27 million to only 5 million parameters is observed in a single-channel
scenario. TTN also improves PESQ over DNN from 2.86 to 2.96 by slightly
increasing the number of trainable parameters. Finally, in 8-channel
conditions, a PESQ of 3.12 is achieved using 20 million parameters for TTN,
whereas a DNN with 68 million parameters can only attain a PESQ of 3.06. Our
implementation is available online

\\
  The delegating private quantum computation (DQC) protocol with the universal
quantum gate set $\left\{ {X,Z,H,P,R,CNOT} \right\}$ was firstly proposed by
Broadbent \emph{et al.}, and then Tan \emph{et al.} tried to put forward an
half-blind DQC protocol (HDQC) with another universal set $\left\{ {H,P,CNOT,T}
\right\}$. However, the decryption circuit of \emph{Toffoli} gate (i.e.,
\emph{T}) is a little redundant, and Tan \emph{et al}.'s protocol exists the
information leak. In addition, both of these two protocols just focus on the
blindness of data (i.e., the client's input and output), but do not consider
the blindness of computation (i.e., the delegated quantum operation). For
solving these problems, we propose a full-blind DQC protocol (FDQC) with
quantum gate set $\left\{ {H,P,CNOT,T} \right\}$ , where the desirable
delegated quantum operation, one of $\left\{ {H,P,CNOT,T} \right\}$ , is
replaced by a fixed sequence $\left \{ {H,P,T,CZ,CNOT} \right\}$ to make the
computation blind, and the decryption circuit of \emph{Toffoli} gate is also
optimized. Analysis shows that our protocol can not only correctly perform any
delegated quantum computation, but also holds the characteristics of data
blindness and computation blindness.

Title: Learning Deep Analysis Dictionaries -- Part II: Convolutional
  Dictionaries
Authors: Jun-Jie Huang and Pier Luigi Dragotti
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  In this paper, we introduce a Deep Convolutional Analysis Dictionary Model
(DeepCAM) by learning convolutional dictionaries instead of unstructured
dictionaries as in the case of deep analysis dictionary model introduced in the
companion paper. Convolutional dictionaries are more suitable for processing
high-dimensional signals like for example images and have only a small number
of free parameters. By exploiting the properties of a convolutional dictionary,
we present an efficient convolutional analysis dictionary learning approach. A
L-layer DeepCAM consists of L layers of convolutional analysis dictionary and
element-wise soft-thresholding pairs and a single layer of convolutional
synthesis dictionary. Similar to DeepAM, each convolutional analysis dictionary
is composed of a convolutional Information Preserving Analysis Dictionary
(IPAD) and a convolutional Clustering Analysis Dictionary (CAD). The IPAD and
the CAD are learned using variations of the proposed learning algorithm. We
demonstrate that DeepCAM is an effective multilayer convolutional model and, on
single image super-resolution, achieves performance comparable with other
methods while also showing good generalization capabilities.

  Optimal Bayesian feature selection (OBFS) is a multivariate supervised
screening method designed from the ground up for biomarker discovery. In this
work, we prove that Gaussian OBFS is strongly consistent under mild conditions,
and provide rates of convergence for key posteriors in the framework. These
results are of enormous importance, since they identify precisely what features
are selected by OBFS asymptotically, characterize the relative rates of
convergence for posteriors on different types of features, provide conditions
that guarantee convergence, justify the use of OBFS when its internal
assumptions are invalid, and set the stage for understanding the asymptotic
behavior of other algorithms based on the OBFS framework.

Title: Depth Map Estimation of Dynamic Scenes Using Prior Depth Information
Authors: James Noraky, Vivienne Sze
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Depth information is useful for many applications. Active depth sensors are
appealing because they obtain dense and accurate depth maps. However, due to
issues that range from power constraints to multi-sensor interference, these
sensors cannot always be continuously used. To overcome this limitation, we
propose an algorithm that estimates depth maps using concurrently collected
images and a previously measured depth map for dynamic scenes, where both the
camera and objects in the scene may be independently moving. To estimate depth
in these scenarios, our algorithm models the dynamic scene motion using
independent and rigid motions. It then uses the previous depth map to
efficiently estimate these rigid motions and obtain a new depth map. Our goal
is to balance the acquisition of depth between the active depth sensor and
computation, without incurring a large computational cost. Thus, we leverage
the prior depth information to avoid computationally expensive operations like
dense optical flow estimation or segmentation used in similar approaches. Our
approach can obtain dense depth maps at up to real-time (30 FPS) on a standard
laptop computer, which is orders of magnitude faster than similar approaches.
When evaluated using RGB-D datasets of various dynamic scenes, our approach
estimates depth maps with a mean relative error of 2.5% while reducing the
active depth sensor usage by over 90%.

\\
  Three-dimensional late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MR (CMR) of left
atrial scar in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has recently emerged as a
promising technique to stratify patients, to guide ablation therapy and to
predict treatment success. This requires a segmentation of the high intensity
scar tissue and also a segmentation of the left atrium (LA) anatomy, the latter
usually being derived from a separate bright-blood acquisition. Performing both
segmentations automatically from a single 3D LGE CMR acquisition would
eliminate the need for an additional acquisition and avoid subsequent
registration issues. In this paper, we propose a joint segmentation method
based on multiview two-task (MVTT) recursive attention model working directly
on 3D LGE CMR images to segment the LA (and proximal pulmonary veins) and to
delineate the scar on the same dataset. Using our MVTT recursive attention
model, both the LA anatomy and scar can be segmented accurately (mean Dice
score of 93% for the LA anatomy and 87% for the scar segmentations) and
efficiently (~0.27 seconds to simultaneously segment the LA anatomy and scars
directly from the 3D LGE CMR dataset with 60-68 2D slices). Compared to
conventional unsupervised learning and other state-of-the-art deep learning
based methods, the proposed MVTT model achieved excellent results, leading to
an automatic generation of a patient-specific anatomical model combined with
scar segmentation for patients in AF.

  Chest radiographs are commonly performed low-cost exams for screening and
diagnosis. However, radiographs are 2D representations of 3D structures causing
considerable clutter impeding visual inspection and automated image analysis.
Here, we propose a Fully Convolutional Network to suppress, for a specific
task, undesired visual structure from radiographs while retaining the relevant
image information such as lung-parenchyma. The proposed algorithm creates
reconstructed radiographs and ground-truth data from high resolution CT-scans.
Results show that removing visual variation that is irrelevant for a
classification task improves the performance of a classifier when only limited
training data are available. This is particularly relevant because a low number
of ground-truth cases is common in medical imaging.

Title: Diffusion bridges for stochastic Hamiltonian systems with applications
  to shape analysis
Authors: Alexis Arnaudon, Frank van der Meulen, Moritz Schauer, Stefan Sommer
Categories: math.ST cs.CV stat.TH
\\
  Stochastically evolving geometric systems are studied in geometric mechanics
for modelling turbulence parts of multi-scale fluid flows and in shape analysis
for stochastic evolutions of shapes of e.g.\ human organs. Recently introduced
models involve stochastic differential equations that govern the dynamics of a
diffusion process $X$. In applications $X$ is only partially observed at times
$0$ and $T>0$. Conditional on these observations, interest lies in inferring
parameters in the dynamics of the diffusion and reconstructing the path
$(X_t,\, t\in [0,T])$. The latter problem is known as bridge simulation. We
develop a general scheme for bridge sampling in the case of finite dimensional
systems of shape landmarks and singular solutions in fluid dynamics. This
scheme allows for subsequent statistical inference of properties of the fluid
flow or the evolution of observed shapes. It covers stochastic landmark models
for which no suitable simulation method has been proposed in the literature,
that removes restrictions of earlier approaches, improves the handling of the
nonlinearity of the configuration space leading to more effective sampling
schemes and allows to generalise the common inexact matching scheme to the
stochastic setting.

\\
  Due to the wide separation of time scales in geophysical fluid dynamics,
semi-implicit time integrators are commonly used in operational atmospheric
forecast models. They guarantee the stable treatment of fast (acoustic and
gravity) waves, while not suffering from severe restrictions on the timestep
size. To propagate the state of the atmosphere forward in time, a non-linear
equation for the prognostic variables has to be solved at every timestep. Since
the nonlinearity is typically weak, this is done with a small number of Newton-
or Picard- iterations, which in turn require the efficient solution of a large
system on linear equations with $\mathcal{O}(10^6-10^9)$ unknowns. This linear
solve is often the computationally most costly part of the model. While the
solution of the linear system is relatively straightforward for simple
finite-difference- and finite-volume- discretisations, it is much more
challenging for advanced finite element discretisations, which have recently
been explored in atmospheric modelling.
  In this paper an efficient linear solver for the LFRic next-generation model,
currently developed by the Met Office, is described. The model uses an advanced
mimetic finite element discretisation which makes the construction of efficient
solvers challenging. The linear solver hinges on a bespoke multigrid
preconditioner of the Schur-complement system for the pressure correction.
  By comparing to Krylov-subspace methods, the superior performance and
robustness of the multigrid algorithm is demonstrated for standard test cases
and realistic model setups. In production mode, the model will have to run in
parallel on 100,000s of processing elements. As confirmed by numerical
experiments, one particular advantage of the multigrid solver is its excellent
parallel scalability due to avoiding expensive global reduction operations.

Title: Excluding a ladder
Authors: Tony Huynh, Gwena\"el Joret, Piotr Micek, Micha{\l} T. Seweryn, Paul
  Wollan
Categories: math.CO cs.DM
\\
  Which graph classes $\mathcal{C}$ exclude a fixed ladder as a minor? We show
that this is the case if and only if all graphs $G$ in $\mathcal{C}$ admit a
proper vertex coloring with a bounded number of colors such that for every
$2$-connected subgraph $H$ of $G$, there is a color that appears exactly once
in $H$. If one were considering all connected subgraphs of $G$ instead, then
such a coloring is known as a centered coloring, and the minimum achievable
number of colors is the treedepth of $G$. Classes of graphs with bounded
treedepth are exactly those that exclude a fixed path as a subgraph, or
equivalently, as a minor. In this sense, the structure of graphs excluding a
fixed ladder as a minor resembles the structure of graphs without long paths.
Another similarity is as follows: It is an easy observation that every
connected graph with two vertex-disjoint paths of length $k$ has a path of
length $k+1$. We show that every $3$-connected graph with sufficiently many
vertex-disjoint subgraphs containing a $k$ ladder minor has a $(k+1)$-ladder
minor.
  Our structural results have applications to poset dimension. We show that
posets whose cover graphs exclude a fixed ladder as a minor have bounded
dimension. This is a new step towards the goal of understanding which graphs
are unavoidable as minors in cover graphs of posets with large dimension.

  With the proliferation of ultra-high-speed mobile networks and
internet-connected devices, along with the rise of artificial intelligence, the
world is generating exponentially increasing amounts of data-data that needs to
be processed in a fast, efficient and 'smart' way. These developments are
pushing the limits of existing computing paradigms, and highly parallelized,
fast and scalable hardware concepts are becoming progressively more important.
Here, we demonstrate a computational specific integrated photonic tensor
core-the optical analog of an ASIC-capable of operating at
Tera-Multiply-Accumulate per second (TMAC/s) speeds. The photonic core achieves
parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change memory arrays and
photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs). The
computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable
and non-resonant, i.e. broadband, passive components operating at a bandwidth
exceeding 14 GHz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and
photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton
microcombs at microwave line rates, ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguides,
and high speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path
towards full CMOS wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. While we
focus on convolution processing, more generally our results indicate the major
potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, efficient and wafer-scale
manufacturable computational hardware in demanding AI applications such as
autonomous driving, live video processing, and next generation cloud computing
services.

Title: The exponentially weighted average forecaster in geodesic spaces of
  non-positive curvature
Authors: Quentin Paris
Categories: math.ST cs.GT cs.LG math.MG stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  This paper addresses the problem of prediction with expert advice for
outcomes in a geodesic space with non-positive curvature in the sense of
Alexandrov. Via geometric considerations, and in particular the notion of
barycenters, we extend to this setting the definition and analysis of the
classical exponentially weighted average forecaster. We also adapt the
principle of online to batch conversion to this setting. We shortly discuss the
application of these results in the context of aggregation and for the problem
of barycenter estimation.

Title: Dynamic Frame Structure for Next Generation Wireless Networks
Authors: Mohammad R. Abedi, Mohammad R. Javan, Nader Mokari, and Eduard . A.

Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we devise a novel radio resource block (RB) structure named
dynamic resource block structure (D-RBS) which can handle low latency traffics
and large fluctuations in data rates by exploiting smart time and frequency
duplexing. In our framework, the main resource block with a predefined
bandwidth and time duration is divided into several small blocks with the same
bandwidth and time duration. Depending on the service requirements, e.g., data
rate and latency, the users are assigned to some these small blocks which could
be noncontiguous both in frequency and time. This is in contrast to the
previously introduced static resource block structure (S-RBS) where the size of
each RB is predetermined and fixed. We provide resource allocation frameworks
for this RB structure and formulate the optimization problems whose solutions
are obtained by alternate search method (ASM) based on successive convex
approximation approach (SCA). We provide a global optimal solution by
exploiting the monotonic optimization method. By simulation we study the
performance of our proposed scheme with S-RBS scheme and show it has 26% gain
compared to the S-RBS scheme.

  Let $q$ be an odd prime power and $n$ be a positive integer. Let $\ell\in
\mathbb F_{q^n}[x]$ be a $q$-linearised $t$-scattered polynomial of linearized
degree $r$. Let $d=\max\{t,r\}$ be an odd prime number. In this paper we show

the classification of transitive subgroups of the general linear group over the

Authors: Luis F. Abanto-Leon and Gek Hong (Allyson) Sim

Comments: 6 pages. To be appear in ICC 2020 Proceedings
\\
  This paper investigates the joint design of hybrid transmit precoder and
analog receive combiners for single-group multicasting in millimeter-wave
systems. We propose LB-GDM, a low-complexity learning-based approach that
leverages gradient descent with momentum and alternating optimization to design
(i) the digital and analog constituents of a hybrid transmitter and (ii) the
analog combiners of each receiver. In addition, we also extend our proposed
approach to design fully-digital precoders. We show through numerical
evaluation that, implementing LB-GDM in either hybrid or digital precoders
attain superlative performance compared to competing designs based on
semidefinite relaxation. Specifically, in terms of minimum signal-to-noise
ratio, we report a remarkable improvement with gains of up to 105% and 101% for
the fully-digital and hybrid precoders, respectively.

Title: A lower bound on the number of inequivalent APN functions

\\
  In this paper, we establish a lower bound on the total number of inequivalent
APN functions on the finite field with $2m$ elements, where $m$ is even. We
obtain this result by proving that the APN functions introduced by Pott and the
second author, that depend on three parameters $k$, $s$ and $\alpha$, are
pairwise inequivalent for distinct choices of the parameters $k$ and $s$.
Moreover, we determine the automorphism group of these APN functions.

Title: Fairness-Aware Hybrid Precoding for mmWave NOMA Unicast/Multicast
  Transmissions in Industrial IoT
Authors: Luis F. Abanto-Leon and Gek Hong (Allyson) Sim
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 6 pages, to be appear in ICC 2020 Proceedings
\\
  This paper investigates dual-layer non-orthogonally superimposed
transmissions for industrial internet of things (IoT) millimeter-wave
communications. Essentially, the overlayer is a multicast signal devised to
serve all the devices in coverage with a common message, i.e., critical control
packet. The underlayer is a composite signal that consists of private unicast
messages. Due to safety implications, it is critical that all devices can
decode the multicast information. To ensure this requirement, we jointly
optimize the hybrid precoder, analog combiners, power allocation, and fairness.
Specifically, we incorporate a power splitting constraint between the two
overlaid signals and enforce supplementary per-device constraints to guarantee
multicast fairness. Performance is evaluated in terms of the spectral
efficiency, multicast fairness, and bit error rate, thus corroborating the
feasibility of our proposed scheme.

Title: HydraWave: Multi-Group Multicast Hybrid Precoding and Low-Latency
  Scheduling for Ubiquitous Industry 4.0 mmWave Communication
Authors: Luis F. Abanto-Leon, Matthias Hollick, and Gek Hong (Allyson) Sim
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Industry 4.0 anticipates massive interconnectivity of industrial devices
(e.g., sensors, actuators) to support factory automation and production. Due to
the rigidity of wired connections to harmonize with automation, wireless
information transfer has attracted substantial attention. However, existing
solutions for the manufacturing sector face critical issues in coping with the
key performance demands: ultra-low latency, high throughput, and high
reliability. Besides, recent advancements in wireless millimeter-wave (mmWave)
technology advocates hybrid precoding with affordable hardware and outstanding
spatial multiplexing performance. Thus, we present HYDRAWAVE --- a new paradigm
that contemplates the joint design of group scheduling and hybrid precoding for
multi-group multicasting to support ubiquitous low-latency communications. Our
flexible hybrid precoder, based on semidefinite relaxation and Cholesky matrix
factorization, facilitates the robust design of the constant-modulus phase
shifts rendering formidable performance at a fraction of the power required by
fully-digital implementations. Further, our novel group scheduling formulation
minimizes the number of scheduling windows while accounting for the channel
correlation of the co-scheduled multicast receivers. Compared to exhaustive
search, which renders the optimal scheduling at high overhead, HYDRAWAVE incurs
only 9.5% more delay. Notoriously, HYDRAWAVE attains up to 102% gain when
compared to the other benchmarked schemes.

Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT

\\
  Future 5G communication systems require more demanding performances than the
existing cellular communication systems, e.g., 10 to 100 Mbps user data rate
and much larger cellular spectrum efficiency. The well-used multiple access
methods like CDMA and OFDMA are hard to achieve these challenging requirements
simultaneously even with advanced signal processing techniques and base station
cooperation. Recently, massive MIMO has gain much attention since it provides
large signal dimensions that can be used to improve future 5G cellular system
performance. This tutorial paper describes a recently proposed multiple access
scheme called multipath division multiple access (MDMA) based on massive
antennas and multipath channel characteristics in millimeter wave band, which
offers uniform user data rate and achieves high cellular spectrum efficiency
for 5G systems. We describe the fundamental principle and show the uplink and
downlink block diagrams, control signaling and the call setup process. Besides,
benefits of using MDMA as a multiple access scheme are discussed. Finally,
practical concerns are addressed for future research directions.

Title: Ambient backscatters-friendly 5G networks: creating hot spots for tags

Authors: Romain Fara, Dinh-Thuy Phan-Huy, and Marco Di Renzo
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference,
  2020
\\
  In this paper, we present an ambient backscatters-friendly 5G network that
creates locations with large power (hot spots) for tags and good reception
locations (quiet spots or coherent spots) for readers. The massive multiple
input multiple output (M-MIMO) antenna and beamforming capability of the 5G
network is used as follows. In a first step, a training device (separate from
tags and readers) is used to send pilots and train the 5G network to perform
focusing and/or nulling onto marked locations. In a second step, tags and
readers are positioned onto the marked locations. The robustness of M-MIMO
beamforming to slight changes in the environment is exploited. Our initial
simulation results, in a multipath propagation channel environment, show that
creating a hot spot on a tag improves the tag-reader range however with a low
probability of detection. Creating a hot spot on a tag and a good reception
spot on a reader at the same time, improves the tag-reader range with 99%
probability of detection. The study also shows that beamforming does not
degrade the performance of a legacy 5G communication.

Title: Data Augmentation for Histopathological Images Based on
  Gaussian-Laplacian Pyramid Blending

\\
  Data imbalance is a major problem that affects several machine learning
algorithms. Such problems are troublesome because most of the learning
algorithms attempts to optimize a loss function based on error measures that do
not take into account the data imbalance. Accordingly, the learning algorithm
simply generates a trivial model that is biased toward predicting the most
frequent class in the training data. Data augmentation techniques have been
used to mitigate the data imbalance problem. However, in the case of
histopathologic images (HIs), low-level as well as high-level data augmentation
techniques still present performance issues when applied in the presence of
inter-patient variability; whence the model tends to learn color
representations, which are in fact related to the stain process. In this paper,
we propose an approach capable of not only augmenting HIs database but also
distributing the inter-patient variability by means of image blending using
Gaussian-Laplacian pyramid. The proposed approach consists in finding the
Gaussian pyramids of two images of different patients and finding the Laplacian
pyramids thereof. Afterwards, the left half of one image and the right half of
another are joined in each level of Laplacian pyramid, and from the joint
pyramids, the original image is reconstructed. This composition, resulting from
the blending process, combines stain variation of two patients, avoiding that
color misleads the learning process. Experimental results on the BreakHis
dataset have shown promising gains vis-\`a-vis the majority of traditional
techniques presented in the literature.

Title: Boosting Algorithms for Estimating Optimal Individualized Treatment
  Rules
Authors: Duzhe Wang, Haoda Fu, Po-Ling Loh
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.AP
\\
  We present nonparametric algorithms for estimating optimal individualized
treatment rules. The proposed algorithms are based on the XGBoost algorithm,
which is known as one of the most powerful algorithms in the machine learning
literature. Our main idea is to model the conditional mean of clinical outcome
or the decision rule via additive regression trees, and use the boosting
technique to estimate each single tree iteratively. Our approaches overcome the
challenge of correct model specification, which is required in current
parametric methods. The major contribution of our proposed algorithms is
providing efficient and accurate estimation of the highly nonlinear and complex
optimal individualized treatment rules that often arise in practice. Finally,
we illustrate the superior performance of our algorithms by extensive
simulation studies and conclude with an application to the real data from a
diabetes Phase III trial.

Title: Dynamic and Distributed Online Convex Optimization for Demand Response

  We extend the regret analysis of the online distributed weighted dual
averaging (DWDA) algorithm[1] to the dynamic setting and provide the tightest
dynamic regret bound known to date for a distributed online convex optimization
(OCO) algorithm. Our bound is linear in the cumulative difference between
consecutive optima and does not depend explicitly on the time horizon. We use
dynamic-online DWDA (D-ODWDA) and formulate a performance-guaranteed
distributed online demand response approach for heating, ventilation, and
air-conditioning (HVAC) systems of commercial buildings. We show the
performance of our approach for fast timescale demand response in numerical
simulations and obtain demand response decisions that closely reproduce the

Title: Edge-based sequential graph generation with recurrent neural networks
Authors: Davide Bacciu, Alessio Micheli, Marco Podda
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Graph generation with Machine Learning is an open problem with applications
in various research fields. In this work, we propose to cast the generative
process of a graph into a sequential one, relying on a node ordering procedure.
We use this sequential process to design a novel generative model composed of
two recurrent neural networks that learn to predict the edges of graphs: the
first network generates one endpoint of each edge, while the second network
generates the other endpoint conditioned on the state of the first. We test our
approach extensively on five different datasets, comparing with two well-known
baselines coming from graph literature, and two recurrent approaches, one of
which holds state of the art performances. Evaluation is conducted considering
quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the generated samples. Results
show that our approach is able to yield novel, and unique graphs originating
from very different distributions, while retaining structural properties very
similar to those in the training sample. Under the proposed evaluation
framework, our approach is able to reach performances comparable to the current
state of the art on the graph generation task.

Title: Generative Modeling with Denoising Auto-Encoders and Langevin Sampling
Authors: Adam Block, Youssef Mroueh, and Alexander Rakhlin
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.PR
Comments: 22 pages
\\
  We study convergence of a generative modeling method that first estimates the
score function of the distribution using Denoising Auto-Encoders (DAE) or
Denoising Score Matching (DSM) and then employs Langevin diffusion for
sampling. We show that both DAE and DSM provide estimates of the score of the
Gaussian smoothed population density, allowing us to apply the machinery of
Empirical Processes.
  We overcome the challenge of relying only on $L^2$ bounds on the score
estimation error and provide finite-sample bounds in the Wasserstein distance
between the law of the population distribution and the law of this sampling
scheme. We then apply our results to the homotopy method of arXiv:1907.05600
and provide theoretical justification for its empirical success.

Title: The Statistical Complexity of Early Stopped Mirror Descent
Authors: Tomas Va\v{s}kevi\v{c}ius, Varun Kanade, Patrick Rebeschini
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Recently there has been a surge of interest in understanding implicit
regularization properties of iterative gradient-based optimization algorithms.
In this paper, we study the statistical guarantees on the excess risk achieved
by early stopped unconstrained mirror descent algorithms applied to the
unregularized empirical risk with squared loss for linear models and kernel
methods. We identify a link between offset Rademacher complexities and
potential-based analysis of mirror descent that allows disentangling statistics
from optimization in the analysis of such algorithms. Our main result
characterizes the statistical performance of the path traced by the iterates of
mirror descent in terms of offset complexities of certain function classes
depending only on the choice of the mirror map, initialization point,
step-size, and number of iterations. We apply our theory to recover, in a
rather clean and elegant manner, some of the recent results in the implicit
regularization literature, while also showing how to improve upon them in some
settings.

\\
  A brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a direct communication pathway
between user and external devices. Electroencephalogram (EEG) motor imagery
(MI) paradigm is widely used in non-invasive BCI to obtain encoded signals
contained user intention of movement execution. However, EEG has intricate and
non-stationary properties resulting in insufficient decoding performance. By
imagining numerous movements of a single-arm, decoding performance can be
improved without artificial command matching. In this study, we collected
intuitive EEG data contained the nine different types of movements of a
single-arm from 9 subjects. We propose an end-to-end role assigned
convolutional neural network (ERA-CNN) which considers discriminative features
of each upper limb region by adopting the principle of a hierarchical CNN
architecture. The proposed model outperforms previous methods on 3-class,
5-class and two different types of 7-class classification tasks. Hence, we
demonstrate the possibility of decoding user intention by using only EEG
signals with robust performance using an ERA-CNN.

  Serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) is a widely used technique for
obtaining volumetric information of biological tissues at nanometer scale.
However, accurate 3D reconstructions of identified cellular structures and
volumetric quantifications require precise estimates of section thickness and
anisotropy (or stretching) along the XY imaging plane. In fact, many image
processing algorithms simply assume isotropy within the imaging plane. To
ameliorate this problem, we present a method for estimating thickness and
stretching of electron microscopy sections using non-parametric Bayesian
regression of image statistics. We verify our thickness and stretching
estimates using direct measurements obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
and show that our method has a lower estimation error compared to a recent
indirect thickness estimation method as well as a relative Z coordinate
estimation method. Furthermore, we have made the first dataset of ssSEM images
with directly measured section thickness values publicly available for the
evaluation of indirect thickness estimation methods.

extracted new features will help to improve the quality of automatic

Sylvester equation that defines a generative model. The proposed model
complements the tensor graphical lasso (Greenewald et al., 2019) that imposes a
Kronecker sum model for the inverse covariance matrix by providing an
alternative Kronecker sum model that is generative and interpretable. A
nodewise regression approach is adopted for estimating the conditional
independence relationships among variables. The statistical convergence of the
method is established, and empirical studies are provided to demonstrate the
recovery of meaningful conditional dependency graphs. We apply the SyGlasso to
an electroencephalography (EEG) study to compare the brain connectivity of
alcoholic and nonalcoholic subjects. We demonstrate that our model can
simultaneously estimate both the brain connectivity and its temporal
dependencies.

Title: Oracle lower bounds for stochastic gradient sampling algorithms
Authors: Niladri S. Chatterji, Peter L. Bartlett, Philip M. Long
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.TH
Comments: 21 pages
\\
  We consider the problem of sampling from a strongly log-concave density in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, and prove an information theoretic lower bound on the number
of stochastic gradient queries of the log density needed. Several popular
sampling algorithms (including many Markov chain Monte Carlo methods) operate
by using stochastic gradients of the log density to generate a sample; our
results establish an information theoretic limit for all these algorithms.
  We show that for every algorithm, there exists a well-conditioned strongly
log-concave target density for which the distribution of points generated by
the algorithm would be at least $\varepsilon$ away from the target in total
variation distance if the number of gradient queries is less than
$\Omega(\sigma^2 d/\varepsilon^2)$, where $\sigma^2 d$ is the variance of the
stochastic gradient. Our lower bound follows by combining the ideas of Le Cam
deficiency routinely used in the comparison of statistical experiments along
with standard information theoretic tools used in lower bounding Bayes risk
functions. To the best of our knowledge our results provide the first
nontrivial dimension-dependent lower bound for this problem.

Title: Provable Noisy Sparse Subspace Clustering using Greedy Neighbor
  Selection: A Coherence-Based Perspective
Authors: Jwo-Yuh Wu, Wen-Hsuan Li, Liang-Chi Huang, Yen-Ping Lin, Chun-Hung Liu
  and Rung-Hung Gau
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) using greedy-based neighbor selection, such
as matching pursuit (MP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), has been known
as a popular computationally-efficient alternative to the conventional
L1-minimization based methods. Under deterministic bounded noise corruption, in
this paper we derive coherence-based sufficient conditions guaranteeing correct
neighbor identification using MP/OMP. Our analyses exploit the maximum/minimum
inner product between two noisy data points subject to a known upper bound on
the noise level. The obtained sufficient condition clearly reveals the impact
of noise on greedy-based neighbor recovery. Specifically, it asserts that, as
long as noise is sufficiently small so that the resultant perturbed residual
vectors stay close to the desired subspace, both MP and OMP succeed in
returning a correct neighbor subset. A striking finding is that, when the
ground truth subspaces are well-separated from each other and noise is not
large, MP-based iterations, while enjoying lower algorithmic complexity, yield
smaller perturbation of residuals, thereby better able to identify correct
neighbors and, in turn, achieving higher global data clustering accuracy.
Extensive numerical experiments are used to corroborate our theoretical study.

Title: Fast Generating A Large Number of Gumbel-Max Variables
Authors: Yiyan Qi, Pinghui Wang, Yuanming Zhang, Junzhou Zhao, Guangjian Tian,
  and Xiaohong Guan
Categories: stat.CO cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by WebConf2020
\\
  The well-known Gumbel-Max Trick for sampling elements from a categorical
distribution (or more generally a nonnegative vector) and its variants have
been widely used in areas such as machine learning and information retrieval.
To sample a random element $i$ (or a Gumbel-Max variable $i$) in proportion to
its positive weight $v_i$, the Gumbel-Max Trick first computes a Gumbel random
variable $g_i$ for each positive weight element $i$, and then samples the
element $i$ with the largest value of $g_i+\ln v_i$. Recently, applications
including similarity estimation and graph embedding require to generate $k$
independent Gumbel-Max variables from high dimensional vectors. However, it is
computationally expensive for a large $k$ (e.g., hundreds or even thousands)
when using the traditional Gumbel-Max Trick. To solve this problem, we propose
a novel algorithm, \emph{FastGM}, that reduces the time complexity from
$O(kn^+)$ to $O(k \ln k + n^+)$, where $n^+$ is the number of positive elements
in the vector of interest. Instead of computing $k$ independent Gumbel random
variables directly, we find that there exists a technique to generate these
variables in descending order. Using this technique, our method FastGM computes
variables $g_i+\ln v_i$ for all positive elements $i$ in descending order. As a
result, FastGM significantly reduces the computation time because we can stop
the procedure of Gumbel random variables computing for many elements especially
for those with small weights. Experiments on a variety of real-world datasets
show that FastGM is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods
without sacrificing accuracy and incurring additional expenses.

Title: Interference Classification Using Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Jianyuan Yu, Mohammad Alhassoun and R. Michael Buehrer
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
\\
  The recent success in implementing supervised learning to classify modulation
types suggests that other problems akin to modulation classification would
eventually benefit from that implementation. One of these problems is
classifying the interference type added to a signal-of-interest, also known as
interference classification. In this paper, we propose an interference
classification method using a deep neural network. We generate five distinct
types of interfering signals then use both the power-spectral density (PSD) and
the cyclic spectrum of the received signal as input features to the network.
The computer experiments reveal that using the received signal PSD outperforms
using its cyclic spectrum in terms of accuracy. In addition, the same
experiments show that the feed-forward networks yield better accuracy than
classic methods. The proposed classifier aids the subsequent stage in the
receiver chain with choosing the appropriate mitigation algorithm and also can
coexist with modulation-classification methods to further improve the
classifier accuracy.

Title: Multiple Angles of Arrival Estimation using Neural Networks
Authors: Jianyuan Yu
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
\\
  MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) and Estimation of signal parameters
via rotational via rotational invariance (ESPRIT) has been widely used in super
resolution direction of arrival estimation (DoA) in both Uniform Linear Arrays
(ULA) or Uniform Circular Arrays (UCA). However, problems become challenging
when the number of source signal increase, MUSIC suffer from computation
complexity when finding the peaks, while ESPRIT may not robust to array
geometry offset. Therefore, Neural Network become a potential solution. In this
paper, we propose a neural network to estimate the azimuth and elevation
angles, based on the correlated matrix extracted from received data. Also, a
serial scheme is listed to estimate multiple signals cases. The result shows
the neural network can achieve an accurate estimation under low SNR and deal
with multiple signals.

Title: Automatic structured variational inference
Authors: Luca Ambrogioni, Max Hinne, Marcel van Gerven
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  The aim of probabilistic programming is to automatize every aspect of
probabilistic inference in arbitrary probabilistic models (programs) so that
the user can focus her attention on modeling, without dealing with ad-hoc
inference methods. Gradient based automatic differentiation stochastic
variational inference offers an attractive option as the default method for
(differentiable) probabilistic programming as it combines high performance with
high computational efficiency. However, the performance of any (parametric)
variational approach depends on the choice of an appropriate variational
family. Here, we introduced a fully automatic method for constructing
structured variational families inspired to the closed-form update in conjugate
models. These pseudo-conjugate families incorporate the forward pass of the
input probabilistic program and can capture complex statistical dependencies.
Pseudo-conjugate families have the same space and time complexity of the input
probabilistic program and are therefore tractable in a very large class of
models. We validate our automatic variational method on a wide range of high
dimensional inference problems including deep learning components.

Title: Distance Metric Learning for Graph Structured Data
Authors: Tomoki Yoshida, Ichiro Takeuchi, Masayuki Karasuyama
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 46 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Graphs are versatile tools for representing structured data. Therefore, a
variety of machine learning methods have been studied for graph data analysis.
Although many of those learning methods depend on the measurement of
differences between input graphs, defining an appropriate distance metric for a
graph remains a controversial issue. Hence, we propose a supervised distance
metric learning method for the graph classification problem. Our method, named
interpretable graph metric learning (IGML), learns discriminative metrics in a
subgraph-based feature space, which has a strong graph representation
capability. By introducing a sparsity-inducing penalty on a weight of each
subgraph, IGML can identify a small number of important subgraphs that can
provide insight about the given classification task. Since our formulation has
a large number of optimization variables, an efficient algorithm is also
proposed by using pruning techniques based on safe screening and working set
selection methods. An important property of IGML is that the optimality of the
solution is guaranteed because the problem is formulated as a convex problem
and our pruning strategies only discard unnecessary subgraphs. Further, we show
that IGML is also applicable to other structured data such as item-set and
sequence data, and that it can incorporate vertex-label similarity by using a
transportation-based subgraph feature. We empirically evaluate the
computational efficiency and classification performance on several benchmark
datasets and show some illustrative examples demonstrating that IGML identifies
important subgraphs from a given graph dataset.

Title: Stochastic geometry to generalize the Mondrian Process
Authors: Eliza O'Reilly and Ngoc Tran
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.PR
MSC-class: 60D05, 62G07
\\
  The Mondrian process is a stochastic process that produces a recursive
partition of space with random axis-aligned cuts. Random forests and Laplace
kernel approximations built from the Mondrian process have led to efficient
online learning methods and Bayesian optimization. By viewing the Mondrian
process as a special case of the stable under iterated tessellation (STIT)
process, we utilize tools from stochastic geometry to resolve three fundamental
questions concern generalizability of the Mondrian process in machine learning.
First, we show that the Mondrian process with general cut directions can be
efficiently simulated, but it is unlikely to give rise to better classification
or regression algorithms. Second, we characterize all possible kernels that
generalizations of the Mondrian process can approximate. This includes, for
instance, various forms of the weighted Laplace kernel and the exponential
kernel. Third, we give an explicit formula for the density estimator arising
from a Mondrian forest. This allows for precise comparisons between the
Mondrian forest, the Mondrian kernel and the Laplace kernel in density
estimation. Our paper calls for further developments at the novel intersection
of stochastic geometry and machine learning.

Title: Limiting Spectrum of Randomized Hadamard Transform and Optimal Iterative
  Sketching Methods
Authors: Jonathan Lacotte, Sifan Liu, Edgar Dobriban and Mert Pilanci
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
\\
  We provide an exact analysis of the limiting spectrum of matrices randomly
projected either with the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform, or
truncated Haar matrices. We characterize this limiting distribution through its
Stieltjes transform, a classical object in random matrix theory, and compute
the first and second inverse moments. We leverage the limiting spectrum and
asymptotic freeness of random matrices to obtain an exact analysis of iterative
sketching methods for solving least squares problems. Our results also yield
optimal step-sizes and convergence rates in terms of simple closed-form
expressions. Moreover, we show that the convergence rate for Haar and
randomized Hadamard matrices are identical, and uniformly improve upon Gaussian
random projections. The developed techniques and formulas can be applied to a
plethora of randomized algorithms that employ fast randomized Hadamard
dimension reduction.

Title: Fragmentation Coagulation Based Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel
Authors: Zheng Yu, Xuhui Fan, Marcin Pietrasik, Marek Reformat
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG cs.SI
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  The Mixed-Membership Stochastic Blockmodel~(MMSB) is proposed as one of the
state-of-the-art Bayesian relational methods suitable for learning the complex
hidden structure underlying the network data. However, the current formulation
of MMSB suffers from the following two issues: (1), the prior information~(e.g.
entities' community structural information) can not be well embedded in the
modelling; (2), community evolution can not be well described in the
literature. Therefore, we propose a non-parametric fragmentation coagulation
based Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel (fcMMSB). Our model performs
entity-based clustering to capture the community information for entities and
linkage-based clustering to derive the group information for links
simultaneously. Besides, the proposed model infers the network structure and
models community evolution, manifested by appearances and disappearances of
communities, using the discrete fragmentation coagulation process (DFCP). By
integrating the community structure with the group compatibility matrix we
derive a generalized version of MMSB. An efficient Gibbs sampling scheme with
Polya Gamma (PG) approach is implemented for posterior inference. We validate
our model on synthetic and real world data.

Title: Siamese Neural Networks for EEG-based Brain-computer Interfaces
Authors: Soroosh Shahtalebi, Amir Asif, Arash Mohammadi
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
\\
  Motivated by the inconceivable capability of the human brain in
simultaneously processing multi-modal signals and its real-time feedback to the
outer world events, there has been a surge of interest in establishing a
communication bridge between the human brain and a computer, which are referred
to as Brain-computer Interfaces (BCI). To this aim, monitoring the electrical
activity of brain through Electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged as the prime
choice for BCI systems. To discover the underlying and specific features of
brain signals for different mental tasks, a considerable number of research
works are developed based on statistical and data-driven techniques. However, a
major bottleneck in the development of practical and commercial BCI systems is
their limited performance when the number of mental tasks for classification is
increased. In this work, we propose a new EEG processing and feature extraction
paradigm based on Siamese neural networks, which can be conveniently merged and
scaled up for multi-class problems. The idea of Siamese networks is to train a
double-input neural network based on a contrastive loss-function, which
provides the capability of verifying if two input EEG trials are from the same
class or not. In this work, a Siamese architecture, which is developed based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and provides a binary output on the
similarity of two inputs, is combined with OVR and OVO techniques to scale up
for multi-class problems. The efficacy of this architecture is evaluated on a
4-class Motor Imagery (MI) dataset from BCI Competition IV-2a and the results
suggest a promising performance compared to its counterparts.

witness set for subvarieties of a smooth complete complex algebraic variety

witness sets enable numerical algorithms such as sampling and membership. These
assumptions hold for products of flag manifolds. We introduce Schubert witness
sets, which provide general witness sets for Grassmannians and flag manifolds.

Title: A hybrid model based on deep LSTM for predicting high-dimensional

Categories: eess.SP cs.NE
\\
  We propose a hybrid method combining the deep long short-term memory (LSTM)
model with the inexact empirical model of dynamical systems to predict
high-dimensional chaotic systems. The deep hierarchy is encoded into the LSTM
by superimposing multiple recurrent neural network layers and the hybrid model
is trained with the Adam optimization algorithm. The statistical results of the
Mackey-Glass system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system are obtained under the
criteria of root mean square error (RMSE) and anomaly correlation coefficient
(ACC) using the singe-layer LSTM, the multi-layer LSTM, and the corresponding
hybrid method, respectively. The numerical results show that the proposed
method can effectively avoid the rapid divergence of the multi-layer LSTM model
when reconstructing chaotic attractors, and demonstrate the feasibility of the
combination of deep learning based on the gradient descent method and the
empirical model.

Title: Empirical Feasibility Analysis for Energy Harvesting Intra-Vehicular
  Wireless Sensor Networks
Authors: Mertkan Koca, Gokhan Gurbilek, Burak Soner and Sinem Coleri
Categories: eess.SP cs.NI
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table
\\
  Vehicle electronic systems currently utilize wired networks for power
delivery (from the main battery) and communication (e.g., LIN, CAN, FlexRay)
between nodes. Wired networks cannot practically accommodate nodes in moving
parts (e.g., tires) and with the increasing functional complexity in vehicles,
they require kilometer-long harnesses, significantly increasing fuel
consumption and manufacturing and design costs. As an alternative, energy
harvesting intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks (IVWSN) can accommodate
nodes in all locations and they obviate the need for wiring, significantly
lowering costs. In this paper, we empirically analyze the feasibility of such
an IVWSN framework via extensive in-vehicle measurements for communications at
2.4 GHz, ultra wideband (UWB) and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies together
with radio frequency (RF), thermal and vibration energy harvesting. Our
analyses show that mmWave performs best for short line-of-sight (LoS) links in
the engine compartment with performance close to UWB for LoS links in the
chassis and passenger compartments in terms of worst case
signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio. For non-LoS links, which appear
especially more in the engine compartment and chassis, UWB provides the highest
security and reliability. 2.4 GHz suffers heavily from interference in all
compartments while UWB utilizes narrowband suppression techniques at the cost
of lower bandwidth; mmWave inherently experiences very low interference due to
its propagation characteristics. On the other hand, RF energy harvesting
provides up to 1 mW of power in all compartments. Vibration and thermal energy
harvesters can supply all nodes consuming <10 mW in the engine compartment and
all <5 mW nodes in the chassis. In the passenger compartment, thermal
harvesting is not available due to low temperature gradients but vibration and
RF sources can supply <1 mW nodes.

Title: Characterization and Thermal Management of a DC Motor-Driven Resonant
  Actuator for Miniature Mobile Robots with Oscillating Limbs

\\
  In this paper, we characterize the performance of and develop thermal
management solutions for a DC motor-driven resonant actuator developed for
flapping wing micro air vehicles. The actuator, a DC micro-gearmotor connected
in parallel with a torsional spring, drives reciprocal wing motion. Compared to
the gearmotor alone, this design increased torque and power density by 161.1%
and 666.8%, respectively, while decreasing the drawn current by 25.8%.
Characterization of the actuator, isolated from nonlinear aerodynamic loading,
results in standard metrics directly comparable to other actuators. The
micro-motor, selected for low weight considerations, operates at high power for
limited duration due to thermal effects. To predict system performance, a
lumped parameter thermal circuit model was developed. Critical model parameters
for this micro-motor, two orders of magnitude smaller than those previously
characterized, were identified experimentally. This included the effects of
variable winding resistance, bushing friction, speed-dependent forced
convection, and the addition of a heatsink. The model was then used to
determine a safe operation envelope for the vehicle and to design a
weight-optimal heatsink. This actuator design and thermal modeling approach
could be applied more generally to improve the performance of any miniature
mobile robot or device with motor-driven oscillating limbs or loads.

\\
  Data augmentation is conventionally used to inject robustness in Speaker
Verification systems. Several recently organized challenges focus on handling
novel acoustic environments. Deep learning based speech enhancement is a modern
solution for this. Recently, a study proposed to optimize the enhancement
network in the activation space of a pre-trained auxiliary network. This
methodology, called deep feature loss, greatly improved over the
state-of-the-art conventional x-vector based system on a children speech
dataset called BabyTrain. This work analyzes various facets of that approach
and asks few novel questions in that context. We first search for optimal
number of auxiliary network activations, training data, and enhancement feature
dimension. Experiments reveal the importance of Signal-to-Noise Ratio filtering
that we employ to create a large, clean, and naturalistic corpus for
enhancement network training. To counter the "mismatch" problem in enhancement,
we find enhancing front-end (x-vector network) data helpful while harmful for
the back-end (Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA)). Importantly,
we find enhanced signals contain complementary information to original.
Established by combining them in front-end, this gives ~40% relative
improvement over the baseline. We also do an ablation study to remove a noise
class from x-vector data augmentation and, for such systems, we establish the
utility of enhancement regardless of whether it has seen that noise class
itself during training. Finally, we design several dereverberation schemes to
conclude ineffectiveness of deep feature loss enhancement scheme for this task.

Title: Exploiting Rays in Blind Localization of Distributed Sensor Arrays
Authors: Szymon Wo\'zniak and Konrad Kowalczyk
Categories: eess.SP cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted to ICASSP 2020
\\
  Many signal processing algorithms for distributed sensors are capable of
improving their performance if the positions of sensors are known. In this
paper, we focus on estimators for inferring the relative geometry of
distributed arrays and sources, i.e. the setup geometry up to a scaling factor.
Firstly, we present the Maximum Likelihood estimator derived under the
assumption that the Direction of Arrival measurements follow the von
Mises-Fisher distribution. Secondly, using unified notation, we show the
relations between the cost functions of a number of state-of-the-art relative
geometry estimators. Thirdly, we derive a novel estimator that exploits the
concept of rays between the arrays and source event positions. Finally, we show
the evaluation results for the presented estimators in various conditions,
which indicate that major improvements in the probability of convergence to the
optimum solution over the existing approaches can be achieved by using the
proposed ray-based estimator.

Title: Time Difference of Arrival Estimation from Frequency-Sliding Generalized
  Cross-Correlations Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Luca Comanducci, Maximo Cobos, Fabio Antonacci, Augusto Sarti
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD

\\
  The interest in deep learning methods for solving traditional signal
processing tasks has been steadily growing in the last years. Time delay
estimation (TDE) in adverse scenarios is a challenging problem, where classical
approaches based on generalized cross-correlations (GCCs) have been widely used
for decades. Recently, the frequency-sliding GCC (FS-GCC) was proposed as a
novel technique for TDE based on a sub-band analysis of the cross-power
spectrum phase, providing a structured two-dimensional representation of the
time delay information contained across different frequency bands. Inspired by
deep-learning-based image denoising solutions, we propose in this paper the use
of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the time-delay patterns
contained in FS-GCCs extracted in adverse acoustic conditions. Our experiments
confirm that the proposed approach provides excellent TDE performance while
being able to generalize to different room and sensor setups.

Title: Within-sample variability-invariant loss for robust speaker recognition
  under noisy environments
Authors: Danwei Cai, Weicheng Cai, Ming Li
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: Accepted at ICASSP 2020
\\
  Despite the significant improvements in speaker recognition enabled by deep
neural networks, unsatisfactory performance persists under noisy environments.
In this paper, we train the speaker embedding network to learn the "clean"
embedding of the noisy utterance. Specifically, the network is trained with the
original speaker identification loss with an auxiliary within-sample
variability-invariant loss. This auxiliary variability-invariant loss is used
to learn the same embedding among the clean utterance and its noisy copies and
prevents the network from encoding the undesired noises or variabilities into
the speaker representation. Furthermore, we investigate the data preparation
strategy for generating clean and noisy utterance pairs on-the-fly. The
strategy generates different noisy copies for the same clean utterance at each
training step, helping the speaker embedding network generalize better under
noisy environments. Experiments on VoxCeleb1 indicate that the proposed
training framework improves the performance of the speaker verification system
in both clean and noisy conditions.

Title: Betweenness centrality for temporal multiplexes
Authors: Silvia Zaoli and Piero Mazzarisi and Fabrizio Lillo
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.SI
\\
  Betweenness centrality quantifies the importance of a vertex for the
information flow in a network. We propose a flexible definition of betweenness
for temporal multiplexes, where geodesics are determined accounting for the
topological and temporal structure and the duration of paths. We propose an
algorithm to compute the new metric via a mapping to a static graph. We show
the importance of considering the temporal multiplex structure and an
appropriate distance metric comparing the results with those obtained with
static or single-layer metrics on a dataset of $\sim 20$k European flights.

Title: A New Derivative-Free Linear Approximation for Solving the Network Water
  Flow Problem with Convergence Guarantees
Authors: Shen Wang and Ahmad F. Taha and Lina Sela and Marcio Giacomoni and

Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY

\\
  Addressing challenges in urban water infrastructure systems including aging
infrastructure, supply uncertainty, extreme events, and security threats,
depend highly on water distribution networks modeling emphasizing the
importance of realistic assumptions, modeling complexities, and scalable
solutions. In this study, we propose a derivative-free, linear approximation
for solving the network water flow problem (WFP). The proposed approach takes
advantage of the special form of the nonlinear head loss equations and, after
the transformation of variables and constraints, the WFP reduces to a linear
optimization problem that can be efficiently solved by modern linear solvers.
Ultimately, the proposed approach amounts to solving a series of linear
optimization problems. We demonstrate the proposed approach through several
case studies and show that the approach can model arbitrary network topologies
and various types of valves and pumps, thus providing modeling flexibility.
Under mild conditions, we show that the proposed linear approximation
converges. We provide sensitivity analysis and discuss in detail the current
limitations of our approach and suggest solutions to overcome these. All the
codes, tested networks, and results are freely available on Github for research
reproducibility.

Title: A Model of Distributed Disorders Detection

MSC-class: Primary: 93E10, 62L15, Secondary: 93E03, 60G40
\\
  The paper deals with disorders detection in the multivariate stochastic
process. We consider the multidimensional Poisson process or the multivariate
renewal process. This class of processes can be used as a description of the
distributed detection system. The multivariate renewal process can be seen as
the sequence of random vectors, where parts of its coordinates are holding
times, others are the size of jumps and the index of stream, at which the new
event appears. It is assumed that at each stream two kinds of changes are
possible: in the holding time or in the size of jumps distribution. The various
specific mutual relations between the change points are possible. The aim of
the research is to derive the detectors which realize the optimal value of the
specified criterion. The change point moment estimates have been obtained in
some cases. The difficulties have appeared for the dependent streams with
unspecified order of change points. The presented results suggest further
research on the construction of detectors in the general model.

Title: Price of Anarchy in Multiuser Massive MIMO: Coordinated versus
  Uncoordinated Channel Tracking for High-Rate Internet of Things
Authors: Hediyeh Soltanizadeh, Shahrokh Farahmand, S. Mohammad Razavizadeh
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications
\\
  Incorporation of high-rate internet of things (IoT) service into a massive
MIMO framework is investigated. It is revealed that massive MIMO possess the
inherent potential to offer such service provided it knows the channels for all
devices. Our proposed method is to jointly estimate and track the channels of
all devices irrespective of their current activity. Using the dynamical model
for devices' channels evolution over time, optimal and sub-optimal trackers are
developed for coordinated scenario. Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm
where the BS need not know the pilot access patterns of devices in advance
which we refer to as uncoordinated setup. After motivating this scenario, we
derive the optimal tracker which is intractable. Then, target tracking
approaches are applied to address uncertainties in the measurements and derive
sub-optimal trackers. Our proposed approaches explicitly address the channel
aging problem and will not require downlink paging and uplink access request
control channels which can become bottlenecks in crowded scenarios. The
fundamental minimum mean square error (MMSE) gap between optimal coordinated
and uncoordinated trackers which is defined as price of anarchy is evaluated
and upper-bounded. Stability of optimal trackers is also investigated. Finally,
performance of various proposed trackers are numerically compared.

Title: Temperature Dependence of Volatile Current shoot-up in PrMnO3 based
  Selector-less RRAM
Authors: S. Lashkare, A. Bhat, and U. Ganguly
Categories: physics.app-ph cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 4 pages, 8 figures
\\
  PrMnO3 (PMO) based Resistance Random Access Memory (RRAM) has recently been
considered for selector-less RRAM and neuromorphic computing applications by
utilizing its current shoot-up. This current shoot-up in the PMO device is
attributed to the thermal runaway in the device. Hence, the understanding of
the ambient temperature dependence on the current shoot-up of the PMO device is
essential for the various applications that utilize the negative differential
resistance (NDR). In this paper, we characterize the ambient thermal dependence
of dc IV, accompanied by the development of analytical modeling. First, the
temperature-dependent current-voltage characteristic and shift in the threshold
voltage of the PMO device are shown experimentally. Second, a Joule heating
based thermal feedback model coupled with current transport by space charge
limited current (SCLC) is developed to explain the experimentally observed NDR
region. Finally, the model successfully predicts device behavior over a range
of experimental ambient temperatures. As an alternative to TCAD, such a compact
and accurate dc model sets up a platform to enable understanding, design with
device and systems-level simulations of memory and neuromorphic applications.

Title: On the Performance of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA): Terrestrial
  vs. Aerial Networks
Authors: Mehdi Monemi, Hina Tabassum, Ramein Zahedi
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access
technique for beyond fifth generation (B5G) cellular wireless networks, where
several users can be served on a single time-frequency resource block, using
the concepts of superposition coding at the transmitter and selfinterference
cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. For terrestrial networks, the achievable
performance gains of NOMA over traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) are
well-known. However, the achievable performance of NOMA in aerial networks,
compared to terrestrial networks, is not well-understood. In this paper, we
provide a unified analytic framework to characterize the outage probabilities
of users considering various network settings, such as i) uplink and downlink
NOMA and OMA in aerial networks, and ii) uplink and downlink NOMA and OMA in
terrestrial networks. In particular, we derive closed-form rate outage
probability expressions for two users, considering line-of-sight (LOS) Rician
fading channels. Numerical results validate the derived analytical expressions
and demonstrate the difference of outage probabilities of users with OMA and
NOMA transmissions. Numerical results unveil that the optimal UAV height
increases with the increase in Rice-K factor, which implies strong
line-of-sight (LOS) conditions.
