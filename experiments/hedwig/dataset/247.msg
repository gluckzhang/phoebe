Title: Natural Language Processing Advancements By Deep Learning: A Survey
Authors: Amirsina Torfi, Rouzbeh A. Shirvani, Yaser Keneshloo, Nader Tavvaf,
  Edward A. Fox
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps empower intelligent machines by
enhancing a better understanding of the human language for linguistic-based
human-computer communication. Recent developments in computational power and
the advent of large amounts of linguistic data have heightened the need and
demand for automating semantic analysis using data-driven approaches. The
utilization of data-driven strategies is pervasive now due to the significant
improvements demonstrated through the usage of deep learning methods in areas
such as Computer Vision, Automatic Speech Recognition, and in particular, NLP.
This survey categorizes and addresses the different aspects and applications of
NLP that have benefited from deep learning. It covers core NLP tasks and
applications and describes how deep learning methods and models advance these
areas. We further analyze and compare different approaches and state-of-the-art
models.

Title: BARD: A structured technique for group elicitation of Bayesian networks

  In many complex, real-world situations, problem solving and decision making
require effective reasoning about causation and uncertainty. However, human
reasoning in these cases is prone to confusion and error. Bayesian networks
(BNs) are an artificial intelligence technology that models uncertain
situations, supporting probabilistic and causal reasoning and decision making.
However, to date, BN methodologies and software require significant upfront
training, do not provide much guidance on the model building process, and do
not support collaboratively building BNs. BARD (Bayesian ARgumentation via
Delphi) is both a methodology and an expert system that utilises (1) BNs as the
underlying structured representations for better argument analysis, (2) a
multi-user web-based software platform and Delphi-style social processes to
assist with collaboration, and (3) short, high-quality e-courses on demand, a
highly structured process to guide BN construction, and a variety of helpful
tools to assist in building and reasoning with BNs, including an automated
explanation tool to assist effective report writing. The result is an
end-to-end online platform, with associated online training, for groups without
prior BN expertise to understand and analyse a problem, build a model of its
underlying probabilistic causal structure, validate and reason with the causal
model, and use it to produce a written analytic report. Initial experimental
results demonstrate that BARD aids in problem solving, reasoning and
collaboration.

Title: Reachability Analysis for Feed-Forward Neural Networks using Face
  Lattices
Authors: Xiaodong Yang, Hoang-Dung Tran, Weiming Xiang, Taylor Johnson
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Deep neural networks have been widely applied as an effective approach to
handle complex and practical problems. However, one of the most fundamental
open problems is the lack of formal methods to analyze the safety of their
behaviors. To address this challenge, we propose a parallelizable technique to
compute exact reachable sets of a neural network to an input set. Our method
currently focuses on feed-forward neural networks with ReLU activation
functions. One of the primary challenges for polytope-based approaches is
identifying the intersection between intermediate polytopes and hyperplanes
from neurons. In this regard, we present a new approach to construct the
polytopes with the face lattice, a complete combinatorial structure. The
correctness and performance of our methodology are evaluated by verifying the
safety of ACAS Xu networks and other benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods such as Reluplex, Marabou, and NNV, our approach exhibits a
significantly higher efficiency. Additionally, our approach is capable of
constructing the complete input set given an output set, so that any input that
leads to safety violation can be tracked.

Title: Predicting A Creator's Preferences In, and From, Interactive Generative
  Art
Authors: Devi Parikh
Categories: cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG
\\
  As a lay user creates an art piece using an interactive generative art tool,
what, if anything, do the choices they make tell us about them and their
preferences? These preferences could be in the specific generative art form
(e.g., color palettes, density of the piece, thickness or curvatures of any
lines in the piece); predicting them could lead to a smarter interactive tool.
Or they could be preferences in other walks of life (e.g., music, fashion,
food, interior design, paintings) or attributes of the person (e.g.,
personality type, gender, artistic inclinations); predicting them could lead to
improved personalized recommendations for products or experiences.
  To study this research question, we collect preferences from 311 subjects,
both in a specific generative art form and in other walks of life. We analyze
the preferences and train machine learning models to predict a subset of
preferences from the remaining. We find that preferences in the generative art
form we studied cannot predict preferences in other walks of life better than
chance (and vice versa). However, preferences within the generative art form
are reliably predictive of each other.

Title: ADWPNAS: Architecture-Driven Weight Prediction for Neural Architecture
  Search
Authors: XuZhang, ChenjunZhou, BoGu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  How to discover and evaluate the true strength of models quickly and
accurately is one of the key challenges in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To
cope with this problem, we propose an Architecture-Driven Weight Prediction
(ADWP) approach for neural architecture search (NAS). In our approach, we first
design an architecture-intensive search space and then train a HyperNetwork by
inputting stochastic encoding architecture parameters. In the trained
HyperNetwork, weights of convolution kernels can be well predicted for neural
architectures in the search space. Consequently, the target architectures can
be evaluated efficiently without any finetuning, thus enabling us to search
fortheoptimalarchitectureinthespaceofgeneralnetworks (macro-search). Through
real experiments, we evaluate the performance of the models discovered by the
proposed AD-WPNAS and results show that one search procedure can be completed
in 4.0 GPU hours on CIFAR-10. Moreover, the discovered model obtains a test
error of 2.41% with only 1.52M parameters which is superior to the best
existing models.

  Task 1 of the DSTC8-track1 challenge aims to develop an end-to-end
multi-domain dialogue system to accomplish complex users' goals under tourist
information desk settings. This paper describes our submitted solution,
Hierarchical Context Enhanced Dialogue System (HCEDS), for this task. The main
motivation of our system is to comprehensively explore the potential of
hierarchical context for sufficiently understanding complex dialogues. More
specifically, we apply BERT to capture token-level information and employ the
attention mechanism to capture sentence-level information. The results listed
in the leaderboard show that our system achieves first place in automatic
evaluation and the second place in human evaluation.

Title: Benchmark Performance of Machine And Deep Learning Based Methodologies
  for Urdu Text Document Classification
Authors: Muhammad Nabeel Asim, Muhammad Usman Ghani, Muhammad Ali Ibrahim,
  Sheraz Ahmad, Waqar Mahmood, Andreas Dengel
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In order to provide benchmark performance for Urdu text document
classification, the contribution of this paper is manifold. First, it pro-vides
a publicly available benchmark dataset manually tagged against 6 classes.
Second, it investigates the performance impact of traditional machine learning
based Urdu text document classification methodologies by embedding 10
filter-based feature selection algorithms which have been widely used for other
languages. Third, for the very first time, it as-sesses the performance of
various deep learning based methodologies for Urdu text document
classification. In this regard, for experimentation, we adapt 10 deep learning
classification methodologies which have pro-duced best performance figures for
English text classification. Fourth, it also investigates the performance
impact of transfer learning by utiliz-ing Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers approach for Urdu language. Fifth, it evaluates the integrity
of a hybrid approach which combines traditional machine learning based feature
engineering and deep learning based automated feature engineering. Experimental
results show that feature selection approach named as Normalised Dif-ference
Measure along with Support Vector Machine outshines state-of-the-art
performance on two closed source benchmark datasets CLE Urdu Digest 1000k, and
CLE Urdu Digest 1Million with a significant margin of 32%, and 13%
respectively. Across all three datasets, Normalised Differ-ence Measure
outperforms other filter based feature selection algorithms as it significantly
uplifts the performance of all adopted machine learning, deep learning, and
hybrid approaches. The source code and presented dataset are available at
Github repository.

Title: Learning Context-aware Task Reasoning for Efficient Meta-reinforcement
  Learning
Authors: Haozhe Wang, Jiale Zhou, Xuming He
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: accepted to AAMAS2020
\\
  Despite recent success of deep network-based Reinforcement Learning (RL), it
remains elusive to achieve human-level efficiency in learning novel tasks.
While previous efforts attempt to address this challenge using meta-learning
strategies, they typically suffer from sampling inefficiency with on-policy RL
algorithms or meta-overfitting with off-policy learning. In this work, we
propose a novel meta-RL strategy to address those limitations. In particular,
we decompose the meta-RL problem into three sub-tasks, task-exploration,
task-inference and task-fulfillment, instantiated with two deep network agents
and a task encoder. During meta-training, our method learns a task-conditioned
actor network for task-fulfillment, an explorer network with a self-supervised
reward shaping that encourages task-informative experiences in
task-exploration, and a context-aware graph-based task encoder for task
inference. We validate our approach with extensive experiments on several
public benchmarks and the results show that our algorithm effectively performs
exploration for task inference, improves sample efficiency during both training
and testing, and mitigates the meta-overfitting problem.

Title: Understanding the Prediction Mechanism of Sentiments by XAI

\\
  People often rely on online reviews to make purchase decisions. The present
work aimed to gain an understanding of a machine learning model's prediction
mechanism by visualizing the effect of sentiments extracted from online hotel
reviews with explainable AI (XAI) methodology. Study 1 used the extracted
sentiments as features to predict the review ratings by five machine learning
algorithms (knn, CART decision trees, support vector machines, random forests,
gradient boosting machines) and identified random forests as best algorithm.
Study 2 analyzed the random forests model by feature importance and revealed
the sentiments joy, disgust, positive and negative as the most predictive
features. Furthermore, the visualization of additive variable attributions and
their prediction distribution showed correct prediction in direction and effect
size for the 5-star rating but partially wrong direction and insufficient
effect size for the 1-star rating. These prediction details were corroborated
by a what-if analysis for the four top features. In conclusion, the prediction
mechanism of a machine learning model can be uncovered by visualization of
particular observations. Comparing instances of contrasting ground truth values
can draw a differential picture of the prediction mechanism and inform
decisions for model improvement.

Title: Evaluation Framework For Large-scale Federated Learning
Authors: Lifeng Liu and Fengda Zhang and Jun Xiao and Chao Wu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Federated learning is proposed as a machine learning setting to enable
distributed edge devices, such as mobile phones, to collaboratively learn a
shared prediction model while keeping all the training data on device, which
can not only take full advantage of data distributed across millions of nodes
to train a good model but also protect data privacy. However, learning in
scenario above poses new challenges. In fact, data across a massive number of
unreliable devices is likely to be non-IID (identically and independently
distributed), which may make the performance of models trained by federated
learning unstable. In this paper, we introduce a framework designed for
large-scale federated learning which consists of approaches to generating
dataset and modular evaluation framework. Firstly, we construct a suite of
open-source non-IID datasets by providing three respects including covariate
shift, prior probability shift, and concept shift, which are grounded in
real-world assumptions. In addition, we design several rigorous evaluation
metrics including the number of network nodes, the size of datasets, the number
of communication rounds and communication resources etc. Finally, we present an
open-source benchmark for large-scale federated learning research.

Authors: Chaehan So
Categories: cs.AI cs.CY
Comments: To be published in IEEE conference proceedings: 2nd International
  Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Information and Communication,

\\
  This paper investigates how accurately the prediction of being an introvert
vs. extrovert can be made with less than ten predictors. The study is based on
a previous data collection of 7161 respondents of a survey on 91 personality
and 3 demographic items. The results show that it is possible to effectively
reduce the size of this measurement instrument from 94 to 10 features with a
performance loss of only 1%, achieving an accuracy of 73.81% on unseen data.
Class imbalance correction methods like SMOTE or ADASYN showed considerable
improvement on the validation set but only minor performance improvement on the
testing set.

Title: Model Assertions for Monitoring and Improving ML Model
Authors: Daniel Kang, Deepti Raghavan, Peter Bailis, Matei Zaharia
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Journal-ref: MLSys 2020
\\
  ML models are increasingly deployed in settings with real world interactions
such as vehicles, but unfortunately, these models can fail in systematic ways.
To prevent errors, ML engineering teams monitor and continuously improve these
models. We propose a new abstraction, model assertions, that adapts the
classical use of program assertions as a way to monitor and improve ML models.
Model assertions are arbitrary functions over a model's input and output that
indicate when errors may be occurring, e.g., a function that triggers if an
object rapidly changes its class in a video. We propose methods of using model
assertions at all stages of ML system deployment, including runtime monitoring,
validating labels, and continuously improving ML models. For runtime
monitoring, we show that model assertions can find high confidence errors,
where a model returns the wrong output with high confidence, which
uncertainty-based monitoring techniques would not detect. For training, we
propose two methods of using model assertions. First, we propose a bandit-based
active learning algorithm that can sample from data flagged by assertions and
show that it can reduce labeling costs by up to 40% over traditional
uncertainty-based methods. Second, we propose an API for generating
"consistency assertions" (e.g., the class change example) and weak labels for
inputs where the consistency assertions fail, and show that these weak labels
can improve relative model quality by up to 46\%. We evaluate model assertions
on four real-world tasks with video, LIDAR, and ECG data.

Title: EXPLAIN-IT: Towards Explainable AI for Unsupervised Network Traffic
  Analysis
Authors: Andrea Morichetta, Pedro Casas, Marco Mellia
Categories: cs.AI cs.NI
\\
  The application of unsupervised learning approaches, and in particular of
clustering techniques, represents a powerful exploration means for the analysis
of network measurements. Discovering underlying data characteristics, grouping
similar measurements together, and identifying eventual patterns of interest
are some of the applications which can be tackled through clustering. Being
unsupervised, clustering does not always provide precise and clear insight into
the produced output, especially when the input data structure and distribution
are complex and difficult to grasp. In this paper we introduce EXPLAIN-IT, a
methodology which deals with unlabeled data, creates meaningful clusters, and
suggests an explanation to the clustering results for the end-user. EXPLAIN-IT
relies on a novel explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach, which
allows to understand the reasons leading to a particular decision of a
supervised learning-based model, additionally extending its application to the
unsupervised learning domain. We apply EXPLAIN-IT to the problem of YouTube
video quality classification under encrypted traffic scenarios, showing
promising results.

Title: Direct Product Primality Testing of Graphs is GI-hard
Authors: Luca Calderoni, Luciano Margara, Moreno Marzolla
Categories: cs.CC
\\
  We investigate the computational complexity of the graph primality testing
problem with respect to the direct product (also known as Kronecker, cardinal
or tensor product). In [1] Imrich proves that both primality testing and a
unique prime factorization can be determined in polynomial time for (finite)
connected and nonbipartite graphs. The author states as an open problem how
results on the direct product of nonbipartite, connected graphs extend to
bipartite connected graphs and to disconnected ones. In this paper we partially
answer this question by proving that the graph isomorphism problem is
polynomial-time many-one reducible to the graph compositeness testing problem
(the complement of the graph primality testing problem). As a consequence of
this result, we prove that the graph isomorphism problem is polynomial-time
Turing reducible to the primality testing problem. Our results show that
connectedness plays a crucial role in determining the computational complexity
of the graph primality testing problem.

Title: Framework of Fracture Network Modeling using Conditioned Data with
  Sequential Gaussian Simulation
Authors: Yerlan Amanbek, Timur Merembayev and Sanjay Srinivasan
Categories: cs.CE
\\
  The fracture characterization using a geostatistical tool with conditioning
data is a computationally efficient tool for subsurface flow and transport
applications. The main objective of the paper is to propose a framework of
geostatistical method to model the fracture network. In the method, we have
chosen neighborhood area to apply the Gaussian Sequential Simulation in order
to generate the fracture network in the unknown region. The angle was
propagated from the seed where direction is guided by the neighborhood data in
simulation regime. Initial seeds can be distributed by Poisson procedure. The
method is applied for geological faults from the Central Kazakhstan and for
field data from Scotland, UK. The simulation results are compatible with the
original fracture network in the flow and transport modeling setting. From the
research that has been carried out, it is possible to conclude that the
numerical simulation of fracture network is a valuable tool in the subsurface
flow and transport applications.

Title: Shape analysis via inconsistent surface registration
Authors: Gary P. T. Choi, Di Qiu, Lok Ming Lui
Categories: cs.CG cs.CV q-bio.QM
\\
  In this work, we develop a framework for shape analysis using inconsistent
surface mapping. Traditional landmark-based geometric morphometrics methods
suffer from the limited degrees of freedom, while most of the more advanced
non-rigid surface mapping methods rely on a strong assumption of the global
consistency of two surfaces. From a practical point of view, given two
anatomical surfaces with prominent feature landmarks, it is more desirable to
have a method that automatically detects the most relevant parts of the two
surfaces and finds the optimal landmark-matching alignment between those parts,
without assuming any global 1-1 correspondence between the two surfaces. Our
method is capable of solving this problem using inconsistent surface
registration based on quasi-conformal theory. It further enables us to quantify
the dissimilarity of two shapes using quasi-conformal distortion and
differences in mean and Gaussian curvatures, thereby providing a natural way
for shape classification. Experiments on Platyrrhine molars demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and shed light on the interplay between function
and shape in nature.

Title: Procedural band patterns
Authors: Jimmy Etienne (MFX), Sylvain Lefebvre (MFX)
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  We seek to cover a parametric domain with a set of evenly spaced bands which
number and widthvaries according to a density field. We propose an implicit
procedural algorithm, that generates theband pattern from a pixel shader and
adapts to changes to the control fields in real time. Each band isuniquely
identified by an integer. This allows a wide range of texturing effects,
including specifying adifferent appearance in each individual bands. Our
technique also affords for progressive gradationsof scales, avoiding the abrupt
doubling of the number of lines of typical subdivision approaches. Thisleads to
a general approach for drawing bands, drawing splitting and merging curves, and
drawingevenly spaced streamlines. Using these base ingredients, we demonstrate
a wide variety of texturingeffects.

annotated data. Electronic health record systems are ubiquitous and the
majority of patients' data are now being collected electronically and in
particular in the form of free text. Identification of medical concepts and
information extraction is a challenging task, yet important ingredient for
parsing unstructured data into structured and tabulated format for downstream
analytical tasks. In this work we introduced a named-entity recognition model
for clinical natural language processing. The model is trained to recognise
seven categories: drug names, route, frequency, dosage, strength, form,
duration. The model was first self-supervisedly pre-trained by predicting the
next word, using a collection of 2 million free-text patients' records from
MIMIC-III corpora and then fine-tuned on the named-entity recognition task. The
model achieved a lenient (strict) micro-averaged F1 score of 0.957 (0.893)
across all seven categories. Additionally, we evaluated the transferability of
the developed model using the data from the Intensive Care Unit in the US to
secondary care mental health records (CRIS) in the UK. A direct application of
the trained NER model to CRIS data resulted in reduced performance of F1=0.762,
however after fine-tuning on a small sample from CRIS, the model achieved a
reasonable performance of F1=0.944. This demonstrated that despite a close
similarity between the data sets and the NER tasks, it is essential to
fine-tune on the target domain data in order to achieve more accurate results.

Title: Transfer Learning for Context-Aware Spoken Language Understanding
Authors: Qian Chen, Zhu Zhuo, Wen Wang, Qiuyun Xu

Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, ASRU2019
Journal-ref: 2019 IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop

DOI: 10.1109/ASRU46091.2019.9003902
\\
  Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a key component of task-oriented
dialogue systems. SLU parses natural language user utterances into semantic
frames. Previous work has shown that incorporating context information
significantly improves SLU performance for multi-turn dialogues. However,
collecting a large-scale human-labeled multi-turn dialogue corpus for the
target domains is complex and costly. To reduce dependency on the collection
and annotation effort, we propose a Context Encoding Language Transformer
(CELT) model facilitating exploiting various context information for SLU. We
explore different transfer learning approaches to reduce dependency on data
collection and annotation. In addition to unsupervised pre-training using
large-scale general purpose unlabeled corpora, such as Wikipedia, we explore
unsupervised and supervised adaptive training approaches for transfer learning
to benefit from other in-domain and out-of-domain dialogue corpora.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model with the proposed
transfer learning approaches achieves significant improvement on the SLU
performance over state-of-the-art models on two large-scale single-turn
dialogue benchmarks and one large-scale multi-turn dialogue benchmark.

Title: Controllable Time-Delay Transformer for Real-Time Punctuation Prediction
  and Disfluency Detection
Authors: Qian Chen, Mengzhe Chen, Bo Li, Wen Wang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, accepted by ICASSP 2020
\\
  With the increased applications of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in
recent years, it is essential to automatically insert punctuation marks and
remove disfluencies in transcripts, to improve the readability of the
transcripts as well as the performance of subsequent applications, such as
machine translation, dialogue systems, and so forth. In this paper, we propose
a Controllable Time-delay Transformer (CT-Transformer) model that jointly
completes the punctuation prediction and disfluency detection tasks in real
time. The CT-Transformer model facilitates freezing partial outputs with
controllable time delay to fulfill the real-time constraints in partial
decoding required by subsequent applications. We further propose a fast
decoding strategy to minimize latency while maintaining competitive
performance. Experimental results on the IWSLT2011 benchmark dataset and an
in-house Chinese annotated dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models on F-scores and achieves a
competitive inference speed.

Title: Improving Candidate Generation for Low-resource Cross-lingual Entity
  Linking
Authors: Shuyan Zhou and Shruti Rijhawani and John Wieting and Jaime Carbonell
  and Graham Neubig
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to TACL 2020
\\
  Cross-lingual entity linking (XEL) is the task of finding referents in a
target-language knowledge base (KB) for mentions extracted from source-language
texts. The first step of (X)EL is candidate generation, which retrieves a list
of plausible candidate entities from the target-language KB for each mention.
Approaches based on resources from Wikipedia have proven successful in the
realm of relatively high-resource languages (HRL), but these do not extend well
to low-resource languages (LRL) with few, if any, Wikipedia pages. Recently,
transfer learning methods have been shown to reduce the demand for resources in
the LRL by utilizing resources in closely-related languages, but the
performance still lags far behind their high-resource counterparts. In this
paper, we first assess the problems faced by current entity candidate
generation methods for low-resource XEL, then propose three improvements that
(1) reduce the disconnect between entity mentions and KB entries, and (2)
improve the robustness of the model to low-resource scenarios. The methods are
simple, but effective: we experiment with our approach on seven XEL datasets
and find that they yield an average gain of 16.9% in Top-30 gold candidate
recall, compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our improved model also yields
an average gain of 7.9% in in-KB accuracy of end-to-end XEL.

  Model

Comments: 8 pages, 9 tables
\\
  In this paper, we introduce the Chinese corpus from CLUE organization,
CLUECorpus2020, a large-scale corpus that can be used directly for
self-supervised learning such as pre-training of a language model, or language
generation. It has 100G raw corpus with 35 billion Chinese characters, which is
retrieved from Common Crawl. To better understand this corpus, we conduct
language understanding experiments on both small and large scale, and results
show that the models trained on this corpus can achieve excellent performance
on Chinese. We release a new Chinese vocabulary with a size of 8K, which is
only one-third of the vocabulary size used in Chinese Bert released by Google.
It saves computational cost and memory while works as good as original
vocabulary. We also release both large and tiny versions of the pre-trained
model on this corpus. The former achieves the state-of-the-art result, and the
latter retains most precision while accelerating training and prediction speed
for eight times compared to Bert-base. To facilitate future work on
self-supervised learning on Chinese, we release our dataset, new vocabulary,
codes, and pre-trained models on Github.

Title: Meta-Embeddings Based On Self-Attention
Authors: Qichen Li, Xiaoke Jiang, Jun Xia, Jian Li
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Creating meta-embeddings for better performance in language modelling has
received attention lately, and methods based on concatenation or merely
calculating the arithmetic mean of more than one separately trained embeddings
to perform meta-embeddings have shown to be beneficial. In this paper, we
devise a new meta-embedding model based on the self-attention mechanism, namely
the Duo. With less than 0.4M parameters, the Duo mechanism achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in text classification tasks such as 20NG.
Additionally, we propose a new meta-embedding sequece-to-sequence model for
machine translation, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first machine
translation model based on more than one word-embedding. Furthermore, it has
turned out that our model outperform the Transformer not only in terms of
achieving a better result, but also a faster convergence on recognized
benchmarks, such as the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task.

Categories: cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  While many BERT-based cross-modal pre-trained models produce excellent
results on downstream understanding tasks like image-text retrieval and VQA,
they cannot be applied to generation tasks directly. In this paper, we propose
XGPT, a new method of Cross-modal Generative Pre-Training for Image Captioning
that is designed to pre-train text-to-image caption generators through three
novel generation tasks, including Image-conditioned Masked Language Modeling
(IMLM), Image-conditioned Denoising Autoencoding (IDA), and Text-conditioned
Image Feature Generation (TIFG). As a result, the pre-trained XGPT can be
fine-tuned without any task-specific architecture modifications to create
state-of-the-art models for image captioning. Experiments show that XGPT
obtains new state-of-the-art results on the benchmark datasets, including COCO
Captions and Flickr30k Captions. We also use XGPT to generate new image
captions as data augmentation for the image retrieval task and achieve
significant improvement on all recall metrics.

  Conversational emotion recognition (CER) has attracted increasing interests
in the natural language processing (NLP) community. Different from the vanilla
emotion recognition, effective speaker-sensitive utterance representation is
one major challenge for CER. In this paper, we exploit speaker identification
(SI) as an auxiliary task to enhance the utterance representation in
conversations. By this method, we can learn better speaker-aware contextual
representations from the additional SI corpus. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture is highly effective for
CER, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on two datasets.

Title: Improving Uyghur ASR systems with decoders using morpheme-based language
  models
Authors: Zicheng Qiu, Wei Jiang, Turghunjan Mamut
Categories: cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: 4 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Uyghur is a minority language, and its resources for Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) research are always insufficient. THUYG-20 is currently the
only open-sourced dataset of Uyghur speeches. State-of-the-art results of its
clean and noiseless speech test task haven't been updated since the first
release, which shows a big gap in the development of ASR between mainstream
languages and Uyghur.In this paper, we try to bridge the gap by ultimately
optimizing the ASR systems, and by developing a morpheme-based decoder,
MLDG-Decoder (Morpheme Lattice Dynamically Generating Decoder for Uyghur
DNN-HMM systems), which has long been missing. We have open-sourced the
decoder. The MLDG-Decoder employs an algorithm, named as "on-the-fly
composition with FEBABOS", to allow the back-off states and transitions to play
the role of a relay station in on-the-fly composition. The algorithm empowers
the dynamically generated graph to constrain the morpheme sequences in the
lattices as effectively as the static and fully composed graph does when a
4-Gram morpheme-based Language Model (LM) is used. We have trained deeper and
wider neural network acoustic models, and experimented with three kinds of
decoding schemes. The experimental results show that the decoding based on the
static and fully composed graph reduces state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER)
on the clean and noiseless speech test task in THUYG-20 to 14.24%. The
MLDG-Decoder reduces the WER to 14.54% while keeping the memory consumption
reasonable. Based on the open-sourced MLDG-Decoder, readers can easily
reproduce the experimental results in this paper.

Title: Hybrid Generative-Retrieval Transformers for Dialogue Domain Adaptation
Authors: Igor Shalyminov, Alessandro Sordoni, Adam Atkinson, Hannes Schulz
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Presented at DSTC8@AAAI 2020
ACM-class: I.2.7
\\
  Domain adaptation has recently become a key problem in dialogue systems
research. Deep learning, while being the preferred technique for modeling such
systems, works best given massive training data. However, in the real-world
scenario, such resources aren't available for every new domain, so the ability
to train with a few dialogue examples can be considered essential. Pre-training
on large data sources and adapting to the target data has become the standard
method for few-shot problems within the deep learning framework. In this paper,
we present the winning entry at the fast domain adaptation task of DSTC8, a
hybrid generative-retrieval model based on GPT-2 fine-tuned to the multi-domain
MetaLWOz dataset. Robust and diverse in response generation, our model uses
retrieval logic as a fallback, being SoTA on MetaLWOz in human evaluation (>4%
improvement over the 2nd place system) and attaining competitive generalization
performance in adaptation to the unseen MultiWOZ dataset.

Title: A First Step Towards Understanding Real-world Attacks on IoT Devices
Authors: Armin Ziaie Tabari and Xinming Ou
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  With the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, it is imperative
to proactively understand the real-world cybersecurity threats posed to them.
This paper describes our initial efforts towards building a honeypot ecosystem
as a means to gathering and analyzing real attack data against IoT devices. A
primary condition for a honeypot to yield useful insights is to let attackers
believe they are real systems used by humans and organizations. IoT devices
pose unique challenges in this respect, due to the large variety of device
types and the physical-connectedness nature. We thus create a multiphased
approach in building a honeypot ecosystem, where researchers can gradually
increase a low-interaction honeypot's sophistication in emulating an IoT device
by observing real-world attackers' behaviors. We deployed honeypots both
on-premise and in the cloud, with associated analysis and vetting
infrastructures to ensure these honeypots cannot be easily identified as such
and appear to be real systems. In doing so we were able to attract increasingly
sophisticated attack data. We present the design of this honeypot ecosystem and
our observation on the attack data so far. Our data shows that real-world
attackers are explicitly going after IoT devices, and some captured activities
seem to involve direct human interaction (as opposed to scripted automatic
activities). We also build a low interaction honeypot for IoT cameras, called
Honeycamera, that present to attackers seemingly real videos. This is our first
step towards building a more comprehensive honeypot ecosystem that will allow
researchers to gain concrete understanding of what attackers are going after on
IoT devices, so as to more proactively protect them.

Title: Adversarial Network Traffic: Toward Evaluating the Robustness of Deep
  Learning Based Network Traffic Classification
Authors: Amir Mahdi Sadeghzadeh, Rasool Jalili, and Saeed Shiravi
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Network traffic classification is used in various applications such as
network traffic management, policy enforcement, and intrusion detection
systems. Although most applications encrypt their network traffic and some of
them dynamically change their port numbers; Machine Learning (ML) and
especially Deep Learning (DL)-based classifiers have shown impressive
performance in network traffic classification. In this paper, we evaluate the
robustness of DL-based network traffic classifiers against Adversarial Network
Traffic (ANT). ANT causes DL-based network traffic classifiers to predict
incorrectly using Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) generating methods.
We partition the input space of the DL-based network traffic classification
into three categories: Packet Classification (PC), Flow Content Classification
(FCC), and Flow Time Series Classification (FTSC). To generate ANT, we propose
three new attacks injecting UAPs to the network traffic. AdvPad attack injects
a UAP into the content of packets to evaluate the robustness of packet
classifiers. AdvPay attack injects a UAP into the payload of a dummy packet to
evaluate the robustness of flow content classifiers. AdvBurst attack injects a
specific number of dummy packets with crafted statistical features based on a
UAP into a selected burst of a flow to evaluate the robustness of flow time
series classifiers. The results indicate injecting a little UAP to the network
traffic, highly decreases the performance of DL-based network traffic
classifiers in all categories.

Title: SoK: A Survey of Open Source Threat Emulators
Authors: Sunders Bruskin and Polina Zilberman and Rami Puzis and Shay Shwarz
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Threat emulators are tools or sets of scripts that emulate cyber-attacks or
malicious behavior. Specifically, threat emulators can launch single procedure
attacks or give one the ability to create multi-step attacks, while the
resulting attacks may be known or unknown cyber-attacks. The motivations for
using threat emulators are various: cutting costs of penetration testing
activities by having smaller red teams, performing automated security audits in
organizations, creating baseline tests for security tools in development,
supplying penetration testers with another tool in their arsenal, etc. In this
paper, we review various open-source threat emulators and perform qualitative
and quantitative comparison between them. We focus on tactics and techniques
from MITRE ATT&CK matrix, and check if they can be performed and tested with
the reviewed emulators. We develop a comprehensive methodology for the
evaluation and comparison of threat emulators with respect to general features
such as prerequisites, attack manipulation, clean up and more. Finally, we
present a discussion on the circumstances in which one threat emulator should
be preferred over another. This survey can help security teams, security
developers and product deployment teams to examine their network environment or
their product with the most suitable threat emulator. Using the provided
guidelines, a team can choose the best threat emulator for their needs without
checking and trying them all. To the best of our knowledge, no academic
comparison was made between threat emulators.

Title: Learning from Suspected Target: Bootstrapping Performance for Breast
  Cancer Detection in Mammography
Authors: Li Xiao, Cheng Zhu, Junjun Liu, Chunlong Luo, Peifang Liu, Yi Zhao
Categories: cs.CV
DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-32226-7_52
\\
  Deep learning object detection algorithm has been widely used in medical
image analysis. Currently all the object detection tasks are based on the data
annotated with object classes and their bounding boxes. On the other hand,
medical images such as mammography usually contain normal regions or objects
that are similar to the lesion region, and may be misclassified in the testing
stage if they are not taken care of. In this paper, we address such problem by
introducing a novel top likelihood loss together with a new sampling procedure
to select and train the suspected target regions, as well as proposing a
similarity loss to further identify suspected targets from targets. Mean
average precision (mAP) according to the predicted targets and specificity,
sensitivity, accuracy, AUC values according to classification of patients are
adopted for performance comparisons. We firstly test our proposed method on a
private dense mammogram dataset. Results show that our proposed method greatly
reduce the false positive rate and the specificity is increased by 0.25 on
detecting mass type cancer. It is worth mention that dense breast typically has
a higher risk for developing breast cancers and also are harder for cancer
detection in diagnosis, and our method outperforms a reported result from
performance of radiologists. Our method is also validated on the public Digital
Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) dataset, brings significant
improvement on mass type cancer detection and outperforms the most
state-of-the-art work.

Comments: Accepted by C-MIMI 2019 as a scientific abstract
\\
  Generalization is one of the key challenges in the clinical validation and
application of deep learning models to medical images. Studies have shown that
such models trained on publicly available datasets often do not work well on
real-world clinical data due to the differences in patient population and image
device configurations. Also, manually annotating clinical images is expensive.
In this work, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method using
Cycle-GAN to improve the generalization ability of the model without using any
additional manual annotations.

Title: Understanding Contexts Inside Robot and Human Manipulation Tasks through
  a Vision-Language Model and Ontology System in a Video Stream
Authors: Chen Jiang, Masood Dehghan, Martin Jagersand
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Manipulation tasks in daily life, such as pouring water, unfold intentionally
under specialized manipulation contexts. Being able to process contextual
knowledge in these Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) over time can help us
understand manipulation intentions, which are essential for an intelligent
robot to transition smoothly between various manipulation actions. In this
paper, to model the intended concepts of manipulation, we present a vision
dataset under a strictly constrained knowledge domain for both robot and human
manipulations, where manipulation concepts and relations are stored by an
ontology system in a taxonomic manner. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to
generate a combination of visual attentions and an evolving knowledge graph
filled with commonsense knowledge. Our scheme works with real-world camera
streams and fuses an attention-based Vision-Language model with the ontology
system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can
successfully represent the evolution of an intended object manipulation
procedure for both robots and humans. The proposed scheme allows the robot to
mimic human-like intentional behaviors by watching real-time videos. We aim to
develop this scheme further for real-world robot intelligence in Human-Robot
Interaction.

  We present a boundary-aware domain adaptation model for Lidar point cloud
semantic segmentation. Our model is designed to extract both the domain private
features and the domain shared features using shared weight. We embedded
Gated-SCNN into the shared features extractors to help it learn boundary
information while learning other shared features. Besides, the CycleGAN
mechanism is imposed for further adaptation. We conducted experiments on
real-world datasets. The source domain data is from the Semantic KITTI dataset,
and the target domain data is collected from our own platform (a warthog) in
off-road as well as urban scenarios. The two datasets have differences in
channel distributions, reflectivity distributions, and sensors setup. Using our
approach, we are able to get a single model that can work on both domains. The
model is capable of achieving the state of art performance on the source domain
(Semantic KITTI dataset) and get 44.0\% mIoU on the target domain dataset.

usage because of low accuracy, need for expert knowledge and high computational
costs. The main objective of this paper is to provide decision makers at sites
with a practical yet comprehensive deep learning and IoT based solution to
tackle various computer vision related problems such as scene classification,
object detection in scenes, semantic segmentation, scene captioning etc. Our
overarching goal is to address the central question of What is happening at
this site and where is it happening in an automated fashion minimizing the need
for human resources dedicated to surveillance. We developed Deep ExxonMobil Eye
for Video Analysis (DEEVA) package to handle scene classification, object
detection, semantic segmentation and captioning of scenes in a hierarchical
approach. The results reveal that transfer learning with the RetinaNet object
detector is able to detect the presence of workers, different types of
vehicles/construction equipment, safety related objects at a high level of
accuracy (above 90%). With the help of deep learning to automatically extract
features and IoT technology to automatic capture, transfer and process vast
amount of realtime images, this framework is an important step towards the
development of intelligent surveillance systems aimed at addressing myriads of
open ended problems in the realm of security/safety monitoring, productivity
assessments and future decision making.

Title: Energy-efficient and Robust Cumulative Training with Net2Net
  Transformation
Authors: Aosong Feng, and Priyadarshini Panda
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures, 2 Tables
\\
  Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art accuracies on several computer
vision tasks. However, the computational and energy requirements associated
with training such deep neural networks can be quite high. In this paper, we
propose a cumulative training strategy with Net2Net transformation that
achieves training computational efficiency without incurring large accuracy
loss, in comparison to a model trained from scratch. We achieve this by first
training a small network (with lesser parameters) on a small subset of the
original dataset, and then gradually expanding the network using Net2Net
transformation to train incrementally on larger subsets of the dataset. This
incremental training strategy with Net2Net utilizes function-preserving
transformations that transfers knowledge from each previous small network to
the next larger network, thereby, reducing the overall training complexity. Our
experiments demonstrate that compared with training from scratch, cumulative
training yields ~2x reduction in computational complexity for training
TinyImageNet using VGG19 at iso-accuracy. Besides training efficiency, a key
advantage of our cumulative training strategy is that we can perform pruning
during Net2Net expansion to obtain a final network with optimal configuration
(~0.4x lower inference compute complexity) compared to conventional training
from scratch. We also demonstrate that the final network obtained from
cumulative training yields better generalization performance and noise
robustness. Further, we show that mutual inference from all the networks
created with cumulative Net2Net expansion enables improved adversarial input
detection.

Title: MRI Super-Resolution with GAN and 3D Multi-Level DenseNet: Smaller,
  Faster, and Better
Authors: Yuhua Chen, Anthony G. Christodoulou, Zhengwei Zhou, Feng Shi, Yibin

Comments: Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis
\\
  High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed
anatomical information that is critical for diagnosis in the clinical
application. However, HR MRI typically comes at the cost of long scan time,
small spatial coverage, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recent studies
showed that with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), HR generic images
could be recovered from low-resolution (LR) inputs via single image
super-resolution (SISR) approaches. Additionally, previous works have shown
that a deep 3D CNN can generate high-quality SR MRIs by using learned image
priors. However, 3D CNN with deep structures, have a large number of parameters
and are computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D CNN
architecture, namely a multi-level densely connected super-resolution network
(mDCSRN), which is light-weight, fast and accurate. We also show that with the
generative adversarial network (GAN)-guided training, the mDCSRN-GAN provides
appealing sharp SR images with rich texture details that are highly comparable
with the referenced HR images. Our results from experiments on a large public
dataset with 1,113 subjects showed that this new architecture outperformed
other popular deep learning methods in recovering 4x resolution-downgraded
images in both quality and speed.

Title: MVC-Net: A Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Manifold-Valued
  Images With Applications
Authors: Jose J. Bouza, Chun-Hao Yang, Baba C. Vemuri
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Equal contribution by J. Bouza and CH. Yang
\\
  Geometric deep learning has attracted significant attention in recent years,
in part due to the availability of exotic data types for which traditional
neural network architectures are not well suited. Our goal in this paper is to
generalize convolutional neural networks (CNN) to the manifold-valued image
case which arises commonly in medical imaging and computer vision applications.
Explicitly, the input data to the network is an image where each pixel value is
a sample from a Riemannian manifold. To achieve this goal, we must generalize
the basic building block of traditional CNN architectures, namely, the weighted
combinations operation. To this end, we develop a tangent space combination
operation which is used to define a convolution operation on manifold-valued
images that we call, the Manifold-Valued Convolution (MVC). We prove
theoretical properties of the MVC operation, including equivariance to the
action of the isometry group admitted by the manifold and characterizing when
compositions of MVC layers collapse to a single layer. We present a detailed
description of how to use MVC layers to build full, multi-layer neural networks
that operate on manifold-valued images, which we call the MVC-net. Further, we
empirically demonstrate superior performance of the MVC-nets in medical imaging
and computer vision tasks.

Title: Point-GNN: Graph Neural Network for 3D Object Detection in a Point Cloud
Authors: Weijing Shi and Ragunathan (Raj) Rajkumar
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we propose a graph neural network to detect objects from a
LiDAR point cloud. Towards this end, we encode the point cloud efficiently in a
fixed radius near-neighbors graph. We design a graph neural network, named
Point-GNN, to predict the category and shape of the object that each vertex in
the graph belongs to. In Point-GNN, we propose an auto-registration mechanism
to reduce translation variance, and also design a box merging and scoring
operation to combine detections from multiple vertices accurately. Our
experiments on the KITTI benchmark show the proposed approach achieves leading
accuracy using the point cloud alone and can even surpass fusion-based
algorithms. Our results demonstrate the potential of using the graph neural
network as a new approach for 3D object detection. The code is available

  Surgical robots are used to perform minimally invasive surgery and alleviate
much of the burden imposed on surgeons. Our group has developed a surgical
robot to aid in the removal of tumors at the base of the skull via access
through the nostrils. To avoid injuring the patients, a collision-avoidance
algorithm that depends on having an accurate model for the poses of the
instruments' shafts is used. Given that the model's parameters can change over
time owing to interactions between instruments and other disturbances, the
online estimation of the poses of the instrument's shaft is essential. In this
work, we propose a new method to estimate the pose of the surgical instruments'
shafts using a monocular endoscope. Our method is based on the use of an
automatically annotated training dataset and an improved pose-estimation
deep-learning architecture. In preliminary experiments, we show that our method
can surpass state of the art vision-based marker-less pose estimation
techniques (providing an error decrease of 55% in position estimation, 64% in
pitch, and 69% in yaw) by using artificial images.

Title: Disrupting DeepFakes: Adversarial Attacks Against Conditional Image
  Translation Networks and Facial Manipulation Systems
Authors: Nataniel Ruiz and Stan Sclaroff
Categories: cs.CV cs.CR cs.CY cs.LG
\\
  Face modification systems using deep learning have become increasingly
powerful and accessible. Given images of a person's face, such systems can
generate new images of that same person under different expressions and poses.
Some systems can also modify targeted attributes such as hair color or age.
This type of manipulated images and video have been coined DeepFakes. In order
to prevent a malicious user from generating modified images of a person without
their consent we tackle the new problem of generating adversarial attacks
against image translation systems, which disrupt the resulting output image. We
call this problem disrupting deepfakes. We adapt traditional adversarial
attacks to our scenario. Most image translation architectures are generative
models conditioned on an attribute (e.g. put a smile on this person's face). We
present class transferable adversarial attacks that generalize to different
classes, which means that the attacker does not need to have knowledge about
the conditioning vector. In gray-box scenarios, blurring can mount a successful
defense against disruption. We present a spread-spectrum adversarial attack,
which evades blurring defenses.

Title: Towards Noise-resistant Object Detection with Noisy Annotations
Authors: Junnan Li, Caiming Xiong, Richard Socher, Steven Hoi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Training deep object detectors requires significant amount of human-annotated
images with accurate object labels and bounding box coordinates, which are
extremely expensive to acquire. Noisy annotations are much more easily
accessible, but they could be detrimental for learning. We address the
challenging problem of training object detectors with noisy annotations, where
the noise contains a mixture of label noise and bounding box noise. We propose
a learning framework which jointly optimizes object labels, bounding box
coordinates, and model parameters by performing alternating noise correction
and model training. To disentangle label noise and bounding box noise, we
propose a two-step noise correction method. The first step performs
class-agnostic bounding box correction by minimizing classifier discrepancy and
maximizing region objectness. The second step distils knowledge from dual
detection heads for soft label correction and class-specific bounding box
refinement. We conduct experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO dataset with both
synthetic noise and machine-generated noise. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance by effectively cleaning both label noise and
bounding box noise. Code to reproduce all results will be released.

Comments: Accepted to ACPR 2019
\\
  The major approaches of transfer learning in computer vision have tried to
adapt the source domain to the target domain one-to-one. However, this scenario
is difficult to apply to real applications such as video surveillance systems.
As those systems have many cameras installed at each location regarded as
source domains, it is difficult to identify the proper source domain. In this
paper, we introduce a new transfer learning scenario that has various source
domains and one target domain, assuming video surveillance system integration.
Also, we propose a novel method for automatically producing a high accuracy
model by fusing models trained at various source domains. In particular, we
show how to apply a gating network to fuse source domains for object detection
tasks, which is a new approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on traffic surveillance datasets.

Title: Data-Free Adversarial Perturbations for Practical Black-Box Attack
Authors: ZhaoXin Huan, Yulong Wang, Xiaolu Zhang, Lin Shang, Chilin Fu, Jun
  Zhou
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are malicious
inputs crafted to fool pre-trained models. Adversarial examples often exhibit
black-box attacking transferability, which allows that adversarial examples
crafted for one model can fool another model. However, existing black-box
attack methods require samples from the training data distribution to improve
the transferability of adversarial examples across different models. Because of
the data dependence, the fooling ability of adversarial perturbations is only
applicable when training data are accessible. In this paper, we present a
data-free method for crafting adversarial perturbations that can fool a target
model without any knowledge about the training data distribution. In the
practical setting of a black-box attack scenario where attackers do not have
access to target models and training data, our method achieves high fooling
rates on target models and outperforms other universal adversarial perturbation
methods. Our method empirically shows that current deep learning models are
still at risk even when the attackers do not have access to training data.

Title: Gastric histopathology image segmentation using a hierarchical
  conditional random field
Authors: Changhao Sun, Chen Li, Xiaoyan Li
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  In this paper, a Hierarchical Conditional Random Field (HCRF) model based
Gastric Histopathology Image Segmentation (GHIS) method is proposed, which can
localize abnormal (cancer) regions in gastric histopathology images obtained by
optical microscope to assist histopathologists in medical work. First, to
obtain pixel-level segmentation information, we retrain a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to build up our pixel-level potentials. Then, in order to obtain
abundant spatial segmentation information in patch-level, we fine-tune another
three CNNs to build up our patch-level potentials. Thirdly, based on the pixel-
and patch-level potentials, our HCRF model is structured. Finally, graph-based
post-processing is applied to further improve our segmentation performance. In
the experiment, a segmentation accuracy of 78.91% is achieved on a Hematoxylin
and Eosin (H&E) stained gastric histopathological dataset with 560 images,
showing the effectiveness and future potential of the proposed GHIS method.

Title: DiPE: Deeper into Photometric Errors for Unsupervised Learning of Depth
  and Ego-motion from Monocular Videos
Authors: Hualie Jiang, Laiyan Ding and Rui Huang
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IROS 2020
\\
  Unsupervised learning of depth and ego-motion from unlabelled monocular
videos has recently drawn attention as it has notable advantages than the
supervised ones. It uses the photometric errors between the target view and the
synthesized views from its adjacent source views as the loss. Although
significant progress has been made, the learning still suffers from occlusion
and scene dynamics. This paper shows that carefully manipulating photometric
errors can tackle these difficulties better. The primary improvement is
achieved by masking out the invisible or nonstationary pixels in the
photometric error map using a statistical technique. With this outlier masking
approach, the depth of objects that move in the opposite direction to the
camera can be estimated more accurately. According to our best knowledge, such
objects have not been seriously considered in the previous work, even though
they pose a higher risk in applications like autonomous driving. We also
propose an efficient weighted multi-scale scheme to reduce the artifacts in the
predicted depth maps. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The overall system achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both depth and ego-motion estimation.

Title: multi-patch aggregation models for resampling detection
Authors: Mohit Lamba, Kaushik Mitra
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 6 pages; 6 tables; 4 figures
\\
  Images captured nowadays are of varying dimensions with smartphones and
DSLR's allowing users to choose from a list of available image resolutions. It
is therefore imperative for forensic algorithms such as resampling detection to
scale well for images of varying dimensions. However, in our experiments, we
observed that many state-of-the-art forensic algorithms are sensitive to image
size and their performance quickly degenerates when operated on images of
diverse dimensions despite re-training them using multiple image sizes. To
handle this issue, we propose a novel pooling strategy called ITERATIVE
POOLING. This pooling strategy can dynamically adjust input tensors in a
discrete without much loss of information as in ROI Max-pooling. This pooling
strategy can be used with any of the existing deep models and for demonstration
purposes, we show its utility on Resnet-18 for the case of resampling detection
a fundamental operation for any image sought of image manipulation. Compared to
existing strategies and Max-pooling it gives up to 7-8% improvement on public
datasets.

\\
  Background and Objective: Object detection is a primary research interest in
computer vision. Sperm-cell detection in a densely populated bull semen
microscopic observation video presents challenges such as partial occlusion,
vast number of objects in a single video frame, tiny size of the object,
artifacts, low contrast, and blurry objects because of the rapid movement of
the sperm cells. This study proposes an architecture, called DeepSperm, that
solves the aforementioned challenges and is more accurate and faster than
state-of-the-art architectures. Methods: In the proposed architecture, we use
only one detection layer, which is specific for small object detection. For
handling overfitting and increasing accuracy, we set a higher network
resolution, use a dropout layer, and perform data augmentation on hue,
saturation, and exposure. Several hyper-parameters are tuned to achieve better
performance. We compare our proposed method with those of a conventional image
processing-based object-detection method, you only look once (YOLOv3), and mask
region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN). Results: In our
experiment, we achieve 86.91 mAP on the test dataset and a processing speed of
50.3 fps. In comparison with YOLOv3, we achieve an increase of 16.66 mAP point,
3.26 x faster on testing, and 1.4 x faster on training with a small training
dataset, which contains 40 video frames. The weights file size was also reduced
significantly, with 16.94 x smaller than that of YOLOv3. Moreover, it requires
1.3 x less graphical processing unit (GPU) memory than YOLOv3. Conclusions:
This study proposes DeepSperm, which is a simple, effective, and efficient
architecture with its hyper-parameters and configuration to detect bull sperm
cells robustly in real time. In our experiment, we surpass the state of the art
in terms of accuracy, speed, and resource needs.

  The interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is an important
topic in the field of computer vision. In recent years, works in this field
generally adopt a mature model to reveal the internal mechanism of CNNs,
helping to understand CNNs thoroughly. In this paper, we argue the working
mechanism of CNNs can be revealed through a totally different interpretation,
by comparing the communication systems and CNNs. This paper successfully
obtained the corresponding relationship between the modules of the two, and
verified the rationality of the corresponding relationship with experiments.
Finally, through the analysis of some cutting-edge research on neural networks,
we find the inherent relation between these two tasks can be of help in
explaining these researches reasonably, as well as helping us discover the
correct research direction of neural networks.

  To promote the development of underwater robot picking in sea farms, we
propose an underwater open-sea farm object detection dataset called UDD.
Concretely, UDD consists of 3 categories (seacucumber, seaurchin, and scallop)
with 2227 images. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first dataset
collected in a real open-sea farm for underwater robot picking and we also
propose a novel Poisson-blending-embedded Generative Adversarial Network
(Poisson GAN) to overcome the class-imbalance and massive small objects issues
in UDD. By utilizing Poisson GAN to change the number, position, even size of
objects in UDD, we construct a large scale augmented dataset (AUDD) containing
18K images. Besides, in order to make the detector better adapted to the
underwater picking environment, a dataset (Pre-trained dataset) for
pre-training containing 590K images is also proposed. Finally, we design a
lightweight network (UnderwaterNet) to address the problems that detecting
small objects from cloudy underwater pictures and meeting the efficiency
requirements in robots. Specifically, we design a depth-wise-convolution-based
Multi-scale Contextual Features Fusion (MFF) block and a Multi-scale
Blursampling (MBP) module to reduce the parameters of the network to 1.3M at
48FPS, without any loss on accuracy. Extensive experiments verify the
effectiveness of the proposed UnderwaterNet, Poisson GAN, UDD, AUDD, and
Pre-trained datasets.

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: Conference paper, 19 pages
\\
  Defining methods for the automatic understanding of gestures is of paramount
importance in many application contexts and in Virtual Reality applications for
creating more natural and easy-to-use human-computer interaction methods. In
this paper, we present a method for the recognition of a set of non-static
gestures acquired through the Leap Motion sensor. The acquired gesture
information is converted in color images, where the variation of hand joint
positions during the gesture are projected on a plane and temporal information
is represented with color intensity of the projected points. The classification
of the gestures is performed using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A
modified version of the popular ResNet-50 architecture is adopted, obtained by
removing the last fully connected layer and adding a new layer with as many
neurons as the considered gesture classes. The method has been successfully
applied to the existing reference dataset and preliminary tests have already
been performed for the real-time recognition of dynamic gestures performed by
users.

  Realistic Applications

\\
  Trained on large datasets, deep learning (DL) can accurately classify videos
into hundreds of diverse classes. However, video data is expensive to annotate.
Zero-shot learning (ZSL) proposes one solution to this problem. ZSL trains a
model once, and generalizes to new tasks whose classes are not present in the
training dataset. We propose the first end-to-end algorithm for ZSL in video
classification. Our training procedure builds on insights from recent video
classification literature and uses a trainable 3D CNN to learn the visual
features. This is in contrast to previous video ZSL methods, which use
pretrained feature extractors. We also extend the current benchmarking
paradigm: Previous techniques aim to make the test task unknown at training
time but fall short of this goal. We encourage domain shift across training and
test data and disallow tailoring a ZSL model to a specific test dataset. We
outperform the state-of-the-art by a wide margin. Our code, evaluation

Title: Implicit Functions in Feature Space for 3D Shape Reconstruction and
  Completion
Authors: Julian Chibane, Thiemo Alldieck, Gerard Pons-Moll
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  While many works focus on 3D reconstruction from images, in this paper, we
focus on 3D shape reconstruction and completion from a variety of 3D inputs,
which are deficient in some respect: low and high resolution voxels, sparse and
dense point clouds, complete or incomplete. Processing of such 3D inputs is an
increasingly important problem as they are the output of 3D scanners, which are
becoming more accessible, and are the intermediate output of 3D computer vision
algorithms. Recently, learned implicit functions have shown great promise as
they produce continuous reconstructions. However, we identified two limitations
in reconstruction from 3D inputs: 1) details present in the input data are not
retained, and 2) poor reconstruction of articulated humans. To solve this, we
propose Implicit Feature Networks (IF-Nets), which deliver continuous outputs,
can handle multiple topologies, and complete shapes for missing or sparse input
data retaining the nice properties of recent learned implicit functions, but
critically they can also retain detail when it is present in the input data,
and can reconstruct articulated humans. Our work differs from prior work in two
crucial aspects. First, instead of using a single vector to encode a 3D shape,
we extract a learnable 3-dimensional multi-scale tensor of deep features, which
is aligned with the original Euclidean space embedding the shape. Second,
instead of classifying x-y-z point coordinates directly, we classify deep
features extracted from the tensor at a continuous query point. We show that
this forces our model to make decisions based on global and local shape
structure, as opposed to point coordinates, which are arbitrary under Euclidean
transformations. Experiments demonstrate that IF-Nets outperform prior work in
3D object reconstruction in ShapeNet, and obtain significantly more accurate 3D
human reconstructions.

Title: Disentangling Physical Dynamics from Unknown Factors for Unsupervised
  Video Prediction
Authors: Vincent Le Guen, Nicolas Thome
Categories: cs.CV
Report-no: CVPR 2020
\\
  Leveraging physical knowledge described by partial differential equations
(PDEs) is an appealing way to improve unsupervised video prediction methods.
Since physics is too restrictive for describing the full visual content of
generic videos, we introduce PhyDNet, a two-branch deep architecture, which
explicitly disentangles PDE dynamics from unknown complementary information. A
second contribution is to propose a new recurrent physical cell (PhyCell),
inspired from data assimilation techniques, for performing PDE-constrained
prediction in latent space. Extensive experiments conducted on four various
datasets show the ability of PhyDNet to outperform state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies also highlight the important gain brought out by both
disentanglement and PDE-constrained prediction. Finally, we show that PhyDNet
presents interesting features for dealing with missing data and long-term
forecasting.

Title: Distilled Hierarchical Neural Ensembles with Adaptive Inference Cost
Authors: Adria Ruiz and Jakob Verbeek
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep neural networks form the basis of state-of-the-art models across a
variety of application domains. Moreover, networks that are able to dynamically
adapt the computational cost of inference are important in scenarios where the
amount of compute or input data varies over time. In this paper, we propose
Hierarchical Neural Ensembles (HNE), a novel framework to embed an ensemble of
multiple networks by sharing intermediate layers using a hierarchical
structure. In HNE we control the inference cost by evaluating only a subset of
models, which are organized in a nested manner. Our second contribution is a
novel co-distillation method to boost the performance of ensemble predictions
with low inference cost. This approach leverages the nested structure of our
ensembles, to optimally allocate accuracy and diversity across the ensemble
members. Comprehensive experiments over the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets confirm
the effectiveness of HNE in building deep networks with adaptive inference cost
for image classification.

  We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for local features and robust
estimation algorithms, focusing on the downstream task -- the accuracy of the
reconstructed camera pose -- as our primary metric. Our pipeline's modular
structure allows us to easily integrate, configure, and combine methods and
heuristics. We demonstrate this by embedding dozens of popular algorithms and
evaluating them, from seminal works to the cutting edge of machine learning
research. We show that with proper settings, classical solutions may still
outperform the perceived state of the art.
  Besides establishing the actual state of the art, the experiments conducted
in this paper reveal unexpected properties of SfM pipelines that can be
exploited to help improve their performance, for both algorithmic and learned
methods. Data and code are online
https://github.com/vcg-uvic/image-matching-benchmark, providing an easy-to-use
and flexible framework for the benchmarking of local feature and robust
estimation methods, both alongside and against top-performing methods. This

Title: Deep Multi-Modal Sets
Authors: Austin Reiter, Menglin Jia, Pu Yang, Ser-Nam Lim
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Many vision-related tasks benefit from reasoning over multiple modalities to
leverage complementary views of data in an attempt to learn robust embedding
spaces. Most deep learning-based methods rely on a late fusion technique
whereby multiple feature types are encoded and concatenated and then a multi
layer perceptron (MLP) combines the fused embedding to make predictions. This
has several limitations, such as an unnatural enforcement that all features be
present at all times as well as constraining only a constant number of
occurrences of a feature modality at any given time. Furthermore, as more
modalities are added, the concatenated embedding grows. To mitigate this, we
propose Deep Multi-Modal Sets: a technique that represents a collection of
features as an unordered set rather than one long ever-growing fixed-size
vector. The set is constructed so that we have invariance both to permutations
of the feature modalities as well as to the cardinality of the set. We will
also show that with particular choices in our model architecture, we can yield
interpretable feature performance such that during inference time we can
observe which modalities are most contributing to the prediction.With this in
mind, we demonstrate a scalable, multi-modal framework that reasons over
different modalities to learn various types of tasks. We demonstrate new
state-of-the-art performance on two multi-modal datasets (Ads-Parallelity [34]
and MM-IMDb [1]).

Title: Volumetric landmark detection with a multi-scale shift equivariant
  neural network
Authors: Tianyu Ma, Ajay Gupta, Mert R. Sabuncu
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Deep neural networks yield promising results in a wide range of computer
vision applications, including landmark detection. A major challenge for
accurate anatomical landmark detection in volumetric images such as clinical CT
scans is that large-scale data often constrain the capacity of the employed
neural network architecture due to GPU memory limitations, which in turn can
limit the precision of the output. We propose a multi-scale, end-to-end deep
learning method that achieves fast and memory-efficient landmark detection in
3D images. Our architecture consists of blocks of shift-equivariant networks,
each of which performs landmark detection at a different spatial scale. These
blocks are connected from coarse to fine-scale, with differentiable resampling
layers, so that all levels can be trained together. We also present a noise
injection strategy that increases the robustness of the model and allows us to
quantify uncertainty at test time. We evaluate our method for carotid artery
bifurcations detection on 263 CT volumes and achieve a better than
state-of-the-art accuracy with mean Euclidean distance error of 2.81mm.

\\
  Learning structures of 3D shapes is a fundamental problem in the field of
computer graphics and geometry processing. We present a simple yet
interpretable unsupervised method for learning a new structural representation
in the form of 3D structure points. The 3D structure points pro-duced by our
method encode the shape structure intrinsi-cally and exhibit semantic
consistency across all the shapeinstances with similar structures. This is a
challenging goal that has not fully been achieved by other methods.
Specifically, our method takes a 3D point cloud as input and encodes it as a
set of local features. The local features are then passed through a novel point
integration module to produce a set of 3D structure points. The chamfer
distance is used as reconstruction loss to ensure the structure points lie
close to the input point cloud. Extensive experiments have shown that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the semantic shape correspondence
task and achieves achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art on the
segmentation label transfer task. Moreover, the PCA based shape embedding built
upon consistent structure points demonstrates good performance in preserving
the shape structures. Code is available at

Title: Holistically-Attracted Wireframe Parsing

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020
\\
  This paper presents a fast and parsimonious parsing method to accurately and
robustly detect a vectorized wireframe in an input image with a single forward
pass. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable, consisting of three
components: (i) line segment and junction proposal generation, (ii) line
segment and junction matching, and (iii) line segment and junction
verification. For computing line segment proposals, a novel exact dual
representation is proposed which exploits a parsimonious geometric
reparameterization for line segments and forms a holistic 4-dimensional
attraction field map for an input image. Junctions can be treated as the
"basins" in the attraction field. The proposed method is thus called
Holistically-Attracted Wireframe Parser (HAWP). In experiments, the proposed
method is tested on two benchmarks, the Wireframe dataset, and the YorkUrban
dataset. On both benchmarks, it obtains state-of-the-art performance in terms
of accuracy and efficiency. For example, on the Wireframe dataset, compared to
the previous state-of-the-art method L-CNN, it improves the challenging mean
structural average precision (msAP) by a large margin ($2.8\%$ absolute
improvements) and achieves 29.5 FPS on single GPU ($89\%$ relative
improvement). A systematic ablation study is performed to further justify the
proposed method.

Title: BATS: Binary ArchitecTure Search
Authors: Adrian Bulat and Brais Martinez and Georgios Tzimiropoulos
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  This paper proposes Binary ArchitecTure Search (BATS), a framework that
drastically reduces the accuracy gap between binary neural networks and their
real-valued counterparts by means of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We show
that directly applying NAS to the binary domain provides very poor results. To
alleviate this, we describe, to our knowledge, for the first time, the 3 key
ingredients for successfully applying NAS to the binary domain. Specifically,
we (1) introduce and design a novel binary-oriented search space, (2) propose a
new mechanism for controlling and stabilising the resulting searched
topologies, (3) propose and validate a series of new search strategies for
binary networks that lead to faster convergence and lower search times.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and
the necessity of searching in the binary space directly. Moreover, (4) we set a
new state-of-the-art for binary neural networks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and
ImageNet datasets. Code will be made available

  Educational games are commonly used to motivate students and provide enhanced
learning opportunities. Apps and mobile games play an increasingly important
role in education and smartphones are part of the daily lives of most female
teenagers: Half of mobile gamers are women and 64% of women prefer smartphones
to other platforms. However, gender differences in playing behaviour and
preferences raises concerns about potential gender inequalities when games are
developed for education. In order to develop a tutorial game that suits the
female target group and provides challenging tasks to solve, girls were
involved at a very early stage of the development cycle and the idea was
developed on the basis of surveys and focus group discussions. A first
prototype of the game has been tested in a mixed-gender group to get feedback
about the learning content, the worked examples, and the whole structure of the
game. Finally, a tutorial game with six worked examples has been released in
our Luna&Cat app, a programming tool that has been designed for our female
target group in particular.

Title: Marketplace for AI Models

\\
  Artificial intelligence shows promise for solving many practical societal
problems in areas such as healthcare and transportation. However, the current
mechanisms for AI model diffusion such as Github code repositories, academic
project webpages, and commercial AI marketplaces have some limitations; for
example, a lack of monetization methods, model traceability, and model
auditabilty. In this work, we sketch guidelines for a new AI diffusion method
based on a decentralized online marketplace. We consider the technical,
economic, and regulatory aspects of such a marketplace including a discussion
of solutions for problems in these areas. Finally, we include a comparative
analysis of several current AI marketplaces that are already available or in
development. We find that most of these marketplaces are centralized commercial
marketplaces with relatively few models.

Title: A Study of the Fundamental Performance Characteristics of GPUs and CPUs
  for Database Analytics (Extended Version)
Authors: Anil Shanbhag, Samuel Madden, Xiangyao Yu
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  There has been significant amount of excitement and recent work on GPU-based
database systems. Previous work has claimed that these systems can perform
orders of magnitude better than CPU-based database systems on analytical
workloads such as those found in decision support and business intelligence
applications. A hardware expert would view these claims with suspicion. Given
the general notion that database operators are memory-bandwidth bound, one
would expect the maximum gain to be roughly equal to the ratio of the memory
bandwidth of GPU to that of CPU. In this paper, we adopt a model-based approach
to understand when and why the performance gains of running queries on GPUs vs
on CPUs vary from the bandwidth ratio (which is roughly 16x on modern
hardware). We propose Crystal, a library of parallel routines that can be
combined together to run full SQL queries on a GPU with minimal materialization
overhead. We implement individual query operators to show that while the
speedups for selection, projection, and sorts are near the bandwidth ratio,
joins
  achieve less speedup due to differences in hardware capabilities.
Interestingly, we show on a popular analytical workload that full query
performance gain from running on GPU exceeds the bandwidth ratio despite
individual operators having speedup less than bandwidth ratio, as a result of
limitations of vectorizing chained operators on CPUs, resulting in a 25x
speedup for GPUs over CPUs on the benchmark.

Title: Data Invariants: On Trust in Data-Driven Systems
Authors: Anna Fariha, Ashish Tiwari, Arjun Radhakrishna, Sumit Gulwani,

Categories: cs.DB
Comments: In submission in VLDB
\\
  The reliability and proper function of data-driven applications hinge on the
data's continued conformance to the applications' initial design. When data
deviates from this initial profile, system behavior becomes unpredictable. Data
profiling techniques such as functional dependencies and denial constraints
encode patterns in the data that can be used to detect deviations. But
traditional methods typically focus on exact constraints and categorical
attributes, and are ill-suited for tasks such as determining whether the
prediction of a machine learning system can be trusted or for quantifying data
drift. In this paper, we introduce data invariants, a new data-profiling
primitive that models arithmetic relationships involving multiple numerical
attributes within a (noisy) dataset and which complements the existing
data-profiling techniques. We propose a quantitative semantics to measure the
degree of violation of a data invariant, and establish that strong data
invariants can be constructed from observations with low variance on the given
dataset. A concrete instance of this principle gives the surprising result that
low-variance components of a principal component analysis (PCA), which are
usually discarded, generate better invariants than the high-variance
components. We demonstrate the value of data invariants on two applications:
trusted machine learning and data drift. We empirically show that data
invariants can (1) reliably detect tuples on which the prediction of a
machine-learned model should not be trusted, and (2) quantify data drift more
accurately than the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we show four case
studies where an intervention-centric explanation tool uses data invariants to
explain causes for tuple non-conformance.

\\
  With a view to managing the increasing traffic in computer networks, round
robin arbiter has been proposed to work with packet switching system to have
increased speed in providing access and scheduling. Round robin arbiter is a
doorway to a particular bus based on request along with equal priority and
gives turns to devices connected to it in a cyclic order. Considering the rapid
growth in computer networking and the emergence of computer automation which
will need much more access to the existing limited resources, this paper
emphasizes on designing a reconfigurable round robin arbiter over FPGA which
takes parallel requests and processes them with high efficiency and less delay
than existing designs. Proposed round robin arbiter encounters with 4 to 12
devices. Results show that with 200% increment in the number of connected
devices, only 2.69% increment has been found in the delay. With less delay,
proposed round robin arbiter exhibits high speed performance with higher
traffic, which is a new feature in comparison with the existing designs.

\\
  We develop and analyze concurrent algorithms for the disjoint set union
(union-find) problem in the shared memory, asynchronous multiprocessor model of
computation, with CAS (compare and swap) or DCAS (double compare and swap) as
the synchronization primitive. We give a deterministic bounded wait-free
algorithm that uses DCAS and has a total work bound of $O(m \cdot (\log(np/m +
1) + \alpha(n, m/(np)))$ for a problem with $n$ elements and $m$ operations
solved by $p$ processes, where $\alpha$ is a functional inverse of Ackermann's
function. We give two randomized algorithms that use only CAS and have the same
work bound in expectation. The analysis of the second randomized algorithm is
valid even if the scheduler is adversarial. Our DCAS and randomized algorithms
take $O(\log n)$ steps per operation, worst-case for the DCAS algorithm,
high-probability for the randomized algorithms. Our work and step bounds grow
only logarithmically with $p$, making our algorithms truly scalable. We prove
that for a class of symmetric algorithms that includes ours, no better step or
work bound is possible.

  We present four high performance hybrid sorting methods developed for various
parallel platforms: shared memory multiprocessors, distributed multiprocessors,
and clusters taking advantage of existence of both shared and distributed
memory. Merge sort, known for its stability, is used to design several of our
algorithms. We improve its parallel performance by combining it with Quicksort.
We present two models designed for shared memory MIMD (OpenMP): (a) a
non-recursive Merge sort and (b) a hybrid Quicksort and Merge sort. The third
model presented is designed for distributed memory MIMD (MPI) using a hybrid
Quicksort and Merge sort. Our fourth model is designed to take advantage of the
shared memory within individual nodes of todays cluster systems, and to
eliminate all internal data transfers between different nodes, Our model
implements a one-step MSD-Radix to distribute data in ten packets (MPI) while
parallel cores of each node use Quicksort to sort their data partitions
sequentially then merge and sort them in parallel employing the OpenMp. The
performances of all developed models outperform the baseline performance.
Hybrid Quicksort and Merge sort outperformed Hybrid Memory Parallel Merge Sort
using Hybrid MSD-Radix and Quicksort in Cluster Platforms when sorting small
size data, but with larger data the speedup of Hybrid Memory Parallel Merge
Sort Using Hybrid MSD-Radix and Quicksort in Cluster Platforms becomes bigger
and it keeps improving. The speedup of Distributed Memory Parallel Hybrid
Quicksort and Merge Sort is the best.

  We present a framework for performance optimization in serverless edge-cloud
platforms using dynamic task placement. We focus on applications for smart edge
devices, for example, smart cameras or speakers, that need to perform
processing tasks on input data in real to near-real time. Our framework allows
the user to specify cost and latency requirements for each application task,
and for each input, it determines whether to execute the task on the edge
device or in the cloud. Further, for cloud executions, the framework identifies
the container resource configuration needed to satisfy the performance goals.
We have evaluated our framework in simulation using measurements collected from
serverless applications in AWS Lambda and AWS Greengrass. In addition, we have
implemented a prototype of our framework that runs in these same platforms. In
experiments with our prototype, our models can predict average end-to-end
latency with less than 6% error, and we obtain almost three orders of magnitude
reduction in end-to-end latency compared to edge-only execution.

  In this paper, we propose a novel method, GSM (Gunrock Subgraph Matching), to
compute graph matching (subgraph isomorphism) on GPUs. In contrast to previous
approaches, GSM is BFS-based: possible matches are explored simultaneously in a
breadth-first strategy and thus can be mapped onto GPUs in a massively parallel
fashion. Our implementation on the Gunrock graph analytics framework follows a
filtering-and-verification strategy. While previous work requires one-/two-step
joining, we use one-step verification to decide the candidates in current
frontier of nodes. Our implementation has a speedup up to 4x over previous GPU
state-of-the-art implementation.

Title: FlexServe: Deployment of PyTorch Models as Flexible REST Endpoints
Authors: Edward Verenich, Alvaro Velasquez, M.G. Sarwar Murshed, Faraz Hussain

\\
  The integration of artificial intelligence capabilities into modern software
systems is increasingly being simplified through the use of cloud-based machine
learning services and representational state transfer architecture design.
However, insufficient information regarding underlying model provenance and the
lack of control over model evolution serve as an impediment to the more
widespread adoption of these services in many operational environments which
have strict security requirements. Furthermore, tools such as TensorFlow
Serving allow models to be deployed as RESTful endpoints, but require
error-prone transformations for PyTorch models as these dynamic computational
graphs. This is in contrast to the static computational graphs of TensorFlow.
To enable rapid deployments of PyTorch models without intermediate
transformations we have developed FlexServe, a simple library to deploy
multi-model ensembles with flexible batching.

Title: A New MRAM-based Process In-Memory Accelerator for Efficient Neural

  The excellent performance of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) comes at an
often prohibitive training cost, limiting the rapid development of DNN
innovations and raising various environmental concerns. To reduce the dominant
data movement cost of training, process in-memory (PIM) has emerged as a
promising solution as it alleviates the need to access DNN weights. However,
state-of-the-art PIM DNN training accelerators employ either analog/mixed
signal computing which has limited precision or digital computing based on a
memory technology that supports limited logic functions and thus requires
complicated procedure to realize floating point computation. In this paper, we
propose a spin orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) based
digital PIM accelerator that supports floating point precision. Specifically,
this new accelerator features an innovative (1) SOT-MRAM cell, (2) full
addition design, and (3) floating point computation. Experiment results show
that the proposed SOT-MRAM PIM based DNN training accelerator can achieve 3.3x,
1.8x, and 2.5x improvement in terms of energy, latency, and area, respectively,
compared with a state-of-the-art PIM based DNN training accelerator.

Title: A Survey on Big Data for Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis
Authors: Alessandro D'Alconzo, Idilio Drago, Andrea Morichetta, Marco Mellia,

Categories: cs.DC cs.NI
\\
  Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis (NTMA) represents a key component for
network management, especially to guarantee the correct operation of
large-scale networks such as the Internet. As the complexity of Internet
services and the volume of traffic continue to increase, it becomes difficult
to design scalable NTMA applications. Applications such as traffic
classification and policing require real-time and scalable approaches. Anomaly
detection and security mechanisms require to quickly identify and react to
unpredictable events while processing millions of heterogeneous events. At
last, the system has to collect, store, and process massive sets of historical
data for post-mortem analysis. Those are precisely the challenges faced by
general big data approaches: Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Veracity. This
survey brings together NTMA and big data. We catalog previous work on NTMA that
adopt big data approaches to understand to what extent the potential of big
data is being explored in NTMA. This survey mainly focuses on approaches and
technologies to manage the big NTMA data, additionally briefly discussing big
data analytics (e.g., machine learning) for the sake of NTMA. Finally, we
provide guidelines for future work, discussing lessons learned, and research
directions.

Title: Dynamic Graph Operations: A Consistent Non-blocking Approach
Authors: Bapi Chatterjee and Sathya Peri and Muktikanta Sa
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 27 pages, 17 figures
\\
  Graph algorithms enormously contribute to the domains such as blockchains,
social networks, biological networks, telecommunication networks, and several
others. The ever-increasing demand of data-volume, as well as speed of such
applications, have essentially transported these applications from their
comfort zone: static setting, to a challenging territory of dynamic updates. At
the same time, mainstreaming of multi-core processors have entailed that the
dynamic applications should be able to exploit concurrency as soon as
parallelization gets inhibited. Thus, the design and implementation of
efficient concurrent dynamic graph algorithms have become significant.
  This paper reports a novel library of concurrent shared-memory algorithms for
breadth-first search (BFS), single-source shortest-path (SSSP), and betweenness
centrality (BC) in a dynamic graph. The presented algorithms are provably
non-blocking and linearizable. We extensively evaluate C++ implementations of
the algorithms through several micro-benchmarks. The experimental results
demonstrate the scalability with the number of threads. Our experiments also
highlight the limitations of static graph analytics methods in a dynamic
setting.

Title: China may need to support more small teams in scientific research
Authors: Linlin Liu, Jianfei Yu, Junming Huang, Feng Xia and Tao Jia
Categories: cs.DL cs.SI physics.soc-ph
\\
  Modern science is dominated by scientific productions from teams. Large teams
have demonstrated a clear advantage over small teams in applying for research
funding, performing complicated research tasks and producing research works
with high impact. Recent research, however, shows that both large and small
teams have their own merits. Small teams tend to expand the frontier of
knowledge by creating disruptive research outcomes, while large teams are more
apt to work in the established field and develop existing problems. Given
different roles of big and small teams in research, the extent to which a
country's scientific work is carried out by big/small teams is of great
importance. Here, we analyze over 26 million papers from Web of Science
published from 2000 to 2017. We find that China's research output is more
dominated by big teams than the rest of the world. It is indeed a global trend
that more papers are done by big teams. However, the drop in small team output
is much steeper in China. More importantly, as research teams in China shift
from small to large size, the team diversity that is essential for innovative
works does not increase as much as that in other countries. Papers by big teams
tend to receive more citations, but this alone is insufficient to explain the
dominance of big teams in China, because the citation boost is roughly the same
in every country. However, using the national average as the baseline, we find
that the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) supports fewer
small team works than the National Science Foundation of U.S. (NSF) does,
implying that big teams are more preferred by grant agencies in China. Our
finding provides new insights into the concern of originality and innovation in
China, which urges a need to balance small and big teams.

  In the eternal domination game, an attacker attacks a vertex at each turn and
a team of guards must move a guard to the attacked vertex to defend it. The
guards may only move to adjacent vertices and no more than one guard may occupy
a vertex. The goal is to determine the eternal domination number of a graph
which is the minimum number of guards required to defend the graph against an
infinite sequence of attacks. In this paper, we continue the study of the
eternal domination game on strong grids. Cartesian grids have been vastly
studied with tight bounds for small grids such as $2\times n$, $3\times n$,
$4\times n$, and $5\times n$ grids, and recently it was proven in [Lamprou et
al., CIAC 2017, 393-404] that the eternal domination number of these grids in
general is within $O(m+n)$ of their domination number which lower bounds the
eternal domination number. Recently, Finbow et al. proved that the eternal
domination number of strong grids is upper bounded by $\frac{mn}{6}+O(m+n)$. We
adapt the techniques of [Lamprou et al., CIAC 2017, 393-404] to prove that the
eternal domination number of strong grids is upper bounded by
$\frac{mn}{7}+O(m+n)$. While this does not improve upon a recently announced
bound of $\lceil\frac{m}{3}\rceil \lceil\frac{n}{3}\rceil+O(m\sqrt{n})$ [Mc
Inerney, Nisse, P\'erennes, CIAC 2019] in the general case, we show that our
bound is an improvement in the case where the smaller of the two dimensions is
at most $6179$.

  In this paper, we introduce a new method which we call it MZ-method, for
dividing a natural number $x$ by two and then we use graph as a model to show
MZ-algorithm. Applying (recursively) $k$-times of the MZ-method for the number
$x$, produces a graph with unique structure that is denoted by $G_k(x)$. We
investigate the structure of $G_k(x)$. Also from the natural number $x$ and
graph $G_k(x)$ we produce codes which are important and applicable in the
information security and cryptography.

Categories: cs.DS cs.DC
\\
  Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in
distributed/parallel algorithms for processing large-scale graphs. By now, we
have quite fast algorithms---usually sublogarithimic-time and often
$\text{poly}(\log\log n)$-time, or even faster---for a number of fundamental
graph problems in the massively parallel computation (MPC) model. This model is
a widely-adopted theoretical abstraction of MapReduce style settings, where a
number of machines communicate in an all-to-all manner to process large-scale
data. Contributing to this line of work on MPC graph algorithms, we present
$\text{poly}(\log k) \in \text{poly}(\log\log n)$ round MPC algorithms for
computing $O(k^{1+{o(1)}})$-spanners in the strongly sublinear regime of local
memory. One important consequence, by letting $k = \log n$, is a $O(\log^2\log
n)$-round algorithm for $O(\log^{1+o(1)} n)$ approximation of all pairs
shortest path (APSP) in the near-linear regime of local memory. To the best of
our knowledge, these are the first sublogarithmic-time MPC algorithms for
computing spanners and distance approximation.

Title: Scalable Distributed Approximation of Internal Measures for Clustering
  Evaluation
Authors: Federico Altieri, Andrea Pietracaprina, Geppino Pucci, Fabio Vandin
Categories: cs.DS cs.LG
Comments: 16 pages, 4 tables, 1 figure
\\
  The most widely used internal measure for clustering evaluation is the
silhouette coefficient, whose naive computation requires a quadratic number of
distance calculations, which is clearly unfeasible for massive datasets.
Surprisingly, there are no known general methods to efficiently approximate the
silhouette coefficient of a clustering with rigorously provable high accuracy.
In this paper, we present the first scalable algorithm to compute such a
rigorous approximation for the evaluation of clusterings based on any metric
distances. Our algorithm hinges on a Probability Proportional to Size (PPS)
sampling scheme, and, for any fixed $\varepsilon, \delta \in (0,1)$, it
approximates the silhouette coefficient within a mere additive error
$O(\varepsilon)$ with probability $1-\delta$, using a very small number of
distance calculations. We also prove that the algorithm can be adapted to
obtain rigorous approximations of other internal measures of clustering
quality, such as cohesion and separation. Importantly, we provide a distributed
implementation of the algorithm using the MapReduce model, which runs in
constant rounds and requires only sublinear local space at each worker, which
makes our estimation approach applicable to big data scenarios. We perform an
extensive experimental evaluation of our silhouette approximation algorithm,
comparing its performance to a number of baseline heuristics on real and
synthetic datasets. The experiments provide evidence that, unlike other
heuristics, our estimation strategy not only provides tight theoretical
guarantees but is also able to return highly accurate estimations while running
in a fraction of the time required by the exact computation, and that its
distributed implementation is highly scalable, thus enabling the computation of
internal measures for very large datasets for which the exact computation is
prohibitive.

Title: Contextual Search for General Hypothesis Classes
Authors: Allen Liu, Renato Paes Leme, Jon Schneider
Categories: cs.DS cs.LG
\\
  We study a general version of the problem of online learning under binary
feedback: there is a hidden function $f : \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$
in a certain hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$. A learner is given adversarially
chosen inputs (contexts) $x_t \in \mathcal{X}$ and is asked to submit a guess
$y_t \in \mathcal{Y}$ for the value $f(x_t)$. Upon guessing the learner incurs
a certain loss $L(y_t, f(x_t))$ and learns whether $y_t \leq f(x_t)$ or $y_t >
f(x_t)$. The special case where $\mathcal{H}$ is the class of linear functions
over the unit ball has been studied in a series of papers. We both generalize
and improve these results. We provide a $O(d^2)$ regret bound where $d$ is the
covering dimension of the hypothesis class. The algorithms are based on a novel
technique which we call Steiner potential since in the linear case it reduces
to controlling the value of the Steiner polynomial of a convex region at
various scales. We also show that this new technique provides optimal regret
(up to log factors) in the linear case (i.e. the original contextual search
problem), improving the previously known bound of $O(d^4)$ to $O(d \log d)$.
Finally, we extend these results to a noisy feedback model, where each round
our feedback is flipped with fixed probability $p < 1/2$.

Title: A Permutation-Equivariant Neural Network Architecture For Auction Design
Authors: Jad Rahme, Samy Jelassi, Joan Bruna, S. Matthew Weinberg
Categories: cs.GT cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Designing an incentive compatible auction that maximizes expected revenue is
a central problem in Auction Design. Theoretical approaches to the problem have
hit some limits in the past decades and analytical solutions are known for only
a few simple settings. Computational approaches to the problem through the use
of LPs have their own set of limitations. Building on the success of deep
learning, a new approach was recently proposed by D\"utting et al., 2017 in
which the auction is modeled by a feed-forward neural network and the design
problem is framed as a learning problem. The neural architectures used in that
work are general purpose and do not take advantage of any of the symmetries the
problem could present, such as permutation equivariance. In this work, we
consider auction design problems that have permutation-equivariant symmetry and
construct a neural architecture that is capable of perfectly recovering the
permutation-equivariant optimal mechanism, which we show is not possible with
the previous architecture. We demonstrate that permutation-equivariant
architectures are not only capable of recovering previous results, they also
have better generalization properties.

  In the task abstraction phase of the visualization design process, including
in "design studies", a practitioner maps the observed domain goals to
generalizable abstract tasks using visualization theory in order to better
understand and address the users needs. We argue that this manual task
abstraction process is prone to errors due to designer biases and a lack of
domain background and knowledge. Under these circumstances, a collaborator can
help validate and provide sanity checks to visualization practitioners during
this important task abstraction stage. However, having a human collaborator is
not always feasible and may be subject to the same biases and pitfalls. In this
paper, we first describe the challenges associated with task abstraction. We
then propose a conceptual Digital Collaborator: an artificial intelligence
system that aims to help visualization practitioners by augmenting their
ability to validate and reason about the output of task abstraction. We also
discuss several practical design challenges of designing and implementing such
systems

  Vast improvements in natural language understanding and speech recognition
have paved the way for conversational interaction with computers. While
conversational agents have often been used for short goal-oriented dialog, we
know little about agents for developing computer programs. To explore the
utility of natural language for programming, we conducted a study ($n$=45)
comparing different input methods to a conversational programming system we
developed. Participants completed novice and advanced tasks using voice-based,
text-based, and voice-or-text-based systems. We found that users appreciated
aspects of each system (e.g., voice-input efficiency, text-input precision) and
that novice users were more optimistic about programming using voice-input than
advanced users. Our results show that future conversational programming tools
should be tailored to users' programming experience and allow users to choose
their preferred input mode. To reduce cognitive load, future interfaces can
incorporate visualizations and possess custom natural language understanding
and speech recognition models for programming.

Title: Evidence-based explanation to promote fairness in AI systems
Authors: Juliana Jansen Ferreira and Mateus de Souza Monteiro
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI
Comments: Fair & Responsible AI Workshop @ CHI2020
\\
  As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology gets more intertwined with every
system, people are using AI to make decisions on their everyday activities. In
simple contexts, such as Netflix recommendations, or in more complex context
like in judicial scenarios, AI is part of people's decisions. People make
decisions and usually, they need to explain their decision to others or in some
matter. It is particularly critical in contexts where human expertise is
central to decision-making. In order to explain their decisions with AI
support, people need to understand how AI is part of that decision. When
considering the aspect of fairness, the role that AI has on a decision-making
process becomes even more sensitive since it affects the fairness and the
responsibility of those people making the ultimate decision. We have been
exploring an evidence-based explanation design approach to 'tell the story of a
decision'. In this position paper, we discuss our approach for AI systems using
fairness sensitive cases in the literature.

\\
  Mobility may degrade the performance of next-generation vehicular networks
operating at the millimeter-wave spectrum: frequent loss of alignment and
blockages require repeated beam training and handover, thus incurring huge
overhead. In this paper, an adaptive and joint design of beam training, data
transmission and handover is proposed, that exploits the mobility process of
mobile users and the dynamics of blockages to optimally trade-off throughput
and power consumption. At each time slot, the serving base station decides to
perform either beam training, data communication, or handover when blockage is
detected. The problem is cast as a partially observable Markov decision
process, and solved via an approximate dynamic programming algorithm based on
PERSEUS [2]. Numerical results show that the PERSEUS-based policy performs
near-optimally, and achieves a 55% gain in spectral efficiency compared to a
baseline scheme with periodic beam training. Inspired by its structure, an
adaptive heuristic policy is proposed with low computational complexity and
small performance degradation.

\\
  In overloaded Massive MIMO (mMIMO) systems, wherein the number K of user
equipments (UEs) exceeds the number of base station antennas M, it has recently
been shown that non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can increase the sum
spectral efficiency. This paper aims at identifying cases where code-domain
NOMA can improve the spectral efficiency of mMIMO in the classical regime in
which K < M. Novel spectral efficiency expressions are provided for the uplink
and downlink with arbitrary spreading signatures and spatial correlation
matrices. Particular attention is devoted to the planar arrays that are
currently being deployed in pre-5G and 5G networks and which are characterized
by limited spatial resolution. Numerical results show that mMIMO with such
planar arrays can benefit from NOMA in scenarios where the UEs are spatially
close to each other. A UE grouping scheme is proposed for NOMA-aided mMIMO
systems that is applicable to the spatial correlation matrices of the UEs that
are currently active in each cell. Numerical results are used to investigate
the performance of the algorithm under different operating conditions and types
of spreading signatures (orthogonal, sparse and random sets). The analysis
reveals that orthogonal signatures provide the highest average spectral
efficiency.

Title: Intelligent UAV Base Station Selection in Urban Environments: A
  Supervised Learning Approach
Authors: Boris Galkin, Ramy Amer, Erika Fonseca, and Luiz A. DaSilva
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  When Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) connect into the cellular network, their
wireless channel is negatively impacted by strong Line-of-Sight (LoS)
interference from terrestrial Base Stations (BSs), as well as from antenna
misalignment due to downtilted BS antennas. Moreover, due to their aerial
positions, these UAVs are exposed to a large number of BSs with which they can
associate for wireless service. Therefore, to maximise the performance of the
UAV-BS wireless link, the UAVs need to be able to choose which BSs to connect
to, based on the observed environmental conditions. In this regard, this paper
proposes a supervised learning-based association scheme, using which a UAV can
intelligently associate to the most appropriate BS. We train a Neural Network
(NN) to identify the most suitable BS from several candidate BSs, based on the
received signal powers from the BSs, known distances to the BSs, as well as the
known locations of potential interferers. We then compare the performance of
the NN-based association scheme against strongest-signal and closest-neighbour
association schemes.

Title: Accelerating Generalized Benders Decomposition for Wireless Resource
  Allocation
Authors: Mengyuan Lee, Ning Ma, Guanding Yu, and Huaiyu Dai
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
\\
  Generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) is a globally optimal algorithm for
mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems, which are NP-hard and can
be widely found in the area of wireless resource allocation. The main idea of
GBD is decomposing an MINLP problem into a primal problem and a master problem,
which are iteratively solved until their solutions converge. However, a direct
implementation of GBD is time- and memory-consuming. The main bottleneck is the
high complexity of the master problem, which increases over the iterations.
Therefore, we propose to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to
accelerate GBD aiming at decreasing the complexity of the master problem.
Specifically, we utilize two different ML techniques, classification and
regression, to deal with this acceleration task. In this way, a cut classifier
and a cut regressor are learned, respectively, to distinguish between useful
and useless cuts. Only useful cuts are added to the master problem and thus the
complexity of the master problem is reduced. By using a resource allocation
problem in device-to-device communication networks as an example, we validate
that the proposed method can reduce the computational complexity of GBD without
loss of optimality and has strong generalization ability. The proposed method
is applicable for solving various MINLP problems in wireless networks since the
designs are invariant for different problems.

Title: Bayesian Receiver Design for Grant-Free NOMA with Message Passing Based
  Structured Signal Estimation
Authors: Zhang Yuanyuan and Yuan Zhengdao and Guo Qinghua and Wang Zhongyong
  and Xi Jiangtao and Li Yonghui
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is promising to achieve low
latency massive access in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In grant-free
NOMA, pilot signals are often used for user activity detection (UAD) and
channel estimation (CE) prior to multiuser detection (MUD) of active users.
However, the pilot overhead makes the communications inefficient for IoT
devices with sporadic transmissions and short data packets, or when the channel
coherence time is short. Hence, it is desirable to improve the efficiency by
avoiding the use of pilot signals, which can also further achieve lower
latency. This work focuses on Bayesian receiver design for grant-free low
density signature orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (LDS-OFDM), where
each user is allocated a unique low density spreading sequence. We propose to
use the low density spreading sequences for active user detection, thereby
avoiding the use of pilot signals. Firstly, the task of joint UAD, CE and MUD
is formulated as a structured signal estimation problem. Then message passing
based Bayesian approach is developed to solve the structured signal estimation
problem. In particular, belief propagation (BP), expectation propagation (EP)
and mean field (MF) message passing are used to develop efficient hybrid
message passing algorithms to achieve trade-off between performance and
complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
receiver for grant-free LDS-OFDM without the use of pilot signals.

Title: OTFS Based Receiver Scheme With Multi-Antennas in High-Mobility V2X
  Systems
Authors: Junqiang Cheng, Chenglu Jia, Hui Gao, Wenjun Xu, and Zhisong Bie
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: Accepted in IEEE ICC'20 Workshop - V2X-NGD
\\
  Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is considered as one of the most important
applications of future wireless communication networks. However, the Doppler
effect caused by the vehicle mobility may seriously deteriorate the performance
of the vehicular communication links, especially when the channels exhibit a
large number of Doppler frequency offsets (DFOs). Orthogonal time frequency
space (OTFS) is a new waveform designed in the delay-Doppler domain, and can
effectively convert a doubly dispersive channel into an almost non-fading
channel, which makes it very attractive for V2X communications. In this paper,
we design a novel OTFS based receiver with multi-antennas to deal with the
high-mobility challenges in V2X systems. We show that the multiple DFOs
associated with multipaths can be separated with the high-spatial resolution
provided by multi-antennas, which leads to an enhanced sparsity of the OTFS
channel in the delay-Doppler domain and bears a potential to reduce the
complexity of the message passing (MP) detection algorithm. Based on this
observation, we further propose a joint MP-maximum ration combining (MRC)
iterative detection for OTFS, where the integration of MRC significantly
improves the convergence performance of the iteration and gains an excellent
system error performance. Finally, we provide numerical simulation results to
corroborate the superiorities of the proposed scheme.

  In this paper, we study the characteristics of dominant interference power
with directional reception in a random network modelled by a Poisson Point
Process. Additionally, the Laplace functional of cumulative interference
excluding the $n$ dominant interferers is also derived, which turns out to be a
generalization of omni-directional reception and complete accumulative
interference. As an application of these results, we study the impact of
directional receivers in random networks in terms of outage probability and
error probability with queue length constraint.

Title: Impact of Spatially Consistent Channels on Digital Beamforming for
  Millimeter-Wave Systems
Authors: Harsh Tataria and Fredrik Tufvesson
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Invited Paper in the Proceedings of EuCAP 2020
\\
  The premise of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is based around
coherent transmission and detection. Majority of the vast literature on massive
MIMO presents performance evaluations over simplified statistical propagation
models. All such models are drop-based and do not ensure continuity of channel
parameters. In this paper, we quantify the impact of spatially consistent (SC)
models on beamforming for massive MIMO systems. We focus on the downlink of a
28GHz multiuser urban microcellular scenario. Using the recently standardized
Third Generation Partnership Project 38.901 SC-I procedure, we evaluate the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of a user equipment and the system
ergodic sum spectral efficiency with zero-forcing, block diagonalization, and
signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio beamforming. Our results disclose that at
practical signal-to-noise ratio levels, SC channels yield a significant
performance loss relative to the case without SC due to substantial spatial
correlation across the channel parameters.

Title: Real-Time Implementation Aspects of Large Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Harsh Tataria and Fredrik Tufvesson and Ove Edfors
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Invited Paper in the Proceedings of IEEE ICASSP 2020
\\
  With the potential to provide a clean break from massive multiple-input
multiple-output, large intelligent surfaces (LISs) have recently received a
thrust of research interest. Various proposals have been made in the literature
to define the exact functionality of LISs, ranging from fully active to largely
passive solutions. Nevertheless, almost all studies in the literature
investigate the fundamental spectral efficiency performance of these
architectures. In stark contrast, this paper investigates the implementation
aspects of LISs. Using the fully active LIS as the basis of our exposition, we
first present a rigorous discussion on the relative merits and disadvantages of
possible implementation architectures from a radio-frequency circuits and
real-time processing viewpoints. We then show that a distributed architecture
based on a common module interfacing a smaller number of antennas can be
scalable. To avoid severe losses with analog signal distribution, multiple
common modules can be interconnected via a digital nearest-neighbor network.
Furthermore, we show that with such a design, the maximum backplane throughput
scales with the number of served user terminals, instead of the number of
antennas across the surface. The discussions in the paper can serve as a
guideline toward the real-time design and development of LISs.

Title: Online Agnostic Boosting via Regret Minimization
Authors: Nataly Brukhim, Xinyi Chen, Elad Hazan, Shay Moran
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Boosting is a widely used machine learning approach based on the idea of
aggregating weak learning rules. While in statistical learning numerous
boosting methods exist both in the realizable and agnostic settings, in online
learning they exist only in the realizable case. In this work we provide the
first agnostic online boosting algorithm; that is, given a weak learner with
only marginally-better-than-trivial regret guarantees, our algorithm boosts it
to a strong learner with sublinear regret.
  Our algorithm is based on an abstract (and simple) reduction to online convex
optimization, which efficiently converts an arbitrary online convex optimizer
to an online booster.
  Moreover, this reduction extends to the statistical as well as the online
realizable settings, thus unifying the 4 cases of statistical/online and
agnostic/realizable boosting.

Title: Deep Survival Machines: Fully Parametric Survival Regression and
  Representation Learning for Censored Data with Competing Risks
Authors: Chirag Nagpal, Xinyu Li and Artur Dubrawski
Categories: cs.LG stat.AP stat.ML
\\
  We describe a new approach to estimating relative risks in time-to-event
prediction problems with censored data in a fully parametric manner. Our
approach does not require making strong assumptions of constant baseline hazard
of the underlying survival distribution, as required by the Cox-proportional
hazard model. By jointly learning deep nonlinear representations of the input
covariates, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach when used to estimate
survival risks through extensive experimentation on multiple real world
datasets with different levels of censoring. We further demonstrate advantages
of our model in the competing risks scenario. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work involving fully parametric estimation of survival times
with competing risks in the presence of censoring.

  Almost all neural architecture search methods are evaluated in terms of
performance (i.e. test accuracy) of the model structures that it finds. Should
it be the only metric for a good autoML approach? To examine aspects beyond
performance, we propose a set of criteria aimed at evaluating the core of
autoML problem: the amount of human intervention required to deploy these
methods into real world scenarios. Based on our proposed evaluation checklist,
we study the effectiveness of a random search strategy for fully automated
multimodal neural architecture search. Compared to traditional methods that
rely on manually crafted feature extractors, our method selects each modality
from a large search space with minimal human supervision. We show that our
proposed random search strategy performs close to the state of the art on the
AV-MNIST dataset while meeting the desirable characteristics for a fully
automated design process.

Title: Variational inference formulation for a model-free simulation of a

  Jayant R. Kalagnanam
Categories: cs.LG cs.CE cs.NE physics.comp-ph
\\
  We propose a recurrent neural network for a "model-free" simulation of a
dynamical system with unknown parameters without prior knowledge. The deep
learning model aims to jointly learn the nonlinear time marching operator and
the effects of the unknown parameters from a time series dataset. We assume
that the time series data set consists of an ensemble of trajectories for a
range of the parameters. The learning task is formulated as a statistical
inference problem by considering the unknown parameters as random variables. A
variational inference method is employed to train a recurrent neural network
jointly with a feedforward neural network for an approximately posterior
distribution. The approximate posterior distribution makes an inference on a
trajectory to identify the effects of the unknown parameters and a recurrent
neural network makes a prediction by using the outcome of the inference. In the
numerical experiments, it is shown that the proposed variational inference
model makes a more accurate simulation compared to the standard recurrent
neural networks. It is found that the proposed deep learning model is capable
of correctly identifying the dimensions of the random parameters and learning a
representation of complex time series data.

Title: Fast Predictive Uncertainty for Classification with Bayesian Deep
  Networks
Authors: Marius Hobbhahn, Agustinus Kristiadi, Philipp Hennig
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In Bayesian Deep Learning, distributions over the output of classification
neural networks are approximated by first constructing a Gaussian distribution
over the weights, then sampling from it to receive a distribution over the
categorical output distribution. This is costly. We reconsider old work to
construct a Dirichlet approximation of this output distribution, which yields
an analytic map between Gaussian distributions in logit space and Dirichlet
distributions (the conjugate prior to the categorical) in the output space. We
argue that the resulting Dirichlet distribution has theoretical and practical
advantages, in particular more efficient computation of the uncertainty
estimate, scaling to large datasets and networks like ImageNet and DenseNet. We
demonstrate the use of this Dirichlet approximation by using it to construct a
lightweight uncertainty-aware output ranking for the ImageNet setup.

\\
  The fragility of modern machine learning models has drawn a considerable
amount of attention from both academia and the public. While immense interests
were in either crafting adversarial attacks as a way to measure the robustness
of neural networks or devising worst-case analytical robustness verification
with guarantees, few methods could enjoy both scalability and robustness
guarantees at the same time. As an alternative to these attempts, randomized
smoothing adopts a different prediction rule that enables statistical
robustness arguments and can scale to large networks. However, in this paper,
we point out for the first time the side effects of current randomized
smoothing workflows. Specifically, we articulate and prove two major points: 1)
the decision boundaries shrink with the adoption of randomized smoothing
prediction rule; 2) noise augmentation does not necessarily resolve the
shrinking issue and can even create additional issues.

Title: Selectivity considered harmful: evaluating the causal impact of class
  selectivity in DNNs
Authors: Matthew L. Leavitt and Ari Morcos
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE q-bio.NC stat.ML
\\
  Class selectivity, typically defined as how different a neuron's responses
are across different classes of stimuli or data samples, is a common metric
used to interpret the function of individual neurons in biological and
artificial neural networks. However, it remains an open question whether it is
necessary and/or sufficient for deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn class
selectivity in individual units. In order to investigate the causal impact of
class selectivity on network function, we directly regularize for or against
class selectivity. Using this regularizer, we were able to reduce mean class
selectivity across units in convolutional neural networks by a factor of 2.5
with no impact on test accuracy, and reduce it nearly to zero with only a small
($\sim$2%) change in test accuracy. In contrast, increasing class selectivity
beyond the levels naturally learned during training had rapid and disastrous
effects on test accuracy. These results indicate that class selectivity in
individual units is neither neither sufficient nor strictly necessary for DNN
performance, and more generally encourage caution when focusing on the
properties of single units as representative of the mechanisms by which DNNs
function.

Title: MPC-guided Imitation Learning of Neural Network Policies for the
  Artificial Pancreas
Authors: Hongkai Chen, Nicola Paoletti, Scott A. Smolka, Shan Lin
Categories: cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
\\
  Even though model predictive control (MPC) is currently the main algorithm
for insulin control in the artificial pancreas (AP), it usually requires
complex online optimizations, which are infeasible for resource-constrained
medical devices. MPC also typically relies on state estimation, an error-prone
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to AP control that uses
Imitation Learning to synthesize neural-network insulin policies from
MPC-computed demonstrations. Such policies are computationally efficient and,
by instrumenting MPC at training time with full state information, they can
directly map measurements into optimal therapy decisions, thus bypassing state
estimation. We apply Bayesian inference via Monte Carlo Dropout to learn
policies, which allows us to quantify prediction uncertainty and thereby derive
safer therapy decisions. We show that our control policies trained under a
specific patient model readily generalize (in terms of model parameters and
disturbance distributions) to patient cohorts, consistently outperforming
traditional MPC with state estimation.

Title: Regression via Implicit Models and Optimal Transport Cost Minimization
Authors: Saurav Manchanda and Khoa Doan and Pranjul Yadav and S. Sathiya

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This paper addresses the classic problem of regression, which involves the
inductive learning of a map, $y=f(x,z)$, $z$ denoting noise,
$f:\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$. Recently,
Conditional GAN (CGAN) has been applied for regression and has shown to be
advantageous over the other standard approaches like Gaussian Process
Regression, given its ability to implicitly model complex noise forms. However,
the current CGAN implementation for regression uses the classical
generator-discriminator architecture with the minimax optimization approach,
which is notorious for being difficult to train due to issues like training
instability or failure to converge. In this paper, we take another step towards
regression models that implicitly model the noise, and propose a solution which
directly optimizes the optimal transport cost between the true probability
distribution $p(y|x)$ and the estimated distribution $\hat{p}(y|x)$ and does
not suffer from the issues associated with the minimax approach. On a variety
of synthetic and real-world datasets, our proposed solution achieves
state-of-the-art results. The code accompanying this paper is available at

Title: Safe Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicles through Parallel
  Constrained Policy Optimization
Authors: Lu Wen, Jingliang Duan, Shengbo Eben Li, Shaobing Xu, Huei Peng
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) is attracting increasing interests in autonomous
driving due to its potential to solve complex classification and control
problems. However, existing RL algorithms are rarely applied to real vehicles
for two predominant problems: behaviours are unexplainable, and they cannot
guarantee safety under new scenarios. This paper presents a safe RL algorithm,
called Parallel Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO), for two autonomous
driving tasks. PCPO extends today's common actor-critic architecture to a
three-component learning framework, in which three neural networks are used to
approximate the policy function, value function and a newly added risk
function, respectively. Meanwhile, a trust region constraint is added to allow
large update steps without breaking the monotonic improvement condition. To
ensure the feasibility of safety constrained problems, synchronized parallel
learners are employed to explore different state spaces, which accelerates
learning and policy-update. The simulations of two scenarios for autonomous
vehicles confirm we can ensure safety while achieving fast learning.

Title: Bounded Regret for Finitely Parameterized Multi-Armed Bandits

Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures, IEEE Control Systems Letters
\\
  We consider the problem of finitely parameterized multi-armed bandits where
the model of the underlying stochastic environment can be characterized based
on a common unknown parameter. The true parameter is unknown to the learning
agent. However, the set of possible parameters, which is finite, is known a
priori. We propose an algorithm that is simple and easy to implement, which we
call FP-UCB algorithm, which uses the information about the underlying
parameter set for faster learning. In particular, we show that the FP-UCB
algorithm achieves a bounded regret under some structural condition on the
underlying parameter set. We also show that, if the underlying parameter set
does not satisfy the necessary structural condition, FP-UCB algorithm achieves
a logarithmic regret, but with a smaller preceding constant compared to the
standard UCB algorithm. We also validate the superior performance of the FP-UCB
algorithm through extensive numerical simulations.

Title: Heterogeneous Graph Transformer

Comments: Published on WWW 2020
\\
  Recent years have witnessed the emerging success of graph neural networks
(GNNs) for modeling structured data. However, most GNNs are designed for
homogeneous graphs, in which all nodes and edges belong to the same types,
making them infeasible to represent heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we
present the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) architecture for modeling
Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we design node- and
edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over
each edge, empowering HGT to maintain dedicated representations for different
types of nodes and edges. To handle dynamic heterogeneous graphs, we introduce
the relative temporal encoding technique into HGT, which is able to capture the
dynamic structural dependency with arbitrary durations. To handle Web-scale
graph data, we design the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling
algorithm---HGSampling---for efficient and scalable training. Extensive
experiments on the Open Academic Graph of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges
show that the proposed HGT model consistently outperforms all the
state-of-the-art GNN baselines by 9%--21% on various downstream tasks.

Title: DETECT: Deep Trajectory Clustering for Mobility-Behavior Analysis
Authors: Mingxuan Yue, Yaguang Li, Haoze Yang, Ritesh Ahuja, Yao-Yi Chiang,

Comments: Published as a conference paper at BigData 2019
\\
  Identifying mobility behaviors in rich trajectory data is of great economic
and social interest to various applications including urban planning, marketing
and intelligence. Existing work on trajectory clustering often relies on
similarity measurements that utilize raw spatial and/or temporal information of
trajectories. These measures are incapable of identifying similar moving
behaviors that exhibit varying spatio-temporal scales of movement. In addition,
the expense of labeling massive trajectory data is a barrier to supervised
learning models. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised neural
approach for mobility behavior clustering, called the Deep Embedded TrajEctory
ClusTering network (DETECT). DETECT operates in three parts: first it
transforms the trajectories by summarizing their critical parts and augmenting
them with context derived from their geographical locality (e.g., using POIs
from gazetteers). In the second part, it learns a powerful representation of
trajectories in the latent space of behaviors, thus enabling a clustering
function (such as $k$-means) to be applied. Finally, a clustering oriented loss
is directly built on the embedded features to jointly perform feature
refinement and cluster assignment, thus improving separability between mobility
behaviors. Exhaustive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for mobility
behavior analyses.

Title: Curriculum By Texture
Authors: Samarth Sinha, Animesh Garg, Hugo Larochelle
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance in
computer vision tasks such as image classification and segmentation. One factor
for the success of CNNs is that they have an inductive bias that assumes a
certain type of spatial structure is present in the data. Recent work by
Geirhos et al. (2018) shows how learning in CNNs causes the learned CNN models
to be biased towards high-frequency textural information, compared to
low-frequency shape information in images. Many tasks generally requires both
shape and textural information. Hence, we propose a simple curriculum based
scheme which improves the ability of CNNs to be less biased towards textural
information, and at the same time, being able to represent both the shape and
textural information. We propose to augment the training of CNNs by controlling
the amount of textural information that is available to the CNNs during the
training process, by convolving the output of a CNN layer with a low-pass
filter, or simply a Gaussian kernel. By reducing the standard deviation of the
Gaussian kernel, we are able to gradually increase the amount of textural
information available as training progresses, and hence reduce the texture
bias. Such an augmented training scheme significantly improves the performance
of CNNs on various image classification tasks, while adding no additional
trainable parameters or auxiliary regularization objectives. We also observe
significant improvements when using the trained CNNs to perform transfer
learning on a different dataset, and transferring to a different task which
shows how the learned CNNs using the proposed method act as better feature
extractors.

Title: Self-Supervised Object-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: William Agnew and Pedro Domingos
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Current deep reinforcement learning approaches incorporate minimal prior
knowledge about the environment, limiting computational and sample efficiency.
We incorporate a few object-based priors that humans are known to use: "Infants
divide perceptual arrays into units that move as connected wholes, that move
separately from one another, that tend to maintain their size and shape over
motion, and that tend to act upon each other only on contact" [Spelke]. We
propose a probabilistic object-based model of environments and use human object
priors to develop an efficient self-supervised algorithm for maximum likelihood
estimation of the model parameters from observations and for inferring objects
directly from the perceptual stream. We then use object features and
incorporate object-contact priors to improve the sample efficiency our
object-based RL agent.We evaluate our approach on a subset of the Atari
benchmarks, and learn up to four orders of magnitude faster than the standard
deep Q-learning network, rendering rapid desktop experiments in this domain
feasible. To our knowledge, our system is the first to learn any Atari task in
fewer environment interactions than humans.

Title: CRATOS: Cogination of Reliable Algorithm for Time-series Optimal
  Solution
Authors: Ziling Wu and Ping Liu and Zheng Hu and Jun Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML
\\
  Anomaly detection of time series plays an important role in reliability
systems engineering. However, in practical application, there is no precisely
defined boundary between normal and anomalous behaviors in different
application scenarios. Therefore, different anomaly detection algorithms and
processes ought to be adopted for time series in different situation. Although
such strategy improve the accuracy of anomaly detection, it takes a lot of time
for engineers to configure millions of different algorithms to different
series, which greatly increases the development and maintenance cost of anomaly
detection processes. In this paper, we propose CRATOS which is a self-adapt
algorithms that extract features for time series, and then cluster series with
similar features into one group. For each group we utilize evolution algorithm
to search the best anomaly detection methods and processes. Our methods can
significantly reduce the cost of development and maintenance. According to our
experiments, our clustering methods achieves the state-of-art results. Compared
with the accuracy (93.4%) of the anomaly detection algorithms that engineers
configure for different time series manually, our algorithms is not far behind
in detecting accuracy (85.1%).

Authors: Niklas {\AA}kerblom and Yuxin Chen and Morteza Haghir Chehreghani
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Energy-efficient navigation constitutes an important challenge in electric
vehicles, due to their limited battery capacity. We employ a Bayesian approach
to model energy consumption at road-segments for efficient navigation. In order
to learn the model parameters, we develop an online learning framework and
investigate several exploration strategies such as Thompson Sampling and Upper
Confidence Bound. We then extend our online learning framework to multi-agent
setting, where multiple vehicles adaptively navigate and learn the parameters
of the energy model. We analyze Thompson Sampling and establish rigorous regret
bounds on its performance. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our
methods via several real-world experiments on Luxembourg SUMO Traffic dataset.

Title: Online Joint Bid/Daily Budget Optimization of Internet Advertising
  Campaigns
Authors: Alessandro Nuara, Francesco Trov\`o, Nicola Gatti and Marcello
  Restelli
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Pay-per-click advertising includes various formats (\emph{e.g.}, search,
contextual, social) with a total investment of more than 200 billion USD per
year worldwide. An advertiser is given a daily budget to allocate over several,
even thousands, campaigns, mainly distinguishing for the ad, target, or
channel. Furthermore, publishers choose the ads to display and how to allocate
them employing auctioning mechanisms, in which every day the advertisers set
for each campaign a bid corresponding to the maximum amount of money per click
they are willing to pay and the fraction of the daily budget to invest. In this
paper, we study the problem of automating the online joint bid/daily budget
optimization of pay-per-click advertising campaigns over multiple channels. We
formulate our problem as a combinatorial semi-bandit problem, which requires
solving a special case of the Multiple-Choice Knapsack problem every day.
Furthermore, for every campaign, we capture the dependency of the number of
clicks on the bid and daily budget by Gaussian Processes, thus requiring mild
assumptions on the regularity of these functions. We design four algorithms and
show that they suffer from a regret that is upper bounded with high probability
as O(sqrt{T}), where T is the time horizon of the learning process. We
experimentally evaluate our algorithms with synthetic settings generated from
real data from Yahoo!, and we present the results of the adoption of our
algorithms in a real-world application with a daily average spent of 1,000
Euros for more than one year.

\\
  Discovering the causal effect of a decision is critical to nearly all forms
of decision-making. In particular, it is a key quantity in drug development, in
crafting government policy, and when implementing a real-world machine learning
system. Given only observational data, confounders often obscure the true
causal effect. Luckily, in some cases, it is possible to recover the causal
effect by using certain observed variables to adjust for the effects of
confounders. However, without access to the true causal model, finding this
adjustment requires brute-force search. In this work, we present an algorithm
that exploits auxiliary variables, similar to instruments, in order to find an
appropriate adjustment by a gradient-based optimization method. We demonstrate
that it outperforms practical alternatives in estimating the true causal
effect, without knowledge of the full causal graph.

Title: Pattern Similarity-based Machine Learning Methods for Mid-term Load
  Forecasting: A Comparative Study
Authors: Grzegorz Dudek, Pawel Pelka
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 17 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Pattern similarity-based methods are widely used in classification and
regression problems. Repeated, similar-shaped cycles observed in seasonal time
series encourage to apply these methods for forecasting. In this paper we use
the pattern similarity-based methods for forecasting monthly electricity demand
expressing annual seasonality. An integral part of the models is the time
series representation using patterns of time series sequences. Pattern
representation ensures the input and output data unification through trend
filtering and variance equalization. Consequently, pattern representation
simplifies the forecasting problem and allows us to use models based on pattern
similarity. We consider four such models: nearest neighbor model, fuzzy
neighborhood model, kernel regression model and general regression neural
network. A regression function is constructed by aggregation output patterns
with weights dependent on the similarity between input patterns. The advantages
of the proposed models are: clear principle of operation, small number of
parameters to adjust, fast optimization procedure, good generalization ability,
working on the newest data without retraining, robustness to missing input
variables, and generating a vector as an output. In the experimental part of
the work the proposed models were used to forecasting the monthly demand for 35
European countries. The model performances were compared with the performances
of the classical models such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing as well as
state-of-the-art models such as multilayer perceptron, neuro-fuzzy system and
long short-term memory model. The results show high performance of the proposed
models which outperform the comparative models in accuracy, simplicity and ease
of optimization.

Title: Analyzing Accuracy Loss in Randomized Smoothing Defenses
Authors: Yue Gao, Harrison Rosenberg, Kassem Fawaz, Somesh Jha, Justin Hsu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 19 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables
\\
  Recent advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially deep neural
networks (DNNs), have demonstrated remarkable success (sometimes exceeding
human-level performance) on several tasks, including face and speech
recognition. However, ML algorithms are vulnerable to \emph{adversarial
attacks}, such test-time, training-time, and backdoor attacks. In test-time
attacks an adversary crafts adversarial examples, which are specially crafted
perturbations imperceptible to humans which, when added to an input example,
force a machine learning model to misclassify the given input example.
Adversarial examples are a concern when deploying ML algorithms in critical
contexts, such as information security and autonomous driving. Researchers have
responded with a plethora of defenses. One promising defense is
\emph{randomized smoothing} in which a classifier's prediction is smoothed by
adding random noise to the input example we wish to classify. In this paper, we
theoretically and empirically explore randomized smoothing. We investigate the
effect of randomized smoothing on the feasible hypotheses space, and show that
for some noise levels the set of hypotheses which are feasible shrinks due to
smoothing, giving one reason why the natural accuracy drops after smoothing. To
perform our analysis, we introduce a model for randomized smoothing which
abstracts away specifics, such as the exact distribution of the noise. We
complement our theoretical results with extensive experiments.

Title: Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning via Global Context
  Prediction
Authors: Zhen Peng, Yixiang Dong, Minnan Luo, Xiao-Ming Wu, Qinghua Zheng
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  To take full advantage of fast-growing unlabeled networked data, this paper
introduces a novel self-supervised strategy for graph representation learning
by exploiting natural supervision provided by the data itself. Inspired by
human social behavior, we assume that the global context of each node is
composed of all nodes in the graph since two arbitrary entities in a connected
network could interact with each other via paths of varying length. Based on
this, we investigate whether the global context can be a source of free and
effective supervisory signals for learning useful node representations.
Specifically, we randomly select pairs of nodes in a graph and train a
well-designed neural net to predict the contextual position of one node
relative to the other. Our underlying hypothesis is that the representations
learned from such within-graph context would capture the global topology of the
graph and finely characterize the similarity and differentiation between nodes,
which is conducive to various downstream learning tasks. Extensive benchmark
experiments including node classification, clustering, and link prediction
demonstrate that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised
methods and sometimes even exceeds the performance of supervised counterparts.

\\
  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently achieved remarkable
successes in various sequential decision making tasks, leveraging advances in
methods for training large deep networks. However, these methods usually
require large amounts of training data, which is often a big problem for
real-world applications. One natural question to ask is whether learning good
representations for states and using larger networks helps in learning better
policies. In this paper, we try to study if increasing input dimensionality
helps improve performance and sample efficiency of model-free deep RL
algorithms. To do so, we propose an online feature extractor network (OFENet)
that uses neural nets to produce good representations to be used as inputs to
deep RL algorithms. Even though the high dimensionality of input is usually
supposed to make learning of RL agents more difficult, we show that the RL
agents in fact learn more efficiently with the high-dimensional representation
than with the lower-dimensional state observations. We believe that stronger
feature propagation together with larger networks (and thus larger search
space) allows RL agents to learn more complex functions of states and thus
improves the sample efficiency. Through numerical experiments, we show that the
proposed method outperforms several other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms
of both sample efficiency and performance.

Title: Explaining Groups of Points in Low-Dimensional Representations
Authors: Gregory Plumb, Jonathan Terhorst, Sriram Sankararaman, Ameet Talwalkar
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A common workflow in data exploration is to learn a low-dimensional
representation of the data, identify groups of points in that representation,
and examine the differences between the groups to determine what they
represent. We treat this as an interpretable machine learning problem by
leveraging the model that learned the low-dimensional representation to help
identify the key differences between the groups. To solve this problem, we
introduce a new type of explanation, a Global Counterfactual Explanation (GCE),
and our algorithm, Transitive Global Translations (TGT), for computing GCEs.
TGT identifies the differences between each pair of groups using compressed
sensing but constrains those pairwise differences to be consistent among all of
the groups. Empirically, we demonstrate that TGT is able to identify
explanations that accurately explain the model while being relatively sparse,
and that these explanations match real patterns in the data.

\\
  In this paper, we consider the problem of building learning agents that can
efficiently learn to navigate in constrained environments. The main goal is to
design agents that can efficiently learn to understand and generalize to
different environments using high-dimensional inputs (a 2D map), while
following feasible paths that avoid obstacles in obstacle-cluttered
environment. To achieve this, we make use of traditional path planning
algorithms, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning algorithms in a
synergistic way. The key idea is to decouple the navigation problem into
planning and control, the former of which is achieved by supervised learning
whereas the latter is done by reinforcement learning. Specifically, we train a
deep convolutional network that can predict collision-free paths based on a map
of the environment-- this is then used by a reinforcement learning algorithm to
learn to closely follow the path. This allows the trained agent to achieve good
generalization while learning faster. We test our proposed method in the
recently proposed Safety Gym suite that allows testing of safety-constraints
during training of learning agents. We compare our proposed method with
existing work and show that our method consistently improves the sample
efficiency and generalization capability to novel environments.

\\
  In unsupervised novelty detection, a model is trained solely on the in-class
data, and infer to single out out-class data. Autoencoder (AE) variants aim to
compactly model the in-class data to reconstruct it exclusively,
differentiating it from out-class by the reconstruction error. However, it
remains challenging for high-dimensional image data in the fully unsupervised
setting. For this, we propose Compact Surjective Encoding AE (CSE-AE). In this
framework, the encoding of any input is constrained into a compact manifold by
exploiting the deep neural net's ignorance of the unknown. Concurrently, the
in-class data is surjectively encoded to the compact manifold via AE. The
mechanism is realized by both GAN and its ensembled discriminative layers, and
results to reconstruct the in-class exclusively. In inference, the
reconstruction error of a query is measured using high-level semantics captured
by the discriminator. Extensive experiments on image data show that the
proposed model gives state-of-the-art performance.

Comments: Submitted to UAI 2020
\\
  Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) is a useful tool for
efficiently learning probabilistic models in machine learning. Generally
approximate posteriors learned by ADVI are forced to be unimodal in order to
facilitate use of the reparameterization trick. In this paper, we show how
stratified sampling may be used to enable mixture distributions as the
approximate posterior, and derive a new lower bound on the evidence analogous
to the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE). We show that this ``SIWAE'' is a
tighter bound than both IWAE and the traditional ELBO, both of which are
special instances of this bound. We verify empirically that the traditional
ELBO objective disfavors the presence of multimodal posterior distributions and
may therefore not be able to fully capture structure in the latent space. Our
experiments show that using the SIWAE objective allows the encoder to learn
more complex distributions which regularly contain multimodality, resulting in
higher accuracy and better calibration in the presence of incomplete, limited,
or corrupted data.

Title: Reliable evaluation of adversarial robustness with an ensemble of
  diverse parameter-free attacks
Authors: Francesco Croce, Matthias Hein
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  The field of defense strategies against adversarial attacks has significantly
grown over the last years, but progress is hampered as the evaluation of
adversarial defenses is often insufficient and thus gives a wrong impression of
robustness. Many promising defenses could be broken later on, making it
difficult to identify the state-of-the-art. Frequent pitfalls in the evaluation
are improper tuning of hyperparameters of the attacks, gradient obfuscation or
masking. In this paper we first propose two extensions of the PGD-attack
overcoming failures due to suboptimal step size and problems of the objective
function. We then combine our novel attacks with two complementary existing
ones to form a parameter-free, computationally affordable and user-independent
ensemble of attacks to test adversarial robustness. We apply our ensemble to
over 40 models from papers published at recent top machine learning and
computer vision venues. In all except one of the cases we achieve lower robust
test accuracy than reported in these papers, often by more than $10\%$,
identifying several broken defenses.

  We study model selection in stochastic bandit problems. Our approach relies
on a master algorithm that selects its actions among candidate base algorithms.
While this problem is studied for specific classes of stochastic base
algorithms, our objective is to provide a method that can work with more
general classes of stochastic base algorithms. We propose a master algorithm
inspired by CORRAL \cite{DBLP:conf/colt/AgarwalLNS17} and introduce a novel and
generic smoothing transformation for stochastic bandit algorithms that permits
us to obtain $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees for a wide class of base
algorithms when working along with our master. We exhibit a lower bound showing
that even when one of the base algorithms has $O(\log T)$ regret, in general it
is impossible to get better than $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ regret in model selection,
even asymptotically. We apply our algorithm to choose among different values of
$\epsilon$ for the $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm, and to choose between the
$k$-armed UCB and linear UCB algorithms. Our empirical studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our model-selection method.

Title: Hierarchically Decoupled Imitation for Morphological Transfer

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO stat.ML
\\
  Learning long-range behaviors on complex high-dimensional agents is a
fundamental problem in robot learning. For such tasks, we argue that
transferring learned information from a morphologically simpler agent can
massively improve the sample efficiency of a more complex one. To this end, we
propose a hierarchical decoupling of policies into two parts: an independently
learned low-level policy and a transferable high-level policy. To remedy poor
transfer performance due to mismatch in morphologies, we contribute two key
ideas. First, we show that incentivizing a complex agent's low-level to imitate
a simpler agent's low-level significantly improves zero-shot high-level
transfer. Second, we show that KL-regularized training of the high level
stabilizes learning and prevents mode-collapse. Finally, on a suite of publicly
released navigation and manipulation environments, we demonstrate the
applicability of hierarchical transfer on long-range tasks across morphologies.

Title: Approximation of noisy data using multivariate splines and finite
  element methods
Authors: Elizabeth Harris, Bishnu Lamichhane, Quoc Thong Le Gia
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We compare a recently proposed multivariate spline based on mixed partial
derivatives with two other standard splines for the scattered data smoothing
problem. The splines are defined as the minimiser of a penalised least squares
functional. The penalties are based on partial differentiation operators, and
are integrated using the finite element method. We compare three methods to two
problems: to remove the mixture of Gaussian and impulsive noise from an image,
and to recover a continuous function from a set of noisy observations.

Title: Numerical solution of the general high-dimensional multi-term
  time-space-fractional diffusion equations
Authors: Xiaogang Zhu
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 16 pages, 12 figures
MSC-class: 35R11, 65D25, 65M9
\\
  In this article, an advanced differential quadrature (DQ) approach is
proposed to obtain the numerical solutions of the two- and three-dimensional
multi-term time-space-fractional diffusion equation (TSFDE) on general domains.
The fractional derivatives in space are firstly discretized by deriving a new
class of differential quadrature (DQ) formulas with radial basis functions
(RBFs) being the trial functions. Then, the original problems are converted to
a group of multi-term fractional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which
are further treated by a class of high-order difference schemes based on the
weighted and shifted Lubich difference operators. The presented DQ method is
high accurate and convergent on arbitrary domains. Finally, several numerical
examples are carried out to illustrate its accuracy and effectiveness.

Title: Shock capturing with discontinuous Galerkin Method using Overset grids
  for two-dimensional Euler equations
Authors: S R Siva Prasad Kochi and M Ramakrishna
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 18 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables
\\
  A new procedure to capture the shocks has been proposed and is demonstrated
for the solutions of two-dimensional Euler equations using discontinuous
Galerkin method and overset grids. A discontinuous Galerkin solver using a
coarse grid provides the troubled cell data that is used to determine the
location of the shock. An overset grid aligned to the shock is constructed
based on this information. The solver is run again with the coarse grid
solution as the initial condition with limiting occurring only in the overset
grid to give a solution with the shock aligned to the grid line. Results for
supersonic flow over a ramp, shock reflecting off a flat plate and the
supersonic flow over a circular cylinder are presented. For the flow over a
circular cylinder, the results obtained are validated using an existing
analytical method for calculating the shock offset distance.

Title: A Riemannian Newton Optimization Framework for the Symmetric Tensor Rank
  Approximation Problem
Authors: Rima Khouja (AROMATH), Houssam Khalil, Bernard Mourrain (AROMATH)
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.OC
\\
  The symmetric tensor rank approximation problem (STA) consists in computing
the best low rank approximation of a symmetric tensor. We describe a Riemannian
Newton iteration with trust region scheme for the STA problem. We formulate
this problem as a Riemannian optimization problem by parameterizing the
constraint set as the Cartesian product of Veronese manifolds. We present an
explicit and exact formula for the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix of
the method, in terms of the weights and points of the low rank approximation
and the symmetric tensor to approximate, by exploiting the properties of the
apolar product. We introduce a retraction operator on the Veronese manifold.
The Newton Riemannian iterations are performed for best low rank approximation
over the real or complex numbers. Numerical experiments are implemented to show
the numerical behavior of the new method first against perturbation, to compute
the best rank-1 approximation and the spectral norm of a symmetric tensor, and
to compare with some existing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: A Bilinear Partially Penalized Immersed Finite Element Method for

Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  In this article, we introduce a new partially penalized immersed finite
element method (IFEM) for solving elliptic interface problems with
multi-domains and triple-junction points. We construct new IFE functions on
elements intersected with multiple interfaces or with triple-junction points to
accommodate interface jump conditions. For non-homogeneous flux jump, we enrich
the local approximating spaces by adding up to three local flux basis
functions. Numerical experiments are carried out to show that both the Lagrange
interpolations and the partial penalized IFEM solutions converge optimally in
L2 and H1 norms.

\\
  We describe a fully discrete mixed finite element method for the linearized
rotating shallow water model, possibly with damping. While Crank-Nicolson
time-stepping conserves energy in the absence of drag or forcing terms and is
not subject to a CFL-like stability condition, it requires the inversion of a
linear system at each step. We develop weighted-norm preconditioners for this
algebraic system that are nearly robust with respect to the physical and
discretization parameters in the system. Numerical experiments using Firedrake
support the theoretical results.

Title: An energy-stable parametric finite element method for simulating
  solid-state dewetting
Authors: Quan, Zhao and Wei, Jiang and Weizhu Bao
Categories: math.NA cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.NA physics.comp-ph
Comments: 29 pages, 12 figures
\\
  We propose an energy-stable parametric finite element method (ES-PFEM) for
simulating solid-state dewetting of thin films in two dimensions via a
sharp-interface model, which is governed by surface diffusion and contact line
(point) migration together with proper boundary conditions. By reformulating
the relaxed contact angle condition into a Robin-type boundary condition and
then treating it as a natural boundary condition, we obtain a new variational
formulation for the problem, in which the interface curve and its contact
points are evolved simultaneously. Then, the variational problem is discretized
in space by using piecewise linear elements. A full discretization is presented
by adopting the backward Euler method in time, and the well-posedness and
energy dissipation of the full discretization are established. The numerical
method is semi-implicit (i.e., a linear system to be solved at each time step
and thus efficient), unconditionally energy-stable with respect to the time
step, and second-order in space measured by a manifold distance between two
curves. In addition, it demonstrates equal mesh distribution when the solution
reaches its equilibrium, i.e., long-time dynamics. Numerical results are
reported to show accuracy and efficiency as well as some good properties of the
proposed numerical method.

Title: Explicitly Trained Spiking Sparsity in Spiking Neural Networks with
  Backpropagation
Authors: Jason M. Allred, Steven J. Spencer, Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan, Kaushik
  Roy
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG
\\
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are being explored for their potential energy
efficiency resulting from sparse, event-driven computations. Many recent works
have demonstrated effective backpropagation for deep Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) by approximating gradients over discontinuous neuron spikes or firing
events. A beneficial side-effect of these surrogate gradient spiking
backpropagation algorithms is that the spikes, which trigger additional
computations, may now themselves be directly considered in the gradient
calculations. We propose an explicit inclusion of spike counts in the loss
function, along with a traditional error loss, causing the backpropagation
learning algorithms to optimize weight parameters for both accuracy and spiking
sparsity. As supported by existing theory of over-parameterized neural
networks, there are many solution states with effectively equivalent accuracy.
As such, appropriate weighting of the two loss goals during training in this
multi-objective optimization process can yield an improvement in spiking
sparsity without a significant loss of accuracy. We additionally explore a
simulated annealing-inspired loss weighting technique to increase the weighting
for sparsity as training time increases. Our preliminary results on the
Cifar-10 dataset show up to 70.1% reduction in spiking activity with
iso-accuracy compared to an equivalent SNN trained only for accuracy and up to
73.3% reduction in spiking activity if allowed a trade-off of 1% reduction in
classification accuracy.

  The endeavor to understand the brain involves multiple collaborating research
fields. Classically, synaptic plasticity rules derived by theoretical
neuroscientists are evaluated in isolation on pattern classification tasks.
This contrasts with the biological brain which purpose is to control a body in
closed-loop. This paper contributes to bringing the fields of computational
neuroscience and robotics closer together by integrating open-source software
components from these two fields. The resulting framework allows to evaluate
the validity of biologically-plausibe plasticity models in closed-loop robotics
environments. We demonstrate this framework to evaluate Synaptic Plasticity
with Online REinforcement learning (SPORE), a reward-learning rule based on
synaptic sampling, on two visuomotor tasks: reaching and lane following. We
show that SPORE is capable of learning to perform policies within the course of
simulated hours for both tasks. Provisional parameter explorations indicate
that the learning rate and the temperature driving the stochastic processes
that govern synaptic learning dynamics need to be regulated for performance
improvements to be retained. We conclude by discussing the recent deep
reinforcement learning techniques which would be beneficial to increase the
functionality of SPORE on visuomotor tasks.

  We present a study demonstrating how random walk algorithms can be used for
evolutionary image transition. We design different mutation operators based on
uniform and biased random walks and study how their combination with a baseline
mutation operator can lead to interesting image transition processes in terms
of visual effects and artistic features. Using feature-based analysis we
investigate the evolutionary image transition behaviour with respect to
different features and evaluate the images constructed during the image
transition process. Afterwards, we investigate how modifications of our biased
random walk approaches can be used for evolutionary image painting. We
introduce an evolutionary image painting approach whose underlying biased
random walk can be controlled by a parameter influencing the bias of the random
walk and thereby creating different artistic painting effects.

Title: A Metric for Evaluating Neural Input Representation in Supervised
  Learning Networks
Authors: Richard R Carrillo, Francisco Naveros, Eduardo Ros, Niceto R Luque
Categories: cs.NE
DOI: 10.3389/fnins.2018.00913
\\
  Supervised learning has long been attributed to several feed-forward neural
circuits within the brain, with attention being paid to the cerebellar granular
layer. The focus of this study is to evaluate the input activity representation
of these feed-forward neural networks. The activity of cerebellar granule cells
is conveyed by parallel fibers and translated into Purkinje cell activity; the
sole output of the cerebellar cortex. The learning process at this
parallel-fiber-to-Purkinje-cell connection makes each Purkinje cell sensitive
to a set of specific cerebellar states, determined by the granule-cell activity
during a certain time window. A Purkinje cell becomes sensitive to each neural
input state and, consequently, the network operates as a function able to
generate a desired output for each provided input by means of supervised
learning. However, not all sets of Purkinje cell responses can be assigned to
any set of input states due to the network's own limitations (inherent to the
network neurobiological substrate), that is, not all input-output mapping can
be learned. A limiting factor is the representation of the input states through
granule-cell activity. The quality of this representation will determine the
capacity of the network to learn a varied set of outputs. In this study we
present an algorithm for evaluating quantitatively the level of
compatibility/interference amongst a set of given cerebellar states according
to their representation (granule-cell activation patterns) without the need for
actually conducting simulations and network training. The algorithm input
consists of a real-number matrix that codifies the activity level of every
considered granule-cell in each state. The capability of this representation to
generate a varied set of outputs is evaluated geometrically, thus resulting in
a real number that assesses the goodness of the representation

Title: Adaptive Federated Learning With Gradient Compression in Uplink NOMA
Authors: Haijian Sun, Xiang Ma, Rose Qingyang Hu
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: submitted to IEEE for possible future publication
\\
  Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning technique that
aggregates model attributes from a large number of distributed devices. Several
unique features such as energy saving and privacy preserving make FL a highly
promising learning approach for power-limited and privacy sensitive devices.
Although distributed computing can lower down the information amount that needs
to be uploaded, model updates in FL can still experience performance
bottleneck, especially for updates via wireless connections. In this work, we
investigate the performance of FL update with mobile edge devices that are
connected to the parameter server (PS) with practical wireless links, where
uplink update from user to PS has very limited capacity. Different from the
existing works, we apply non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) together with
gradient compression in the wireless uplink. Simulation results show that our
proposed scheme can significantly reduce aggregation latency while achieving
similar accuracy.

\\
  Recent developments in robotics and communication technologies are paving the
way towards the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide ubiquitous
connectivity in public safety scenarios or in remote areas. The millimeter wave
(mmWave) spectrum, in particular, has gained momentum since the huge amount of
free spectrum available at such frequencies can yield very high data rates. In
the UAV context, however, mmWave operations may incur severe signal attenuation
and sensitivity to blockage, especially considering the very long transmission
distances involved. In this paper, we present a tractable stochastic analysis
to characterize the coverage probability of UAV stations operating at mmWaves.
We exemplify some of the trade-offs to be considered when designing solutions
for millimeter wave (mmWave) scenarios, such as the beamforming configuration,
and the UAV altitude and deployment.

\\
  We analyze the performance of redundancy in a multi-type job and multi-type
server system. We assume the job dispatcher is unaware of the servers'
capacities, and we set out to study under which circumstances redundancy
improves the performance. With redundancy an arriving job dispatches redundant
copies to all its compatible servers, and departs as soon as one of its copies
completes service. As a benchmark comparison, we take the non-redundant system
in which a job arrival is routed to only one randomly selected compatible
server. Service times are generally distributed and all copies of a job are
identical, i.e., have the same service requirement. In our first main result,
we characterize the sufficient and necessary stability conditions of the
redundancy system. This condition coincides with that of a system where each
job type only dispatches copies into its least-loaded servers, and those copies
need to be fully served. In our second result, we compare the stability regions
of the system under redundancy to that of no redundancy. We show that if the
server's capacities are sufficiently heterogeneous, the stability region under
redundancy can be much larger than that without redundancy. We apply the
general solution to particular classes of systems, including redundancy-d and
nested models, to derive simple conditions on the degree of heterogeneity
required for redundancy to improve the stability. As such, our result is the
first in showing that redundancy can improve the stability and hence
performance of a system when copies are non-i.i.d..

Title: Sealing Pointer-Based Optimizations Behind Pure Functions
Authors: Daniel Selsam, Simon Hudon and Leonardo de Moura
Categories: cs.PL
\\
  Functional programming languages are particularly well-suited for building
automated reasoning systems, since (among other reasons) a logical term is well
modeled by an inductive type, traversing a term can be implemented generically
as a higher-order combinator, and backtracking is dramatically simplified by
persistent datastructures. However, existing pure functional programming
languages all suffer a major limitation in these domains: traversing a term
requires time proportional to the tree size of the term as opposed to its graph
size. This limitation would be particularly devastating when building
automation for interactive theorem provers such as Lean and Coq, for which the
exponential blowup of term-tree sizes has proved to be both common and
difficult to prevent. All that is needed to recover the optimal scaling is the
ability to perform simple operations on the memory addresses of terms, and yet
allowing these operations to be used freely would clearly violate the basic
premise of referential transparency. We show how to use dependent types to seal
the necessary pointer-address manipulations behind pure functional interfaces
while requiring only a negligible amount of additional trust. We have
implemented our approach for the upcoming version (v4) of Lean, and our
approach could be adopted by other languages based on dependent type theory as
well.

Title: Decision-making for automated vehicles using a hierarchical
  behavior-based arbitration scheme
Authors: Piotr Franciszek Orzechowski, Christoph Burger and Martin Lauer
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Behavior planning and decision-making are some of the biggest challenges for
highly automated systems. A fully automated vehicle is confronted with numerous
tactical and strategical choices. Most state-of-the-art automated vehicle
platforms implement tactical and strategical behavior generation using finite
state machines. However, these usually result in poor explainability,
maintainability and scalability. Research in robotics has raised many
architectures to mitigate these problems, most interestingly behavior-based
systems and hybrid derivatives.
  Inspired by these approaches, we propose a hierarchical behavior-based
architecture for tactical and strategical behavior generation in automated
driving. It is a generalizing and scalable decision-making framework, utilizing
modular behavior components to compose more complex behaviors in a bottom-up
approach. The system is capable of combining a variety of scenario- and
methodology-specific solutions, like POMDPs, RRT* or learning-based behavior,
into one understandable and traceable architecture. We extend the hierarchical
behavior-based arbitration concept to address scenarios where multiple behavior
options are applicable but have no clear priority against each other. Then, we
formulate the behavior generation stack for automated driving in urban and
highway environments, incorporating parking and emergency behaviors as well.
Finally, we illustrate our design in an explanatory evaluation.

\\
  The intuitive collaboration of humans and intelligent robots (embodied AI) in
the real-world is an essential objective for many desirable applications of
robotics. Whilst there is much research regarding explicit communication, we
focus on how humans and robots interact implicitly, on motor adaptation level.
We present a real-world setup of a human-robot collaborative maze game,
designed to be non-trivial and only solvable through collaboration, by limiting
the actions to rotations of two orthogonal axes, and assigning each axes to one
player. This results in neither the human nor the agent being able to solve the
game on their own. We use a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm
for the robotic agent, and achieve results within 30 minutes of real-world
play, without any type of pre-training. We then use this system to perform
systematic experiments on human/agent behaviour and adaptation when co-learning
a policy for the collaborative game. We present results on how co-policy
learning occurs over time between the human and the robotic agent resulting in
each participant's agent serving as a representation of how they would play the
game. This allows us to relate a person's success when playing with different
agents than their own, by comparing the policy of the agent with that of their
own agent.

\\
  Energy-efficient mapless navigation is crucial for mobile robots as they
explore unknown environments with limited on-board resources. Although the
recent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have been successfully
applied to navigation, their high energy consumption limits their use in many
robotic applications. Here, we propose a neuromorphic approach that combines
the energy-efficiency of spiking neural networks with the optimality of DRL to
learn control policies for mapless navigation. Our hybrid framework, Spiking
deep deterministic policy gradient (SDDPG), consists of a spiking actor network
(SAN) and a deep critic network, where the two networks were trained jointly
using gradient descent. The trained SAN was deployed on Intel's Loihi
neuromorphic processor. The co-learning enabled synergistic information
exchange between the two networks, allowing them to overcome each other's
limitations through a shared representation learning. When validated on both
simulated and real-world complex environments, our method on Loihi not only
consumed 75 times less energy per inference as compared to DDPG on Jetson TX2,
but also had a higher rate of successfully navigating to the goal which ranged
by 1\% to 4.2\%, depending on the forward-propagation timestep size. These
results reinforce our ongoing effort to design brain-inspired algorithms for

Title: Adversarial Generation of Informative Trajectories for Dynamics System
  Identification
Authors: Marija Jegorova, Joshua Smith, Michael Mistry, Timothy Hospedales
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to iROS2020
\\
  Dynamic System Identification approaches usually heavily rely on the
evolutionary and gradient-based optimisation techniques to produce optimal
excitation trajectories for determining the physical parameters of robot
platforms. Current optimisation techniques tend to generate single
trajectories. This is expensive, and intractable for longer trajectories, thus
limiting their efficacy for system identification. We propose to tackle this
issue by using multiple shorter cyclic trajectories, which can be generated in
parallel, and subsequently combined together to achieve the same effect as a
longer trajectory. Crucially, we show how to scale this approach even further
by increasing the generation speed and quality of the dataset through the use
of generative adversarial network (GAN) based architectures to produce a large
databases of valid and diverse excitation trajectories. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first robotics work to explore system identification
with multiple cyclic trajectories and to develop GAN-based techniques for
scaleably producing excitation trajectories that are diverse in both control
parameter and inertial parameter spaces. We show that our approach dramatically
accelerates trajectory optimisation, while simultaneously providing more
accurate system identification than the conventional approach.

Title: Learning to Collide: An Adaptive Safety-Critical Scenarios Generating
  Method
Authors: Wenhao Ding, Minjun Xu, Ding Zhao
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Submitted to IROS 2020
\\
  Long-tail and rare event problems become crucial when autonomous driving
algorithms are applied in the real world. For the purpose of evaluating systems
in challenging settings, we propose a generative framework to create
safety-critical scenarios for evaluating specific task algorithms. We first
represent the traffic scenarios with a series of autoregressive building blocks
and generate diverse scenarios by sampling from the joint distribution of these
blocks. We then train the generative model as an agent (or a generator) to
investigate the risky distribution parameters for a given driving algorithm
being evaluated. We regard the task algorithm as an environment (or a
discriminator) that returns a reward to the agent when a risky scenario is
generated. Through the experiments conducted on several scenarios in the
simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed framework generates
safety-critical scenarios more efficiently than grid search or human design
methods. Another advantage of this method is its adaptiveness to the routes and
parameters.

Title: Extrinsic Calibration of a 3D-LIDAR and a Camera
Authors: Subodh Mishra, Gaurav Pandey, Srikanth Saripalli
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  This work presents an extrinsic parameter estimation algorithm between a 3D
LIDAR and a Projective Camera using a marker-less planar target, by exploiting
Planar Surface Point to Plane and Planar Edge Point to back-projected Plane
geometric constraints. The proposed method uses the data collected by placing
the planar board at different poses in the common field of view of the LIDAR
and the Camera. The steps include, detection of the target and the edges of the
target in LIDAR and Camera frames, matching the detected planes and lines
across both the sensing modalities and finally solving a cost function formed
by the aforementioned geometric constraints that link the features detected in
both the LIDAR and the Camera using non-linear least squares. We have
extensively validated our algorithm using two Basler Cameras, Velodyne VLP-32
and Ouster OS1 LIDARs.

Title: The Use of Implicit Human Motor Behaviour in the Online Personalisation
  of Prosthetic Interfaces
Authors: Ricardo Garcia-Rosas, Tianshi Yu, Denny Oetomo, Chris Manzie, Ying
  Tan, and Peter Choong
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  In previous work, the authors proposed a data-driven optimisation algorithm
for the personalisation of human-prosthetic interfaces, demonstrating the
possibility of adapting prosthesis behaviour to its user while the user
performs tasks with it. This method requires that the human and the prosthesis
personalisation algorithm have same pre-defined objective function. This was
previously ensured by providing the human with explicit feedback on what the
objective function is. However, constantly displaying this information to the
prosthesis user is impractical. Moreover, the method utilised task information
in the objective function which may not be available from the wearable sensors
typically used in prosthetic applications. In this work, the previous approach
is extended to use a prosthesis objective function based on implicit human
motor behaviour, which represents able-bodied human motor control and is
measureable using wearable sensors. The approach is tested in a hardware
implementation of the personalisation algorithm on a prosthetic elbow, where
the prosthetic objective function is a function of upper-body compensation, and
is measured using wearable IMUs. Experimental results on able-bodied subjects
using a supernumerary prosthetic elbow mounted on an elbow orthosis suggest
that it is possible to use a prosthesis objective function which is implicit in
human behaviour to achieve collaboration without providing explicit feedback to
the human, motivating further studies.

Title: Robot Mindreading and the Problem of Trust
Authors: Andr\'es P\'aez
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CY cs.HC
Comments: 2020 Convention of the Society for the Study of Artificial
  Intelligence and Simulation of Behavior
\\
  This paper raises three questions regarding the attribution of beliefs,
desires, and intentions to robots. The first one is whether humans in fact
engage in robot mindreading. If they do, this raises a second question: does
robot mindreading foster trust towards robots? Both of these questions are
empirical, and I show that the available evidence is insufficient to answer
them. Now, if we assume that the answer to both questions is affirmative, a
third and more important question arises: should developers and engineers
promote robot mindreading in view of their stated goal of enhancing
transparency? My worry here is that by attempting to make robots more
mind-readable, they are abandoning the project of understanding automatic
decision processes. Features that enhance mind-readability are prone to make
the factors that determine automatic decisions even more opaque than they
already are. And current strategies to eliminate opacity do not enhance
mind-readability. The last part of the paper discusses different ways to
analyze this apparent trade-off and suggests that a possible solution must
adopt tolerable degrees of opacity that depend on pragmatic factors connected
to the level of trust required for the intended uses of the robot.

\\
  Learning adaptable policies is crucial for robots to operate autonomously in
our complex and quickly changing world. In this work, we present a new
meta-learning method that allows robots to quickly adapt to changes in
dynamics. In contrast to gradient-based meta-learning algorithms that rely on
second-order gradient estimation, we introduce a more noise-tolerant Batch
Hill-Climbing adaptation operator and combine it with meta-learning based on
evolutionary strategies. Our method significantly improves adaptation to
changes in dynamics in high noise settings, which are common in robotics
applications. We validate our approach on a quadruped robot that learns to walk
while subject to changes in dynamics. We observe that our method significantly
outperforms prior gradient-based approaches, enabling the robot to adapt its
policy to changes based on less than 3 minutes of real data.

Title: Rectangular Pyramid Partitioning using Integrated Depth Sensors

Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) with the
  International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems 2020 (IROS) option
\\
  We present a novel multicopter trajectory planning algorithm (RAPPIDS) that
is capable of quickly finding local collision-free trajectories given a single
depth image from an onboard camera. The algorithm leverages a new pyramid-based
spatial partitioning method that enables rapid collision detection between
candidate trajectories and the environment. Due to its efficiency, the
algorithm can be run at high rates on computationally constrained hardware,
evaluating thousands of candidate trajectories in milliseconds. The performance
of the algorithm is compared to existing collision checking methods in
simulation, showing our method to be capable of evaluating orders of magnitude
more trajectories per second. Experimental results are presented showing a
quadcopter quickly navigating a previously unseen cluttered environment by
running the algorithm on an ODROID-XU4 at 30 Hz.

Title: Closed-Loop Benchmarking of Stereo Visual-Inertial SLAM Systems:
  Understanding the Impact of Drift and Latency on Tracking Accuracy

\\
  Visual-inertial SLAM is essential for robot navigation in GPS-denied
environments, e.g. indoor, underground. Conventionally, the performance of
visual-inertial SLAM is evaluated with open-loop analysis, with a focus on the
drift level of SLAM systems. In this paper, we raise the question on the
importance of visual estimation latency in closed-loop navigation tasks, such
as accurate trajectory tracking. To understand the impact of both drift and
latency on visual-inertial SLAM systems, a closed-loop benchmarking simulation
is conducted, where a robot is commanded to follow a desired trajectory using
the feedback from visual-inertial estimation. By extensively evaluating the
trajectory tracking performance of representative state-of-the-art
visual-inertial SLAM systems, we reveal the importance of latency reduction in
visual estimation module of these systems. The findings suggest directions of
future improvements for visual-inertial SLAM.

Title: Traversing the Reality Gap via Simulator Tuning
Authors: Jack Collins, Ross Brown, Jurgen Leitner and David Howard
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8 Pages, Submitted to IROS2020
\\
  The large demand for simulated data has made the reality gap a problem on the
forefront of robotics. We propose a method to traverse the gap by tuning
available simulation parameters. Through the optimisation of physics engine
parameters, we show that we are able to narrow the gap between simulated
solutions and a real world dataset, and thus allow more ready transfer of
leaned behaviours between the two. We subsequently gain understanding as to the
importance of specific simulator parameters, which is of broad interest to the
robotic machine learning community. We find that even optimised for different
tasks that different physics engine perform better in certain scenarios and
that friction and maximum actuator velocity are tightly bounded parameters that
greatly impact the transference of simulated solutions.

  In this paper, we study a wheeled robot with a prismatic extension joint.
This allows the robot to build up momentum to perform jumps over obstacles and
to swing up to the upright position after the loss of balance. We propose a
template model for the class of such two-wheeled jumping robots. This model can
be considered as the simplest wheeled-legged system. We provide an analytical
derivation of the system dynamics which we use inside a model predictive
controller (MPC). We study the behavior of the model and demonstrate highly
dynamic motions such as swing-up and jumping. Furthermore, these motions are
discovered through optimization from first principles. We evaluate the
controller on a variety of tasks and uneven terrains in a simulator.

Title: Robust High-Transparency Haptic Exploration for Dexterous
  Telemanipulation
Authors: Keyhan Kouhkiloui Babarahmati, Carlo Tiseo, Quentin Rouxel, Zhibin Li,
  Michael Mistry
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Robot teleoperation has been proposed as a solution to perform complex tasks
in dangerous or remote environments. Teleoperation dexterity is not yet
sufficient to enable effective interaction control, even in short-range
operation, and low communication delays between the slave and the master. This
manuscript explores the development of a haptic teleoperation setup that relies
upon a recently proposed passive impedance controller, called Fractal Impedance
Controller (FIC). The controller has a state-dependent impedance which enables
to tune the slave task accuracy. The proposed controller has been compared with
a similar setup using a traditional impedance controller. The results show that
the proposed control architecture has higher transparency of interaction
compared to the impedance controller. A preliminary study on the ability of an
expert user to perform dexterous tasks has been conducted maintaining constant
controller parameters. The tasks included opening an electrical box, driving a
pile in the sand, pushing a ball on rough terrain, moving a sponge in an
obstacle course, and pushing an E-stop button. The results show that the
proposed method can complete all the task while the impedance controller on the
slave could not. Furthermore, the FIC enables a shorter completion time on the
tasks completed that have been also completed from the traditional impedance
controller (pushing a ball, moving the sponge, and pushing E-Stop).

Authors: Carlo Tiseo, Wolfgang Merkt, Keyhan Kouhkiloui Babarahmati, Wouter
  Wolfslag, Sethu Vijayakumar and Michael Mistry
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  The ability of animals to interact with complex dynamics is unmatched in
robots. Especially important to the interaction performances is the online
adaptation of body dynamics, which can be modeled as an impedance behaviour.
However, the variable impedance controller still possesses a challenge in the
current control frameworks due to the difficulties of retaining stability when
adapting the controller gains. The fractal impedance controller has been
recently proposed to solve this issue. However, it still has limitations such
as sudden jumps in force when it starts to converge to the desired position and
the lack of a force feedback loop. In this manuscript, two improvements are
made to the control framework to solve these limitations. The force
discontinuity has been addressed introducing a modulation of the impedance via
a virtual antagonist that modulates the output force. The force tracking has
been modeled after the parallel force/position controller architecture. In
contrast to traditional methods, the fractal impedance controller enables the
implementation of a search algorithm on the force feedback to adapt its
behaviour on the external environment instead of on relying on \textit{a
priori} knowledge of the external dynamics. Preliminary simulation results
presented in this paper show the feasibility of the proposed approach, and it
allows to evaluate the trade-off that needs to be made when relying on the
proposed controller for interaction. In conclusion, the proposed method mimics
the behaviour of an agonist/antagonist system adapting to unknown external
dynamics, and it may find application in computational neuroscience, haptics,
and interaction control.

Title: Robust tightly-coupled pose estimation based on monocular vision,
  inertia and wheel speed
Authors: Peng Gang, Lu Zezao, Chen Bocheng, Chen Shanliang, He Dingxin
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  The Visual SLAM method is widely used in self localization and mapping in
complex environments. Visual-Inertia SLAM which combines camera with IMU can
significantly improve the robustness and make scale week-visible while
Monocular Visual SLAM is scale-invisible. For the ground mobile robot, the
introduction of the wheel speed sensor can solve the scale weak-visible problem
and improve the robustness under abnormal conditions. In this thesis, a
multi-sensor fusion SLAM algorithm using monocular vision, inertial and wheel
speed measurement is proposed. The sensor measurements are combined in a
tightly-coupled manner, and the nonlinear optimization method is used to
maximize the posterior probability to solve the optimal state estimation. Loop
detection and back-end optimization are added to help reduce or even eliminate
the cumulative error of estimated poses, ensuring global consistency of
trajectory and map. The main research results include: wheel odometer
pre-integration algorithm which combines chassis speed and IMU angular speed
can avoid repeated integration caused by linearization point changes during
iterative optimization; the state initialization based on the wheel odometer
and IMU makes it possible to quickly and reliably calculate the initial state
values required by the state estimator in both stationary and moving states.
Comparative experiments were carried out in room scale scenes, building scale
scenes, and visual loss. The results show that proposed algorithm has high
accuracy, 2.2 m of cumulative error after the motion of 812 meters (0.28%,
loopback optimization disabled); strong robustness, effectively localization
even in the case of sensor loss such as visual loss, etc. Accuracy and
robustness of proposed method are superior to Monocular Visual Inertia SLAM and
traditional wheel odometer.

  Virtual Reality (VR) is rapidly increasing in popularity as a teaching tool.
It allows for the creation of a highly immersive, three-dimensional virtual
environment intended to simulate real-life environments. With more robots
saturating the industry - from manufacturing to healthcare, there is a need to
train end-users on how to set up, operate, tear down, and troubleshoot the
robot. Even though VR has become widely used in training surgeons on the
psychomotor skills associated with operating the robot, little research has
been done to see how the benefits of VR could translate to teaching the bedside
staff, tasked with supporting the robot during the full end-to-end surgical
procedure. We trained 30 participants on how to set up a robotic arm in an
environment mimicking clinical setup. We divided these participants equally
into 3 groups with one group trained with paper-based instructions, one with
video-based instructions and one with VR-based instructions. We then compared
and contrasted these three different training methods. VR and paper-based were
highly favored training mediums over video-based. VR-trained participants
achieved slightly higher fidelity of individual robotic joint angles,
suggesting better comprehension of the spatial awareness skills necessary to
achieve desired arm positioning. In addition, VR resulted in higher
reproducibility of setup fidelity and more consistency in user confidence
levels as compared to paper and video-based training.

  Despite their abundance in robotics and nature, underactuated systems remain
a challenge for control engineering. Trajectory optimization provides a
generally applicable solution, however its efficiency strongly depends on the
skill of the engineer to frame the problem in an optimizer-friendly way. This
paper proposes a procedure that automates such problem reformulation for a
class of tasks in which the desired trajectory is specified by a sequence of
waypoints. The approach is based on introducing auxiliary optimization
variables that represent waypoint activations. To validate the proposed method,
a letter drawing task is set up where shapes traced by the tip of a rotary
inverted pendulum are visualized using long exposure photography.

  Chinese calligraphy is a unique art form with great artistic value but

problem as a trajectory optimization problem, and propose an improved virtual
brush model for simulating the real writing process. Our approach is inspired
by pseudospectral optimal control in that we parameterize the actuator
trajectory for each stroke as a Chebyshev polynomial. The proposed dynamic
virtual brush model plays a key role in formulating the objective function to
be optimized. Our approach shows excellent performance in drawing aesthetically
pleasing characters, and does so much more efficiently than previous work,
opening up the possibility to achieve real-time closed-loop control.

  The engineering design of robotic grippers presents an ample design space for
optimization towards robust grasping. In this paper, we adopt the
reconfigurable design of the robotic gripper using a novel soft finger
structure with omni-directional adaptation, which generates a large number of
possible gripper configurations by rearranging these fingers. Such
reconfigurable design with these omni-adaptive fingers enables us to
systematically investigate the optimal arrangement of the fingers towards
robust grasping. Furthermore, we adopt a learning-based method as the baseline
to benchmark the effectiveness of each design configuration. As a result, we
found that a 3-finger and 4-finger radial configuration is the most effective
one achieving an average 96\% grasp success rate on seen and novel objects
selected from the YCB dataset. We also discussed the influence of the
frictional surface on the finger to improve the grasp robustness.

to superior adaptation when interacting with the unstructured physical
environment. In this paper, we present an embedded sensing solution using
optical fibers for an omni-adaptive soft robotic finger with exceptional
adaptation in all directions. In particular, we managed to insert a pair of
optical fibers inside the finger's structural cavity without interfering with
its adaptive performance. The resultant integration is scalable as a versatile,
low-cost, and moisture-proof solution for physically safe human-robot
interaction. In addition, we experimented with our finger design for an object
sorting task and identified sectional diameters of 94\% objects within the
$\pm$6mm error and measured 80\% of the structural strains within $\pm$0.1mm/mm
error. The proposed sensor design opens many doors in future applications of
soft robotics for scalable and adaptive physical interactions in the
unstructured environment.

Title: Rigid-Soft Interactive Learning for Robust Grasping

\\
  Inspired by widely used soft fingers on grasping, we propose a method of
rigid-soft interactive learning, aiming at reducing the time of data
collection. In this paper, we classify the interaction categories into
Rigid-Rigid, Rigid-Soft, Soft-Rigid according to the interaction surface
between grippers and target objects. We find experimental evidence that the
interaction types between grippers and target objects play an essential role in
the learning methods. We use soft, stuffed toys for training, instead of
everyday objects, to reduce the integration complexity and computational burden
and exploit such rigid-soft interaction by changing the gripper fingers to the
soft ones when dealing with rigid, daily-life items such as the
Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) objects. With a small data collection of 5K picking
attempts in total, our results suggest that such Rigid-Soft and Soft-Rigid
interactions are transferable. Moreover, the combination of different grasp
types shows better performance on the grasping test. We achieve the best
grasping performance at 97.5\% for easy YCB objects and 81.3\% for difficult
YCB objects while using a precise grasp with a two-soft-finger gripper to
collect training data and power grasp with a four-soft-finger gripper to test.

Title: Robotic Grasping through Combined image-Based Grasp Proposal and 3D
  Reconstruction
Authors: Tarik Tosun, Daniel Yang, Ben Eisner, Volkan Isler, and Daniel Lee
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures
\\
  We present a novel approach to robotic grasp planning using both a learned
grasp proposal network and a learned 3D shape reconstruction network. Our
system generates 6-DOF grasps from a single RGB-D image of the target object,
which is provided as input to both networks. By using the geometric
reconstruction to refine the the candidate grasp produced by the grasp proposal
network, our system is able to accurately grasp both known and unknown objects,
even when the grasp location on the object is not visible in the input image.
  This paper presents the network architectures, training procedures, and grasp
refinement method that comprise our system. Hardware experiments demonstrate
the efficacy of our system at grasping both known and unknown objects (91%
success rate). We additionally perform ablation studies that show the benefits
of combining a learned grasp proposal with geometric reconstruction for
grasping, and also show that our system outperforms several baselines in a
grasping task.

Title: Which Pull Requests Get Accepted and Why? A study of popular NPM
  Packages
Authors: Tapajit Dey, Audris Mockus
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Background: Pull Request (PR) Integrators often face challenges in terms of
multiple concurrent PRs, so the ability to gauge which of the PRs will get
accepted can help them balance their workload. PR creators would benefit from
knowing if certain characteristics of their PRs may increase the chances of
acceptance. Aim: We modeled the probability that a PR will be accepted within a
month after creation using a Random Forest model utilizing 50 predictors
representing properties of the author, PR, and the project to which PR is
submitted. Method: 483,988 PRs from 4218 popular NPM packages were analysed and
we selected a subset of 14 predictors sufficient for a tuned Random Forest
model to reach high accuracy. Result: An AUC-ROC value of 0.95 was achieved
predicting PR acceptance. The model excluding PR properties that change after
submission gave an AUC-ROC value of 0.89. We tested the utility of our model in
practical scenarios by training it with historical data for the NPM package
\textit{bootstrap} and predicting if the PRs submitted in future will be
accepted. This gave us an AUC-ROC value of 0.94 with all 14 predictors, and
0.77 excluding PR properties that change after its creation. Conclusion: PR
integrators can use our model for a highly accurate assessment of the quality
of the open PRs and PR creators may benefit from the model by understanding
which characteristics of their PRs may be undesirable from the integrators'
perspective. The model can be implemented as a tool, which we plan to do as a
future work.

Title: Towards Probability-based Safety Verification of Systems with Components
  from Machine Learning
Authors: Hermann Kaindl and Stefan Kramer
Categories: cs.SE cs.LG
Comments: First version for public access
\\
  Machine learning (ML) has recently created many new success stories. Hence,
there is a strong motivation to use ML technology in software-intensive
systems, including safety-critical systems. This raises the issue of safety
verification of ML-based systems, which is currently thought to be infeasible
or, at least, very hard. We think that it requires taking into account specific
properties of ML technology such as: (i) Most ML approaches are inductive,
which is both their power and their source of failure. (ii) Neural networks
(NN) resulting from deep learning are at the current state of the art not
transparent. Consequently, there will always be errors remaining and, at least
for deep NNs (DNNs), verification of their internal structure is extremely
hard. However, also traditional safety engineering cannot provide full
guarantees that no harm will ever occur. That is why probabilities are used,
e.g., for specifying a Risk or a Tolerable Hazard Rate (THR). Recent
theoretical work has extended the scope of formal verification to probabilistic
model-checking, but this requires behavioral models. Hence, we propose
verification based on probabilities of errors both estimated for by controlled
experiments and output by the inductively learned classifier itself.
Generalization error bounds may propagate to the probabilities of a hazard,
which must not exceed a THR. As a result, the quantitatively determined bound
on the probability of a classification error of an ML component in a
safety-critical system contributes in a well-defined way to the latter's
overall safety verification.

Title: Assessing Software Defection Prediction Performance: Why Using the
  Matthews Correlation Coefficient Matters
Authors: Jingxiu Yao and Martin Shepperd
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: EASE 2020, April 15--17, 2020, Trondheim, Norway
DOI: 10.1145/3383219.3383232
\\
  Context: There is considerable diversity in the range and design of
computational experiments to assess classifiers for software defect prediction.
This is particularly so, regarding the choice of classifier performance
metrics. Unfortunately some widely used metrics are known to be biased, in
particular F1. Objective: We want to understand the extent to which the
widespread use of the F1 renders empirical results in software defect
prediction unreliable. Method: We searched for defect prediction studies that
report both F1 and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). This enabled us
to determine the proportion of results that are consistent between both metrics
and the proportion that change. Results: Our systematic review identifies 8
studies comprising 4017 pairwise results. Of these results, the direction of
the comparison changes in 23% of the cases when the unbiased MCC metric is
employed. Conclusion: We find compelling reasons why the choice of
classification performance metric matters, specifically the biased and
misleading F1 metric should be deprecated.

  Fuzzy Graphs

\\
  Software requirement selection is to find an optimal set of requirements that
gives the highest value for a release of software while keeping the cost within
the budget. However, value-related dependencies among software requirements may
impact the value of an optimal set. Moreover, value-related dependencies can be
of varying strengths. Hence, it is important to consider both the existence and
the strengths of value-related dependencies during a requirement selection. The
existing selection models however, either assume that software requirements are
independent or they ignore strengths of requirement dependencies. This paper
presents a cost-value optimization model that considers the impacts of
value-related requirement dependencies on the value of selected requirements
(optimal set). We have exploited algebraic structure of fuzzy graphs for
modeling value-related requirement dependencies and their strengths. Validity
and practicality of the work are verified through carrying out several
simulations and studying a real world software project.

Title: Exploring the Efficacy of Transfer Learning in Mining Image-Based
  Software Artifacts
Authors: Natalie Best, Jordan Ott, Erik Linstead
Categories: cs.SE cs.LG
\\
  Transfer learning allows us to train deep architectures requiring a large
number of learned parameters, even if the amount of available data is limited,
by leveraging existing models previously trained for another task. Here we
explore the applicability of transfer learning utilizing models pre-trained on
non-software engineering data applied to the problem of classifying software
UML diagrams. Our experimental results show training reacts positively to
transfer learning as related to sample size, even though the pre-trained model
was not exposed to training instances from the software domain. We contrast the
transferred network with other networks to show its advantage on different
sized training sets, which indicates that transfer learning is equally
effective to custom deep architectures when large amounts of training data is
not available.

Title: A Semi-supervised Graph Attentive Network for Financial Fraud Detection

\\
  With the rapid growth of financial services, fraud detection has been a very
important problem to guarantee a healthy environment for both users and
providers. Conventional solutions for fraud detection mainly use some
rule-based methods or distract some features manually to perform prediction.
However, in financial services, users have rich interactions and they
themselves always show multifaceted information. These data form a large
multiview network, which is not fully exploited by conventional methods.
Additionally, among the network, only very few of the users are labelled, which
also poses a great challenge for only utilizing labeled data to achieve a
satisfied performance on fraud detection.
  To address the problem, we expand the labeled data through their social
relations to get the unlabeled data and propose a semi-supervised attentive
graph neural network, namedSemiGNN to utilize the multi-view labeled and
unlabeled data for fraud detection. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical
attention mechanism to better correlate different neighbors and different
views. Simultaneously, the attention mechanism can make the model interpretable
and tell what are the important factors for the fraud and why the users are
predicted as fraud. Experimentally, we conduct the prediction task on the users
of Alipay, one of the largest third-party online and offline cashless payment
platform serving more than 4 hundreds of million users in China. By utilizing
the social relations and the user attributes, our method can achieve a better
accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods on two tasks. Moreover, the
interpretable results also give interesting intuitions regarding the tasks.

Title: Just SLaQ When You Approximate: Accurate Spectral Distances for
  Web-Scale Graphs
Authors: Anton Tsitsulin, Marina Munkhoeva, Bryan Perozzi

\\
  Graph comparison is a fundamental operation in data mining and information
retrieval. Due to the combinatorial nature of graphs, it is hard to balance the
expressiveness of the similarity measure and its scalability. Spectral analysis
provides quintessential tools for studying the multi-scale structure of graphs
and is a well-suited foundation for reasoning about differences between graphs.
However, computing full spectrum of large graphs is computationally
prohibitive; thus, spectral graph comparison methods often rely on rough
approximation techniques with weak error guarantees. In this work, we propose
SLaQ, an efficient and effective approximation technique for computing spectral
distances between graphs with billions of nodes and edges. We derive the
corresponding error bounds and demonstrate that accurate computation is
possible in time linear in the number of graph edges. In a thorough
experimental evaluation, we show that SLaQ outperforms existing methods,
oftentimes by several orders of magnitude in approximation accuracy, and
maintains comparable performance, allowing to compare million-scale graphs in a
matter of minutes on a single machine.

Title: Learn to Generate Time Series Conditioned Graphs with Generative
  Adversarial Nets
Authors: Shanchao Yang, Jing Liu, Kai Wu and Mingming Li
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  Deep learning based approaches have been utilized to model and generate
graphs subjected to different distributions recently. However, they are
typically unsupervised learning based and unconditioned generative models or
simply conditioned on the graph-level contexts, which are not associated with
rich semantic node-level contexts. Differently, in this paper, we are
interested in a novel problem named Time Series Conditioned Graph Generation:
given an input multivariate time series, we aim to infer a target relation
graph modeling the underlying interrelationships between time series with each
node corresponding to each time series. For example, we can study the
interrelationships between genes in a gene regulatory network of a certain
disease conditioned on their gene expression data recorded as time series. To
achieve this, we propose a novel Time Series conditioned Graph
Generation-Generative Adversarial Networks (TSGG-GAN) to handle challenges of
rich node-level context structures conditioning and measuring similarities
directly between graphs and time series. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-word gene regulatory networks datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed TSGG-GAN.

\\
  Mobile payment such as Alipay has been widely used in our daily lives. To
further promote the mobile payment activities, it is important to run marketing
campaigns under a limited budget by providing incentives such as coupons,
commissions to merchants. As a result, incentive optimization is the key to
maximizing the commercial objective of the marketing campaign. With the
analyses of online experiments, we found that the transaction network can
subtly describe the similarity of merchants' responses to different incentives,
which is of great use in the incentive optimization problem. In this paper, we
present a graph representation learning method atop of transaction networks for
merchant incentive optimization in mobile payment marketing. With limited
samples collected from online experiments, our end-to-end method first learns
merchant representations based on an attributed transaction networks, then
effectively models the correlations between the commercial objectives each
merchant may achieve and the incentives under varying treatments. Thus we are
able to model the sensitivity to incentive for each merchant, and spend the
most budgets on those merchants that show strong sensitivities in the marketing
campaign. Extensive offline and online experimental results at Alipay
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Title: Player Chemistry: Striving for a Perfectly Balanced Soccer Team
Authors: Lotte Bransen, Jan Van Haaren
Categories: cs.SI stat.AP
\\
  Soccer scouts typically ignore the team balance and team chemistry when
evaluating potential signings for their teams. Instead, they focus on the
individual qualities of the players in isolation. To overcome this limitation
of their recruitment process, this paper takes a first step towards objectively
providing insight into the question: How well does a team of soccer players
gel? We address that question in both an observational and a predictive
setting. In the former setting, we observe the chemistry between players who
have actually played together, which is relevant when selecting the best
possible line-up for a match. In the latter setting, we predict the chemistry
between players who have never played together before, which is particularly
relevant to assess the fit of a potential signing with the players who are
already on the team.
  We introduce two chemistry metrics that measure the offensive and defensive
chemistry for a pair of players, respectively. The offensive chemistry metric
measures the pair's joint performance in terms of scoring goals, whereas the
defensive chemistry metric measures their joint performance in preventing their
opponents from scoring goals. We compute our metrics for 361 seasons in 106
different competitions and present a number of concrete use cases. For
instance, we show that the partnership between Mohamed Salah and Roberto
Firmino in Liverpool's 2017/2018 Champions League campaign exhibited the
highest mutual chemistry between two players. Furthermore, we show that Mesut
\"Ozil's chemistry has rapidly started declining following Alexis S\'anchez'
departure to Manchester United in 2018.

Adjustable Boundary Condition LMPC (ABC-LMPC), which enables rapid adaptation

Comments: to be published in European Control Conference 2020 proceedings
\\
  An optimization-based method for improving the productivity of precision
machine tools is proposed, where the reference path is computed in local
coordinates, and information about the machine tool performance is learned from
experimental data. The optimization yields a modified reference that is tracked
by the existing low-level controller. The method is tested in simulation for a
biaxial positioning system. The positioning system is modelled as double
integrator, and the controller characteristic is modelled from experimental
data using a least-squares fit. Simulation results show that the method is
effective in designing optimal references even for challenging geometries such
as sharp corners. The application of this procedure allows the retrofit of the
control of existing machines with minimal overhead, by providing a modified
reference file to track.

Title: Robust PSSE Using Graph Neural Networks for Data-driven and
  Topology-aware Priors
Authors: Qiuling Yang, Alireza Sadeghi, Gang Wang, Georgios B. Giannakis, and
  Jian Sun
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY eess.SP
\\
  Distributed renewable generation, elastic loads, and purposeful manipulation
of meter readings challenge the monitoring and control of today's power systems
(PS). In this context, to maintain a comprehensive view of the system in real
time, fast and robust state estimation (SE) methods are urgently needed.
Conventional PSSE solvers typically entail minimizing a nonlinear and nonconvex
least-squares by e.g., the workhorse Gauss-Newton method. Those iterative
solvers however, are sensitive to initialization and may get stuck in local
minima. To overcome these hurdles and inspired by recent image denoising
techniques, this paper advocates a learnable regularization term for PSSE that
uses a deep neural network (DNN) prior. For the resultant regularized PSSE
problem, a "Gauss-Newton-like" alternating minimization solver is first
developed. To accommodate real-time monitoring, a novel end-to-end DNN is
constructed by unrolling the proposed alternating minimization solver.
Interestingly, the power network topology can be easily incorporated into the
DNN by designing a graph neural network (GNN) based prior. To further endow the
physics-based DNN with robustness against bad data, an adversarial DNN training
method is discussed. Numerical tests using real load data on the IEEE $118$-bus

Title: Remarks on H-infinity Controller Design for SISO Plants with Time Delays
Authors: Suat Gumussoy, Hitay Ozbay
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Journal-ref: 5th IFAC Symposium on Robust Control Design, 2006
DOI: 10.3182/20060705-3-FR-2907.00110
\\
  The skew Toeplitz approach is one of the well developed methods to design
H-infinity controllers for infinite dimensional systems. In order to be able to
use this method the plant needs to be factorized in some special manner. This
paper investigates the largest class of SISO time delay systems for which the
special factorizations required by the skew Toeplitz approach can be done.
Reliable implementation of the optimal controller is also discussed. It is
shown that the finite impulse response (FIR) block structure appears in these
controllers not only for plants with I/O delays, but also for general
time-delay plants.

Title: A Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian Method for Topology Optimization
Authors: Yue Li, Xuan Li, Minchen Li, Yixin Zhu, Bo Zhu, Chenfanfu Jiang
Categories: physics.comp-ph cs.CE cs.GR
\\
  We propose LETO, a new hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian method for topology
optimization. At the heart of LETO lies in a hybrid particle-grid Material
Point Method (MPM) to solve for elastic force equilibrium. LETO transfers
density information from freely movable Lagrangian carrier particles to a fixed
set of Eulerian quadrature points. The quadrature points act as MPM particles
embedded in a lower-resolution grid and enable sub-cell resolution of intricate
structures with a reduced computational cost. By treating both densities and
positions of the carrier particles as optimization variables, LETO
reparameterizes the Eulerian solution space of topology optimization in a
Lagrangian view. LETO also unifies the treatment for both linear and non-linear
elastic materials. In the non-linear deformation regime, the resulting scheme
naturally permits large deformation and buckling behaviors. Additionally, LETO
explores contact-awareness during optimization by incorporating a fictitious
domain-based contact model into the static equilibrium solver, resulting in the
discovery of novel structures. We conduct an extensive set of experiments. By
comparing against a representative Eulerian scheme, LETO's objective achieves
an average quantitative improvement of 20% (up to 40%) in 3D and 2% in 2D (up
to 12%). Qualitatively, LETO also discovers novel non-linear functional
structures and conducts self-contact-aware structural explorations.

Title: New production matrices for geometric graphs
Authors: Guillermo Esteban, Clemens Huemer, Rodrigo I. Silveira
Categories: math.CO cs.CG
\\
  We use production matrices to count several classes of geometric graphs. We
present novel production matrices for non-crossing partitions, connected
geometric graphs, and k-angulations, which provide another way of counting the
number of such objects. Counting geometric graphs is then equivalent to
calculating the powers of a production matrix. Applying the technique of
Riordan Arrays to these production matrices, we establish new formulas for the
numbers of geometric graphs as well as combinatorial identities derived from
the production matrices. Further, we obtain the characteristic polynomial and
the eigenvectors of such production matrices.

Title: A Deep learning Approach to Generate Contrast-Enhanced Computerised
  Tomography Angiography without the Use of Intravenous Contrast Agents

\\
  Contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiograms (CTAs) are widely used in
cardiovascular imaging to obtain a non-invasive view of arterial structures.
However, contrast agents are associated with complications at the injection
site as well as renal toxicity leading to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)
and renal failure. We hypothesised that the raw data acquired from a
non-contrast CT contains sufficient information to differentiate blood and
other soft tissue components. We utilised deep learning methods to define the
subtleties between soft tissue components in order to simulate contrast
enhanced CTAs without contrast agents. Twenty-six patients with paired
non-contrast and CTA images were randomly selected from an approved clinical
study. Non-contrast axial slices within the AAA from 10 patients (n = 100) were
sampled for the underlying Hounsfield unit (HU) distribution at the lumen,
intra-luminal thrombus and interface locations. Sampling of HUs in these
regions revealed significant differences between all regions (p<0.001 for all
comparisons), confirming the intrinsic differences in the radiomic signatures
between these regions. To generate a large training dataset, paired axial
slices from the training set (n=13) were augmented to produce a total of 23,551
2-D images. We trained a 2-D Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (cycleGAN)
for this non-contrast to contrast (NC2C) transformation task. The accuracy of
the cycleGAN output was assessed by comparison to the contrast image. This
pipeline is able to differentiate between visually incoherent soft tissue
regions in non-contrast CT images. The CTAs generated from the non-contrast
images bear strong resemblance to the ground truth. Here we describe a novel
application of Generative Adversarial Network for CT image processing. This is
poised to disrupt clinical pathways requiring contrast enhanced CT imaging.

Title: Visualizing intestines for diagnostic assistance of ileus based on

\\
  This paper presents a visualization method of intestine (the small and large
intestines) regions and their stenosed parts caused by ileus from CT volumes.
Since it is difficult for non-expert clinicians to find stenosed parts, the
intestine and its stenosed parts should be visualized intuitively. Furthermore,
the intestine regions of ileus cases are quite hard to be segmented. The
proposed method segments intestine regions by 3D FCN (3D U-Net). Intestine
regions are quite difficult to be segmented in ileus cases since the inside the
intestine is filled with fluids. These fluids have similar intensities with
intestinal wall on 3D CT volumes. We segment the intestine regions by using 3D
U-Net trained by a weak annotation approach. Weak-annotation makes possible to
train the 3D U-Net with small manually-traced label images of the intestine.
This avoids us to prepare many annotation labels of the intestine that has long
and winding shape. Each intestine segment is volume-rendered and colored based
on the distance from its endpoint in volume rendering. Stenosed parts (disjoint
points of an intestine segment) can be easily identified on such visualization.
In the experiments, we showed that stenosed parts were intuitively visualized
as endpoints of segmented regions, which are colored by red or blue.

Title: DDU-Nets: Distributed Dense Model for 3D MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation
Authors: Hanxiao Zhang, Jingxiong Li, Mali Shen, Yaqi Wang and Guang-Zhong Yang
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Segmentation of brain tumors and their subregions remains a challenging task
due to their weak features and deformable shapes. In this paper, three patterns
(cross-skip, skip-1 and skip-2) of distributed dense connections (DDCs) are
proposed to enhance feature reuse and propagation of CNNs by constructing
tunnels between key layers of the network. For better detecting and segmenting
brain tumors from multi-modal 3D MR images, CNN-based models embedded with DDCs
(DDU-Nets) are trained efficiently from pixel to pixel with a limited number of
parameters. Postprocessing is then applied to refine the segmentation results
by reducing the false-positive samples. The proposed method is evaluated on the
BraTS 2019 dataset with results demonstrating the effectiveness of the DDU-Nets
while requiring less computational cost.

\\
  In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized
medical image analysis. One of the most well-known CNN architectures in
semantic segmentation is the U-net, which has achieved much success in several
medical image segmentation applications. Also more recently, with the rise of
autoML ad advancements in neural architecture search (NAS), methods like
NAS-Unet have been proposed for NAS in medical image segmentation. In this
paper, with inspiration from LadderNet, U-Net, autoML and NAS, we propose an
ensemble deep neural network with an underlying U-Net framework consisting of
bi-directional convolutional LSTMs and dense connections, where the first (from
left) U-Net-like network is deeper than the second (from left). We show that
this ensemble network outperforms recent state-of-the-art networks in several
evaluation metrics, and also evaluate a lightweight version of this ensemble
network, which also outperforms recent state-of-the-art networks in some
evaluation metrics.

\\
  Optical artificial neural networks (ONNs), analog computing hardware tailored
for machine learning, have significant potential for ultra-high computing speed
and energy efficiency. We propose a new approach to architectures for ONNs
based on integrated Kerr micro-comb sources that is programmable, highly
scalable and capable of reaching ultra-high speeds. We experimentally
demonstrate the building block of the ONN, a single neuron perceptron, by
mapping synapses onto 49 wavelengths of a micro-comb to achieve a high
single-unit throughput of 11.9 Giga-FLOPS at 8 bits per FLOP, corresponding to
95.2 Gbps. We test the perceptron on simple standard benchmark datasets,
handwritten-digit recognition and cancer-cell detection, achieving over 90% and
85% accuracy, respectively. This performance is a direct result of the record
small wavelength spacing (49GHz) for a coherent integrated microcomb source,
which results in an unprecedented number of wavelengths for neuromorphic
optics. Finally, we propose an approach to scaling the perceptron to a deep
learning network using the same single micro-comb device and standard
off-the-shelf telecommunications technology, for high-throughput operation
involving full matrix multiplication for applications such as real-time massive
data processing for unmanned vehicle and aircraft tracking.

Title: End-to-End Fast Training of Communication Links Without a Channel Model
  via Online Meta-Learning
Authors: Sangwoo Park, Osvaldo Simeone, Joonhyuk Kang
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
\\
  When a channel model is not available, the end-to-end training of encoder and
decoder on a fading noisy channel generally requires the repeated use of the
channel and of a feedback link. An important limitation of the approach is that
training should be generally carried out from scratch for each new channel. To
cope with this problem, prior works considered joint training over multiple
channels with the aim of finding a single pair of encoder and decoder that
works well on a class of channels. In this paper, we propose to obviate the
limitations of joint training via meta-learning. The proposed approach is based
on a meta-training phase in which the online gradient-based meta-learning of
the decoder is coupled with the joint training of the encoder via the
transmission of pilots and the use of a feedback link. Accounting for channel
variations during the meta-training phase, this work demonstrates the
advantages of meta-learning in terms of number of pilots as compared to
conventional methods when the feedback link is only available for meta-training
and not at run time.

Title: Did Sequence Dependent Geometry Influence the Evolution of the Genetic
  Code?

DOI: 10.1090/conm/746/15001
\\
  The genetic code is the function from the set of codons to the set of amino
acids by which a DNA sequence encodes proteins. Since the codons also influence
the shape of the DNA molecule itself, the same sequence that encodes a protein
also has a separate geometric interpretation. A question then arises: How
well-duplexed are these two "codes"? In other words, in choosing a genetic
sequence to encode a particular protein, how much freedom does one still have
to vary the geometry (or vice versa). A recent paper by the first author
addressed this question using two different methods. After reviewing those
results, this paper addresses the same question with a third method: the use of
Monte Carlo and Gaussian sampling methods to approximate a multi-integral
representing the mutual information of a variety of possible genetic codes.
Once again, it is found that the genetic code used in nuclear DNA has a
slightly lower than average duplexing efficiency as compared with other
hypothetical genetic codes. A concluding section discusses the significance of
these surprising results.

Title: A Framework for Interdomain and Multioutput Gaussian Processes

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  One obstacle to the use of Gaussian processes (GPs) in large-scale problems,
and as a component in deep learning system, is the need for bespoke derivations
and implementations for small variations in the model or inference. In order to
improve the utility of GPs we need a modular system that allows rapid
implementation and testing, as seen in the neural network community. We present
a mathematical and software framework for scalable approximate inference in
GPs, which combines interdomain approximations and multiple outputs. Our
framework, implemented in GPflow, provides a unified interface for many
existing multioutput models, as well as more recent convolutional structures.
This simplifies the creation of deep models with GPs, and we hope that this
work will encourage more interest in this approach.

Title: A Functional EM Algorithm for Panel Count Data with Missing Counts

Categories: stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 18 pages
\\
  Panel count data is recurrent events data where counts of events are observed
at discrete time points. Panel counts naturally describe self-reported
behavioral data, and the occurrence of missing or unreliable reports is common.
Unfortunately, no prior work has tackled the problem of missingness in this
setting. We address this gap in the literature by developing a novel functional
EM algorithm that can be used as a wrapper around several popular panel count
mean function inference methods when some counts are missing. We provide a
novel theoretical analysis of our method showing strong consistency. Extending
the methods in (Balakrishnan et al., 2017, Wu et al. 2016), we show that the
functional EM algorithm recovers the true mean function of the counting
process. We accomplish this by developing alternative regularity conditions for
our objective function in order to show convergence of the population EM
algorithm. We prove strong consistency of the M-step, thus giving strong
consistency guarantees for the finite sample EM algorithm. We present
experimental results for synthetic data, synthetic missingness on real data,
and a smoking cessation study, where we find that participants may
underestimate cigarettes smoked by approximately 18.6% over a 12 day period.

  The Lipschitz constant of a neural network is a useful metric for provable

prove hardness and inapproximability results for computing the local Lipschitz
constant of ReLU neural networks. We develop a mixed-integer programming
formulation to exactly compute the local Lipschitz constant for scalar and
vector-valued networks. Finally, we apply our technique on networks trained on
synthetic datasets and MNIST, drawing observations about the tightness of
competing Lipschitz estimators and the effects of regularized training on
Lipschitz constants.

Title: Iterate Averaging Helps: An Alternative Perspective in Deep Learning
Authors: Diego Granziol, Xingchen Wan, Stephen Roberts
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures, 21 pages including references and appendix
\\
  Iterate averaging has a rich history in optimisation, but has only very
recently been popularised in deep learning. We investigate its effects in a
deep learning context, and argue that previous explanations on its efficacy,
which place a high importance on the local geometry (flatness vs sharpness) of
final solutions, are not necessarily relevant. We instead argue that the
robustness of iterate averaging towards the typically very high estimation
noise in deep learning and the various regularisation effects averaging exert,
are the key reasons for the performance gain, indeed this effect is made even
more prominent due to the over-parameterisation of modern networks. Inspired by
this, we propose Gadam, which combines Adam with iterate averaging to address
one of key problems of adaptive optimisers that they often generalise worse.
Without compromising adaptivity and with minimal additional computational
burden, we show that Gadam (and its variant GadamX) achieve a generalisation
performance that is consistently superior to tuned SGD and is even on par or
better compared to SGD with iterate averaging on various image classification
(CIFAR 10/100 and ImageNet 32$\times$32) and language tasks (PTB).

\\
  In spite of the accomplishments of deep learning based algorithms in numerous
applications and very broad corresponding research interest, at the moment
there is still no rigorous understanding of the reasons why such algorithms
produce useful results in certain situations. A thorough mathematical analysis
of deep learning based algorithms seems to be crucial in order to improve our
understanding and to make their implementation more effective and efficient. In
this article we provide a mathematically rigorous full error analysis of deep
learning based empirical risk minimisation with quadratic loss function in the
probabilistically strong sense, where the underlying deep neural networks are
trained using stochastic gradient descent with random initialisation. The
convergence speed we obtain is presumably far from optimal and suffers under
the curse of dimensionality. To the best of our knowledge, we establish,
however, the first full error analysis in the scientific literature for a deep
learning based algorithm in the probabilistically strong sense and, moreover,
the first full error analysis in the scientific literature for a deep learning
based algorithm where stochastic gradient descent with random initialisation is
the employed optimisation method.

Title: Few-Shot Relation Learning with Attention for EEG-based Motor Imagery
  Classification
Authors: Sion An, Soopil Kim, Philip Chikontwe and Sang Hyun Park
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
Comments: 6 pages. We submitted this paper as first submission on IROS2020
ACM-class: I.2.4
\\
  Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, in particular motor imagery (MI) data have received a lot of attention
and show the potential towards the design of key technologies both in
healthcare and other industries. MI data is generated when a subject imagines
movement of limbs and can be used to aid rehabilitation as well as in
autonomous driving scenarios. Thus, classification of MI signals is vital for
EEG-based BCI systems. Recently, MI EEG classification techniques using deep
learning have shown improved performance over conventional techniques. However,
due to inter-subject variability, the scarcity of unseen subject data, and low
signal-to-noise ratio, extracting robust features and improving accuracy is
still challenging. In this context, we propose a novel two-way few shot network
that is able to efficiently learn how to learn representative features of
unseen subject categories and how to classify them with limited MI EEG data.
The pipeline includes an embedding module that learns feature representations
from a set of samples, an attention mechanism for key signal feature discovery,
and a relation module for final classification based on relation scores between
a support set and a query signal. In addition to the unified learning of
feature similarity and a few shot classifier, our method leads to emphasize
informative features in support data relevant to the query data, which
generalizes better on unseen subjects. For evaluation, we used the BCI
competition IV 2b dataset and achieved an 9.3% accuracy improvement in the
20-shot classification task with state-of-the-art performance. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of employing attention and the overall
generality of our method.

Title: Distributed Cooperative Decision Making in Multi-agent Multi-armed
  Bandits
Authors: Peter Landgren, Vaibhav Srivastava, and Naomi Ehrich Leonard
Categories: math.OC cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We study a distributed decision-making problem in which multiple agents face
the same multi-armed bandit (MAB), and each agent makes sequential choices
among arms to maximize its own individual reward. The agents cooperate by
sharing their estimates over a fixed communication graph. We consider an
unconstrained reward model in which two or more agents can choose the same arm
and collect independent rewards. And we consider a constrained reward model in
which agents that choose the same arm at the same time receive no reward. We
design a dynamic, consensus-based, distributed estimation algorithm for
cooperative estimation of mean rewards at each arm. We leverage the estimates
from this algorithm to develop two distributed algorithms: coop-UCB2 and
coop-UCB2-selective-learning, for the unconstrained and constrained reward
models, respectively. We show that both algorithms achieve group performance
close to the performance of a centralized fusion center. Further, we
investigate the influence of the communication graph structure on performance.
We propose a novel graph explore-exploit index that predicts the relative
performance of groups in terms of the communication graph, and we propose a
novel nodal explore-exploit centrality index that predicts the relative
performance of agents in terms of the agent locations in the communication
graph.

Title: Nonlinear Functional Output Regression: a Dictionary Approach
Authors: Dimitri Bouche, Marianne Clausel, Fran\c{c}ois Roueff and Florence
  d'Alch\'e-Buc
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Many applications in signal processing involve data that consists in a high
number of simultaneous or sequential measurements of the same phenomenon. Such
data is inherently high dimensional, however it contains strong within
observation correlations and smoothness patterns which can be exploited in the
learning process. A relevant modelling is provided by functional data analysis.
We consider the setting of functional output regression. We introduce
Projection Learning, a novel dictionary-based approach that combines a
representation of the functional output on this dictionary with the
minimization of a functional loss. This general method is instantiated with
vector-valued kernels, allowing to impose some structure on the model. We prove
general theoretical results on projection learning, with in particular a bound
on the estimation error. From the practical point of view, experiments on
several data sets show the efficiency of the method. Notably, we provide
evidence that Projection Learning is competitive compared to other nonlinear
output functional regression methods and shows an interesting ability to deal
with sparsely observed functions with missing data.

Title: Towards Novel Insights in Lattice Field Theory with Explainable Machine
  Learning

\\
  Machine learning has the potential to aid our understanding of phase
structures in lattice quantum field theories through the statistical analysis
of Monte Carlo samples. Available algorithms, in particular those based on deep
learning, often demonstrate remarkable performance in the search for previously
unidentified features, but tend to lack transparency if applied naively. To
address these shortcomings, we propose representation learning in combination
with interpretability methods as a framework for the identification of
observables. More specifically, we investigate action parameter regression as a
pretext task while using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to identify the
most important observables depending on the location in the phase diagram. The
approach is put to work in the context of a scalar Yukawa model in (2+1)d.
First, we investigate a multilayer perceptron to determine an importance
hierarchy of several predefined, standard observables. The method is then
applied directly to the raw field configurations using a convolutional network,
demonstrating the ability to reconstruct all order parameters from the learned
filter weights. Based on our results, we argue that due to its broad
applicability, attribution methods such as LRP could prove a useful and
versatile tool in our search for new physical insights. In the case of the
Yukawa model, it facilitates the construction of an observable that
characterises the symmetric phase.

\\
  The neural plausibility of backpropagation has long been disputed, primarily
for its use of non-local weight transport - the biologically dubious
requirement that one neuron instantaneously measure the synaptic weights of
another. Until recently, attempts to create local learning rules that avoid
weight transport have typically failed in the large-scale learning scenarios
where backpropagation shines, e.g. ImageNet categorization with deep
convolutional networks. Here, we investigate a recently proposed local learning
rule that yields competitive performance with backpropagation and find that it
is highly sensitive to metaparameter choices, requiring laborious tuning that
does not transfer across network architecture. Our analysis indicates the
underlying mathematical reason for this instability, allowing us to identify a
more robust local learning rule that better transfers without metaparameter
tuning. Nonetheless, we find a performance and stability gap between this local
rule and backpropagation that widens with increasing model depth. We then
investigate several non-local learning rules that relax the need for
instantaneous weight transport into a more biologically-plausible "weight
estimation" process, showing that these rules match state-of-the-art
performance on deep networks and operate effectively in the presence of noisy
updates. Taken together, our results suggest two routes towards the discovery
of neural implementations for credit assignment without weight symmetry:
further improvement of local rules so that they perform consistently across
architectures and the identification of biological implementations for
non-local learning mechanisms.

\\
  Owing to small size, sensing capabilities and autonomous nature, the Unmanned
Air Vehicles (UAVs) have enormous applications in various areas, e.g., remote
sensing, navigation, archaeology, journalism, environmental science, and
agriculture. However, the unmonitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur
drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and
infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the
protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital
infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on
sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these
techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we
propose an efficient unsupervise machine learning approach of independent
component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of
bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario.
After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square
Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD
signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter
banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to detect the presence or
absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a
single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic
interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive
simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs
better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM.

Title: On the rate of convergence of image classifiers based on convolutional
  neural networks
Authors: M. Kohler, A. Krzyzak and B. Walter
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Image classifiers based on convolutional neural networks are defined, and the
rate of convergence of the misclassification risk of the estimates towards the
optimal misclassification risk is analyzed. Under suitable assumptions on the
smoothness and structure of the aposteriori probability a rate of convergence
is shown which is independent of the dimension of the image. This proves that
in image classification it is possible to circumvent the curse of
dimensionality by convolutional neural networks.

Title: Voice Separation with an Unknown Number of Multiple Speakers
Authors: Eliya Nachmani, Yossi Adi, Lior Wolf
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML
\\
  We present a new method for separating a mixed audio sequence, in which
multiple voices speak simultaneously. The new method employs gated neural
networks that are trained to separate the voices at multiple processing steps,
while maintaining the speaker in each output channel fixed. A different model
is trained for every number of possible speakers, and a the model with the
largest number of speakers is employed to select the actual number of speakers
in a given sample. Our method greatly outperforms the current state of the art,
which, as we show, is not competitive for more than two speakers.

Title: Explainable and Scalable Machine-Learning Algorithms for Detection of
  Autism Spectrum Disorder using fMRI Data
Authors: Taban Eslami, Joseph S. Raiker and Fahad Saeed
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a challenging problem, and is
based purely on behavioral descriptions of symptomology (DSM-5/ICD-10), and
requires informants to observe children with disorder across different settings
(e.g. home, school). Numerous limitations (e.g., informant discrepancies, lack
of adherence to assessment guidelines, informant biases) to current diagnostic
practices have the potential to result in over-, under-, or misdiagnosis of the
disorder. Advances in neuroimaging technologies are providing a critical step
towards a more objective assessment of the disorder. Prior research provides
strong evidence that structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
data collected from individuals with ASD exhibit distinguishing characteristics
that differ in local and global spatial, and temporal neural-patterns of the
brain. Our proposed deep-learning model ASD-DiagNet exhibits consistently high
accuracy for classification of ASD brain scans from neurotypical scans. We have
for the first time integrated traditional machine-learning and deep-learning
techniques that allows us to isolate ASD biomarkers from MRI data sets. Our
method, called Auto-ASD-Network, uses a combination of deep-learning and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify ASD scans from neurotypical scans.
Such interpretable models would help explain the decisions made by
deep-learning techniques leading to knowledge discovery for neuroscientists,
and transparent analysis for clinicians.

\\
  The understanding of the surrounding environment plays a critical role in
autonomous robotic systems, such as self-driving cars. Extensive research has
been carried out concerning visual perception. Yet, to obtain a more complete
perception of the environment, autonomous systems of the future should also
take acoustic information into account. Recent sound event localization and
detection (SELD) frameworks utilize convolutional recurrent neural networks
(CRNNs). However, considering the recurrent nature of CRNNs, it becomes
challenging to implement them efficiently on embedded hardware. Not only are
their computations strenuous to parallelize, but they also require high memory
bandwidth and large memory buffers. In this work, we develop a more robust and
hardware-friendly novel architecture based on a temporal convolutional
network(TCN). The proposed framework (SELD-TCN) outperforms the
state-of-the-art SELDnet performance on four different datasets. Moreover,
SELD-TCN achieves 4x faster training time per epoch and 40x faster inference
time on an ordinary graphics processing unit (GPU).

Title: Single-exposure absorption imaging of ultracold atoms using deep

Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Absorption imaging is the most common probing technique in experiments with
ultracold atoms. The standard procedure involves the division of two frames
acquired at successive exposures, one with the atomic absorption signal and one
without. A well-known problem is the presence of residual structured noise in
the final image, due to small differences between the imaging light in the two
exposures. Here we solve this problem by performing absorption imaging with
only a single exposure, where instead of a second exposure the reference frame
is generated by an unsupervised image-completion autoencoder neural network.
The network is trained on images without absorption signal such that it can
infer the noise overlaying the atomic signal based only on the information in
the region encircling the signal. We demonstrate our approach on data captured
with a quantum degenerate Fermi gas. The average residual noise in the
resulting images is below that of the standard double-shot technique. Our
method simplifies the experimental sequence, reduces the hardware requirements,
and can improve the accuracy of extracted physical observables. The trained
network and its generating scripts are available as an open-source repository
(http://absDL.github.io/).

Title: Theoretical Understanding of Batch-normalization: A Markov Chain
  Perspective
Authors: Hadi Daneshmand, Jonas Kohler, Francis Bach, Thomas Hofmann, Aurelien
  Lucchi
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Batch-normalization (BN) is a key component to effectively train deep neural
networks. Empirical evidence has shown that without BN, the training process is
prone to unstabilities. This is however not well understood from a theoretical
point of view. Leveraging tools from Markov chain theory, we show that BN has a
direct effect on the rank of the pre-activation matrices of a neural network.
Specifically, while deep networks without BN exhibit rank collapse and poor
training performance, networks equipped with BN have a higher rank. In an
extensive set of experiments on standard neural network architectures and
datasets, we show that the latter quantity is a good predictor for the
optimization speed of training.

Title: Robust data encodings for quantum classifiers
Authors: Ryan LaRose, Brian Coyle
Categories: quant-ph cs.LG
Comments: 18 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Data representation is crucial for the success of machine learning models. In
the context of quantum machine learning with near-term quantum computers,
equally important considerations of how to efficiently input (encode) data and
effectively deal with noise arise. In this work, we study data encodings for
binary quantum classification and investigate their properties both with and
without noise. For the common classifier we consider, we show that encodings
determine the classes of learnable decision boundaries as well as the set of
points which retain the same classification in the presence of noise. After
defining the notion of a robust data encoding, we prove several results on
robustness for different channels, discuss the existence of robust encodings,
and prove an upper bound on the number of robust points in terms of fidelities
between noisy and noiseless states. Numerical results for several example
implementations are provided to reinforce our findings.

  Smartphone is the superstar product in digital device market and the quality
of smartphone camera photos (SCPs) is becoming one of the dominant
considerations when consumers purchase smartphones. How to evaluate the quality
of smartphone cameras and the taken photos is urgent issue to be solved. To
bridge the gap between academic research accomplishment and industrial needs,
in this paper, we establish a new Smartphone Camera Photo Quality Database
(SCPQD2020) including 1800 images with 120 scenes taken by 15 smartphones.
Exposure, color, noise and texture which are four dominant factors influencing
the quality of SCP are evaluated in the subjective study, respectively. Ten
popular no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms are tested
and analyzed on our database. Experimental results demonstrate that the current
objective models are not suitable for SCPs, and quality metrics having high
correlation with human visual perception are highly needed.

  In this paper, we provide conditions, \emph{based solely on the observed
data}, for the global well-posedness, regularity and convergence of the
Azouni-Olson-Titi data assimilation algorithm (AOT algorithm) for a Leray-Hopf
weak solutions of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations (3D NSE). The
aforementioned conditions on the observations, which in this case comprise
either of \emph{modal} or \emph{volume element observations}, are automatically
satisfied for solutions that are globally regular and are uniformly bounded in
the $H^1$-norm. However, neither regularity nor uniqueness is necessary for the
efficacy of the AOT algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
such rigorous analysis of the AOT data assimilation algorithm for the 3D NSE.

Title: Assessment of WRF model parameter sensitivity for high-intensity

\\
  Default values for many model parameters in Numerical Weather Prediction
models are typically adopted based on theoretical or experimental
investigations by scheme designers. Short-range forecasts are substantially
affected by the specification of parameters in the Weather Research and
Forecasting (WRF) model. The presence of a multitude of parameters and several
output variables in the WRF model renders appropriate parameter value
identification quite challenging. The objective of the current study is to
reduce the uncertainty in the model outcomes through the recognition of
parameters that strongly influence the model performance using a Global
Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) method. Morris one-step-at-a-time (MOAT), GSA
method, is used to identify the sensitivities of 23 chosen tunable parameters
corresponding to seven physical parameterization schemes of the WRF model. The
sensitivity measures (MOAT mean and standard deviation) are evaluated for
eleven output variables, out of which some are surface meteorological variables
and the remaining are atmospheric variables, which are simulated by the WRF
model with different parameters. Twelve high-intensity four day precipitation
events during the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) for the years 2015, 2016, and
2017 over the monsoon core region in India are considered for the study. Six
out of 23 parameters have high MOAT mean in the case of almost all the model
output variables indicating that these parameters have a considerable effect on
the outcome of the simulations. MOAT mean values of a few parameters are
noticeably small for all the model output variables, and thus the uncertainty
associated with them has a negligible effect on the WRF model performance. The
study also presents the physical insights into the trends of the parameter
sensitivity.

Title: VOR Adaptation on a Humanoid iCub Robot Using a Spiking Cerebellar Model

DOI: 10.1109/TCYB.2019.2899246
\\
  We embed a spiking cerebellar model within an adaptive real-time (RT) control
loop that is able to operate a real robotic body (iCub) when performing
different vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) tasks. The spiking neural network
computation, including event- and time-driven neural dynamics, neural activity,
and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms, leads to a
nondeterministic computation time caused by the neural activity volleys
encountered during cerebellar simulation. This nondeterministic computation
time motivates the integration of an RT supervisor module that is able to
ensure a well-orchestrated neural computation time and robot operation.
Actually, our neurorobotic experimental setup (VOR) benefits from the
biological sensory motor delay between the cerebellum and the body to buffer
the computational overloads as well as providing flexibility in adjusting the
neural computation time and RT operation. The RT supervisor module provides for
incremental countermeasures that dynamically slow down or speed up the
cerebellar simulation by either halting the simulation or disabling certain
neural computation features (i.e., STDP mechanisms, spike propagation, and
neural updates) to cope with the RT constraints imposed by the real robot
operation. This neurorobotic experimental setup is applied to different
horizontal and vertical VOR adaptive tasks that are widely used by the
neuroscientific community to address cerebellar functioning. We aim to
elucidate the manner in which the combination of the cerebellar neural
substrate and the distributed plasticity shapes the cerebellar neural activity
to mediate motor adaptation. This paper underlies the need for a two-stage
learning process to facilitate VOR acquisition.

  Studying and understanding the computational primitives of our neural system

use the Neuro-robotic Platform (NRP)to evaluate the vestibulo ocular cerebellar
adaptatIon (Vestibulo-ocular reflex, VOR)mediated by two STDP mechanisms

respectively. This simulation study adopts an experimental setup (rotatory
VOR)widely used by neuroscientists to better understand the contribution of
certain specific cerebellar properties (i.e. distributed STDP, neural
properties, coding cerebellar topology, etc.)to r-VOR adaptation. The work
proposes and describes an embodiment solution for which we endow a simulated
humanoid robot (iCub)with a spiking cerebellar model by means of the NRP, and
we face the humanoid to an r-VOR task. The results validate the adaptive
capabilities of the spiking cerebellar model (with STDP)in a perception-action
closed-loop (r- VOR)causing the simulated iCub robot to mimic a human behavior.

  Accurate sound field reproduction in rooms is often limited by the lack of
knowledge of the room characteristics. Information about the room shape or
nearby reflecting boundaries can, in principle, be used to improve the accuracy
of the reproduction. In this paper, we propose a method to infer the location
of nearby reflecting boundaries from measurements on a microphone array. As
opposed to traditional methods, we explicitly exploit the loudspeaker
directivity model (beyond omnidirectional radiation) and the microphone array
geometry. This approach does not require noiseless timing information of the
echoes as input, nor a tailored loudspeaker-wall-microphone measurement step.
Simulations show the proposed model outperforms current methods that disregard
directivity in reverberant environments.

Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
\\
  This work addresses the problem of multichannel source separation combining
two powerful approaches, multichannel spectral factorization with recent
monophonic deep-learning (DL) based spectrum inference. Individual source
spectra at different channels are estimated with a Masker-Denoiser Twin Network
(MaD TwinNet), able to model long-term temporal patterns of a musical piece.
The monophonic source spectrograms are used within a spatial covariance mixing
model based on Complex Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) that predicts
the spatial characteristics of each source. The proposed framework is evaluated
on the task of singing voice separation with a large multichannel dataset.
Experimental results show that our joint DL+CNMF method outperforms both the
individual monophonic DL-based separation and the multichannel CNMF baseline
methods.

Title: Semi-supervised learning of glottal pulse positions in a neural

Authors: Frederik Bous, Luc Ardaillon, Axel Roebel
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
\\
  This article investigates into recently emerging approaches that use deep
neural networks for the estimation of glottal closure instants (GCI). We build
upon our previous approach that used synthetic speech exclusively to create
perfectly annotated training data and that had been shown to compare favourably
with other training approaches using electroglottograph (EGG) signals. Here we
introduce a semi-supervised training strategy that allows refining the
estimator by means of an analysis-synthesis setup using real speech signals,
for which GCI ground truth does not exist. Evaluation of the analyser is
performed by means of comparing the GCI extracted from the glottal flow signal
generated by the analyser with the GCI extracted from EGG on the CMU arctic
dataset, where EGG signals were recorded in addition to speech. We observe that
(1.) the artificial increase of the diversity of pulse shapes that has been
used in our previous construction of the synthetic database is beneficial, (2.)
training the GCI network in the analysis-synthesis setup allows achieving a
very significant improvement of the GCI analyser, (3.) additional
regularisation strategies allow improving the final analysis network when
trained in the analysis-synthesis setup.

  Silence is a part of human-to-human communication, which can be a clue for
human emotion perception. For automatic emotion recognition by a computer, it
is not clear whether silence is useful to determine human emotion within a
speech. This paper presents an investigation of the effect of using silence
feature in dimensional emotion recognition. As the silence feature is extracted
per utterance, we grouped the silence feature with high statistical functions
from a set of acoustic features. The result reveals that the silence feature
affects the arousal dimension more than other emotion dimensions. The proper
choice of a factor in the calculation of silence feature improves the
performance of dimensional speech emotion recognition performance in terms of a
concordance correlation coefficient. On the other side, improper choice of that
factor leads to a decrease in performance by using the same architecture.

Title: Unsupervised Interpretable Representation Learning for Singing Voice
  Separation
Authors: Stylianos I. Mimilakis, Konstantinos Drossos and Gerald Schuller
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
\\
  In this work, we present a method for learning interpretable music signal
representations directly from waveform signals. Our method can be trained using
unsupervised objectives and relies on the denoising auto-encoder model that
uses a simple sinusoidal model as decoding functions to reconstruct the singing
voice. To demonstrate the benefits of our method, we employ the obtained
representations to the task of informed singing voice separation via binary
masking, and measure the obtained separation quality by means of
scale-invariant signal to distortion ratio. Our findings suggest that our
method is capable of learning meaningful representations for singing voice
separation, while preserving conveniences of the the short-time Fourier
transform like non-negativity, smoothness, and reconstruction subject to
time-frequency masking, that are desired in audio and music source separation.

Title: A Scalar Parameterized Mechanism for Two-Sided Markets
Authors: Mariola Ndrio, Khaled Alshehri and Subhonmesh Bose
Categories: econ.GN cs.SY eess.SY q-fin.EC
Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures
\\
  We consider a market in which both suppliers and consumers compete for a
product via scalar-parameterized supply offers and demand bids.
Scalar-parameterized offers/bids are appealing due to their modeling simplicity
and desirable mathematical properties with the most prominent being bounded
efficiency loss and price markup under strategic interactions. Our model
incorporates production capacity constraints and minimum inelastic demand
requirements. Under perfect competition, the market mechanism yields
allocations that maximize social welfare. When market participants are
price-anticipating, we show that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium, and
provide an efficient way to compute the resulting market allocation. Moreover,
we explicitly characterize the bounds on the welfare loss and prices observed
at the Nash equilibrium.

Title: Fault detection and isolation for linear structured systems
Authors: Jiajia Jia, Harry L. Trentelman and M. Kanat Camlibel
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY math.DS
Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure, 1 table
\\
  This paper deals with the fault detection and isolation (FDI) problem for
linear structured systems in which the system matrices are given by
zero/nonzero/arbitrary pattern matrices. In this paper, we follow a geometric
approach to verify solvability of the FDI problem for such systems. To do so,
we first develop a necessary and sufficient condition under which the FDI
problem for a given particular linear time-invariant system is solvable. Next,
we establish a necessary condition for solvability of the FDI problem for
linear structured systems. In addition, we develop a sufficient algebraic
condition for solvability of the FDI problem in terms of a rank test on an
associated pattern matrix. To illustrate that this condition is not necessary,
we provide a counterexample in which the FDI problem is solvable while the
condition is not satisfied. Finally, we develop a graph-theoretic condition for
the full rank property of a given pattern matrix, which leads to a
graph-theoretic condition for solvability of the FDI problem.
