Title: Learning Compositional Rules via Neural Program Synthesis
Authors: Maxwell I. Nye, Armando Solar-Lezama, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Brenden M.
  Lake
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Many aspects of human reasoning, including language, require learning rules
from very little data. Humans can do this, often learning systematic rules from
very few examples, and combining these rules to form compositional rule-based
systems. Current neural architectures, on the other hand, often fail to
generalize in a compositional manner, especially when evaluated in ways that
vary systematically from training. In this work, we present a neuro-symbolic
model which learns entire rule systems from a small set of examples. Instead of
directly predicting outputs from inputs, we train our model to induce the
explicit system of rules governing a set of previously seen examples, drawing
upon techniques from the neural program synthesis literature. Our
rule-synthesis approach outperforms neural meta-learning techniques in three
domains: an artificial instruction-learning domain used to evaluate human
learning, the SCAN challenge datasets, and learning rule-based translations of
number words into integers for a wide range of human languages.

Title: Online Fast Adaptation and Knowledge Accumulation: a New Approach to
  Continual Learning

\\
  Learning from non-stationary data remains a great challenge for machine
learning. Continual learning addresses this problem in scenarios where the
learning agent faces a stream of changing tasks. In these scenarios, the agent
is expected to retain its highest performance on previous tasks without
revisiting them while adapting well to the new tasks. Two new recent
continual-learning scenarios have been proposed. In meta-continual learning,
the model is pre-trained to minimize catastrophic forgetting when trained on a
sequence of tasks. In continual-meta learning, the goal is faster remembering,
i.e., focusing on how quickly the agent recovers performance rather than
measuring the agent's performance without any adaptation. Both scenarios have
the potential to propel the field forward. Yet in their original formulations,
they each have limitations. As a remedy, we propose a more general scenario
where an agent must quickly solve (new) out-of-distribution tasks, while also
requiring fast remembering. We show that current continual learning, meta
learning, meta-continual learning, and continual-meta learning techniques fail
in this new scenario. Accordingly, we propose a strong baseline:
Continual-MAML, an online extension of the popular MAML algorithm. In our
empirical experiments, we show that our method is better suited to the new
scenario than the methodologies mentioned above, as well as standard continual
learning and meta learning approaches.

\\
  To achieve social interactions within Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
environments is a very challenging task. Most of the current research focuses
on Wizard-of-Oz approaches, which neglect the recent development of intelligent
robots. On the other hand, real-world scenarios usually do not provide the
necessary control and reproducibility which are needed for learning algorithms.
In this paper, we propose a virtual simulation environment that implements the
Chef's Hat card game, designed to be used in HRI scenarios, to provide a
controllable and reproducible scenario for reinforcement-learning algorithms.

Title: On the Complexity and Approximation of $\lambda_\infty\,,$ Spread
  Constant and Maximum Variance Embedding
Authors: Majid Farhadi, Anand Louis, Prasad Tetali
Categories: cs.CC cs.DS
\\
  Twenty years ago, Bobkov, Houdr\'e, and the last author introduced a
Poincar\'e-type functional graph parameter, $\lambda_\infty(G)$, of a graph
$G$, and related it to the {\em vertex expansion} of $G$ via a Cheeger-type
inequality. This is analogous to the Cheeger-type inequality relating the
spectral gap, $\lambda_2(G)$, of the graph to its {\em edge expansion}.
  While $\lambda_2$ can be computed efficiently, the computational complexity
of $\lambda_\infty$ has remained an open question. Following the work of the
second author with Raghavendra and Vempala, wherein the complexity of
$\lambda_\infty$ was related to the so-called Small-Set Expansion (SSE)
problem, it has been believed that computing $\lambda_\infty$ is a hard
problem. We settle this question by proving that computing $\lambda_\infty$ is
indeed NP-hard. Additionally, we use our techniques to prove NP-hardness of
computing the spread constant (of a graph), a geometric measure introduced by
Alon, Boppana, and Spencer, in the context of deriving an asymptotic
isoperimetric inequality on cartesian products of graphs.
  We complement our hardness results by providing approximation schemes for
computing $\lambda_\infty$ and the spread constant of star graphs, and
investigate constant approximability for weighted trees.
  Finally, we provide improved approximation results for the maximum variance
embedding problem for general graphs, by replacing the optimal orthogonal
projection (PCA) with a randomized projection approach.

Title: New Exponential Size Lower Bounds against Depth Four Circuits of Bounded
  Individual Degree
Authors: Suryajith Chillara
Categories: cs.CC
\\
  Kayal, Saha and Tavenas [Theory of Computing, 2018] showed that for all large
enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d\geq \omega(\log{n})$, any syntactic
depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta = o(d)$ that computes
the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial ($IMM_{n,d}$) must have size
$n^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{d/\delta}\right)}$. Unfortunately, this bound
deteriorates as the value of $\delta$ increases. Further, the bound is
superpolynomial only when $\delta$ is $o(d)$. It is natural to ask if the
dependence on $\delta$ in the bound could be weakened. Towards this, in an
earlier result [STACS, 2020], we showed that for all large enough integers $n$
and $d$ such that $d = \Theta(\log^2{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of
bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{0.2}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must
have size $n^{\Omega(\log{n})}$.
  In this paper, we make further progress by proving that for all large enough
integers $n$ and $d$, and absolute constants $a$ and $b$ such that
$\omega(\log^2n)\leq d\leq n^{a}$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded
individual degree $\delta\leq n^{b}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size
$n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$. Our bound is obtained by carefully adapting the proof
of Kumar and Saraf [SIAM J. Computing, 2017] to the complexity measure
introduced in our earlier work [STACS, 2020].

Title: Improved VIV response prediction using adaptive parameters and data
  clustering

\\
  Slender marine structures such as deep-water riser systems are continuously
exposed to currents leading to vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of the
structure. This may result in amplified drag loads and fast accumulation of
fatigue damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of VIV responses is of great
importance for the safe design and operation of marine risers. Model tests with
elastic pipes have shown that VIV responses are influenced by many structural
and hydrodynamic parameters, which have not been fully modelled in present
frequency domain VIV prediction tools. Traditionally, predictions have been
computed using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters, often leading to
inconsistent prediction accuracy when compared with observed field measurements
and experimental data. Hence, it is necessary to implement a high safety factor
of 10 - 20 in the riser design, which increases development cost and adds extra
constraints in the field operation. One way to compensate for the
simplifications in the mathematical prediction model is to apply adaptive
parameters to describe different riser responses. The objective of this work is
to demonstrate a new method to improve the prediction consistency and accuracy
by applying adaptive hydrodynamic parameters. In the present work, a four-step
approach has been proposed: First, the measured VIV response will be analysed
to identify key parameters to represent the response characteristics. These
parameters will be grouped using data clustering algorithms. Secondly, optimal
hydrodynamic parameters will be identified for each data group by optimisation
against measured data. Thirdly, the VIV response using the obtained parameters
will be calculated and the prediction accuracy evaluated. The correct
hydrodynamic parameters to be used for new cases can be obtained from the
clustering. This concept has been demonstrated with examples from experimental
data.

Title: Deriving peridynamic influence functions for one-dimensional elastic
  materials with periodic microstructure
Authors: Xiao Xu, John T. Foster
Categories: cs.CE
\\
  The influence function in peridynamic material models has a large effect on
the dynamic behavior of elastic waves and in turn can greatly effect dynamic
simulations of fracture propagation and material failure. Typically, the
influence functions that are used in peridynamic models are selected for their
numerical properties without regard to physical considerations. In this work,
we present a method of deriving the peridynamic influence function for a
one-dimensional initial/boundary value problem in a material with periodic
microstructure. Starting with the linear local elastodynamic equation of motion
in the microscale, we first use polynomial anzatzes to approximate
microstructural displacements and then derive the homogenized nonlocal dynamic
equation of motion for the macroscopic displacements; which, is easily
reformulated as linear peridyamic equation with a discrete influence function.
The shape and localization of the discrete influence function is completely
determined by microstructural mechanical properties and length scales. By
comparison with a highly resolved microstructural finite element model and the
standard linear peridynamic model with a linearly decaying influence function,
we demonstrate that the influence function derived from microstructural
considerations is more accurate in predicting time dependent displacements and
wave dynamics.

Title: A Precisely Xtreme-Multi Channel Hybrid Approach For Roman Urdu
  Sentiment Analysis
Authors: Faiza Memood, Muhammad Usman Ghani, Muhammad Ali Ibrahim, Rehab

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  In order to accelerate the performance of various Natural Language Processing
tasks for Roman Urdu, this paper for the very first time provides 3 neural word
embeddings prepared using most widely used approaches namely Word2vec,
FastText, and Glove. The integrity of generated neural word embeddings is
evaluated using intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation approaches. Considering the
lack of publicly available benchmark datasets, it provides a first-ever Roman
Urdu dataset which consists of 3241 sentiments annotated against positive,
negative and neutral classes. To provide benchmark baseline performance over
the presented dataset, we adapt diverse machine learning (Support Vector
Machine Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes), deep learning (convolutional neural
network, recurrent neural network), and hybrid approaches. Effectiveness of
generated neural word embeddings is evaluated by comparing the performance of
machine and deep learning based methodologies using 7, and 5 distinct feature
representation approaches respectively. Finally, it proposes a novel precisely
extreme multi-channel hybrid methodology which outperforms state-of-the-art
adapted machine and deep learning approaches by the figure of 9%, and 4% in
terms of F1-score. Roman Urdu Sentiment Analysis, Pretrain word embeddings for

Title: Investigating Entity Knowledge in BERT with Simple Neural End-To-End
  Entity Linking
Authors: Samuel Broscheit
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Published at CoNLL 2019
Journal-ref: Proceedings of the 23rd Conference on Computational Natural
  Language Learning (CoNLL), 2019, 677-685
DOI: 10.18653/v1/K19-1063
\\
  A typical architecture for end-to-end entity linking systems consists of
three steps: mention detection, candidate generation and entity disambiguation.
In this study we investigate the following questions: (a) Can all those steps
be learned jointly with a model for contextualized text-representations, i.e.
BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)? (b) How much entity knowledge is already contained
in pretrained BERT? (c) Does additional entity knowledge improve BERT's
performance in downstream tasks? To this end, we propose an extreme
simplification of the entity linking setup that works surprisingly well: simply
cast it as a per token classification over the entire entity vocabulary (over
700K classes in our case). We show on an entity linking benchmark that (i) this
model improves the entity representations over plain BERT, (ii) that it
outperforms entity linking architectures that optimize the tasks separately and
(iii) that it only comes second to the current state-of-the-art that does
mention detection and entity disambiguation jointly. Additionally, we
investigate the usefulness of entity-aware token-representations in the
text-understanding benchmark GLUE, as well as the question answering benchmarks
SQUAD V2 and SWAG and also the EN-DE WMT14 machine translation benchmark. To
our surprise, we find that most of those benchmarks do not benefit from
additional entity knowledge, except for a task with very small training data,
the RTE task in GLUE, which improves by 2%.

Title: Semantic Holism and Word Representations in Artificial Neural Networks
Authors: Tom\'a\v{s} Musil
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Artificial neural networks are a state-of-the-art solution for many problems
in natural language processing. What can we learn about language and meaning
from the way artificial neural networks represent it? Word representations
obtained from the Skip-gram variant of the word2vec model exhibit interesting
semantic properties. This is usually explained by referring to the general
distributional hypothesis, which states that the meaning of the word is given
by the contexts where it occurs. We propose a more specific approach based on
Frege's holistic and functional approach to meaning. Taking Tugendhat's formal
reinterpretation of Frege's work as a starting point, we demonstrate that it is
analogical to the process of training the Skip-gram model and offers a possible
explanation of its semantic properties.

Title: Learning word-referent mappings and concepts from raw inputs
Authors: Wai Keen Vong, Brenden M. Lake
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  How do children learn correspondences between the language and the world from
noisy, ambiguous, naturalistic input? One hypothesis is via cross-situational
learning: tracking words and their possible referents across multiple
situations allows learners to disambiguate correct word-referent mappings (Yu &
Smith, 2007). However, previous models of cross-situational word learning
operate on highly simplified representations, side-stepping two important
aspects of the actual learning problem. First, how can word-referent mappings
be learned from raw inputs such as images? Second, how can these learned
mappings generalize to novel instances of a known word? In this paper, we
present a neural network model trained from scratch via self-supervision that
takes in raw images and words as inputs, and show that it can learn
word-referent mappings from fully ambiguous scenes and utterances through
cross-situational learning. In addition, the model generalizes to novel word
instances, locates referents of words in a scene, and shows a preference for
mutual exclusivity.

Title: Sentiment Analysis with Contextual Embeddings and Self-Attention
Authors: Katarzyna Biesialska, Magdalena Biesialska and Henryk Rybinski
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at the 25th International Symposium on Methodologies for
  Intelligent Systems (ISMIS 2020)
\\
  In natural language the intended meaning of a word or phrase is often
implicit and depends on the context. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective method for sentiment analysis using contextual embeddings and a
self-attention mechanism. The experimental results for three languages,
including morphologically rich Polish and German, show that our model is
comparable to or even outperforms state-of-the-art models. In all cases the
superiority of models leveraging contextual embeddings is demonstrated.
Finally, this work is intended as a step towards introducing a universal,
multilingual sentiment classifier.

Currently, we serve pre-trained embeddings for four knowledge graphs. We

The evaluation also reveals that the combination of multiple models can lead to

Title: Bypassing memory safety mechanisms through speculative control flow
  hijacks
Authors: Andrea Mambretti, Alexandra Sandulescu, Alessandro Sorniotti, Wil
  Robertson, Engin Kirda, Anil Kurmus
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  The prevalence of memory corruption bugs in the past decades resulted in
numerous defenses, such as stack canaries, control flow integrity (CFI), and
memory safe languages. These defenses can prevent entire classes of
vulnerabilities, and help increase the security posture of a program. In this
paper, we show that memory corruption defenses can be bypassed using
speculative execution attacks. We study the cases of stack protectors, CFI, and
bounds checks in Go, demonstrating under which conditions they can be bypassed
by a form of speculative control flow hijack, relying on speculative or
architectural overwrites of control flow data. Information is leaked by
redirecting the speculative control flow of the victim to a gadget accessing
secret data and acting as a side channel send. We also demonstrate, for the
first time, that this can be achieved by stitching together multiple gadgets,
in a speculative return-oriented programming attack. We discuss and implement
software mitigations, showing moderate performance impact.

Title: Securing Autonomous Service Robots through Fuzzing, Detection, and
  Mitigation

Categories: cs.CR cs.RO
Comments: 14 pages
\\
  Autonomous service robots share social spaces with humans, usually working
together for domestic or professional tasks. Cyber security breaches in such
robots undermine the trust between humans and robots. In this paper, we
investigate how to apprehend and inflict security threats at the design and
implementation stage of a movable autonomous service robot. To this end, we
leverage the idea of directed fuzzing and design RoboFuzz that systematically
tests an autonomous service robot in line with the robot's states and the
surrounding environment. The methodology of RoboFuzz is to study critical
environmental parameters affecting the robot's state transitions and subject
the robot control program with rational but harmful sensor values so as to
compromise the robot. Furthermore, we develop detection and mitigation
algorithms to counteract the impact of RoboFuzz. The difficulties mainly lie in
the trade-off among limited computation resources, timely detection and the
retention of work efficiency in mitigation. In particular, we propose detection
and mitigation methods that take advantage of historical records of obstacles
to detect inconsistent obstacle appearances regarding untrustworthy sensor
values and navigate the movable robot to continue moving so as to carry on a
planned task. By doing so, we manage to maintain a low cost for detection and
mitigation but also retain the robot's work efficacy. We have prototyped the
bundle of RoboFuzz, detection and mitigation algorithms in a real-world movable
robot. Experimental results confirm that RoboFuzz makes a success rate of up to
93.3% in imposing concrete threats to the robot while the overall loss of work
efficacy is merely 4.1% at the mitigation mode.

Title: ConAML: Constrained Adversarial Machine Learning for Cyber-Physical
  Systems
Authors: Jiangnan Li, Jin Young Lee, Yingyuan Yang, Jinyuan Stella Sun, Kevin
  Tomsovic
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Recent research demonstrated that the superficially well-trained machine
learning (ML) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. As ML
techniques are rapidly employed in cyber-physical systems (CPSs), the security
of these applications is of concern. However, current studies on adversarial
machine learning (AML) mainly focus on computer vision and related fields. The
risks the adversarial examples can bring to the CPS applications have not been
well investigated. In particular, due to the distributed property of data
sources and the inherent physical constraints imposed by CPSs, the widely-used
threat models in previous research and the state-of-the-art AML algorithms are
no longer practical when applied to CPS applications.
  We study the vulnerabilities of ML applied in CPSs by proposing Constrained
Adversarial Machine Learning (ConAML), which generates adversarial examples
used as ML model input that meet the intrinsic constraints of the physical
systems. We first summarize the difference between AML in CPSs and AML in
existing cyber systems and propose a general threat model for ConAML. We then
design a best-effort search algorithm to iteratively generate adversarial
examples with linear physical constraints. As proofs of concept, we evaluate
the vulnerabilities of ML models used in the electric power grid and water
treatment systems. The results show that our ConAML algorithms can effectively
generate adversarial examples which significantly decrease the performance of
the ML models even under practical physical constraints.

Title: Inline Detection of DGA Domains Using Side Information
Authors: Raaghavi Sivaguru, Jonathan Peck, Femi Olumofin, Anderson Nascimento
  and Martine De Cock
Categories: cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Malware applications typically use a command and control (C&C) server to
manage bots to perform malicious activities. Domain Generation Algorithms
(DGAs) are popular methods for generating pseudo-random domain names that can
be used to establish a communication between an infected bot and the C&C
server. In recent years, machine learning based systems have been widely used
to detect DGAs. There are several well known state-of-the-art classifiers in
the literature that can detect DGA domain names in real-time applications with
high predictive performance. However, these DGA classifiers are highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks in which adversaries purposely craft domain
names to evade DGA detection classifiers. In our work, we focus on hardening
DGA classifiers against adversarial attacks. To this end, we train and evaluate
state-of-the-art deep learning and random forest (RF) classifiers for DGA
detection using side information that is harder for adversaries to manipulate
than the domain name itself. Additionally, the side information features are
selected such that they are easily obtainable in practice to perform inline DGA
detection. The performance and robustness of these models is assessed by
exposing them to one day of real-traffic data as well as domains generated by
adversarial attack algorithms. We found that the DGA classifiers that rely on
both the domain name and side information have high performance and are more
robust against adversaries.

Title: SMap: Internet-wide Scanning for Ingress Filtering
Authors: Tianxiang Dai and Haya Shulman
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  To protect from attacks, networks need to enforce ingress filtering. Despite
the importance, the existing studies do not allow to infer the extent of
ingress filtering at Internet-scale, providing results with only a limited
coverage: they can either measure networks that operate servers with faulty
network-stack implementations, or require installation of the measurement
software by volunteers, or assume specific properties, like traceroute loops,
which are challenging to reproduce in practice. Improving coverage of the
spoofing measurements is critical.
  In this work we present the Spoofing Mapper (SMap): the first scanner for
performing Internet-wide studies of enforcement of ingress filtering. The SMap
measurement methodology utilises standard protocols' behaviour that are present
in almost any network. SMap not only provides better coverage of
ingress-filtering measurements, but it is also more effective than the previous
approaches. We applied SMap for Internet-wide measurements: we found that 21%
of all the Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet do not filter spoofed
packets, in contrast to 2.5% ASes identified by the most recent study with
volunteers (of the Spoofer Project), as well as 13173 new spoofable ASes, which
were not detected by the other tools. Our study with SMap provides the most
comprehensive view of ingress filtering deployment in the Internet and
remediation in filtering spoofed packets over a period of six months until
February 2020. SMap is simple to use and does not require installation on the
tested network nor coordination with the tested networks.
  We set up a web service at http://141.12.72.78/ which reports statistics from
SMap evaluations and enables continual Internet-wide data collection and
analysis. We also make our datasets as well as the SMap tool publicly available
to enable researchers to reproduce and validate the results.

\\
  Large-scale password data breaches are becoming increasingly commonplace,
which has enabled researchers to produce a substantial body of password
security research utilising real-world password datasets, which often contain
numbers of records in the tens or even hundreds of millions. While much study
has been conducted on how password composition policies (sets of rules that a
user must abide by when creating a password) influence the distribution of
user-chosen passwords on a system, much less research has been done on
inferring the password composition policy that a given set of user-chosen
passwords was created under. In this paper, we state the problem with the naive
approach to this challenge, and suggest a simple approach that produces more
reliable results. We also present pol-infer, a tool that implements this
approach, and demonstrates its use in inferring password composition policies.

\\
  Visual saliency modeling for images and videos is treated as two independent
tasks in recent computer vision literature. On the one hand, image saliency
modeling is a well-studied problem and progress on benchmarks like
\mbox{SALICON} and MIT300 is slowing. For video saliency prediction on the
other hand, rapid gains have been achieved on the recent DHF1K benchmark
through network architectures that are optimized for this task. Here, we take a
step back and ask: Can image and video saliency modeling be approached via a
unified model, with mutual benefit? We find that it is crucial to model the
domain shift between image and video saliency data and between different video
saliency datasets for effective joint modeling. We identify different sources
of domain shift and address them through four novel domain adaptation
techniques - Domain-Adaptive Priors, Domain-Adaptive Fusion, Domain-Adaptive
Smoothing and Bypass-RNN - in addition to an improved formulation of learned
Gaussian priors. We integrate these techniques into a simple and lightweight
encoder-RNN-decoder-style network, UNISAL, and train the entire network
simultaneously with image and video saliency data. We evaluate our method on
the video saliency datasets DHF1K, Hollywood-2 and UCF-Sports, as well as the
image saliency datasets SALICON and MIT300. With one set of parameters, our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all video saliency datasets and
is on par with the state-of-the-art for image saliency prediction, despite a 5
to 20-fold reduction in model size and the fastest runtime among all competing
deep models. We provide retrospective analyses and ablation studies which
demonstrate the importance of the domain shift modeling. The code is available

Title: Confidence Guided Stereo 3D Object Detection with Split Depth Estimation
Authors: Chengyao Li, Jason Ku and Steven L. Waslander
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Accurate and reliable 3D object detection is vital to safe autonomous
driving. Despite recent developments, the performance gap between stereo-based
methods and LiDAR-based methods is still considerable. Accurate depth
estimation is crucial to the performance of stereo-based 3D object detection
methods, particularly for those pixels associated with objects in the
foreground. Moreover, stereo-based methods suffer from high variance in the
depth estimation accuracy, which is often not considered in the object
detection pipeline. To tackle these two issues, we propose CG-Stereo, a
confidence-guided stereo 3D object detection pipeline that uses separate
decoders for foreground and background pixels during depth estimation, and
leverages the confidence estimation from the depth estimation network as a soft
attention mechanism in the 3D object detector. Our approach outperforms all
state-of-the-art stereo-based 3D detectors on the KITTI benchmark.

Title: Softmax Splatting for Video Frame Interpolation
Authors: Simon Niklaus, Feng Liu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR 2020, http://sniklaus.com/softsplat
\\
  Differentiable image sampling in the form of backward warping has seen broad
adoption in tasks like depth estimation and optical flow prediction. In
contrast, how to perform forward warping has seen less attention, partly due to
additional challenges such as resolving the conflict of mapping multiple pixels
to the same target location in a differentiable way. We propose softmax
splatting to address this paradigm shift and show its effectiveness on the
application of frame interpolation. Specifically, given two input frames, we
forward-warp the frames and their feature pyramid representations based on an
optical flow estimate using softmax splatting. In doing so, the softmax
splatting seamlessly handles cases where multiple source pixels map to the same
target location. We then use a synthesis network to predict the interpolation
result from the warped representations. Our softmax splatting allows us to not
only interpolate frames at an arbitrary time but also to fine tune the feature
pyramid and the optical flow. We show that our synthesis approach, empowered by
softmax splatting, achieves new state-of-the-art results for video frame
interpolation.

\\
  Comprehensive visual understanding requires detection frameworks that can
effectively learn and utilize object interactions while analyzing objects
individually. This is the main objective in Human-Object Interaction (HOI)
detection task. In particular, relative spatial reasoning and structural
connections between objects are essential cues for analyzing interactions,
which is addressed by the proposed Visual-Spatial-Graph Network (VSGNet)
architecture. VSGNet extracts visual features from the human-object pairs,
refines the features with spatial configurations of the pair, and utilizes the
structural connections between the pair via graph convolutions. The performance
of VSGNet is thoroughly evaluated using the Verbs in COCO (V-COCO) and HICO-DET
datasets. Experimental results indicate that VSGNet outperforms
state-of-the-art solutions by 8% or 4 mAP in V-COCO and 16% or 3 mAP in
HICO-DET.

Title: Frequency-Tuned Universal Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Yingpeng Deng and Lina J. Karam
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Researchers have shown that the predictions of a convolutional neural network
(CNN) for an image set can be severely distorted by one single image-agnostic
perturbation, or universal perturbation, usually with an empirically fixed
threshold in the spatial domain to restrict its perceivability. However, by
considering the human perception, we propose to adopt JND thresholds to guide
the perceivability of universal adversarial perturbations. Based on this, we
propose a frequency-tuned universal attack method to compute universal
perturbations and show that our method can realize a good balance between
perceivability and effectiveness in terms of fooling rate by adapting the
perturbations to the local frequency content. Compared with existing universal
adversarial attack techniques, our frequency-tuned attack method can achieve
cutting-edge quantitative results. We demonstrate that our approach can
significantly improve the performance of the baseline on both white-box and
black-box attacks.

  Critical aspects of computational imaging systems, such as experimental
design and image priors, can be optimized through deep networks formed by the
unrolled iterations of classical model-based reconstructions (termed
physics-based networks). However, for real-world large-scale inverse problems,
computing gradients via backpropagation is infeasible due to memory limitations
of graphics processing units. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient
learning procedure that exploits the reversibility of the network's layers to
enable data-driven design for large-scale computational imaging systems. We
demonstrate our method on a small-scale compressed sensing example, as well as
two large-scale real-world systems: multi-channel magnetic resonance imaging
and super-resolution optical microscopy.

Title: SeqXY2SeqZ: Structure Learning for 3D Shapes by Sequentially Predicting
  1D Occupancy Segments From 2D Coordinates
Authors: Zhizhong Han, Guanhui Qiao, Yu-Shen Liu, and Matthias Zwicker
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Structure learning for 3D shapes is vital for 3D computer vision.
State-of-the-art methods show promising results by representing shapes using
implicit functions in 3D that are learned using discriminative neural networks.
However, learning implicit functions requires dense and irregular sampling in
3D space, which also makes the sampling methods affect the accuracy of shape
reconstruction during test. To avoid dense and irregular sampling in 3D, we
propose to represent shapes using 2D functions, where the output of the
function at each 2D location is a sequence of line segments inside the shape.
Our approach leverages the power of functional representations, but without the
disadvantage of 3D sampling. Specifically, we use a voxel tubelization to
represent a voxel grid as a set of tubes along any one of the X, Y, or Z axes.
Each tube can be indexed by its 2D coordinates on the plane spanned by the
other two axes. We further simplify each tube into a sequence of occupancy
segments. Each occupancy segment consists of successive voxels occupied by the
shape, which leads to a simple representation of its 1D start and end location.
Given the 2D coordinates of the tube and a shape feature as condition, this
representation enables us to learn 3D shape structures by sequentially
predicting the start and end locations of each occupancy segment in the tube.
We implement this approach using a Seq2Seq model with attention, called
SeqXY2SeqZ, which learns the mapping from a sequence of 2D coordinates along
two arbitrary axes to a sequence of 1D locations along the third axis.
SeqXY2SeqZ not only benefits from the regularity of voxel grids in training and
testing, but also achieves high memory efficiency. Our experiments show that
SeqXY2SeqZ outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods under widely used
benchmarks.

Title: Extended Batch Normalization
Authors: Chunjie Luo, Jianfeng Zhan, Lei Wang, Wanling Gao
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Batch normalization (BN) has become a standard technique for training the
modern deep networks. However, its effectiveness diminishes when the batch size
becomes smaller, since the batch statistics estimation becomes inaccurate. That
hinders batch normalization's usage for 1) training larger model which requires
small batches constrained by memory consumption, 2) training on mobile or
embedded devices of which the memory resource is limited. In this paper, we
propose a simple but effective method, called extended batch normalization
(EBN). For NCHW format feature maps, extended batch normalization computes the
mean along the (N, H, W) dimensions, as the same as batch normalization, to
maintain the advantage of batch normalization. To alleviate the problem caused
by small batch size, extended batch normalization computes the standard
deviation along the (N, C, H, W) dimensions, thus enlarges the number of
samples from which the standard deviation is computed. We compare extended
batch normalization with batch normalization and group normalization on the
datasets of MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, STL-10, and ImageNet, respectively. The
experiments show that extended batch normalization alleviates the problem of
batch normalization with small batch size while achieving close performances to
batch normalization with large batch size.

Authors: Lingling Zhang, Xiaojun Chang, Jun Liu, Minnan Luo, Sen Wang, Zongyuan

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  An integral part of video analysis and surveillance is temporal activity
detection, which means to simultaneously recognize and localize activities in
long untrimmed videos. Currently, the most effective methods of temporal
activity detection are based on deep learning, and they typically perform very
well with large scale annotated videos for training. However, these methods are
limited in real applications due to the unavailable videos about certain
activity classes and the time-consuming data annotation. To solve this
challenging problem, we propose a novel task setting called zero-shot temporal
activity detection (ZSTAD), where activities that have never been seen in
training can still be detected. We design an end-to-end deep network based on
R-C3D as the architecture for this solution. The proposed network is optimized
with an innovative loss function that considers the embeddings of activity
labels and their super-classes while learning the common semantics of seen and
unseen activities. Experiments on both the THUMOS14 and the Charades datasets
show promising performance in terms of detecting unseen activities.

Title: Encoder-Decoder Based Convolutional Neural Networks with
  Multi-Scale-Aware Modules for Crowd Counting
Authors: Pongpisit Thanasutives, Ken-ichi Fukui, Masayuki Numao, Boonserm
  Kijsirikul
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  In this paper, we proposed two modified neural network architectures based on
SFANet and SegNet respectively for accurate and efficient crowd counting.
Inspired by SFANet, the first model is attached with two novel
multi-scale-aware modules called, ASSP and CAN. This model is called M-SFANet.
The encoder of M-SFANet is enhanced with ASSP containing parallel atrous
convolution with different sampling rates and hence able to extract multi-scale
features of the target object and incorporate larger context. To further deal
with scale variation throughout an input image, we leverage contextual module
called CAN which adaptively encodes the scales of the contextual information.
The combination yields an effective model for counting in both dense and sparse
crowd scenes. Based on SFANet decoder structure, M-SFANet decoder has dual
paths, for density map generation and attention map generation. The second
model is called M-SegNet. For M-SegNet, we simply change bilinear upsampling
used in SFANet to max unpooling originally from SegNet and propose the faster
model while providing competitive counting performance. Designed for high-speed
surveillance applications, M-SegNet has no additional multi-scale-aware module
in order to not increase the complexity. Both models are encoder-decoder based
architectures and end-to-end trainable. We also conduct extensive experiments
on four crowd counting datasets and one vehicle counting dataset to show that
these modifications yield algorithms that could outperform some of
state-of-the-art crowd counting methods.

Comments: Accepted in CVPR 2020
\\
  In contrast to the literature where local patterns in 3D point clouds are
captured by customized convolutional operators, in this paper we study the
problem of how to effectively and efficiently project such point clouds into a
2D image space so that traditional 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such
as U-Net can be applied for segmentation. To this end, we are motivated by
graph drawing and reformulate it as an integer programming problem to learn the
topology-preserving graph-to-grid mapping for each individual point cloud. To
accelerate the computation in practice, we further propose a novel hierarchical
approximate algorithm. With the help of the Delaunay triangulation for graph
construction from point clouds and a multi-scale U-Net for segmentation, we
manage to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on ShapeNet and PartNet,
respectively, with significant improvement over the literature. Code is

Title: Arbitrary-Oriented Object Detection with Circular Smooth Label
Authors: Xue Yang and Junchi Yan
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 18 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables
\\
  Arbitrary-oriented object detection has recently attracted increasing
attention in vision for their importance in aerial imagery, scene text, and
face etc. In this paper, we show that existing regression-based rotation
detectors suffer the problem of discontinuous boundaries, which is directly
caused by angular periodicity or corner ordering. By a careful study, we find
the root cause is that the ideal predictions are beyond the defined range. We
design a new rotation detection baseline, to address the boundary problem by
transforming angular prediction from a regression problem to a classification
task with little accuracy loss, whereby high-precision angle classification is
devised in contrast to previous works using coarse-granularity in rotation
detection. We also propose a circular smooth label (CSL) technique to handle
the periodicity of the angle and increase the error tolerance to adjacent
angles. We further introduce four window functions in CSL and explore the
effect of different window radius sizes on detection performance. Extensive
experiments and visual analysis on two large-scale public datasets for aerial
images i.e. DOTA, HRSC2016, as well as scene text dataset ICDAR2015 and MLT,
show the effectiveness of our approach. The code will be released at

Title: Beyond the Camera: Neural Networks in World Coordinates
Authors: Gunnar A. Sigurdsson, Abhinav Gupta, Cordelia Schmid, Karteek Alahari
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Eye movement and strategic placement of the visual field onto the retina,
gives animals increased resolution of the scene and suppresses distracting
information. This fundamental system has been missing from video understanding
with deep networks, typically limited to 224 by 224 pixel content locked to the
camera frame. We propose a simple idea, WorldFeatures, where each feature at
every layer has a spatial transformation, and the feature map is only
transformed as needed. We show that a network built with these WorldFeatures,
can be used to model eye movements, such as saccades, fixation, and smooth
pursuit, even in a batch setting on pre-recorded video. That is, the network
can for example use all 224 by 224 pixels to look at a small detail one moment,
and the whole scene the next. We show that typical building blocks, such as
convolutions and pooling, can be adapted to support WorldFeatures using
available tools. Experiments are presented on the Charades, Olympic Sports, and
Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 datasets, exploring action recognition,
fine-grained recognition, and video stabilization.

Title: Understanding Crowd Flow Movements Using Active-Langevin Model
Authors: Shreetam Behera, Debi Prosad Dogra, Malay Kumar Bandyopadhyay, and
  Partha Pratim Roy
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Crowd flow describes the elementary group behavior of crowds. Understanding
the dynamics behind these movements can help to identify various abnormalities
in crowds. However, developing a crowd model describing these flows is a
challenging task. In this paper, a physics-based model is proposed to describe
the movements in dense crowds. The crowd model is based on active Langevin
equation where the motion points are assumed to be similar to active colloidal
particles in fluids. The model is further augmented with computer-vision
techniques to segment both linear and non-linear motion flows in a dense crowd.
The evaluation of the active Langevin equation-based crowd segmentation has
been done on publicly available crowd videos and on our own videos. The
proposed method is able to segment the flow with lesser optical flow error and
better accuracy in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Highly Efficient Salient Object Detection with 100K Parameters
Authors: Shang-Hua Gao, Yong-Qiang Tan, Ming-Ming Cheng, Chengze Lu, Yunpeng
  Chen, Shuicheng Yan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Salient object detection models often demand a considerable amount of
computation cost to make precise prediction for each pixel, making them hardly
applicable on low-power devices. In this paper, we aim to relieve the
contradiction between computation cost and model performance by improving the
network efficiency to a higher degree. We propose a flexible convolutional
module, namely generalized OctConv (gOctConv), to efficiently utilize both
in-stage and cross-stages multi-scale features, while reducing the
representation redundancy by a novel dynamic weight decay scheme. The effective
dynamic weight decay scheme stably boosts the sparsity of parameters during
training, supports learnable number of channels for each scale in gOctConv,
allowing 80% of parameters reduce with negligible performance drop. Utilizing
gOctConv, we build an extremely light-weighted model, namely CSNet, which
achieves comparable performance with about 0.2% parameters (100k) of large
models on popular salient object detection benchmarks.

Title: Towards High-Fidelity 3D Face Reconstruction from In-the-Wild Images
  Using Graph Convolutional Networks
Authors: Jiangke Lin, Yi Yuan, Tianjia Shao, Kun Zhou
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based methods have achieved great success in
recovering 3D face shapes from single-view images. However, the facial textures
recovered by such methods lack the fidelity as exhibited in the input images.
Recent work demonstrates high-quality facial texture recovering with generative
networks trained from a large-scale database of high-resolution UV maps of face
textures, which is hard to prepare and not publicly available. In this paper,
we introduce a method to reconstruct 3D facial shapes with high-fidelity
textures from single-view images in-the-wild, without the need to capture a
large-scale face texture database. The main idea is to refine the initial
texture generated by a 3DMM based method with facial details from the input
image. To this end, we propose to use graph convolutional networks to
reconstruct the detailed colors for the mesh vertices instead of reconstructing
the UV map. Experiments show that our method can generate high-quality results
and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative
comparisons.

Title: Open Source Computer Vision-based Layer-wise 3D Printing Analysis
Authors: Aliaksei L. Petsiuk, Joshua M. Pearce
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 29 pages, 19 figures
\\
  The paper describes an open source computer vision-based hardware structure
and software algorithm, which analyzes layer-wise the 3-D printing processes,
tracks printing errors, and generates appropriate printer actions to improve
reliability. This approach is built upon multiple-stage monocular image
examination, which allows monitoring both the external shape of the printed
object and internal structure of its layers. Starting with the side-view height
validation, the developed program analyzes the virtual top view for outer shell
contour correspondence using the multi-template matching and iterative closest
point algorithms, as well as inner layer texture quality clustering the
spatial-frequency filter responses with Gaussian mixture models and segmenting
structural anomalies with the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm.
This allows evaluation of both global and local parameters of the printing
modes. The experimentally-verified analysis time per layer is less than one
minute, which can be considered a quasi-real-time process for large prints. The
systems can work as an intelligent printing suspension tool designed to save
time and material. However, the results show the algorithm provides a means to
systematize in situ printing data as a first step in a fully open source
failure correction algorithm for additive manufacturing.

Title: Conditional Convolutions for Instance Segmentation
Authors: Zhi Tian and Chunhua Shen and Hao Chen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We propose a simple yet effective instance segmentation framework, termed
CondInst (conditional convolutions for instance segmentation). Top-performing
instance segmentation methods such as Mask R-CNN rely on ROI operations
(typically ROIPool or ROIAlign) to obtain the final instance masks. In
contrast, we propose to solve instance segmentation from a new perspective.
Instead of using instance-wise ROIs as inputs to a network of fixed weights, we
employ dynamic instance-aware networks, conditioned on instances. CondInst
enjoys two advantages: 1) Instance segmentation is solved by a fully
convolutional network, eliminating the need for ROI cropping and feature
alignment. 2) Due to the much improved capacity of dynamically-generated
conditional convolutions, the mask head can be very compact (e.g., 3 conv.
layers, each having only 8 channels), leading to significantly faster
inference. We demonstrate a simpler instance segmentation method that can
achieve improved performance in both accuracy and inference speed. On the COCO
dataset, we outperform a few recent methods including well-tuned Mask RCNN
baselines, without longer training schedules needed.

Title: ARAE: Adversarially Robust Training of Autoencoders Improves Novelty
  Detection
Authors: Mohammadreza Salehi, Atrin Arya, Barbod Pajoum, Mohammad Otoofi,
  Amirreza Shaeiri, Mohammad Hossein Rohban, Hamid R. Rabiee
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Autoencoders (AE) have recently been widely employed to approach the novelty
detection problem. Trained only on the normal data, the AE is expected to
reconstruct the normal data effectively while fail to regenerate the anomalous
data, which could be utilized for novelty detection. However, in this paper, it
is demonstrated that this does not always hold. AE often generalizes so
perfectly that it can also reconstruct the anomalous data well. To address this
problem, we propose a novel AE that can learn more semantically meaningful
features. Specifically, we exploit the fact that adversarial robustness
promotes learning of meaningful features. Therefore, we force the AE to learn
such features by penalizing networks with a bottleneck layer that is unstable
against adversarial perturbations. We show that despite using a much simpler
architecture in comparison to the prior methods, the proposed AE outperforms or
is competitive to state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets.

Title: Skeleton Based Action Recognition using a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder
  with Constraints of Privileged Information
Authors: Zhize Wu, Thomas Weise, Le Zou, Fei Sun, Ming Tan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recently, with the availability of cost-effective depth cameras coupled with
real-time skeleton estimation, the interest in skeleton-based human action
recognition is renewed. Most of the existing skeletal representation approaches
use either the joint location or the dynamics model. Differing from the
previous studies, we propose a new method called Denoising Autoencoder with
Temporal and Categorical Constraints (DAE_CTC)} to study the skeletal
representation in a view of skeleton reconstruction. Based on the concept of
learning under privileged information, we integrate action categories and
temporal coordinates into a stacked denoising autoencoder in the training
phase, to preserve category and temporal feature, while learning the hidden
representation from a skeleton. Thus, we are able to improve the discriminative
validity of the hidden representation. In order to mitigate the variation
resulting from temporary misalignment, a new method of temporal registration,
called Locally-Warped Sequence Registration (LWSR), is proposed for registering
the sequences of inter- and intra-class actions. We finally represent the
sequences using a Fourier Temporal Pyramid (FTP) representation and perform
classification using a combination of LWSR registration, FTP representation,
and a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results on three
action data sets, namely MSR-Action3D, UTKinect-Action, and Florence3D-Action,
show that our proposal performs better than many existing methods and
comparably to the state of the art.

Title: Low-Rank and Total Variation Regularization and Its Application to Image
  Recovery
Authors: Pawan Goyal, Hussam Al Daas, and Peter Benner
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we study the problem of image recovery from given partial
(corrupted) observations. Recovering an image using a low-rank model has been
an active research area in data analysis and machine learning. But often,
images are not only of low-rank but they also exhibit sparsity in a transformed
space. In this work, we propose a new problem formulation in such a way that we
seek to recover an image that is of low-rank and has sparsity in a transformed
domain. We further discuss various non-convex non-smooth surrogates of the rank
function, leading to a relaxed problem. Then, we present an efficient iterative
scheme to solve the relaxed problem that essentially employs the (weighted)
singular value thresholding at each iteration. Furthermore, we discuss the
convergence properties of the proposed iterative method. We perform extensive
experiments, showing that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art
methodologies in recovering images.

Title: Fairness by Learning Orthogonal Disentangled Representations
Authors: Mhd Hasan Sarhan, Nassir Navab, Abouzar Eslami, Shadi Albarqouni
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Learning discriminative powerful representations is a crucial step for
machine learning systems. Introducing invariance against arbitrary nuisance or
sensitive attributes while performing well on specific tasks is an important
problem in representation learning. This is mostly approached by purging the
sensitive information from learned representations. In this paper, we propose a
novel disentanglement approach to invariant representation problem. We
disentangle the meaningful and sensitive representations by enforcing
orthogonality constraints as a proxy for independence. We explicitly enforce
the meaningful representation to be agnostic to sensitive information by
entropy maximization. The proposed approach is evaluated on five publicly
available datasets and compared with state of the art methods for learning
fairness and invariance achieving the state of the art performance on three
datasets and comparable performance on the rest. Further, we perform an
ablative study to evaluate the effect of each component.

Title: Deformation Flow Based Two-Stream Network for Lip Reading
Authors: Jingyun Xiao, Shuang Yang, Yuanhang Zhang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen

Comments: 7 pages, FG 2020
ACM-class: I.4.9
\\
  Lip reading is the task of recognizing the speech content by analyzing
movements in the lip region when people are speaking. Observing on the
continuity in adjacent frames in the speaking process, and the consistency of
the motion patterns among different speakers when they pronounce the same
phoneme, we model the lip movements in the speaking process as a sequence of
apparent deformations in the lip region. Specifically, we introduce a
Deformation Flow Network (DFN) to learn the deformation flow between adjacent
frames, which directly captures the motion information within the lip region.
The learned deformation flow is then combined with the original grayscale
frames with a two-stream network to perform lip reading. Different from
previous two-stream networks, we make the two streams learn from each other in
the learning process by introducing a bidirectional knowledge distillation loss
to train the two branches jointly. Owing to the complementary cues provided by
different branches, the two-stream network shows a substantial improvement over
using either single branch. A thorough experimental evaluation on two
large-scale lip reading benchmarks is presented with detailed analysis. The
results accord with our motivation, and show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art or comparable performance on these two challenging datasets.

Title: EDC3: Ensemble of Deep-Classifiers using Class-specific Copula functions
  to Improve Semantic Image Segmentation
Authors: Somenath Kuiry, Nibaran Das, Alaka Das, Mita Nasipuri
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In the literature, many fusion techniques are registered for the segmentation
of images, but they primarily focus on observed output or belief score or
probability score of the output classes. In the present work, we have utilized
inter source statistical dependency among different classifiers for ensembling
of different deep learning techniques for semantic segmentation of images. For
this purpose, in the present work, a class-wise Copula-based ensembling method
is newly proposed for solving the multi-class segmentation problem.
Experimentally, it is observed that the performance has improved more for
semantic image segmentation using the proposed class-specific Copula function
than the traditionally used single Copula function for the problem. The
performance is also compared with three state-of-the-art ensembling methods.

Authors: Soumyajyoti Dey, Soham Das, Swarnendu Ghosh, Shyamali Mitra, Sukanta

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  One of the most challenging aspects of medical image analysis is the lack of
a high quantity of annotated data. This makes it difficult for deep learning
algorithms to perform well due to a lack of variations in the input space.
While generative adversarial networks have shown promise in the field of
synthetic data generation, but without a carefully designed prior the
generation procedure can not be performed well. In the proposed approach we
have demonstrated the use of automatically generated segmentation masks as
learnable class-specific priors to guide a conditional GAN for the generation
of patho-realistic samples for cytology image. We have observed that
augmentation of data using the proposed pipeline called "SynCGAN" improves the
performance of state of the art classifiers such as ResNet-152, DenseNet-161,
Inception-V3 significantly.

Title: Cross-modal Multi-task Learning for Graphic Recognition of Caricature
  Face
Authors: Zuheng Ming, Jean-Christophe Burie, Muhammad Muzzamil Luqman
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1911.03341
\\
  Face recognition of realistic visual images has been well studied and made a
significant progress in the recent decade. Unlike the realistic visual images,
the face recognition of the caricatures is far from the performance of the
visual images. This is largely due to the extreme non-rigid distortions of the
caricatures introduced by exaggerating the facial features to strengthen the
characters. The heterogeneous modalities of the caricatures and the visual
images result the caricature-visual face recognition is a cross-modal problem.
In this paper, we propose a method to conduct caricature-visual face
recognition via multi-task learning. Rather than the conventional multi-task
learning with fixed weights of tasks, this work proposes an approach to learn
the weights of tasks according to the importance of tasks. The proposed
multi-task learning with dynamic tasks weights enables to appropriately train
the hard task and easy task instead of being stuck in the over-training easy
task as conventional methods. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed dynamic multi-task learning for cross-modal
caricature-visual face recognition. The performances on the datasets CaVI and
WebCaricature show the superiority over the state-of-art methods.

Title: CPS: Class-level 6D Pose and Shape Estimation From Monocular Images

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Contemporary monocular 6D pose estimation methods can only cope with a
handful of object instances. This naturally limits possible applications as,
for instance, robots need to work with hundreds of different objects in a real
environment. In this paper, we propose the first deep learning approach for
class-wise monocular 6D pose estimation, coupled with metric shape retrieval.
We propose a new loss formulation which directly optimizes over all parameters,
i.e. 3D orientation, translation, scale and shape at the same time. Instead of
decoupling each parameter, we transform the regressed shape, in the form of a
point cloud, to 3D and directly measure its metric misalignment. We
experimentally demonstrate that we can retrieve precise metric point clouds
from a single image, which can also be further processed for e.g. subsequent
rendering. Moreover, we show that our new 3D point cloud loss outperforms all
baselines and gives overall good results despite the inherent ambiguity due to
monocular data.

Authors: Lei Li, Siyu Zhu, Hongbo Fu, Ping Tan, Chiew-Lan Tai
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR 2020
\\
  In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework to learn local multi-view
descriptors for 3D point clouds. To adopt a similar multi-view representation,
existing studies use hand-crafted viewpoints for rendering in a preprocessing
stage, which is detached from the subsequent descriptor learning stage. In our
framework, we integrate the multi-view rendering into neural networks by using
a differentiable renderer, which allows the viewpoints to be optimizable
parameters for capturing more informative local context of interest points. To
obtain discriminative descriptors, we also design a soft-view pooling module to
attentively fuse convolutional features across views. Extensive experiments on
existing 3D registration benchmarks show that our method outperforms existing
local descriptors both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Title: Towards Photo-Realistic Virtual Try-On by Adaptively
  Generating$\leftrightarrow$Preserving Image Content
Authors: Han Yang, Ruimao Zhang, Xiaobao Guo, Wei Liu, Wangmeng Zuo, Ping Luo
Categories: cs.CV cs.GR eess.IV
Comments: CVPR 2020
\\
  Image visual try-on aims at transferring a target clothing image onto a
reference person, and has become a hot topic in recent years. Prior arts
usually focus on preserving the character of a clothing image (e.g. texture,
logo, embroidery) when warping it to arbitrary human pose. However, it remains
a big challenge to generate photo-realistic try-on images when large occlusions
and human poses are presented in the reference person. To address this issue,
we propose a novel visual try-on network, namely Adaptive Content Generating
and Preserving Network (ACGPN). In particular, ACGPN first predicts semantic
layout of the reference image that will be changed after try-on (e.g. long
sleeve shirt$\rightarrow$arm, arm$\rightarrow$jacket), and then determines
whether its image content needs to be generated or preserved according to the
predicted semantic layout, leading to photo-realistic try-on and rich clothing
details. ACGPN generally involves three major modules. First, a semantic layout
generation module utilizes semantic segmentation of the reference image to
progressively predict the desired semantic layout after try-on. Second, a
clothes warping module warps clothing images according to the generated
semantic layout, where a second-order difference constraint is introduced to
stabilize the warping process during training. Third, an inpainting module for
content fusion integrates all information (e.g. reference image, semantic
layout, warped clothes) to adaptively produce each semantic part of human body.
In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, ACGPN can generate
photo-realistic images with much better perceptual quality and richer
fine-details.

Title: SASL: Saliency-Adaptive Sparsity Learning for Neural Network
  Acceleration
Authors: Jun Shi, Jianfeng Xu, Kazuyuki Tasaka, Zhibo Chen
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Accelerating the inference speed of CNNs is critical to their deployment in
real-world applications. Among all the pruning approaches, those implementing a
sparsity learning framework have shown to be effective as they learn and prune
the models in an end-to-end data-driven manner. However, these works impose the
same sparsity regularization on all filters indiscriminately, which can hardly
result in an optimal structure-sparse network. In this paper, we propose a
Saliency-Adaptive Sparsity Learning (SASL) approach for further optimization. A
novel and effective estimation of each filter, i.e., saliency, is designed,
which is measured from two aspects: the importance for the prediction
performance and the consumed computational resources. During sparsity learning,
the regularization strength is adjusted according to the saliency, so our
optimized format can better preserve the prediction performance while zeroing
out more computation-heavy filters. The calculation for saliency introduces
minimum overhead to the training process, which means our SASL is very
efficient. During the pruning phase, in order to optimize the proposed
data-dependent criterion, a hard sample mining strategy is utilized, which
shows higher effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superior performance of our method. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012 dataset, our
approach can reduce 49.7% FLOPs of ResNet-50 with very negligible 0.39% top-1
and 0.05% top-5 accuracy degradation.

Title: Cascade EF-GAN: Progressive Facial Expression Editing with Local Focuses
Authors: Rongliang Wu, Gongjie Zhang, Shijian Lu, Tao Chen
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) have shown remarkable
improvements for facial expression editing. However, current methods are still
prone to generate artifacts and blurs around expression-intensive regions, and
often introduce undesired overlapping artifacts while handling large-gap
expression transformations such as transformation from furious to laughing. To
address these limitations, we propose Cascade Expression Focal GAN (Cascade
EF-GAN), a novel network that performs progressive facial expression editing
with local expression focuses. The introduction of the local focus enables the
Cascade EF-GAN to better preserve identity-related features and details around
eyes, noses and mouths, which further helps reduce artifacts and blurs within
the generated facial images. In addition, an innovative cascade transformation
strategy is designed by dividing a large facial expression transformation into
multiple small ones in cascade, which helps suppress overlapping artifacts and
produce more realistic editing while dealing with large-gap expression
transformations. Extensive experiments over two publicly available facial
expression datasets show that our proposed Cascade EF-GAN achieves superior
performance for facial expression editing.

automation. In a series of four studies, we explored the experiential costs of
everyday automation and strategies of how to design technology to reconcile
experience with the advantages of ever more powerful automation.

Title: Positive Work Practices. Opportunities and Challenges in Designing
  Meaningful Work-related Technology
Authors: Matthias Laschke and Alarith Uhde and Marc Hassenzahl
Categories: cs.CY cs.HC
Comments: 5 pages, to be published in Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI
  Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems
\\
  Work is a rich source of meaning. However, beyond organizational changes,
most approaches in the research field of Meaningful Work neglected the power of
work-related technology to increase meaning. Using two cases as examples, this
paper proposes a wellbeing-driven approach to the design of work-related
technology. Despite the positive results of our cases, we argue that the use of
technology as a means of increasing meaning in the workplace is still in its
infancy.

Title: Undergraduate Student Research With Low Faculty Cost
Authors: Sindhu Kutty, Mark Guzdial
Categories: cs.CY
\\
  Undergraduates are unlikely to even consider graduate research in Computer
Science if they do not know what Computer Science research is. Many programs
aimed at introducing undergraduate to research are structured like graduate
research programs, with a small number of undergraduates working with a faculty
advisor. Further, females, under-represented minorities, and first generation
students may be too intimidated or the idea of research may be too amorphous,
so that they miss out on these programs. As a consequence, we lose out on
opportunities for greater diversity in CS research. We have started a pilot
program in our department where a larger number of students (close to two
dozen) work with a single faculty member as part of a research group focused on
Machine Learning and related areas. The goal of this program is not to convince
students to pursue a research career but rather to enable them to make a more
informed decision about what role they would like research to play in their
future. In order to evaluate our approach, we elicited student experience via
two anonymized exit surveys. Students report that they develop a better
understanding of what research in Computer Science is. Their interest in
research was increased as was their reported confidence in their ability to do
research, although not all students wanted to further pursue computer science
research opportunities. Given the reported experience of female students, this
program can offer a starting point for greater diversity in CS research.

  The Covid-19 outbreak threatens to saturate healthcare systems in most
Western countries. We describe how digital technologies may be used to
automatically and remotely monitor patients at home. Patients answer simple
self-reported questionnaires and their data is transmitted, in real time, to a
Command Centre in the nearest reference hospital. Patient reported data are
automatically filtered by algorithms to identify those with early warning
signs. Open-source code of all software components required to deploy the
remote digital monitoring platform and Command Centres is available.

Title: PALS: Plesiochronous and Locally Synchronous Systems
Authors: Johannes Bund, Matthias F\"ugger, Christoph Lenzen, Moti Medina, Will
  Rosenbaum
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Consider an arbitrary network of communicating modules on a chip, each
requiring a local signal telling it when to execute a computational step. There
are three common solutions to generating such a local clock signal: (i) by
deriving it from a single, central clock source, (ii) by local, free-running
oscillators, or (iii) by handshaking between neighboring modules. Conceptually,
each of these solutions is the result of a perceived dichotomy in which
(sub)systems are either clocked or fully asynchronous, suggesting that the
designer's choice is limited to deciding where to draw the line between
synchronous and asynchronous design. In contrast, we take the view that the
better question to ask is how synchronous the system can and should be. Based
on a distributed clock synchronization algorithm, we present a novel design
providing modules with local clocks whose frequency bounds are almost as good
as those of corresponding free-running oscillators, yet neighboring modules are
guaranteed to have a phase offset substantially smaller than one clock cycle.
Concretely, parameters obtained from a 15nm ASIC implementation running at 2GHz
yield mathematical worst-case bounds of 30ps on phase offset for a 32x32 node
grid network.

Title: Topology Dependent Bounds For FAQs
Authors: Michael Langberg, Shi Li, Sai Vikneshwar Mani Jayaraman, and Atri
  Rudra
Categories: cs.DC cs.CC cs.DB
Comments: A conference version was presented at PODS 2019
DOI: 10.1145/3294052.3319686
\\
  In this paper, we prove topology dependent bounds on the number of rounds
needed to compute Functional Aggregate Queries (FAQs) studied by Abo Khamis et
al. [PODS 2016] in a synchronous distributed network under the model considered
by Chattopadhyay et al. [FOCS 2014, SODA 2017]. Unlike the recent work on
computing database queries in the Massively Parallel Computation model, in the
model of Chattopadhyay et al., nodes can communicate only via private
point-to-point channels and we are interested in bounds that work over an {\em
arbitrary} communication topology. This is the first work to consider more
practically motivated problems in this distributed model. For the sake of
exposition, we focus on two special problems in this paper: Boolean Conjunctive
Query (BCQ) and computing variable/factor marginals in Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs). We obtain tight bounds on the number of rounds needed to compute
such queries as long as the underlying hypergraph of the query is
$O(1)$-degenerate and has $O(1)$-arity. In particular, the $O(1)$-degeneracy
condition covers most well-studied queries that are efficiently computable in
the centralized computation model like queries with constant treewidth. These
tight bounds depend on a new notion of `width' (namely internal-node-width) for
Generalized Hypertree Decompositions (GHDs) of acyclic hypergraphs, which
minimizes the number of internal nodes in a sub-class of GHDs. To the best of
our knowledge, this width has not been studied explicitly in the theoretical
database literature. Finally, we consider the problem of computing the product
of a vector with a chain of matrices and prove tight bounds on its round
complexity (over the finite field of two elements) using a novel min-entropy
based argument.

Title: Distributed Hierarchical GPU Parameter Server for Massive Scale Deep
  Learning Ads Systems
Authors: Weijie Zhao, Deping Xie, Ronglai Jia, Yulei Qian, Ruiquan Ding,
  Mingming Sun, Ping Li
Categories: cs.DC cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Neural networks of ads systems usually take input from multiple resources,
e.g., query-ad relevance, ad features and user portraits. These inputs are
encoded into one-hot or multi-hot binary features, with typically only a tiny
fraction of nonzero feature values per example. Deep learning models in online
advertising industries can have terabyte-scale parameters that do not fit in
the GPU memory nor the CPU main memory on a computing node. For example, a
sponsored online advertising system can contain more than $10^{11}$ sparse
features, making the neural network a massive model with around 10 TB
parameters. In this paper, we introduce a distributed GPU hierarchical
parameter server for massive scale deep learning ads systems. We propose a
hierarchical workflow that utilizes GPU High-Bandwidth Memory, CPU main memory
and SSD as 3-layer hierarchical storage. All the neural network training
computations are contained in GPUs. Extensive experiments on real-world data
confirm the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed system. A 4-node
hierarchical GPU parameter server can train a model more than 2X faster than a
150-node in-memory distributed parameter server in an MPI cluster. In addition,
the price-performance ratio of our proposed system is 4-9 times better than an
MPI-cluster solution.

Title: Trends in Development of Databases and Blockchain
Authors: Mayank Raikwar, Danilo Gligoroski, Goran Velinov
Categories: cs.DC cs.CR cs.DB
Comments: Accepted in The Second International Workshop on Blockchain
  Applications and Theory (BAT 2020)
\\
  This work is about the mutual influence between two technologies: Databases
and Blockchain. It addresses two questions: 1. How the database technology has
influenced the development of blockchain technology?, and 2. How blockchain
technology has influenced the introduction of new functionalities in some
modern databases? For the first question, we explain how database technology
contributes to blockchain technology by unlocking different features such as
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) transactional
consistency, rich queries, real-time analytics, and low latency. We explain how
the CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem known for
databases influenced the DCS (Decentralization, Consistency, Scalability)
theorem for the blockchain systems. By using an analogous relaxation approach
as it was used for the proof of the CAP theorem, we postulate a
"DCS-satisfiability conjecture." For the second question, we review different
databases that are designed specifically for blockchain and provide most of the
blockchain functionality like immutability, privacy, censorship resistance,
along with database features.

Title: Computing a Minimum-Cost $k$-hop Steiner Tree in Tree-Like Metrics
Authors: Martin B\"ohm, Ruben Hoeksma, Nicole Megow, Lukas N\"olke, Bertrand
  Simon
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We consider the problem of computing a Steiner tree of minimum cost under a
$k$-hop constraint which requires the depth of the tree to be at most $k$. Our
main result is an exact algorithm for metrics induced by graphs of bounded
treewidth that runs in time $n^{O(k)}$. For the special case of a path, we give
a simple algorithm that solves the problem in polynomial time, even if $k$ is
part of the input. The main result can be used to obtain, in quasi-polynomial
time, a near-optimal solution that violates the $k$-hop constraint by at most
one hop for more general metrics induced by graphs of bounded highway
dimension.

Title: Regular Intersection Emptiness of Graph Problems: Finding a Needle in a
  Haystack of Graphs with the Help of Automata
Authors: Petra Wolf, Henning Fernau
Categories: cs.FL cs.CL
\\
  The Int_reg-problem of a combinatorial problem P asks, given a
nondeterministic automaton M as input, whether the language L(M) accepted by M
contains any positive instance of the problem P. We consider the
Int_reg-problem for a number of different graph problems and give general
criteria that give decision procedures for these Int_reg-problems. To achieve
this goal, we consider a natural graph encoding so that the language of all
graph encodings is regular. Then, we draw the connection between classical
pumping- and interchange-arguments from the field of formal language theory
with the graph operations induced on the encoded graph. Our techniques apply
among others to the Int_reg-problem of well-known graph problems like Vertex
Cover and Independent Set, as well as to subgraph problems, graph-edit problems
and graph-partitioning problems, including coloring problems.

Title: Can Society Function Without Ethical Agents? An Informational
  Perspective
Authors: Bruno Strulovici
Categories: cs.GT econ.TH
\\
  Many facts are learned through the intermediation of individuals with special
access to information, such as law enforcement officers, officials with a
security clearance, or experts with specific knowledge. This paper considers
whether societies can learn about such facts when information is cheap to
manipulate, produced sequentially, and these individuals are devoid of ethical
motive. The answer depends on an "information attrition" condition pertaining
to the amount of evidence available which distinguishes, for example, between
reproducible scientific evidence and the evidence generated in a crime.
Applications to institution enforcement, social cohesion, scientific progress,
and historical revisionism are discussed.

Title: Discrete Richman-bidding Scoring Games

Categories: cs.GT math.CO
Comments: 26 Pages, 6 figures
MSC-class: 91A46, 11B75, 91A05
\\
  We study zero-sum (combinatorial) games, within the framework of so-called
Richman auctions (Lazarus et al. 1996) namely, we modify the alternating play
scoring ruleset Cumulative Subtraction (CS) (Cohensius et al. 2019), to a
discrete bidding scheme (similar to Develin and Payne 2010). Players bid to
move and the player with the highest bid wins the move, and hands over the
winning bidding amount to the other player. The new game is dubbed Bidding
Cumulative Subtraction (BCS). In so-called unitary games, players remove
exactly one item out of a single heap of identical items, until the heap is
empty, and their actions contribute to a common score, which increases or
decreases by one unit depending on whether the maximizing player won the turn
or not. We show that there is a unique bidding equilibrium for a much larger
class of games, that generalize standard scoring play in the literature. We
prove that for all sufficiently large heap sizes, the equilibrium outcomes of
unitary BCS are eventually periodic, with period 2, and we show that the
periodicity appears at the latest for heaps of sizes quadratic in the total
budget.

Title: Stackelberg Equilibria for Two-Player Network Routing Games on Parallel
  Networks
Authors: David Grimsman, Joao P Hespanha, Jason R Marden
Categories: cs.GT cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  We consider a two-player zero-sum network routing game in which a router
wants to maximize the amount of legitimate traffic that flows from a given
source node to a destination node and an attacker wants to block as much
legitimate traffic as possible by flooding the network with malicious traffic.
We address scenarios with asymmetric information, in which the router must
reveal its policy before the attacker decides how to distribute the malicious
traffic among the network links, which is naturally modeled by the notion of
Stackelberg equilibria. The paper focuses on parallel networks, and includes
three main contributions: we show that computing the optimal attack policy
against a given routing policy is an NP-hard problem; we establish conditions
under which the Stackelberg equilibria lead to no regret; and we provide a
metric that can be used to quantify how uncertainty about the attacker's
capabilities limits the router's performance.

Title: Escaping Cannibalization? Correlation-Robust Pricing for a Unit-Demand
  Buyer
Authors: Moshe Babaioff, Michal Feldman, Yannai A. Gonczarowski, Brendan
  Lucier, Inbal Talgam-Cohen
Categories: cs.GT cs.CC econ.TH
\\
  A single seller wishes to sell $n$ items to a single unit-demand buyer. We
consider a robust version of this revenue-maximization pricing problem, where
the seller knows the buyer's marginal distributions of values for each item,
but not the joint distribution, and wishes to maximize worst-case revenue over
all possible correlation structures. We devise a computationally efficient
(polynomial in the support size of the marginals) algorithm that computes the
worst-case joint distribution for any choice of item prices. And yet, in sharp
contrast to the additive buyer case (Carroll, 2017), we show that it is NP-hard
to approximate the optimal choice of prices to within any factor better than
$n^{1/2-\epsilon}$. For the special case of marginal distributions that satisfy
the monotone hazard rate property, we show how to guarantee a constant fraction
of the optimal worst-case revenue using item pricing; this pricing equates
revenue across all possible correlations and can be computed efficiently.

\\
  A new bookkeeping system called Jiskefet is being developed for A Large Ion
Collider Experiment (ALICE) during Long Shutdown 2, to be in production until
the end of LHC Run 4 (2029). Jiskefet unifies two functionalities: a)
gathering, storing and presenting metadata associated with the operations of
the ALICE experiment and b) tracking the asynchronous processing of the physics
data. It will replace the existing ALICE Electronic Logbook and AliMonitor,
allowing for a technology refresh and the inclusion of new features based on
the experience collected during Run 1 and Run 2. The front end leverages web
technologies much in use nowadays such as TypeScript and NodeJS and is adaptive
to various clients such as tablets, mobile devices and other screens. The back
end includes an OpenAPI specification based REST API and a relational database.
This paper will describe the organization of the work done by various student
teams who work on Jiskefet in sequential and parallel semesters and how
continuity is guaranteed by using guidelines on coding, documentation and
development. It will also describe the current status of the development, the
initial experience in detector stand-alone commissioning setups and the future
plans.

Title: Analyzing the Impact of Automated User Assistance Systems: A Systematic
  Review
Authors: Murat Acar and Bedir Tekinerdogan
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 22 pages
\\
  Context: User assistance is generally defined as the guided assistance to a
user of a software system in order to help accomplish tasks and enhance user
experience. Automated user assistance systems are equipped with online help
system that provides information to the user in an electronic format and which
can be opened directly in the application. Various different automated user
assistance approaches have been proposed in the literature. However, there has
been no attempt to systematically review and report the impact of automated
user assistance systems. Objective: The overall objective of this systematic
review is to identify the state of art in automated user assistance systems,
and describe the reported evidence for automated user assistance. Method: A
systematic literature review is conducted by a multiphase study selection
process using the published literature since 2002. Results: We reviewed 575
papers that are discovered using a well-planned review protocol, and 31 of them
were assessed as primary studies related to our research questions.
Conclusions: Our study shows that user assistance systems can provide important
benefits for the user but still more research is required in this domain.

Title: Natural Language Interaction to Facilitate Mental Models of Remote
  Robots
Authors: Francisco J. Chiyah Garcia, Jos\'e Lopes, Helen Hastie
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI
Comments: In Workshop on Mental Models of Robots at HRI 2020
\\
  Increasingly complex and autonomous robots are being deployed in real-world
environments with far-reaching consequences. High-stakes scenarios, such as
emergency response or offshore energy platform and nuclear inspections, require
robot operators to have clear mental models of what the robots can and can't
do. However, operators are often not the original designers of the robots and
thus, they do not necessarily have such clear mental models, especially if they
are novice users. This lack of mental model clarity can slow adoption and can
negatively impact human-machine teaming. We propose that interaction with a
conversational assistant, who acts as a mediator, can help the user with
understanding the functionality of remote robots and increase transparency
through natural language explanations, as well as facilitate the evaluation of
operators' mental models.

Title: Reinforced Negative Sampling over Knowledge Graph for Recommendation

Comments: WWW 2020 oral presentation

\\
  Properly handling missing data is a fundamental challenge in recommendation.
Most present works perform negative sampling from unobserved data to supply the
training of recommender models with negative signals. Nevertheless, existing
negative sampling strategies, either static or adaptive ones, are insufficient
to yield high-quality negative samples --- both informative to model training
and reflective of user real needs. In this work, we hypothesize that item
knowledge graph (KG), which provides rich relations among items and KG
entities, could be useful to infer informative and factual negative samples.
Towards this end, we develop a new negative sampling model, Knowledge Graph
Policy Network (KGPolicy), which works as a reinforcement learning agent to
explore high-quality negatives. Specifically, by conducting our designed
exploration operations, it navigates from the target positive interaction,
adaptively receives knowledge-aware negative signals, and ultimately yields a
potential negative item to train the recommender. We tested on a matrix
factorization (MF) model equipped with KGPolicy, and it achieves significant
improvements over both state-of-the-art sampling methods like DNS and IRGAN,
and KG-enhanced recommender models like KGAT. Further analyses from different
angles provide insights of knowledge-aware sampling. We release the codes and
datasets at https://github.com/xiangwang1223/kgpolicy.

Title: Needmining: Identifying micro blog data containing customer needs
Authors: Niklas K\"uhl, Jan Scheurenbrand, Gerhard Satzger
Categories: cs.IR cs.LG
Comments: European Conference on Information Systems
\\
  The design of new products and services starts with the identification of
needs of potential customers or users. Many existing methods like observations,
surveys, and experiments draw upon specific efforts to elicit unsatisfied needs
from individuals. At the same time, a huge amount of user-generated content in
micro blogs is freely accessible at no cost. While this information is already
analyzed to monitor sentiments towards existing offerings, it has not yet been
tapped for the elicitation of needs. In this paper, we lay an important
foundation for this endeavor: we propose a Machine Learning approach to
identify those posts that do express needs. Our evaluation of tweets in the
e-mobility domain demonstrates that the small share of relevant tweets can be
identified with remarkable precision or recall results. Applied to huge data
sets, the developed method should enable scalable need elicitation support for
innovation managers - across thousands of users, and thus augment the service
design tool set available to him.

Title: Asymptotic Expansions of Smooth R\'{e}nyi Entropies and Their
  Applications
Authors: Yuta Sakai, Vincent Y. F. Tan
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 56 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory

  This study considers the unconditional smooth R\'{e}nyi entropy, the smooth
conditional R\'{e}nyi entropy proposed by Kuzuoka [\emph{IEEE Trans.\ Inf.\
Theory}, vol.~66, no.~3, pp.~1674--1690, 2020], and a new quantity which we
term the conditional smooth R\'{e}nyi entropy. In particular, we examine
asymptotic expansions of these entropies when the underlying source with its
side-information is stationary and memoryless. Using these smooth R\'{e}nyi
entropies, we establish one-shot coding theorems of several
information-theoretic problems: Campbell's source coding, guessing problems,
and task encoding problems, all allowing errors. In each problem, we consider
two error formalisms: the average and maximum error criteria, where the
averaging and maximization are taken with respect to the side-information of
the source. Applying our asymptotic expansions to the derived one-shot coding
theorems, we derive various asymptotic fundamental limits for these problems
when their error probabilities are allowed to be non-vanishing. We show that,
in non-degenerate settings, the first-order fundamental limits differ under the
average and maximum error criteria. This is in contrast to a different but
related setting considered by the present authors (for variable-length
conditional source coding allowing errors) in which the first-order terms are
identical but the second-order terms are different under these criteria.

Title: Random NOMA With Cross-Slot Successive Interference Cancellation Packet
  Recovery
Authors: Zhaoji Zhang, Ying Li, Guanghui Song, Chau Yuen, and Yong Liang Guan
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: accepted by IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, 5 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Conventional power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) relies on
precise power control, which requires real-time channel state information at
transmitters. This requirement severely limits its application to future
wireless communication systems. To address this problem, we consider NOMA
without power allocation, where we exploit the random channel fading and
opportunistically perform successive interference cancellation (SIC) detection.
To mitigate the multi-user interference, we propose a random NOMA where users
randomly transmit their data packets with a certain probability. Then a
cross-slot SIC packet recovery scheme is proposed to recover transmitted data
packets. We model the cross-slot SIC packet recovery as a Markov process, and
provide a throughput analysis, based on which the sum rate is maximized by
jointly optimizing the transmission probability and the encoding rate of users.

Title: Data-Driven Deep Learning to Design Pilot and Channel Estimator For
  Massive MIMO
Authors: Xisuo Ma, Zhen Gao
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT
Comments: 6 pages 4 fugures;accepted by IEEE Transactions on Vehicular
  Technology
\\
  In this paper, we propose a data-driven deep learning (DL) approach to
jointly design the pilot signals and channel estimator for wideband massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. By exploiting the angular-domain
compressibility of massive MIMO channels, the conceived DL framework can
reliably reconstruct the high-dimensional channels from the under-determined
measurements. Specifically, we design an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN)
architecture composed of dimensionality reduction network and reconstruction
network to respectively mimic the pilot signals and channel estimator, which
can be acquired by data-driven deep learning. For the dimensionality reduction
network, we design a fully-connected layer by compressing the high-dimensional
massive MIMO channel vector as input to low-dimensional received measurements,
where the weights are regarded as the pilot signals. For the reconstruction
network, we design a fully-connected layer followed by multiple cascaded
convolutional layers, which will reconstruct the high-dimensional channel as
the output. By defining the mean square error between input and output as loss
function, we leverage Adam algorithm to train the end-to-end DNN aforementioned
with extensive channel samples. In this way, both the pilot signals and channel
estimator can be simultaneously obtained. The simulation results demonstrate
that the superiority of the proposed solution over state-of-the-art compressive
sensing approaches.

\\
  Outlier detection is an important task for various data mining applications.
Current outlier detection techniques are often manually designed for specific
domains, requiring large human efforts of database setup, algorithm selection,
and hyper-parameter tuning. To fill this gap, we present PyODDS, an automated
end-to-end Python system for Outlier Detection with Database Support, which
automatically optimizes an outlier detection pipeline for a new data source at
hand. Specifically, we define the search space in the outlier detection
pipeline, and produce a search strategy within the given search space. PyODDS
enables end-to-end executions based on an Apache Spark backend server and a
light-weight database. It also provides unified interfaces and visualizations
for users with or without data science or machine learning background. In
particular, we demonstrate PyODDS on several real-world datasets, with
quantification analysis and visualization results.

Title: Privacy Preserving Point-of-interest Recommendation Using Decentralized
  Matrix Factorization
Authors: Chaochao Chen, Ziqi Liu, Peilin Zhao, Jun Zhou, Xiaolong Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by AAAI'18
\\
  Points of interest (POI) recommendation has been drawn much attention
recently due to the increasing popularity of location-based networks, e.g.,
Foursquare and Yelp. Among the existing approaches to POI recommendation,
Matrix Factorization (MF) based techniques have proven to be effective.
However, existing MF approaches suffer from two major problems: (1) Expensive
computations and storages due to the centralized model training mechanism: the
centralized learners have to maintain the whole user-item rating matrix, and
potentially huge low rank matrices. (2) Privacy issues: the users' preferences
are at risk of leaking to malicious attackers via the centralized learner. To
solve these, we present a Decentralized MF (DMF) framework for POI
recommendation. Specifically, instead of maintaining all the low rank matrices
and sensitive rating data for training, we propose a random walk based
decentralized training technique to train MF models on each user's end, e.g.,
cell phone and Pad. By doing so, the ratings of each user are still kept on
one's own hand, and moreover, decentralized learning can be taken as
distributed learning with multi-learners (users), and thus alleviates the
computation and storage issue. Experimental results on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that, comparing with the classic and state-of-the-art latent factor
models, DMF significantly improvements the recommendation performance in terms
of precision and recall.

Title: Fisher Deep Domain Adaptation
Authors: Yinghua Zhang, Yu Zhang, Ying Wei, Kun Bai, Yangqiu Song, Qiang Yang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep domain adaptation models learn a neural network in an unlabeled target
domain by leveraging the knowledge from a labeled source domain. This can be
achieved by learning a domain-invariant feature space. Though the learned
representations are separable in the source domain, they usually have a large
variance and samples with different class labels tend to overlap in the target
domain, which yields suboptimal adaptation performance. To fill the gap, a
Fisher loss is proposed to learn discriminative representations which are
within-class compact and between-class separable. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets show that the Fisher loss is a general and effective loss
for deep domain adaptation. Noticeable improvements are brought when it is used
together with widely adopted transfer criteria, including MMD, CORAL and domain
adversarial loss. For example, an absolute improvement of 6.67% in terms of the
mean accuracy is attained when the Fisher loss is used together with the domain
adversarial loss on the Office-Home dataset.

Title: Machine Learning on Volatile Instances
Authors: Xiaoxi Zhang, Jianyu Wang, Gauri Joshi, and Carlee Joe-Wong
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC stat.ML
\\
  Due to the massive size of the neural network models and training datasets
used in machine learning today, it is imperative to distribute stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) by splitting up tasks such as gradient evaluation across
multiple worker nodes. However, running distributed SGD can be prohibitively
expensive because it may require specialized computing resources such as GPUs
for extended periods of time. We propose cost-effective strategies to exploit
volatile cloud instances that are cheaper than standard instances, but may be
interrupted by higher priority workloads. To the best of our knowledge, this
work is the first to quantify how variations in the number of active worker
nodes (as a result of preemption) affects SGD convergence and the time to train
the model. By understanding these trade-offs between preemption probability of
the instances, accuracy, and training time, we are able to derive practical
strategies for configuring distributed SGD jobs on volatile instances such as
Amazon EC2 spot instances and other preemptible cloud instances. Experimental
results show that our strategies achieve good training performance at
substantially lower cost.

Title: Hyper-Parameter Optimization: A Review of Algorithms and Applications
Authors: Tong Yu and Hong Zhu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Since deep neural networks were developed, they have made huge contributions
to everyday lives. Machine learning provides more rational advice than humans
are capable of in almost every aspect of daily life. However, despite this
achievement, the design and training of neural networks are still challenging
and unpredictable procedures. To lower the technical thresholds for common
users, automated hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) has become a popular topic
in both academic and industrial areas. This paper provides a review of the most
essential topics on HPO. The first section introduces the key hyper-parameters
related to model training and structure, and discusses their importance and
methods to define the value range. Then, the research focuses on major
optimization algorithms and their applicability, covering their efficiency and
accuracy especially for deep learning networks. This study next reviews major
services and toolkits for HPO, comparing their support for state-of-the-art
searching algorithms, feasibility with major deep learning frameworks, and
extensibility for new modules designed by users. The paper concludes with
problems that exist when HPO is applied to deep learning, a comparison between
optimization algorithms, and prominent approaches for model evaluation with
limited computational resources.

  Deep learning models on graphs have achieved remarkable performance in
various graph analysis tasks, e.g., node classification, link prediction and
graph clustering. However, they expose uncertainty and unreliability against
the well-designed inputs, i.e., adversarial examples. Accordingly, various
studies have emerged for both attack and defense addressed in different graph
analysis tasks, leading to the arms race in graph adversarial learning. For
instance, the attacker has poisoning and evasion attack, and the defense group
correspondingly has preprocessing- and adversarial- based methods. Despite the
booming works, there still lacks a unified problem definition and a
comprehensive review. To bridge this gap, we investigate and summarize the
existing works on graph adversarial learning tasks systemically. Specifically,
we survey and unify the existing works w.r.t. attack and defense in graph
analysis tasks, and give proper definitions and taxonomies at the same time.
Besides, we emphasize the importance of related evaluation metrics, and
investigate and summarize them comprehensively. Hopefully, our works can serve
as a reference for the relevant researchers, thus providing assistance for
their studies. More details of our works are available at

\\
  Outlier detection is a key data mining task for identifying abnormal objects
from massive data. Due to the high expense of acquiring ground truth,
practitioners lean towards building a large number of unsupervised models for
further combination and analysis, rather than relying on a single model out of
reliability consideration. However, this poses scalability challenge to
high-dimensional, large datasets. In this study, we propose a three-module
framework called SUOD to address the challenge. It can accelerate outlier model
building and scoring when a large number of base models are used. It focuses on
three complementary levels to speed up the process while controlling prediction
performance degradation at the same time. At the data level, its Random
Projection module projects high-dimensional data onto diversified
low-dimensional subspaces while preserving the pairwise distance relationship.
At the model level, SUOD's Pseudo-supervised Approximation module can
approximate and replace fitted unsupervised models by low-cost supervised
regressors, leading to fast offline scoring on new-coming samples with better
interpretability. At the system level, Balanced Parallel Scheduling module
mitigates the workload imbalance within distributed systems, which is helpful
for heterogeneous outlier ensembles.
  As the three modules are independent with different focuses, they have great
flexibility to "mix and match". The framework is also designed with
extensibility in mind. One may customize each module based on specific use
cases, and the framework may be generalized to other learning tasks as well.
Extensive experiments on more than 20 benchmark datasets demonstrate SUOD's
effectiveness. In addition, a real-world deployment system on fraudulent claim
analysis by IQVIA is also discussed. The full framework, documentation, and
examples are openly shared at https://github.com/yzhao062/SUOD.

Title: Towards Practical Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Adversarial Training
Authors: Bai Li, Shiqi Wang, Yunhan Jia, Yantao Lu, Zhenyu Zhong, Lawrence
  Carin, Suman Jana
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Recent research has proposed the lottery ticket hypothesis, suggesting that
for a deep neural network, there exist trainable sub-networks performing
equally or better than the original model with commensurate training steps.
While this discovery is insightful, finding proper sub-networks requires
iterative training and pruning. The high cost incurred limits the applications
of the lottery ticket hypothesis. We show there exists a subset of the
aforementioned sub-networks that converge significantly faster during the
training process and thus can mitigate the cost issue. We conduct extensive
experiments to show such sub-networks consistently exist across various model
structures for a restrictive setting of hyperparameters ($e.g.$, carefully
selected learning rate, pruning ratio, and model capacity). As a practical
application of our findings, we demonstrate that such sub-networks can help in
cutting down the total time of adversarial training, a standard approach to
improve robustness, by up to 49\% on CIFAR-10 to achieve the state-of-the-art
robustness.

Title: IG-RL: Inductive Graph Reinforcement Learning for Massive-Scale Traffic
  Signal Control
Authors: Fran\c{c}ois-Xavier Devailly, Denis Larocque, Laurent Charlin
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages 9 figures, 1 table
\\
  Scaling adaptive traffic-signal control involves dealing with combinatorial
state and action spaces. Multi-agent reinforcement learning attempts to address
this challenge by distributing control to specialized agents. However,
specialization hinders generalization and transferability, and the
computational graphs underlying neural-networks architectures---dominating in
the multi-agent setting---do not offer the flexibility to handle an arbitrary
number of entities which changes both between road networks, and over time as
vehicles traverse the network. We introduce Inductive Graph Reinforcement
Learning (IG-RL) based on graph-convolutional networks which adapts to the
structure of any road network, to learn detailed representations of
traffic-controllers and their surroundings. Our decentralized approach enables
learning of a transferable-adaptive-traffic-signal-control policy. After being
trained on an arbitrary set of road networks, our model can generalize to new
road networks, traffic distributions, and traffic regimes, with no additional
training and a constant number of parameters, enabling greater scalability
compared to prior methods. Furthermore, our approach can exploit the
granularity of available data by capturing the (dynamic) demand at both the
lane and the vehicle levels. The proposed method is tested on both road
networks and traffic settings never experienced during training. We compare
IG-RL to multi-agent reinforcement learning and domain-specific baselines. In
both synthetic road networks and in a larger experiment involving the control
of the 3,971 traffic signals of Manhattan, we show that different
instantiations of IG-RL outperform baselines.

  Mixture Density Networks are a tried and tested tool for modelling
conditional probability distributions. As such, they constitute a great
baseline for novel approaches to this problem. In the standard formulation, an
MDN takes some input and outputs parameters for a Gaussian mixture model with
restrictions on the mixture components' covariance. Since covariance between
random variables is a central issue in the conditional modeling problems we
were investigating, I derived and implemented an MDN formulation with
unrestricted covariances. It is likely that this has been done before, but I
could not find any resources online. For this reason, I have documented my
approach in the form of this technical report, in hopes that it may be useful

Title: Learning Algebraic Multigrid Using Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Ilay Luz, Meirav Galun, Haggai Maron, Ronen Basri, Irad Yavneh
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Efficient numerical solvers for sparse linear systems are crucial in science
and engineering. One of the fastest methods for solving large-scale sparse
linear systems is algebraic multigrid (AMG). The main challenge in the
construction of AMG algorithms is the selection of the prolongation operator --
a problem-dependent sparse matrix which governs the multiscale hierarchy of the
solver and is critical to its efficiency. Over many years, numerous methods
have been developed for this task, and yet there is no known single right
answer except in very special cases. Here we propose a framework for learning
AMG prolongation operators for linear systems with sparse symmetric positive
(semi-) definite matrices. We train a single graph neural network to learn a
mapping from an entire class of such matrices to prolongation operators, using
an efficient unsupervised loss function. Experiments on a broad class of
problems demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to classical AMG,
demonstrating the potential utility of neural networks for developing sparse
system solvers.

Title: Fast local linear regression with anchor regularization
Authors: Mathis Petrovich and Makoto Yamada
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Regression is an important task in machine learning and data mining. It has
several applications in various domains, including finance, biomedical, and
computer vision. Recently, network Lasso, which estimates local models by
making clusters using the network information, was proposed and its superior
performance was demonstrated. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective
local model training algorithm called the fast anchor regularized local linear
method (FALL). More specifically, we train a local model for each sample by
regularizing it with precomputed anchor models. The key advantage of the
proposed algorithm is that we can obtain a closed-form solution with only
matrix multiplication; additionally, the proposed algorithm is easily
interpretable, fast to compute and parallelizable. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FALL compares favorably
in terms of accuracy with the state-of-the-art network Lasso algorithm with
significantly smaller training time (two orders of magnitude).

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 17 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Vertex classification is vulnerable to perturbations of both graph topology
and vertex attributes, as shown in recent research. As in other machine
learning domains, concerns about robustness to adversarial manipulation can
prevent potential users from adopting proposed methods when the consequence of
action is very high. This paper considers two topological characteristics of
graphs and explores the way these features affect the amount the adversary must
perturb the graph in order to be successful. We show that, if certain vertices
are included in the training set, it is possible to substantially an
adversary's required perturbation budget. On four citation datasets, we
demonstrate that if the training set includes high degree vertices or vertices
that ensure all unlabeled nodes have neighbors in the training set, we show
that the adversary's budget often increases by a substantial factor---often a
factor of 2 or more---over random training for the Nettack poisoning attack.
Even for especially easy targets (those that are misclassified after just one
or two perturbations), the degradation of performance is much slower, assigning
much lower probabilities to the incorrect classes. In addition, we demonstrate
that this robustness either persists when recently proposed defenses are
applied, or is competitive with the resulting performance improvement for the
defender.

  Optimization problems with an auxiliary latent variable structure in addition

expensive, either in terms of memory (by maintaining the latent variables), or
in terms of runtime (repeated exact inference of latent variables). We aim to
remove the need to maintain the latent variables and propose two formally

\\
  We present Geo2DR, a Python library for unsupervised learning on
graph-structured data using discrete substructure patterns and neural language
models. It contains efficient implementations of popular graph decomposition
algorithms and neural language models in PyTorch which are combined to learn
representations using the distributive hypothesis. Furthermore, Geo2DR comes

capable of learning distributed representations of graphs. This is useful for
replication of existing methods, modification, or even creation of novel
systems. This work serves to present the Geo2DR library and perform a

Title: Querying and Repairing Inconsistent Prioritized Knowledge Bases:
  Complexity Analysis and Links with Abstract Argumentation
Authors: Meghyn Bienvenu and Camille Bourgaux
Categories: cs.LO cs.AI cs.DB
\\
  In this paper, we explore the issue of inconsistency handling over
prioritized knowledge bases (KBs), which consist of an ontology, a set of
facts, and a priority relation between conflicting facts. In the database
setting, a closely related scenario has been studied and led to the definition
of three different notions of optimal repairs (global, Pareto, and completion)
of a prioritized inconsistent database. After transferring the notions of
globally-, Pareto- and completion-optimal repairs to our setting, we study the
data complexity of the core reasoning tasks: query entailment under
inconsistency-tolerant semantics based upon optimal repairs, existence of a
unique optimal repair, and enumeration of all optimal repairs. Our results
provide a nearly complete picture of the data complexity of these tasks for
ontologies formulated in common DL-Lite dialects. The second contribution of
our work is to clarify the relationship between optimal repairs and different
notions of extensions for (set-based) argumentation frameworks. Among our
results, we show that Pareto-optimal repairs correspond precisely to stable
extensions (and often also to preferred extensions), and we propose a novel
semantics for prioritized KBs which is inspired by grounded extensions and
enjoys favourable computational properties. Our study also yields some results
of independent interest concerning preference-based argumentation frameworks.

Title: On monotonic determinacy and rewritability for recursive queries and
  views
Authors: Michael Benedikt, Stanislav Kikot, Piotr Ostropolski-Nalewaja, and
  Miguel Romero
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  A query Q is monotonically determined over a set of views if Q can be
expressed as a monotonic function of the view image. In the case of relational
algebra views and queries, monotonic determinacy coincides with rewritability
as a union of conjunctive queries, and it is decidable in important special
cases, such as for CQ views and queries. We investigate the situation for views
and queries in the recursive query language Datalog. We give both positive and
negative results about the ability to decide monotonic determinacy, and also
about the co-incidence of monotonic determinacy with Datalog rewritability.

Title: The Application of Market-based Multi-Robot Task Allocation to Ambulance
  Dispatch

\\
  Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) is the problem of distributing a set of
tasks to a team of robots with the objective of optimising some criteria, such
as minimising the amount of time or energy spent to complete all the tasks or
maximising the efficiency of the team's joint activity. The exploration of MRTA
methods is typically restricted to laboratory and field experimentation. There
are few existing real-world models in which teams of autonomous mobile robots
are deployed "in the wild", e.g., in industrial settings. In the work presented
here, a market-based MRTA approach is applied to the problem of ambulance
dispatch, where ambulances are allocated in respond to patients' calls for
help. Ambulances and robots are limited (and perhaps scarce), specialised
mobile resources; incidents and tasks represent time-sensitive, specific,
potentially unlimited, precisely-located demands for the services which the
resources provide. Historical data from the London Ambulance Service describing
a set of more than 1 million (anonymised) incidents are used as the basis for
evaluating the predicted performance of the market-based approach versus the
current, largely manual, method of allocating ambulances to incidents.
Experimental results show statistically significant improvement in response
times when using the market-based approach.

  pyMOR is a free software library for model order reduction that includes both

Title: A Non-Iterative Transformation Method for a Class of Free Boundary Value
  Problems Governed by ODEs

Comments: 20 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables

\\
  The aim of this work is to point out that the class of free boundary problems
governed by second order autonomous ordinary differential equations can be
transformed to initial value problems. Interest in the numerical solution of
free boundary problems arises because these are always nonlinear problems. The
theoretical content of this paper is original: results already available in
literature are related to the invariance properties of scaling or spiral groups
of point transformations but here we show how it is also possible to use e
invariance properties of a translation group. We test the proposed algorithm by
solving three problems: a problem describing a rope configuration against an
obstacle, a dynamical problem with a nonlinear force, and a problem related to
the optimal length estimate for tubular flow reactors.

Title: Optimization of Generalized Jacobian Chain Products without Memory
  Constraints
Authors: Uwe Naumann
Categories: math.NA cs.DM cs.NA
Comments: 13 pages
\\
  The efficient computation of Jacobians represents a fundamental challenge in
computational science and engineering. Large-scale modular numerical simulation
programs can be regarded as sequences of evaluations of in our case
differentiable modules with corresponding local Jacobians. The latter are
typically not available. Tangent and adjoint versions of the individual modules
are assumed to be given as results of algorithmic differentiation instead. The
classical (Jacobian) matrix chain product formulation is extended with the
optional evaluation of matrix-free Jacobian-matrix and matrix-Jacobian products
as tangents and adjoints. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm for the
minimization of the computational cost of such generalized Jacobian chain
products without considering constraints on the available persistent system
memory. In other words, the naive evaluation of an adjoint of the entire
simulation program is assumed to be a feasible option. No checkpointing is
required. Under the given assumptions we obtain optimal solutions which improve
the best state of the art methods by factors of up to seven on a set of
randomly generated problem instances of growing size.

Title: An ultraweak-local discontinuous Galerkin method for PDEs with high
  order spatial derivatives
Authors: Qi Tao, Yan Xu and Chi-Wang Shu
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 39 pages
MSC-class: Primary 65M60, Secondary 35G25
\\
  In this paper, we develop a new discontinuous Galerkin method for solving
several types of partial differential equations (PDEs) with high order spatial
derivatives. We combine the advantages of local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG)
method and ultra-weak discontinuous Galerkin (UWDG) method. Firstly, we rewrite
the PDEs with high order spatial derivatives into a lower order system, then
apply the UWDG method to the system. We first consider the fourth order and
fifth order nonlinear PDEs in one space dimension, and then extend our method
to general high order problems and two space dimensions. The main advantage of
our method over the LDG method is that we have introduced fewer auxiliary
variables, thereby reducing memory and computational costs. The main advantage
of our method over the UWDG method is that no internal penalty terms are
necessary in order to ensure stability for both even and odd order PDEs. We
prove stability of our method in the general nonlinear case and provide optimal
error estimates for linear PDEs for the solution itself as well as for the
auxiliary variables approximating its derivatives. A key ingredient in the
proof of the error estimates is the construction of the relationship between
the derivative and the element interface jump of the numerical solution and the
auxiliary variable solution of the solution derivative. With this relationship,
we can then use the discrete Sobolev and Poincar\'{e} inequalities to obtain
the optimal error estimates. The theoretical findings are confirmed by
numerical experiments.

Comments: 17 pages, 13 figures

\\
  This work focuses on the numerical modelling of confined concretes when
subjected to multiaxial loading accounting for a nonlinear material response.
Particularly, an improved return mapping procedure is here presented to cope
with the issue of singularities (corners) in the yield surface, able to catch
locally the optimal return point on the active yield surface. The algorithm is
applied to the Menetry and Willam's yield surface, with a plastic potential as
suggested by Grassl and the softening law proposed by Cervenka suitable for
concrete materials. The model capabilities to reproduce the confined behaviour
of concrete, as well as its post-peak behaviour, and to predict perfect
plasticity or softening are here discussed. The proposed approach can be
applied to any elastoplastic material with singular yield surface along the
hydrostatic axis.

\\
  Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key for the fifth generation (5G)
and beyond wireless communication systems owing to higher spectrum efficiency,
spatial gains, and energy efficiency. Reaping the benefits of MIMO transmission
can be fully harnessed if the channel state information (CSI) is available at
the transmitter side. However, the acquisition of transmitter side CSI entails
many challenges. In this paper, we propose a deep learning assisted CSI
estimation technique in highly mobile vehicular networks, based on the fact
that the propagation environment (scatterers, reflectors) is almost identical
thereby allowing a data driven deep neural network (DNN) to learn the
non-linear CSI relations with negligible overhead. Moreover, we formulate and
solve a dynamic network slicing based resource allocation problem for vehicular
user equipments (VUEs) requesting enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and
ultra-reliable low latency (URLLC) traffic slices. The formulation considers a
threshold rate violation probability minimization for the eMBB slice while
satisfying a probabilistic threshold rate criterion for the URLLC slice.
Simulation result shows that an overhead reduction of 50% can be achieved with
12% increase in threshold violations compared to an ideal case with perfect CSI
knowledge.

Title: SARDO: An Automated Search-and-Rescue Drone-based Solution for Victims
  Localization
Authors: Antonio Albanese and Vincenzo Sciancalepore and Xavier Costa-P\'erez
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Natural disasters affect millions of people every year. Finding missing
persons in the shortest possible time is of crucial importance to reduce the
death toll. This task is especially challenging when victims are sparsely
distributed in large and/or difficult-to-reach areas and cellular networks are
down. In this paper we present SARDO, a drone-based search and rescue solution
that exploits the high penetration rate of mobile phones in the society to
localize missing people. SARDO is an autonomous, all-in-one drone-based mobile
network solution that does not require infrastructure support or mobile phones
modifications. It builds on novel concepts such as pseudo-trilateration
combined with machine-learning techniques to efficiently locate mobile phones
in a given area. Our results, with a prototype implementation in a field-trial,
show that SARDO rapidly determines the location of mobile phones (~3 min/UE) in
a given area with an accuracy of few tens of meters and at a low battery
consumption cost (~5%). State-of-the-art localization solutions for disaster
scenarios rely either on mobile infrastructure support or exploit onboard
cameras for human/computer vision, IR, thermal-based localization. To the best
of our knowledge, SARDO is the first drone-based cellular search-and-rescue
solution able to accurately localize missing victims through mobile phones.

\\
  Different scheduling algorithms for mixed criticality systems have been
recently proposed. The common denominator of these algorithms is to discard low
critical tasks whenever high critical tasks are in lack of computation
resources. This is achieved upon a switch of the scheduling mode from Normal to
Critical. We distinguish two main categories of the algorithms: system-level
mode switch and task-level mode switch. System-level mode algorithms allow low
criticality (LC) tasks to execute only in normal mode. Task-level mode switch
algorithms enable to switch the mode of an individual high criticality task
(HC), from low (LO) to high (HI), to obtain priority over all LC tasks. This
paper investigates an online scheduling algorithm for mixed-criticality systems
that supports dynamic mode switches for both task level and system level. When
a HC task job overruns its LC budget, then only that particular job is switched
to HI mode. If the job cannot be accommodated, then the system switches to
Critical mode. To accommodate for resource availability of the HC jobs, the LC
tasks are degraded by stretching their periods until the Critical mode
exhibiting job complete its execution. The stretching will be carried out until
the resource availability is met. We have mechanized and implemented the
proposed algorithm using Uppaal. To study the efficiency of our scheduling
algorithm, we examine a case study and compare our results to the state of the
art algorithms.

  Strategies that artificially tighten high-criticality task deadlines in
low-criticality behaviors have been successfully employed for scheduling
mixed-criticality systems. Although efficient scheduling algorithms have been
developed for implicit deadline task systems, the same is not true for more
general sporadic tasks. In this paper we develop a new demand-based
schedulability test for such general mixed-criticality task systems, in which
we collectively bound the low- and high-criticality demand of tasks. We show
that the new test strictly dominates the only other known demand-based test for
such systems. We also propose a new deadline tightening strategy based on this
test, and show through simulations that the strategy significantly outperforms
all known scheduling algorithms for a variety of sporadic task systems.

  Mixed-Criticality (MC) systems consolidate multiple functionalities with
different criticalities onto a single hardware platform. Such systems improve
the overall resource utilization while guaranteeing resources to critical
tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of partitioned multiprocessor MC
scheduling, in particular the problem of designing efficient partitioning
strategies. We develop two new partitioning strategies based on the principle
of evenly distributing the difference between total high-critical utilization
and total low-critical utilization for the critical tasks among all processors.
By balancing this difference, we are able to reduce the pessimism in
uniprocessor MC schedulability tests that are applied on each processor, thus
improving overall schedulability. To evaluate the schedulability performance of
the proposed strategies, we compare them against existing partitioned
algorithms using extensive experiments. We show that the proposed strategies
are effective with both dynamic-priority Earliest Deadline First with Virtual
Deadlines (EDF-VD) and fixed-priority Adaptive Mixed-Criticality (AMC)
algorithms. Specifically, our results show that the proposed strategies improve
schedulability by as much as 28.1% and 36.2% for implicit and
constrained-deadline task systems respectively.

  Obfuscating compilers protect a software by obscuring its meaning and
impeding the reconstruction of its original source code. The typical concern
when defining such compilers is their robustness against reverse engineering
and the performance of the produced code. Little work has been done in studying
whether the security properties of a program are preserved under obfuscation.
In this paper we start addressing this problem: we consider control-flow
flattening, a popular obfuscation technique used in industrial compilers, and a
specific security policy, namely constant-time. We prove that this obfuscation
preserves the policy, i.e., that every program satisfying the policy still does
after the transformation.

Title: Toward certified quantum programming
Authors: Christophe Chareton, S\'ebastien Bardin, Fran\c{c}ois Bobot, Valentin

Categories: cs.PL
\\
  While recent progress in quantum hardware open the door for significant
speedup in certain key areas, quantum algorithms are still hard to implement
right, and the validation of such quantum programs is a challenge. Early
attempts either suffer from the lack of automation or parametrized reasoning,
or require the user to write specifications and algorithms far from those
presented in research articles or textbooks, and as a consequence, no
significant quantum algorithm implementation has been currently verified in a
scale-invariant manner. We propose QBRICKS, the first development environment
for certified quantum programs featuring clear separation between code and
proof, scale-invariance specification and proof, high degree of proof
automation and allowing to encode quantum programs in a natural way, i.e. close
to textbook style. This environment features a new domain-specific language for
quantum programs, namely QBRICKS-DSL, together with a new logical specification
language QBRICKS-SPEC . Especially, we introduce and intensively build upon
HOPS, a higher-order extension of the recent path-sum semantics, used for both
specification (parametrized, versatile) and automation (closure properties).
QBRICKS builds on best practice of formal verification for the classic case and
tailor them to the quantum case. To illustrate the opportunity of QBRICKS , we
implement the first scale-invariant verified implementations of non-trivial
quantum algorithms, namely phase estimation (QPE) -- the purely quantum part of
Shor algorithm for integer factoring -- and Grover search. It proves by fact
that applying formal verification to real quantum programs is possible and
should be further developed.

Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 15 pages, pre-print
\\
  Planning whole-body motions while taking into account the terrain conditions
is a challenging problem for legged robots since the terrain model might
produce many local minima. Our coupled planning method uses stochastic and
derivatives-free search to plan both foothold locations and horizontal motions
due to the local minima produced by the terrain model. It jointly optimizes
body motion, step duration and foothold selection, and it models the terrain as
a cost-map. Due to the novel attitude planning method, the horizontal motion
plans can be applied to various terrain conditions. The attitude planner
ensures the robot stability by imposing limits to the angular acceleration. Our
whole-body controller tracks compliantly trunk motions while avoiding slippage,
as well as kinematic and torque limits. Despite the use of a simplified model,
which is restricted to flat terrain, our approach shows remarkable capability
to deal with a wide range of non-coplanar terrains. The results are validated
by experimental trials and comparative evaluations in a series of terrains of
progressively increasing complexity.

  Localization

\\
  In this paper, we propose a real-time deep-learning approach for determining
the 6D relative pose of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) from a single
image. A team of autonomous robots localizing themselves, in a
communication-constrained underwater environment, is essential for many
applications such as underwater exploration, mapping, multi-robot convoying,
and other multi-robot tasks. Due to the profound difficulty of collecting
ground truth images with accurate 6D poses underwater, this work utilizes
rendered images from the Unreal Game Engine simulation for training. An image
translation network is employed to bridge the gap between the rendered and the
real images producing synthetic images for training. The proposed method
predicts the 6D pose of an AUV from a single image as 2D image keypoints
representing 8 corners of the 3D model of the AUV, and then the 6D pose in the
camera coordinates is determined using RANSAC-based PnP. Experimental results
in underwater environments (swimming pool and ocean) with different cameras
demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique, where the trained system
decreased translation error by 75.5% and

Title: A Multi-task Learning Framework for Grasping-Position Detection and
  Few-Shot Classification
Authors: Yasuto Yokota, Kanata Suzuki, Yuzi Kanazawa, Tomoyoshi Takebayashi
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  It is a big problem that a model of deep learning for a picking robot needs
many labeled images. Operating costs of retraining a model becomes very
expensive because the object shape of a product or a part often is changed in a
factory. It is important to reduce the amount of labeled images required to
train a model for a picking robot. In this study, we propose a multi-task
learning framework for few-shot classification using feature vectors from an
intermediate layer of a model that detects grasping positions. In the field of
manufacturing, multitask for shape classification and grasping-position
detection is often required for picking robots. Prior multi-task learning
studies include methods to learn one task with feature vectors from a deep
neural network (DNN) learned for another task. However, the DNN that was used
to detect grasping positions has two problems with respect to extracting
feature vectors from a layer for shape classification: (1) Because each layer
of the grasping position detection DNN is activated by all objects in the input
image, it is necessary to refine the features for each grasping position. (2)
It is necessary to select a layer to extract the features suitable for shape
classification. To tackle these issues, we propose a method to refine the
features for each grasping position and to select features from the optimal
layer of the DNN. We then evaluated the shape classification accuracy using
these features from the grasping positions. Our results confirm that our
proposed framework can classify object shapes even when the input image
includes multiple objects and the number of images available for training is
small.

  Autonomous drone racing is a challenging research problem at the intersection
of computer vision, planning, state estimation, and control. We introduce
AirSim Drone Racing Lab, a simulation framework for enabling fast prototyping
of algorithms for autonomy and enabling machine learning research in this
domain, with the goal of reducing the time, money, and risks associated with
field robotics. Our framework enables generation of racing tracks in multiple
photo-realistic environments, orchestration of drone races, comes with a suite
of gate assets, allows for multiple sensor modalities (monocular, depth,
neuromorphic events, optical flow), different camera models, and benchmarking
of planning, control, computer vision, and learning-based algorithms. We used
our framework to host a simulation based drone racing competition at NeurIPS
2019. The competition binaries are available at our github repository.

Title: Intensity Scan Context: Coding Intensity and Geometry Relations for Loop
  Closure Detection
Authors: Han Wang, Chen Wang and Lihua Xie
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
Comments: Accepted in International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  (ICRA) 2020
\\
  Loop closure detection is an essential and challenging problem in
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). It is often tackled with light
detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor due to its view-point and illumination
invariant properties. Existing works on 3D loop closure detection often
leverage the matching of local or global geometrical-only descriptors, but
without considering the intensity reading. In this paper we explore the
intensity property from LiDAR scan and show that it can be effective for place
recognition. Concretely, we propose a novel global descriptor, intensity scan
context (ISC), that explores both geometry and intensity characteristics. To
improve the efficiency for loop closure detection, an efficient two-stage
hierarchical re-identification process is proposed, including a
binary-operation based fast geometric relation retrieval and an intensity
structure re-identification. Thorough experiments including both local
experiment and public datasets test have been conducted to evaluate the
performance of the proposed method. Our method achieves higher recall rate and
recall precision than existing geometric-only methods.

Title: The Newer College Dataset: Handheld LiDAR, Inertial and Vision with
  Ground Truth
Authors: Milad Ramezani, Yiduo Wang, Marco Camurri, David Wisth, Matias
  Mattamala and Maurice Fallon
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  In this paper we present a large dataset with a variety of mobile mapping
sensors collected using a handheld device carried at typical walking speeds for
nearly 2.2 km through New College, Oxford. The dataset includes data from two
commercially available devices - a stereoscopic-inertial camera and a
multi-beam 3D LiDAR, which also provides inertial measurements. Additionally,
we used a tripod-mounted survey grade LiDAR scanner to capture a detailed
millimeter-accurate 3D map of the test location (containing $\sim$290 million
points). Using the map we inferred centimeter-accurate 6 Degree of Freedom
(DoF) ground truth for the position of the device for each LiDAR scan to enable
better evaluation of LiDAR and vision localisation, mapping and reconstruction
systems. This ground truth is the particular novel contribution of this dataset
and we believe that it will enable systematic evaluation which many similar
datasets have lacked. The dataset combines both built environments, open spaces
and vegetated areas so as to test localization and mapping systems such as
vision-based navigation, visual and LiDAR SLAM, 3D LIDAR reconstruction and
appearance-based place recognition. The dataset is available at:

Title: Inertial-Only Optimization for Visual-Inertial Initialization
Authors: Carlos Campos, Jos\'e M.M. Montiel and Juan D. Tard\'os
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 2020 International Conference on Robotics and Automation
\\
  We formulate for the first time visual-inertial initialization as an optimal
estimation problem, in the sense of maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation. This
allows us to properly take into account IMU measurement uncertainty, which was
neglected in previous methods that either solved sets of algebraic equations,
or minimized ad-hoc cost functions using least squares. Our exhaustive
initialization tests on EuRoC dataset show that our proposal largely
outperforms the best methods in the literature, being able to initialize in
less than 4 seconds in almost any point of the trajectory, with a scale error
of 5.3% on average. This initialization has been integrated into ORB-SLAM
Visual-Inertial boosting its robustness and efficiency while maintaining its
excellent accuracy.

Title: A Hamilton-Jacobi Formulation for Optimal Coordination of Heterogeneous
  Multiple Vehicle Systems
Authors: Matthew R. Kirchner, Mark J. Debord, Jo\~ao P. Hespanha
Categories: cs.RO cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY math.OC
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  We present a method for optimal coordination of multiple vehicle teams when
multiple endpoint configurations are equally desirable, such as seen in the
autonomous assembly of formation flight. The individual vehicles' positions in
the formation are not assigned a priori and a key challenge is to find the
optimal configuration assignment along with the optimal control and trajectory.
Commonly, assignment and trajectory planning problems are solved separately. We
introduce a new multi-vehicle coordination paradigm, where the optimal goal
assignment and optimal vehicle trajectories are found simultaneously from a
viscosity solution of a single Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial differential
equation (PDE), which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for global
optimality. Intrinsic in this approach is that individual vehicle dynamic
models need not be the same, and therefore can be applied to heterogeneous
systems. Numerical methods to solve the HJ equation have historically relied on
a discrete grid of the solution space and exhibits exponential scaling with
system dimension, preventing their applicability to multiple vehicle systems.
By utilizing a generalization of the Hopf formula, we avoid the use of grids
and present a method that exhibits polynomial scaling in the number of
vehicles.

  Natural beings undergo a morphological development process of their bodies
while they are learning and adapting to the environments they face from infancy
to adulthood. In fact, this is the period where the most important learning
pro-cesses, those that will support learning as adults, will take place.
However, in artificial systems, this interaction between morphological
development and learning, and its possible advantages, have seldom been
considered. In this line, this paper seeks to provide some insights into how
morphological development can be harnessed in order to facilitate learning in
em-bodied systems facing tasks or domains that are hard to learn. In
particular, here we will concentrate on whether morphological development can
really provide any advantage when learning complex tasks and whether its
relevance towards learning in-creases as tasks become harder. To this end, we
present the results of some initial experiments on the application of
morpho-logical development to learning to walk in three cases, that of a
quadruped, a hexapod and that of an octopod. These results seem to confirm that
as task learning difficulty increases the application of morphological
development to learning becomes more advantageous.

Title: SAHRTA: A Supervisory-Based Adaptive Human-Robot Teaming Architecture
Authors: Jamison Heard and Julian Fortune and Julie A. Adams
Categories: cs.RO cs.HC
Comments: Accepted to IEEE CogSIMA
\\
  Supervisory-based human-robot teams are deployed in various dynamic and
extreme environments (e.g., space exploration). Achieving high task performance
in such environments is critical, as a mistake may lead to significant monetary
loss or human injury. Task performance may be augmented by adapting the
supervisory interface's interactions or autonomy levels based on the human
supervisor's workload level, as workload is related to task performance.
Typical adaptive systems rely solely on the human's overall or cognitive
workload state to select what adaptation strategy to implement; however,
overall workload encompasses many dimensions (i.e., cognitive, physical,
visual, auditory, and speech) called workload components. Selecting an
appropriate adaptation strategy based on a complete human workload state
(rather than a single workload dimension) may allow for more impactful
adaptations that ensure high task performance. A Supervisory-Based Adaptive
Human-Robot Teaming Architecture (SAHRTA) that selects an appropriate level of
autonomy or system interaction based on a complete real-time multi-dimensional
workload estimate and predicted future task performance is introduced. SAHRTA
was shown to improve overall task performance in a physically expanded version
of the NASA Multi-Attribute Task Battery.

  Accurate relative localization is an important requirement for a swarm of
robots, especially when performing a cooperative task. This paper presents an
autonomous multi-robot system equipped with a fully onboard range-based
relative positioning system. It uses onboard sensing of velocity, yaw rate, and
height as inputs, and then estimates the relative position of other robots in
its own body frame by fusing these quantities with ranging measurements
obtained from onboard ultra wide-band (UWB) antennas. Simulations concisely
show the high precision, efficiency, and stability of the proposed localization
method. Experiments are conducted on a team of 5 Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotors,
demonstrating autonomous formation flight and pattern formation, and
coordinated flight through a window. All results indicate the effectiveness of
the proposed relative positioning method for multi-robot systems.

Title: Deciding the Consistency of Non-Linear Real Arithmetic Constraints with
  a Conflict Driven Search Using Cylindrical Algebraic Coverings
Authors: Erika {\'A}brah\'am, James H. Davenport, Matthew England, and Gereon
  Kremer
Categories: cs.SC cs.LO
\\
  We present a new algorithm for determining the satisfiability of conjunctions
of non-linear polynomial constraints over the reals, which can be used as a
theory solver for satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solving for non-linear
real arithmetic. The algorithm is a variant of Cylindrical Algebraic
Decomposition (CAD) adapted for satisfiability, where solution candidates
(sample points) are constructed incrementally, either until a satisfying sample
is found or sufficient samples have been sampled to conclude unsatisfiability.
The choice of samples is guided by the input constraints and previous
conflicts.
  The key idea behind our new approach is to start with a partial sample;
demonstrate that it cannot be extended to a full sample; and from the reasons
for that rule out a larger space around the partial sample, which build up
incrementally into a cylindrical algebraic covering of the space. There are
similarities with the incremental variant of CAD, the NLSAT method of
Jovanovi\'{c} and de~Moura, and the NuCAD algorithm of Brown; but we present
worked examples and experimental results on a preliminary implementation to
demonstrate the differences to these, and the benefits of the new approach.

Title: A survey on test practitioners' awareness of test smells
Authors: Nildo Silva Junior, Larissa Rocha, Luana Almeida Martins, and Ivan
  Machado
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: 14 pages, 2 figures and 3 tables
\\
  Developing test code may be a time-consuming task that usually requires much
effort and cost, especially when it is done manually. Besides, during this
process, developers and testers are likely to adopt bad design choices, which
may lead to the introduction of the so-called test smells in test code. Test
smells are bad solutions to either implement or design test code. As the test
code with test smells increases in size, these tests might become more complex,
and as a consequence, much harder to understand and evolve correctly.
Therefore, test smells may have a negative impact on the quality and
maintenance of test code and may also harm the whole software testing
activities. In this context, this study aims to understand whether test
professionals non-intentionally insert test smells. We carried out an expert
survey to analyze the usage frequency of a set of test smells. Sixty
professionals from different companies participated in the survey. We selected
14 widely studied smells from the literature, which are also implemented in
existing test smell detection tools. The yielded results indicate that
experienced professionals introduce test smells during their daily programming
tasks, even when they are using standardized practices from their companies,
and not only for their personal assumptions. Another relevant evidence was that
developers' professional experience can not be considered as a root-cause for
the insertion of test smells in test code.

Title: Code Clone Matching: A Practical and Effective Approach to Find Code
  Snippets
Authors: Katsuro Inoue, Yuya Miyamoto, Daniel M. German, Takashi Ishio
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: 11 pages, for downloading ccgrep, https://github.com/yuy-m/CCGrep
\\
  Finding the same or similar code snippets in source code is one of
fundamental activities in software maintenance. Text-based pattern matching
tools such as grep is frequently used for such purpose, but making proper
queries for the expected result is not easy. Code clone detectors could be used
but their features and result are generally excessive. In this paper, we
propose Code Clone matching (CC matching for short) that employs a combination
of token-based clone detection and meta-patterns enhanced with meta-tokens. The
user simply gives a query code snippet possibly with a few meta-tokens and then
gets the resulting snippets, forming type 1, 2, or 3 code clone pairs between
the query and result. By using a code snippet with meta-tokens as the query,
the resulting matches are well controlled by the users. CC matching has been
implemented as a practical and efficient tool named ccgrep, with grep-like user
interface. The evaluation shows that ccgrep~ is a very effective to find
various kinds of code snippets.

Title: CC2Vec: Distributed Representations of Code Changes
Authors: Thong Hoang, Hong Jin Kang, Julia Lawall, David Lo
Categories: cs.SE
DOI: 10.1145/3377811.3380361
\\
  Existing work on software patches often use features specific to a single
task. These works often rely on manually identified features, and human effort
is required to identify these features for each task. In this work, we propose
CC2Vec, a neural network model that learns a representation of code changes
guided by their accompanying log messages, which represent the semantic intent
of the code changes. CC2Vec models the hierarchical structure of a code change
with the help of the attention mechanism and uses multiple comparison functions
to identify the differences between the removed and added code.
  To evaluate if CC2Vec can produce a distributed representation of code
changes that is general and useful for multiple tasks on software patches, we
use the vectors produced by CC2Vec for three tasks: log message generation, bug
fixing patch identification, and just-in-time defect prediction. In all tasks,
the models using CC2Vec outperform the state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: Dependency-Aware Software Requirements Selection using Fuzzy Graphs and
  Integer Programming
Authors: Davoud Mougouei and David M W Powers
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.04806
\\
  Software requirements selection aims to find an optimal subset of the
requirements with the highest value while respecting the project constraints.
But the value of a requirement may depend on the presence or absence of other
requirements in the optimal subset. Such Value Dependencies, however, are
imprecise and hard to capture. In this paper, we propose a method based on
integer programming and fuzzy graphs to account for value dependencies and
their imprecision in software requirements selection. The proposed method,
referred to as Dependency-Aware Software Requirements Selection (DARS), is
comprised of three components: (i) an automated technique for the
identification of value dependencies from user preferences, (ii) a modeling
technique based on fuzzy graphs that allows for capturing the imprecision of
value dependencies, and (iii) an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that
takes into account user preferences and value dependencies identified from
those preferences to reduce the risk of value loss in software projects. Our
work is verified by studying a real-world software project. The results show
that our proposed method reduces the value loss in software projects and is
scalable to large requirement sets.

Title: The Changing Nature of Computational Science Software
Authors: Huy Tu, Rishabh Agrawal, Tim Menzies
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: 10 pages, submitted for FSE
\\
  How should software engineering be adapted for Computational Science (CS)? If
we understood that, then we could better support software sustainability,
verifiability, reproducibility, comprehension, and usability for CS community.
For example, improving the maintainability of the CS code could lead to: (a)
faster adaptation of scientific project simulations to new and efficient
hardware (multi-core and heterogeneous systems); (b) better support for larger
teams to co-ordinate (through integration with interdisciplinary teams); and
(c) an extended capability to model complex phenomena.
  In order to better understand computational science, this paper uses
quantitative evidence (from 59 CS projects in Github) to check 13 published
beliefs about CS. These beliefs reflect on (a) the nature of scientific
challenges; (b) the implications of limitations of computer hardware; and (c)
the cultural environment of scientific software development. What we found was,
using this new data from Github, only a minority of those older beliefs can be
endorsed. More than half of the pre-existing beliefs are dubious, which leads
us to conclude that the nature of CS software development is changing.
  Further, going forward, this has implications for (1) what kinds of tools we
would propose to better support computational science and (2) research
directions for both communities.

pattern in these huge repositories. This study utilizes network science to
create collaboration network of Iranian Scientific Institutions. A
modularity-based approach applied to find network communities. To reach a big

crucial. Our results demonstrated that geographic location closeness and ethnic
attributes has important roles in academic collaboration network establishment.
Besides, it shows that famous scientific centers in the capital city of Iran,
Tehran has strong influence on the production flow of scientific activities.
These academic papers are mostly viewed and downloaded from the United State of
America, China, India, and Iran. The motivation of this research is that by
discovering hidden communities in the network and finding the structure of
intuitions communications, we can identify each scientific center research
potential separately and clear mutual scientific fields. Therefore, an
efficient strategic program can be designed, developed and tested to keep
scientific centers in progress way and navigate their research goals into a

Title: Improving Network Robustness through Edge Augmentation While Preserving

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY

\\
  In this paper, we consider a network of agents with Laplacian dynamics, and
study the problem of improving network robustness by adding a maximum number of
edges within the network while preserving a lower bound on its strong
structural controllability (SSC) at the same time. Edge augmentation increases
network's robustness to noise and structural changes, however, it could also
deteriorate network controllability. Thus, by exploiting relationship between
network controllability and distances between nodes in graphs, we formulate an
edge augmentation problem with a constraint to preserve distances between
certain node pairs, which in turn guarantees that a lower bound on SSC is
maintained even after adding edges. In this direction, first we choose a node
pair and maximally add edges while maintaining the distance between selected
nodes. We show that an optimal solution belongs to a certain class of graphs
called clique chains. Then, we present an algorithm to add edges while
preserving distances between a certain collection of nodes. Further, we present
a randomized algorithm that guarantees a desired approximation ratio with high
probability to solve the edge augmentation problem. Finally, we evaluate our
results on various networks.

  An eigenvalue based framework is developed for the stability analysis and
stabilization of coupled systems with time-delays, which are naturally
described by delay differential algebraic equations. The spectral properties of
these equations are analyzed and a numerical method for stability assessment is
presented, taking into account the effect of small delay perturbations on
stability. Subsequently, the design of stabilizing controllers with a
prescribed structure or order is addressed, based on a direct optimization
approach. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated with numerical
examples, and the similarities with the computation and optimization of
H-infinity norms are pointed out.

Title: Resilient Vector Consensus in Multi-Agent Networks Using Centerpoints
Authors: Mudassir Shabbir, Jiani Li, Waseem Abbas, Xenofon Koutsoukos
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: American Control Conference (ACC), 2020 (Denver)
\\
  In this paper, we study the resilient vector consensus problem in multi-agent
networks and improve resilience guarantees of existing algorithms. In resilient
vector consensus, agents update their states, which are vectors in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, by locally interacting with other agents some of which might be
adversarial. The main objective is to ensure that normal (non-adversarial)
agents converge at a common state that lies in the convex hull of their initial
states. Currently, resilient vector consensus algorithms, such as approximate
distributed robust convergence (ADRC) are based on the idea that to update
states in each time step, every normal node needs to compute a point that lies
in the convex hull of its normal neighbors' states. {To compute such a point,
the idea of Tverberg partition is typically used, which is computationally
hard. Approximation algorithms for Tverberg partition negatively impact the
resilience guarantees of consensus algorithm.} To deal with this issue, we
propose to use the idea of centerpoint, which is an extension of median in
higher dimensions, instead of Tverberg partition. We show that the resilience
of such algorithms to adversarial nodes is improved if we use the notion of
centerpoint. Furthermore, using centerpoint provides a better characterization
of the necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing resilient vector
consensus. We analyze these conditions in two, three, and higher dimensions
separately. Finally, we numerically evaluate the performance of our approach
through various experiments.

Title: Smart Home Energy Management System for Power System Resiliency
Authors: Ninad Gaikwad, Naren Srivaths Raman, and Prabir Barooah

  Technology and Applications (CCTA 2020)
\\
  The need for resiliency of electricity supply is increasing due to increasing
frequency of natural disasters---such as hurricanes---that disrupt supply from
the power grid. Rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) panels together with batteries
can provide resiliency in many scenarios. Without intelligent and automated
decision making that can trade off conflicting requirements, a large PV system
and a large battery is needed to provide meaningful resiliency. By using
forecast of solar generation and household demand, an intelligent decision
maker can operate the equipment (battery and critical loads) to ensure that the
critical loads are serviced to the maximum duration possible. With the aid of
such an intelligent control system, a smaller (and thus lower cost) system can
service the primary loads for the same duration that a much larger system will
be needed to service otherwise.
  In this paper we propose such an intelligent control system. A model
predictive control (MPC) architecture is used that uses available measurements
and forecasts to make optimal decisions for batteries and critical loads in
real time. The optimization problem is formulated as a MILP (mixed integer
linear program) due to the on/off decisions for the loads. Performance is
compared with a non-intelligent baseline controller, for a PV-battery system
chosen carefully for a single family house in Florida. Simulations are
conducted for a one week period during hurricane Irma in 2017. Simulations show
that the cost of the PV+battery system to provide a certain resiliency
performance, duration the primary load can be serviced successfully, can be
halved by the proposed control system.

Title: Optimal Composition of Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Teams for Coverage
  Problems with Performance Bound Guarantees
Authors: Chuangchuang Sun and Shirantha Welikala and Christos G. Cassandras
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
Comments: To be published in Automatica
\\
  We consider the problem of determining the optimal composition of a
heterogeneous multi-agent team for coverage problems by including costs
associated with different agents and subject to an upper bound on the maximal
allowable number of agents. We formulate a resource allocation problem without
introducing additional non-convexities to the original problem. We develop a
distributed Projected Gradient Ascent (PGA) algorithm to solve the optimal team
composition problem. To deal with non-convexity, we initialize the algorithm
using a greedy method and exploit the submodularity and curvature properties of
the coverage objective function to derive novel tighter performance bound
guarantees on the optimization problem solution. Numerical examples are
included to validate the effectiveness of this approach in diverse mission
space configurations and different heterogeneous multi-agent collections.
Comparative results obtained using a commercial mixed-integer nonlinear
programming problem solver demonstrate both the accuracy and computational
efficiency of the distributed PGA algorithm.

Title: Cooperative output feedback tracking control of stochastic linear
  heterogeneous multi-agent systems
Authors: Dianqiang Li and Tao Li
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  We study cooperative output feedback tracking control of stochastic linear
heterogeneous leader-following multi-agent systems. Each agent has a
continuous-time linear heterogeneous dynamics with incompletely measurable
state, and there are additive and multiplicative noises along with information
exchange among agents. We propose the set of admissible distributed observation
strategies for estimating each follower's own state and the leader's state, and
the set of admissible cooperative output feedback control strategies based on
the certainty equivalence principle. By output regulation theory and stochastic
analysis, we show that for observable leader's dynamics and stabilizable and
detectable followers' dynamics, if the product of the intensities of
multiplicative measurement noises and the sum of real parts of unstable
eigenvalues of leader's dynamics is less than 1/4 of the minimum non-zero
Laplacian eigenvalue of the communication graph,then there exist admissible
distributed observation and cooperative control strategies to ensure mean
square bounded output tracking, provided the associated output regulation
equations are solvable. Finally, the effectiveness of our control strategies is
demonstrated by numerical simulation.

Title: Backward Reachability using Integral Quadratic Constraints for Uncertain
  Nonlinear Systems
Authors: He Yin, Peter Seiler, Murat Arcak
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Submitted to L-CSS
\\
  A method is proposed to compute robust inner-approximations to the backward
reachable set for uncertain nonlinear systems. It also produces a robust
control law that drives trajectories starting in these sets to the target set.
The method merges dissipation inequalities and integral quadratic constraints
(IQCs) with both hard and soft IQC factorizations. Computational algorithms are
presented using the generalized S-procedure and sum-of-squares techniques. The
use of IQCs in backward reachability analysis allows for a variety of
perturbations including parametric uncertainty, unmodeled dynamics,
nonlinearities, and uncertain time delays. The method is demonstrated on two
examples, including a 6-state quadrotor with actuator uncertainties.

Title: Vulnerability Assessment of Load Frequency Control Considering Cyber
  Security
Authors: Chunyu Chen, Yang Chen, Kaifeng Zhang, Wenjun Bi, Meng Tian
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 9 pages, 13 figures
\\
  Security is one of the biggest concern in power system operation. Recently,
the emerging cyber security threats to operational functions of power systems
arouse high public attention, and cybersecurity vulnerability thus become an
emerging topic to evaluate compromised operational performance under cyber
attack. In this paper, vulnerability of cyber security of load frequency
control (LFC) system, which is the key component in energy manage system (EMS),
is assessed by exploiting the system response to attacks on LFC
variables/parameters. Two types of attacks: 1) injection attack and 2) scale
attack are considered for evaluation. Two evaluation criteria reflecting the
damage on system stability and power generation are used to quantify system
loss under cyber attacks. Through a sensitivity-based method and attack tree
models, the vulnerability of different LFC components is ranked. In addition, a
post-intrusion cyber attack detection scheme is proposed. Classification-based
schemes using typical classification algorithms are studied and compared to
identify different attack scenarios.

  New nonlinear damping control is proposed for the second-order systems. The
proportional output feedback is combined with the damping term which is
quadratic to the output derivative and inverse to the set-point distance. The
global stability, passivity property, and convergence time and accuracy are
shown. The suggested nonlinear damping is denoted as optimal since requiring no

  We design fixed-order strong H-infinity controllers for general time-delay
systems. The designer chooses the controller order and may introduce constant
time-delays in the controller. We represent the closed-loop system of the plant
and the controller as delay differential algebraic equations (DDAEs). This
representation deals with any interconnection of systems with time-delays
without any elimination techniques. We present a numerical algorithm to compute
the strong H-infinity norm for DDAEs which is robust to arbitrarily small delay
perturbations, unlike the standard H-infinity norm. We optimize the strong
H-infinity norm of the closed-loop system based on non-smooth, non-convex
optimization methods using this algorithm and the computation of the gradient
of the strong H-infinity norm with respect to the controller parameters. We
tune the controller parameters and design H-infinity controllers with a
prescribed order or structure.

Title: Actuator Security Index for Structured Systems
Authors: Sebin Gracy, Jezdimir Milosevic and Henrik Sandberg
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Given a network with the set of vulnerable actuators (and sensors), the
security index of an actuator equals the minimum number of sensors and
actuators that needs to be compromised so as to conduct a perfectly
undetectable attack using the said actuator. This paper deals with the problem
of computing actuator security indices for discrete-time LTI network systems.
Firstly, we show that, under a structured systems framework, the actuator
security index is generic. Thereafter, we provide graph-theoretic conditions
for computing the structural actuator security index. The said conditions are
in terms of existence of linkings on appropriately-defined directed
(sub)graphs. Based on these conditions, we present an algorithm for computing
the structural index.

Title: Robustness to Incorrect Models in Average-Cost Optimal Stochastic
  Control

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Presented at Conference on Decision and Control 2019. arXiv admin
  note: text overlap with arXiv:1803.06046
\\
  We study continuity properties of infinite-horizon average expected cost
problems with respect to (controlled) transition kernels, and applications of
these results to the problem of robustness of control policies designed for
incorrect models applied to systems with incomplete models. We show that
sufficient conditions presented in the literature for discounted-cost problems
are in general not sufficient to ensure robustness for average-cost problems.
However, we show that the average optimal cost is continuous in the
convergences of controlled transition kernel models where convergence of models
entails (i) continuous weak convergence in state and actions, and (ii)
continuous setwise convergence in the actions for every fixed state variable,
in addition to uniform ergodicity and regularity conditions. Using such
continuity results, we establish that the mismatch error due to the application
of a control policy designed for an incorrectly estimated model to the true
model decreases to zero as the incorrect model approaches the true model under
the stated convergence criteria. Our findings significantly relax related
studies in the literature which have primarily considered the more restrictive
total variation convergence criteria.

  This paper deals with stabilization of discrete-time switched linear systems
when explicit knowledge of the state-space models of their subsystems are not
available. Given the sets of indices of the stable and unstable subsystems, the
set of admissible switches between the subsystems, the admissible dwell times
on the subsystems and a simulation model from which finite traces of state
trajectories of the switched system can be collected, we devise an algorithm
that designs periodic switching signals which preserve stability of the
resulting switched system. We combine two ingredients: (a) data-based stability
analysis of discrete-time linear systems and (b) multiple Lyapunov-like
functions and graph walks based design of stabilizing switching signals, for
this purpose. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the proposed
algorithm.

Title: UAV-to-Device Underlay Communications: Age of Information Minimization

Authors: Fanyi Wu, Hongliang Zhang, Jianjun Wu, Lingyang Song, Zhu Han, and H.
  Vincent Poor

\\
  In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have found numerous sensing
applications, which are expected to add billions of dollars to the world
economy in the next decade. To further improve the Quality-of-Service (QoS) in
such applications, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has considered
the adoption of terrestrial cellular networks to support UAV sensing services,
also known as the cellular Internet of UAVs. In this paper, we consider a
cellular Internet of UAVs, where the sensory data can be transmitted either to
base station (BS) via cellular links, or to mobile devices by underlay
UAV-to-Device (U2D) communications. To evaluate the freshness of data, the age
of information (AoI) is adopted, in which a lower AoI implies fresher data.
Since UAVs' AoIs are determined by their trajectories during sensing and
transmission, we investigate the AoI minimization problem for UAVs by designing
their trajectories. This problem is a Markov decision problem (MDP) with an
infinite state-action space, and thus we utilize multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) to approximate the state-action space. Then, we propose a
multi-UAV trajectory design algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results
show that our algorithm achieves a lower AoI than greedy algorithm and policy
gradient algorithm.

Title: Computing Robustly Forward Invariant Sets for Mixed-Monotone Systems
Authors: Matthew Abate and Samuel Coogan
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.DS
Comments: 8 Pages, 6 Figures. Submitted to 59th Conference on Decision and
  Control (CDC 2020)
\\
  This work presents new tools for studying reachability and set invariance for
continuous-time {mixed-monotone} dynamical systems subject to a disturbance
input. The vector field of a mixed-monotone system is characterized as being
decomposable into increasing and decreasing components which allows the
dynamics to be embedded in a higher dimensional embedding system. Even though
the original system is nondeterministic due to the unknown disturbance input,
the embedding system has no disturbance and its trajectories provide bounds for
finite-time reachable sets of the original dynamics. We then present an
efficient method for identifying robustly forward invariant and attractive sets
for mixed-monotone systems by studying equilibria and their stability
properties of the corresponding embedding system. Next, we show that this
approach, when applied to the backward-time dynamics, also establishes
different robustly forward invariant sets for the original dynamics. Lastly, we
present an independent result for computing decomposition functions for
mixed-monotone systems with polynomial dynamics. These tools are demonstrated
in several examples and a case study.

Title: On the Convergence of the Dynamic Inner PCA Algorithm
Authors: Sungho Shin, Alex D. Smith, S. Joe Qin, Victor M. Zavala
Categories: eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY stat.ML
\\
  Dynamic inner principal component analysis (DiPCA) is a powerful method for
the analysis of time-dependent multivariate data. DiPCA extracts dynamic latent
variables that capture the most dominant temporal trends by solving a
large-scale, dense, and nonconvex nonlinear program (NLP). A scalable
decomposition algorithm has been recently proposed in the literature to solve
these challenging NLPs. The decomposition algorithm performs well in practice
but its convergence properties are not well understood. In this work, we show
that this algorithm is a specialized variant of a coordinate maximization
algorithm. This observation allows us to explain why the decomposition
algorithm might work (or not) in practice and can guide improvements. We
compare the performance of the decomposition strategies with that of the
off-the-shelf solver Ipopt. The results show that decomposition is more
scalable and, surprisingly, delivers higher quality solutions.

Title: Expressiveness and machine processability of Knowledge Organization

\\
  This study considers the expressiveness (that is the expressive power or
expressivity) of different types of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) and
discusses its potential to be machine-processable in the context of the
Semantic Web. For this purpose, the theoretical foundations of KOS are reviewed
based on conceptualizations introduced by the Functional Requirements for
Subject Authority Data (FRSAD) and the Simple Knowledge Organization System
(SKOS); natural language processing techniques are also implemented. Applying a
comparative analysis, the dataset comprises a thesaurus (Eurovoc), a subject
headings system (LCSH) and a classification scheme (DDC). These are compared
with an ontology (CIDOC-CRM) by focusing on how they define and handle concepts
and relations. It was observed that LCSH and DDC focus on the formalism of
character strings (nomens) rather than on the modelling of semantics; their
definition of what constitutes a concept is quite fuzzy, and they comprise a
large number of complex concepts. By contrast, thesauri have a coherent
definition of what constitutes a concept, and apply a systematic approach to
the modelling of relations. Ontologies explicitly define diverse types of
relations, and are by their nature machine-processable. The paper concludes
that the potential of both the expressiveness and machine processability of
each KOS is extensively regulated by its structural rules. It is harder to
represent subject headings and classification schemes as semantic networks with
nodes and arcs, while thesauri are more suitable for such a representation. In
addition, a paradigm shift is revealed which focuses on the modelling of
relations between concepts, rather than the concepts themselves.

Title: Predicting the vulnerability of spacecraft components: modelling debris
  impact effects through vulnerable-zones
Authors: Mirko Trisolini, Hugh G. Lewis, Camilla Colombo
Categories: astro-ph.IM cs.CE physics.space-ph
Comments: Article accepted for pubblication in Advances in Space Research
\\
  The space environment around the Earth is populated by more than 130 million
objects of 1 mm in size and larger, and future predictions shows that this
amount is destined to increase, even if mitigation measures are implemented at
a far better rate than today. These objects can hit and damage a spacecraft or
its components. It is thus necessary to assess the risk level for a satellite
during its mission lifetime. Few software packages perform this analysis, and
most of them employ time-consuming ray-tracing methodology, where particles are
randomly sampled from relevant distributions. In addition, they tend not to
consider the risk associated with the secondary debris clouds. The paper
presents the development of a vulnerability assessment model, which relies on a
fully statistical procedure: the debris fluxes are directly used combining them
with the concept of the vulnerable zone, avoiding the random sampling the
debris fluxes. A novel methodology is presented to predict damage to internal
components. It models the interaction between the components and the secondary
debris cloud through basic geometric operations, considering mutual shielding
and shadowing between internal components. The methodologies are tested against
state-of-the-art software for relevant test cases, comparing results on
external structures and internal components.

  We have collected a large set of 377 publicly available complete genome
sequences of the COVID-19 virus, the previously known flu-causing
coronaviruses, HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1, and the deadly
pathogenic P3/P4 viruses, SARS, MERS, Victoria, Lassa, Yamagata, Ebola, and
Dengue. This article reports a computational study of the similarities and the
evolutionary relationships of COVID-19 strains from different countries and
between COVID-19 and the related viruses using our newly developed big sequence
data analysis tool I-MLCS, the existing MEGA 6.0 system, and a clustering
algorithm. Similarity analysis shows that two strains of the COVID-19 virus
taking rhinolophine as host have very high similarities with the COVID-19 virus
taking human as host, although the average similarity between the strains of
the virus taking pangolin as host and taking human as host is higher.
Evolutionary relationship analysis shows that about 13 strains of the COVID-19
virus sequenced in 5 countries are very likely to be connected to or can
potentially lead researchers to find the first generation COVID-19 virus and
its origin.

Title: Persistence of the Conley Index in Combinatorial Dynamical Systems
Authors: Tamal K. Dey, Marian Mrozek, Ryan Slechta
Categories: math.AT cs.CG math.DS
\\
  A combinatorial framework for dynamical systems provides an avenue for
connecting classical dynamics with data-oriented, algorithmic methods.
Combinatorial vector fields introduced by Forman and their recent
generalization to multivector fields have provided a starting point for
building such a connection. In this work, we strengthen this relationship by
placing the Conley index in the persistent homology setting. Conley indices are
homological features associated with so-called isolated invariant sets, so a
change in the Conley index is a response to perturbation in an underlying
multivector field. We show how one can use zigzag persistence to summarize
changes to the Conley index, and we develop techniques to capture such changes
in the presence of noise. We conclude by developing an algorithm to track
features in a changing multivector field.

Title: Investigating the influence Brexit had on Financial Markets, in
  particular the GBP/EUR exchange rate
Authors: Michael Filletti
Categories: q-fin.ST cs.CL
\\
  On 23rd June 2016, 51.9% of British voters voted to leave the European Union,
triggering a process and events that have led to the United Kingdom leaving the
EU, an event that has become known as 'Brexit'. In this piece of research, we
investigate the effects of this entire process on the currency markets,
specifically the GBP/EUR exchange rate. Financial markets are known to be
sensitive to news articles and media, and the aim of this research is to
evaluate the magnitude of impact of relevant events, as well as whether the
impact was positive or negative for the GBP.

Title: Optimal HDR and Depth from Dual Cameras
Authors: Pradyumna Chari, Anil Kumar Vadathya, Kaushik Mitra
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Dual camera systems have assisted in the proliferation of various
applications, such as optical zoom, low-light imaging and High Dynamic Range
(HDR) imaging. In this work, we explore an optimal method for capturing the
scene HDR and disparity map using dual camera setups. Hasinoff et al. (2010)
have developed a noise optimal framework for HDR capture from a single camera.
We generalize this to the dual camera set-up for estimating both HDR and
disparity map. It may seem that dual camera systems can capture HDR in a
shorter time. However, disparity estimation is a necessary step, which requires
overlap among the images captured by the two cameras. This may lead to an
increase in the capture time. To address this conflicting requirement, we
propose a novel framework to find the optimal exposure and ISO sequence by
minimizing the capture time under the constraints of an upper bound on the
disparity error and a lower bound on the per-exposure SNR. We show that the
resulting optimization problem is non-convex in general and propose an
appropriate initialization technique. To obtain the HDR and disparity map from
the optimal capture sequence, we propose a pipeline which alternates between
estimating the camera ICRFs and the scene disparity map. We demonstrate that
our optimal capture sequence leads to better results than other possible
capture sequences. Our results are also close to those obtained by capturing
the full stereo stack spanning the entire dynamic range. Finally, we present
for the first time a stereo HDR dataset consisting of dense ISO and exposure
stack captured from a smartphone dual camera. The dataset consists of 6 scenes,
with an average of 142 exposure-ISO image sequence per scene.

Title: MaCSim approach to assess the accuracy of individual matched records
  with varying block sizes and cut-off values
Authors: Shovanur Haque, Kerrie Mengersen
Categories: stat.CO cs.DB stat.AP
Comments: 20 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Record linkage is the process of matching together the records from different
data sources that belong to the same entity. Record linkage is increasingly
being used by statistical, health, government and business organisations to
link administrative, survey, population census and other files to create a
robust file for more complete and comprehensive analysis. Despite this
increase, there has been little work on developing tools to assess the accuracy
of linked files. Ensuring that the matched records in the combined file
actually correspond to the same individual or entity is crucial for the
validity of any analyses and inferences based on the combined data. Haque et
al. (submitted for publication) proposed a Markov Chain based Monte Carlo
simulation approach (MaCSim) for assessing linkage accuracy and used ABS
(Australian Bureau of Statistics) synthetic data to illustrate the utility of
the approach. Different blocking strategies were considered to classify matches
from non-matches with different levels of accuracy. In order to assess average
accuracy of linking, correctly linked proportions were investigated for each
record. The analyses indicated strong performance of the proposed method of
assessment of accuracy of the linkages. In this paper, this method is employed
to evaluate the accuracy of linkages, using varying block sizes and different
cut-off values while minimizing error. The aim is to facilitate optimal choice
of block size and cut-off value to achieve high accuracy in terms of minimizing
the average False Discovery Rate (FDR) and False Negative Rate (FNR).

Title: Duality pairs and homomorphisms to oriented and un-oriented cycles
Authors: Santiago Guzm\'an-Pro and C\'esar Hern\'andez-Cruz

Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures
MSC-class: 05C60, 05C75
\\
  In the homomorphism order of digraphs, a duality pair is an ordered pair of
digraphs $(G,H)$ such that for any digraph, $D$, $G\to D$ if and only if
$D\not\to H$. The directed path on $k+1$ vertices together with the transitive
tournament on $k$ vertices is a classic example of a duality pair. This
relation between paths and tournaments implies that a graph is $k$-colourable
if and only if it admits an orientation with no directed path on more than
$k$-vertices.
  In this work, for every undirected cycle $C$ we find an orientation $C_D$ and
an oriented path $P_C$, such that $(P_C,C_D)$ is a duality pair. As a
consequence we obtain that there is a finite set, $F_C$, such that an
undirected graph is homomorphic to $C$, if and only if it admits an $F_C$-free
orientation. As a byproduct of the proposed duality pairs, we show that if $T$
is a tree of height at most $3$, one can choose a dual of $T$ of linear size
with respect to the size of $T$.

\\
  Given a set of oriented graphs $F$, a graph $G$ is an $F$-graph if it admits
an $F$-free orientation. Building on previous work by Bang-Jensen and Urrutia,
we propose a master algorithm that determines if a graph admits an $F$-free
orientation when $F$ is a subset of the orientations of $P_3$ and the
transitive triangle.
  We extend previous results of Skrien by studying the class of $F$-graphs,
when $F$ is any set of oriented graphs of order three; structural
characterizations for all such sets are provided, except for the so-called
perfectly-orientable graphs and one of its subclasses, which remain as open
problems.

Title: Conflict-free coloring on closed neighborhoods of bounded degree graphs
Authors: Sriram Bhyravarapu, Subrahmanyam Kalyanasundaram, and Rogers Mathew
Categories: math.CO cs.DM
Comments: 3 pages
\\
  The closed neighborhood conflict-free chromatic number of a graph $G$,
denoted by $\chi_{CN}(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required to color
the vertices of $G$ such that for every vertex, there is a color that appears
exactly once in its closed neighborhood. Pach and Tardos [Combin. Probab.
Comput. 2009] showed that $\chi_{CN}(G) = O(\log^{2+\varepsilon} \Delta)$, for
any $\varepsilon > 0$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree. In [Combin.
Probab. Comput. 2014], Glebov, Szab\'o and Tardos showed existence of graphs
$G$ with $\chi_{CN}(G) = \Omega(\log^2\Delta)$. In this paper, we bridge the
gap between the two bounds by showing that $\chi_{CN}(G) = O(\log^2 \Delta)$.

  In this note, we studied the asymptotic behaviour of the length of the
longest common substring for run-length encoded sequences. When the original
sequences are generated by an $\alpha$-mixing process with exponential decay
(or $\psi$-mixing with polynomial decay), we proved that this length grows
logarithmically with a coefficient depending on the R\'enyi entropy of the
pushforward measure. For Bernoulli processes and Markov chains, this
coefficient is computed explicitly.

\\
  In this paper, we discuss the way advanced machine learning techniques allow
physicists to perform in-depth studies of the realistic operating modes of the
detectors during the stage of their design. Proposed approach can be applied to
both design concept (CDR) and technical design (TDR) phases of future detectors
and existing detectors if upgraded. The machine learning approaches may speed
up the verification of the possible detector configurations and will automate
the entire detector R\&D, which is often accompanied by a large number of
scattered studies. We present the approach of using machine learning for
detector R\&D and its optimisation cycle with an emphasis on the project of the
electromagnetic calorimeter upgrade for the LHCb detector\cite{lhcls3}. The
spatial reconstruction and time of arrival properties for the electromagnetic
calorimeter were demonstrated.

Title: Stochastic Coordinate Minimization with Progressive Precision for
  Stochastic Convex Optimization
Authors: Sudeep Salgia, Qing Zhao, Sattar Vakili
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.OC
\\
  A framework based on iterative coordinate minimization (CM) is developed for
stochastic convex optimization. Given that exact coordinate minimization is
impossible due to the unknown stochastic nature of the objective function, the
crux of the proposed optimization algorithm is an optimal control of the
minimization precision in each iteration. We establish the optimal precision
control and the resulting order-optimal regret performance for strongly convex
and separably nonsmooth functions. An interesting finding is that the optimal
progression of precision across iterations is independent of the
low-dimensional CM routine employed, suggesting a general framework for
extending low-dimensional optimization routines to high-dimensional problems.
The proposed algorithm is amenable to online implementation and inherits the
scalability and parallelizability properties of CM for large-scale
optimization. Requiring only a sublinear order of message exchanges, it also
lends itself well to distributed computing as compared with the alternative
approach of coordinate gradient descent.

Title: A Mean-field Analysis of Deep ResNet and Beyond: Towards Provable
  Optimization Via Overparameterization From Depth
Authors: Yiping Lu, Chao Ma, Yulong Lu, Jianfeng Lu, Lexing Ying
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG cs.NA math.NA math.OC
\\
  Training deep neural networks with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can
often achieve zero training loss on real-world tasks although the optimization
landscape is known to be highly non-convex. To understand the success of SGD
for training deep neural networks, this work presents a mean-field analysis of
deep residual networks, based on a line of works that interpret the continuum
limit of the deep residual network as an ordinary differential equation when
the network capacity tends to infinity. Specifically, we propose a new
continuum limit of deep residual networks, which enjoys a good landscape in the
sense that every local minimizer is global. This characterization enables us to
derive the first global convergence result for multilayer neural networks in
the mean-field regime. Furthermore, without assuming the convexity of the loss
landscape, our proof relies on a zero-loss assumption at the global minimizer
that can be achieved when the model shares a universal approximation property.
Key to our result is the observation that a deep residual network resembles a
shallow network ensemble, i.e. a two-layer network. We bound the difference
between the shallow network and our ResNet model via the adjoint sensitivity
method, which enables us to apply existing mean-field analyses of two-layer
networks to deep networks. Furthermore, we propose several novel training
schemes based on the new continuous model, including one training procedure
that switches the order of the residual blocks and results in strong empirical
performance on the benchmark datasets.

Title: General linear-time inference for Gaussian Processes on one dimension

Comments: 36 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICML
MSC-class: 60G15 (Primary) 68W10, 47B34 (Secondary)
\\
  Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a powerful probabilistic framework for
interpolation, forecasting, and smoothing, but have been hampered by
computational scaling issues. Here we prove that for data sampled on one
dimension (e.g., a time series sampled at arbitrarily-spaced intervals),
approximate GP inference at any desired level of accuracy requires
computational effort that scales linearly with the number of observations; this
new theorem enables inference on much larger datasets than was previously
feasible. To achieve this improved scaling we propose a new family of
stationary covariance kernels: the Latent Exponentially Generated (LEG) family,
which admits a convenient stable state-space representation that allows
linear-time inference. We prove that any continuous integrable stationary
kernel can be approximated arbitrarily well by some member of the LEG family.
The proof draws connections to Spectral Mixture Kernels, providing new insight
about the flexibility of this popular family of kernels. We propose
parallelized algorithms for performing inference and learning in the LEG model,
test the algorithm on real and synthetic data, and demonstrate scaling to
datasets with billions of samples.

Title: Model-Free Algorithm and Regret Analysis for MDPs with Peak Constraints
Authors: Qinbo Bai and Ather Gattami and Vaneet Aggarwal
Categories: math.OC cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
\\
  In the optimization of dynamic systems, the variables typically have
constraints. Such problems can be modeled as a constrained Markov Decision
Process (MDP). This paper considers a model-free approach to the problem, where
the transition probabilities are not known. In the presence of peak
constraints, the agent has to choose the policy to maximize the long-term
average reward as well as satisfy the constraints at each time. We propose
modifications to the standard Q-learning problem for unconstrained optimization
to come up with an algorithm with peak constraints. The proposed algorithm is
shown to achieve $O(T^{1/2+\gamma})$ regret bound for the obtained reward, and
$O(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret bound for the constraint violation for any $\gamma
\in(0,1/2)$ and time-horizon $T$. We note that these are the first results on
regret analysis for constrained MDP, where the transition problems are not
known apriori. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on an energy harvesting
problem where it outperforms state-of-the-art and performs close to the
theoretical upper bound of the studied optimization problem.

Title: Off-policy Policy Evaluation For Sequential Decisions Under Unobserved
  Confounding
Authors: Hongseok Namkoong, Ramtin Keramati, Steve Yadlowsky, Emma Brunskill
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  When observed decisions depend only on observed features, off-policy policy
evaluation (OPE) methods for sequential decision making problems can estimate
the performance of evaluation policies before deploying them. This assumption
is frequently violated due to unobserved confounders, unrecorded variables that
impact both the decisions and their outcomes. We assess robustness of OPE
methods under unobserved confounding by developing worst-case bounds on the
performance of an evaluation policy. When unobserved confounders can affect
every decision in an episode, we demonstrate that even small amounts of
per-decision confounding can heavily bias OPE methods. Fortunately, in a number
of important settings found in healthcare, policy-making, operations, and
technology, unobserved confounders may primarily affect only one of the many
decisions made. Under this less pessimistic model of one-decision confounding,
we propose an efficient loss-minimization-based procedure for computing
worst-case bounds, and prove its statistical consistency. On two simulated
healthcare examples---management of sepsis patients and developmental
interventions for autistic children---where this is a reasonable model of
confounding, we demonstrate that our method invalidates non-robust results and
provides meaningful certificates of robustness, allowing reliable selection of
policies even under unobserved confounding.

Title: Methods of Adaptive Signal Processing on Graphs Using Vertex-Time
  Autoregressive Models
Authors: Thiernithi Variddhisai, Danilo Mandic
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The concept of a random process has been recently extended to graph signals,
whereby random graph processes are a class of multivariate stochastic processes
whose coefficients are matrices with a \textit{graph-topological} structure.
The system identification problem of a random graph process therefore revolves
around determining its underlying topology, or mathematically, the graph shift
operators (GSOs) i.e. an adjacency matrix or a Laplacian matrix. In the same
work that introduced random graph processes, a \textit{batch} optimization
method to solve for the GSO was also proposed for the random graph process
based on a \textit{causal} vertex-time autoregressive model. To this end, the
online version of this optimization problem was proposed via the framework of
adaptive filtering. The modified stochastic gradient projection method was
employed on the regularized least squares objective to create the filter. The
recursion is divided into 3 regularized sub-problems to address issues like
multi-convexity, sparsity, commutativity and bias. A discussion on convergence
analysis is also included. Finally, experiments are conducted to illustrate the
performance of the proposed algorithm, from traditional MSE measure to
successful recovery rate regardless correct values, all of which to shed light
on the potential, the limit and the possible research attempt of this work.

\\
  A machine learning algorithm is developed to forecast the CO2 emission
intensities in electrical power grids in the Danish bidding zone DK2,
distinguishing between average and marginal emissions. The analysis was done on
data set comprised of a large number (473) of explanatory variables such as
power production, demand, import, weather conditions etc. collected from
selected neighboring zones. The number was reduced to less than 50 using both
LASSO (a penalized linear regression analysis) and a forward feature selection
algorithm. Three linear regression models that capture different aspects of the
data (non-linearities and coupling of variables etc.) were created and combined
into a final model using Softmax weighted average. Cross-validation is
performed for debiasing and autoregressive moving average model (ARIMA)
implemented to correct the residuals, making the final model the variant with
exogenous inputs (ARIMAX). The forecasts with the corresponding uncertainties
are given for two time horizons, below and above six hours. Marginal emissions
came up independent of any conditions in the DK2 zone, suggesting that the
marginal generators are located in the neighbouring zones.
  The developed methodology can be applied to any bidding zone in the European
electricity network without requiring detailed knowledge about the zone.

Title: A deep belief network-based method to identify proteomic risk markers
  for Alzheimer disease
Authors: Ning An, Liuqi Jin, Huitong Ding, Jiaoyun Yang, Jing Yuan
Categories: q-bio.QM cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  While a large body of research has formally identified apolipoprotein E
(APOE) as a major genetic risk marker for Alzheimer disease, accumulating
evidence supports the notion that other risk markers may exist. The traditional
Alzheimer-specific signature analysis methods, however, have not been able to
make full use of rich protein expression data, especially the interaction
between attributes. This paper develops a novel feature selection method to
identify pathogenic factors of Alzheimer disease using the proteomic and
clinical data. This approach has taken the weights of network nodes as the
importance order of signaling protein expression values. After generating and
evaluating the candidate subset, the method helps to select an optimal subset
of proteins that achieved an accuracy greater than 90%, which is superior to
traditional machine learning methods for clinical Alzheimer disease diagnosis.
Besides identifying a proteomic risk marker and further reinforce the link
between metabolic risk factors and Alzheimer disease, this paper also suggests
that apidonectin-linked pathways are a possible therapeutic drug target.

  The idea of slicing divergences has been proven to be successful when
comparing two probability measures in various machine learning applications
including generative modeling, and consists in computing the expected value of
a `base divergence' between one-dimensional random projections of the two
measures. However, the computational and statistical consequences of such a
technique have not yet been well-established. In this paper, we aim at bridging
this gap and derive some properties of sliced divergence functions. First, we
show that slicing preserves the metric axioms and the weak continuity of the
divergence, implying that the sliced divergence will share similar topological
properties. We then precise the results in the case where the base divergence
belongs to the class of integral probability metrics. On the other hand, we
establish that, under mild conditions, the sample complexity of the sliced
divergence does not depend on the dimension, even when the base divergence
suffers from the curse of dimensionality. We finally apply our general results
to the Wasserstein distance and Sinkhorn divergences, and illustrate our theory
on both synthetic and real data experiments.

Title: Towards a General Theory of Infinite-Width Limits of Neural Classifiers
Authors: Eugene A. Golikov
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 27 pages, 7 figures, improved and corrected version of the paper
  submitted to ICML'20
\\
  Obtaining theoretical guarantees for neural networks training appears to be a
hard problem in a general case. Recent research has been focused on studying
this problem in the limit of infinite width and two different theories have
been developed: mean-field (MF) and kernel limit theories. We propose a general
framework that provides a link between these seemingly distinct theories. Our
framework out of the box gives rise to a discrete-time MF limit which was not
previously explored in the literature. We prove a convergence theorem for it
and show that it provides a more reasonable approximation for finite-width nets
compared to NTK limit if learning rates are not very small. Also, our analysis
suggests that all infinite-width limits of a network with a single hidden layer
are covered by either mean-field limit theory or kernel limit theory. We show
that for networks with more than two hidden layers RMSProp training has a
non-trivial MF limit, but GD training does not have one. Overall, our framework
demonstrates that both MF and NTK limits have considerable limitations in
approximating finite-sized neural nets, indicating the need for designing more
accurate infinite-width approximations for them. Source code to reproduce all
the reported results is available on GitHub.

Title: An agent-based model of multi-dimensional opinion dynamics and opinion
  alignment
Authors: Simon Schweighofer, David Garcia, Frank Schweitzer
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.MA nlin.AO
Comments: 34 pp
\\
  It is known that individual opinions on different policy issues often align
to a dominant ideological dimension (e.g. "left" vs. "right") and become
increasingly polarized. We provide an agent-based model that reproduces these
two stylized facts as emergent properties of an opinion dynamics in a
multi-dimensional space of continuous opinions. The mechanisms for the change
of agents' opinions in this multi-dimensional space are derived from cognitive
dissonance theory and structural balance theory. We test assumptions from
proximity voting and from directional voting regarding their ability to
reproduce the expected emerging properties. We further study how the emotional
involvement of agents, i.e. their individual resistance to change opinions,
impacts the dynamics. We identify two regimes for the global and the individual
alignment of opinions. If the affective involvement is high and shows a large
variance across agents, this fosters the emergence of a dominant ideological
dimension. Agents align their opinions along this dimension in opposite
directions, i.e. create a state of polarization.

  We propose a time-multiplexed DS-DBR/SOA-gated system to deliver low-power
fast tuning across S-/C-/L-bands. Sub-ns switching is demonstrated, supporting
122$\times$50 GHz channels over 6.05 THz using AI techniques.

Title: Bringing in the outliers: A sparse subspace clustering approach to learn
  a dictionary of mouse ultrasonic vocalizations
Authors: Jiaxi Wang and Karel Mundnich and Allison T. Knoll and Pat Levitt and
  Shrikanth Narayanan
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, conference paper, accepted in ICASSP 2020
\\
  Mice vocalize in the ultrasonic range during social interactions. These
vocalizations are used in neuroscience and clinical studies to tap into complex
behaviors and states. The analysis of these ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) has
been traditionally a manual process, which is prone to errors and human bias,
and is not scalable to large scale analysis. We propose a new method to
automatically create a dictionary of USVs based on a two-step spectral
clustering approach, where we split the set of USVs into inlier and outlier
data sets. This approach is motivated by the known degrading performance of
sparse subspace clustering with outliers. We apply spectral clustering to the
inlier data set and later find the clusters for the outliers. We propose
quantitative and qualitative performance measures to evaluate our method in
this setting, where there is no ground truth. Our approach outperforms two
baselines based on k-means and spectral clustering in all of the proposed
performance measures, showing greater distances between clusters and more
variability between clusters.

Title: Fast Gradient Method for Model Predictive Control with Input Rate and
  Amplitude Constraints
Authors: Idris Kempf and Paul Goulart and Stephen Duncan
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: Initial IFAC 2020 conference submission
\\
  This paper is concerned with the computing efficiency of model predictive
control (MPC) problems for dynamical systems with both rate and amplitude
constraints on the inputs. Instead of augmenting the decision variables of the
underlying finite-horizon optimal control problem to accommodate the input rate
constraints, we propose to solve this problem using the fast gradient method
(FGM), where the projection step is solved using Dykstra's algorithm. We show
that, relative to the Alternating Direction of Method Multipliers (ADMM), this
approach greatly reduces the computation time while halving the memory usage.
Our algorithm is implemented in C and its performance demonstrated using
several examples.

Title: Exponential input-to-state stabilization of a class of diagonal boundary
  control systems with delay boundary control
Authors: Hugo Lhachemi, Robert Shorten and Christophe Prieur
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: Published in Systems & Control Letters
Journal-ref: Systems & Control Letters, Volume 138, April 2020, 104651
DOI: 10.1016/j.sysconle.2020.104651
\\
  This paper deals with the exponential input-to-state stabilization with
respect to boundary disturbances of a class of diagonal infinite-dimensional
systems via delay boundary control. The considered input delays are uncertain
and time-varying. The proposed control strategy consists of a constant-delay
predictor feedback controller designed on a truncated finite-dimensional model
capturing the unstable modes of the original infinite-dimensional system. We
show that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially input-to-state
stable with fading memory of both additive boundary input perturbations and
disturbances in the computation of the predictor feedback.

Title: Co-Design of Delays and Sparse Controllers for Bandwidth-Constrained
  Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: Nandini Negi and Aranya Chakrabortty
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  We address the problem of sparsity-promoting optimal control of
cyber-physical systems with feedback delays. The delays are categorized into
two classes - namely, intra-layer delay, and inter-layer delay between the
cyber and the physical layers. Our objective is to minimize the H2-norm of the
closed-loop system by designing an optimal combination of these two delays
along with a sparse state-feedback controller, while respecting a given
bandwidth constraint. We propose a two-loop optimization algorithm for this.
The inner loop, based on alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM),
handles the conflicting directions of decreasing H2-norm and increasing
sparsity of the controller. The outer loop comprises of semidefinite program
(SDP)-based relaxations of non-convex inequalities necessary for stable
co-design of the delays with the controller. We illustrate this algorithm using
simulations that highlight various aspects of how delays and sparsity impact
the stability and $\mc{H}_2$ performance of a LTI system.
