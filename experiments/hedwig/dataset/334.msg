Title: Choice functions based on sets of strict partial orders: an axiomatic
  characterisation
Authors: Jasper De Bock
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Methods for choosing from a set of options are often based on a strict
partial order on these options, or on a set of such partial orders. I here
provide a very general axiomatic characterisation for choice functions of this
form. It includes as special cases an axiomatic characterisation for choice
functions based on (sets of) total orders, (sets of) weak orders, (sets of)
coherent lower previsions and (sets of) probability measures.

Title: A Critique on the Interventional Detection of Causal Relationships
Authors: Mehrzad Saremi
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Interventions are of fundamental importance in Pearl's probabilistic
causality regime. In this paper, we will inspect how interventions influence
the interpretation of causation in causal models in specific situation. To this
end, we will introduce a priori relationships as non-causal relationships in a
causal system. Then, we will proceed to discuss the cases that interventions
can lead to spurious causation interpretations. This includes the
interventional detection of a priori relationships, and cases where the
interventional detection of causality forms structural causal models that are
not valid in natural situations. We will also discuss other properties of a
priori relations and SCMs that have a priori information in their structural
equations.

  Collaboration requires agents to coordinate their behavior on the fly,
sometimes cooperating to solve a single task together and other times dividing
it up into sub-tasks to work on in parallel. Underlying the human ability to
collaborate is theory-of-mind, the ability to infer the hidden mental states
that drive others to act. Here, we develop Bayesian Delegation, a decentralized
multi-agent learning mechanism with these abilities. Bayesian Delegation
enables agents to rapidly infer the hidden intentions of others by inverse
planning. These inferences enable agents to flexibly decide in the absence of
communication when to cooperate on the same sub-task and when to work on
different sub-tasks in parallel. We test this model in a suite of multi-agent
Markov decision processes inspired by cooking problems. To succeed, agents must
coordinate both their high-level plans (e.g., what sub-task they should work
on) and their low-level actions (e.g., avoiding collisions). Bayesian
Delegation bridges these two levels and rapidly aligns agents' beliefs about
who should work on what without any communication. When agents cooperate on the
same sub-task, coordinated plans emerge that enable the group of agents to
achieve tasks no agent can complete on their own. Our model outperforms
lesioned agents without Bayesian Delegation or without the ability to cooperate
on the same sub-task.

Title: No-Rainbow Problem is NP-Hard

Categories: cs.CC cs.LO math.RA

  Surjective Constraint Satisfaction Problem (SCSP) is the problem of deciding
whether there exists a surjective assignment to a set of variables subject to
some specified constraints. In this paper we show that one of the most popular
variants of the SCSP, called No-Rainbow Problem, is NP-Hard.

Title: A Topological Characterization of Modulo-p Arguments and Implications
  for Necklace Splitting
Authors: Aris Filos-Ratsikas, Alexandros Hollender, Katerina Sotiraki, Manolis
  Zampetakis
Categories: cs.CC cs.CG cs.DM cs.GT
\\
  The classes PPA-$p$ have attracted attention lately, because they are the
main candidates for capturing the complexity of Necklace Splitting with $p$
thieves, for prime $p$. However, these classes are not known to have complete
problems of a topological nature, which impedes any progress towards settling
the complexity of the problem. On the contrary, such problems have been pivotal
in obtaining completeness results for PPAD and PPA, for several important
problems, such as finding a Nash equilibrium [Daskalakis et al., 2009, Chen et
al., 2009b] and Necklace Splitting with 2 thieves [Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg,
2019].
  In this paper, we provide the first topological characterization of the
classes PPA-$p$. First, we show that the computational problem associated with
a simple generalization of Tucker's Lemma, termed $p$-polygon-Tucker, as well
as the associated Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem, $p$-polygon-Borsuk-Ulam, are
PPA-$p$-complete. Then, we show that the computational version of the
well-known BSS Theorem [Barany et al., 1981], as well as the associated
BSS-Tucker problem are PPA-$p$-complete. Finally, using a different
generalization of Tucker's Lemma (termed $\mathbb{Z}_p$-star-Tucker), which we
prove to be PPA-$p$-complete, we prove that $p$-thieves Necklace Splitting is
in PPA-$p$. All of our containment results are obtained through a new
combinatorial proof for $\mathbb{Z}_p$-versions of Tucker's lemma that is a
natural generalization of the standard combinatorial proof of Tucker's lemma by
Freund and Todd [1981]. We believe that this new proof technique is of
independent interest.

Title: Position based dynamic of a particle system: a configurable algorithm to
  describe complex behaviour of continuum material starting from swarm robotics
Authors: Ramiro dell'Erba
Categories: cs.CE cs.RO
\\
  In a previous work we considered a two-dimensional lattice of particles and
calculated its time evolution by using an interaction law based on the spatial
position of the particles themselves. The model reproduced the behaviour of
deformable bodies both according to the standard Cauchy model and second
gradient theory; this success led us to use this method in more complex cases.
This work is intended as the natural evolution of the previous one in which we
shall consider both energy aspects, coherence with the principle of Saint
Venant and we start to manage a more general tool that can be adapted to
different physical phenomena, supporting complex effects like lateral
contraction, anisotropy or elastoplasticity.

Title: XBlock-EOS: Extracting and Exploring Blockchain Data From EOSIO
Authors: Weilin Zheng, Zibin Zheng, Hong-Ning Dai, Xu Chen, and Peilin Zheng
Categories: cs.CE cs.CR
Comments: 15 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables
\\
  Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and applications have flourished the
blockchain research community. Massive data generated from diverse blockchain
systems bring not only huge business values and but also technical challenges
in data analytics of heterogeneous blockchain data. Different from Bitcoin and
Ethereum, EOSIO has richer diversity and higher volume of blockchain data due
to its unique architectural design in resource management, consensus scheme and
high throughput. Despite its popularity (e.g., 89,800,000 blocks generated till
Nov. 14, 2019 since its launching in June 8, 2018), few studies have been made
on data analysis of EOSIO. To fill this gap, we collect and process the
up-to-date on-chain data from EOSIO. We name these well-processed EOSIO
datasets as XBlock-EOS, which consists of 7 well-processed datasets: 1) Block,
Transaction and Action, 2) Internal and External EOS Transfer Action, 3)
Contract Information, 4) Contract Invocation, 5) Token Action, 6) Account
Creation, 7) Resource Management. It is challenging to process and analyze high
volume of raw EOSIO data and establish the mapping from original raw data to
the fine-grained datasets since it requires substantial efforts in exacting
various types of data as well as sophisticated knowledge on software
engineering and data analytics. Meanwhile, we present statistics and
exploration on these datasets. Moreover, we also outline the possible research
opportunities based on XBlock-EOS.

Title: Geometric Pattern Matching Reduces to k-SUM
Authors: Boris Aronov and Jean Cardinal
Categories: cs.CG cs.DS
\\
  We prove that some exact geometric pattern matching problems reduce in linear
time to $k$-SUM when the pattern has a fixed size $k$. This holds in the real
RAM model for searching for a similar copy of a set of $k\geq 3$ points within
a set of $n$ points in the plane, and for searching for an affine image of a
set of $k\geq d+2$ points within a set of $n$ points in $d$-space.
  As corollaries, we obtain improved real RAM algorithms and decision trees for
the two problems. In particular, they can be solved by algebraic decision trees
of near-linear height.

Title: Geometric Sparsification of Closeness Relations: Eigenvalue Clustering
  for Computing Matrix Functions
Authors: Nir Goren, Dan Halperin, and Sivan Toledo
Categories: cs.CG cs.MS cs.NA math.NA
\\
  We show how to efficiently solve a clustering problem that arises in a method
to evaluate functions of matrices. The problem requires finding the connected
components of a graph whose vertices are eigenvalues of a real or complex
matrix and whose edges are pairs of eigenvalues that are at most \delta away
from each other. Davies and Higham proposed solving this problem by enumerating
the edges of the graph, which requires at least $\Omega(n^{2})$ work. We show
that the problem can be solved by computing the Delaunay triangulation of the
eigenvalues, removing from it long edges, and computing the connected
components of the remaining edges in the triangulation. This leads to an
$O(n\log n)$ algorithm. We have implemented both algorithms using CGAL, a
mature and sophisticated computational-geometry software library, and we
demonstrate that the new algorithm is much faster in practice than the naive
algorithm. We also present a tight analysis of the naive algorithm, showing
that it performs $\Theta(n^{2})$ work, and correct a misrepresentation in the
original statement of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first application of computational geometry to solve a real-world problem in
numerical linear algebra.

Title: Forensic Authorship Analysis of Microblogging Texts Using N-Grams and

\\
  In recent years, messages and text posted on the Internet are used in
criminal investigations. Unfortunately, the authorship of many of them remains
unknown. In some channels, the problem of establishing authorship may be even
harder, since the length of digital texts is limited to a certain number of
characters. In this work, we aim at identifying authors of tweet messages,
which are limited to 280 characters. We evaluate popular features employed
traditionally in authorship attribution which capture properties of the writing
style at different levels. We use for our experiments a self-captured database
of 40 users, with 120 to 200 tweets per user. Results using this small set are
promising, with the different features providing a classification accuracy
between 92% and 98.5%. These results are competitive in comparison to existing
studies which employ short texts such as tweets or SMS.

Title: Predicting Legal Proceedings Status: an Approach Based on Sequential
  Text Data
Authors: Felipe Maia Polo, Itamar Ciochetti, Emerson Bertolo
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Machine learning applications in the legal field are numerous and diverse. In
order to make contribution to both the machine learning community and the legal
community, we have made efforts to create a model compatible with the
classification of text sequences, valuing the interpretability of the results.
The purpose of this paper is to classify legal proceedings in three possible
status classes, which are (i) archived proceedings, (ii) active proceedings and
(iii) suspended proceedings. Our approach is composed by natural language
processing, supervised and unsupervised deep learning models and performed
remarkably well in the classification task. Furthermore we had some insights
regarding the patterns learned by the neural network applying tools to make the
results more interpretable.

Title: Finnish Language Modeling with Deep Transformer Models

Categories: cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS stat.ML
Comments: 4 pages
\\
  Transformers have recently taken the center stage in language modeling after
LSTM's were considered the dominant model architecture for a long time. In this
project, we investigate the performance of the Transformer architectures-BERT
and Transformer-XL for the language modeling task. We use a sub-word model
setting with the Finnish language and compare it to the previous State of the
art (SOTA) LSTM model. BERT achieves a pseudo-perplexity score of 14.5, which
is the first such measure achieved as far as we know. Transformer-XL improves
upon the perplexity score to 73.58 which is 27\% better than the LSTM model.

Title: Cost-Sensitive BERT for Generalisable Sentence Classification with
  Imbalanced Data
Authors: Harish Tayyar Madabushi, Elena Kochkina, Michael Castelle
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: NLP4IF 2019
\\
  The automatic identification of propaganda has gained significance in recent
years due to technological and social changes in the way news is generated and
consumed. That this task can be addressed effectively using BERT, a powerful
new architecture which can be fine-tuned for text classification tasks, is not
surprising. However, propaganda detection, like other tasks that deal with news
documents and other forms of decontextualized social communication (e.g.
sentiment analysis), inherently deals with data whose categories are
simultaneously imbalanced and dissimilar. We show that BERT, while capable of
handling imbalanced classes with no additional data augmentation, does not
generalise well when the training and test data are sufficiently dissimilar (as
is often the case with news sources, whose topics evolve over time). We show
how to address this problem by providing a statistical measure of similarity
between datasets and a method of incorporating cost-weighting into BERT when
the training and test sets are dissimilar. We test these methods on the
Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC) and achieve the second-highest score on
sentence-level propaganda classification.

Title: Predicting Unplanned Readmissions with Highly Unstructured Data
Authors: Constanza Fierro, Jorge P\'erez, Javier Mora
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied to predict unplanned
readmissions of patients in medical centers. The training data for these models
is usually based on historical medical records that contain a significant
amount of free-text from admission reports, referrals, exam notes, etc. Most of
the models proposed so far are tailored to English text data and assume that
electronic medical records follow standards common in developed countries.
These two characteristics make them difficult to apply in developing countries
that do not necessarily follow international standards for registering patient
information, or that store text information in languages other than English.
  In this paper we propose a deep learning architecture for predicting
unplanned readmissions that consumes data that is significantly less structured
compared with previous models in the literature. We use it to present the first
results for this task in a large clinical dataset that mainly contains Spanish
text data. The dataset is composed of almost 10 years of records in a Chilean
medical center. On this dataset, our model achieves results that are comparable
to some of the most recent results obtained in US medical centers for the same
task (0.76 AUROC).

Title: Author2Vec: A Framework for Generating User Embedding
Authors: Xiaodong Wu, Weizhe Lin, Zhilin Wang, and Elena Rastorgueva
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Online forums and social media platforms provide noisy but valuable data
every day. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network-based
user embedding system, Author2Vec. The model incorporates sentence
representations generated by BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) with a novel unsupervised pre-training objective, authorship
classification, to produce better user embedding that encodes useful
user-intrinsic properties. This user embedding system was pre-trained on post
data of 10k Reddit users and was analyzed and evaluated on two user
classification benchmarks: depression detection and personality classification,
in which the model proved to outperform traditional count-based and
prediction-based methods. We substantiate that Author2Vec successfully encoded
useful user attributes and the generated user embedding performs well in
downstream classification tasks without further finetuning.

Title: Sentiment Analysis in Drug Reviews using Supervised Machine Learning
  Algorithms
Authors: Sairamvinay Vijayaraghavan, Debraj Basu
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Sentiment Analysis is an important algorithm in Natural Language Processing
which is used to detect sentiment within some text. In our project, we had
chosen to work on analyzing reviews of various drugs which have been reviewed
in form of texts and have also been given a rating on a scale from 1-10. We had
obtained this data set from the UCI machine learning repository which had 2
data sets: train and test (split as 75-25\%). We had split the number rating
for the drug into three classes in general: positive (7-10), negative (1-4) or
neutral(4-7). There are multiple reviews for the drugs that belong to a similar
condition and we decided to investigate how the reviews for different
conditions use different words impact the ratings of the drugs. Our intention
was mainly to implement supervised machine learning classification algorithms
that predict the class of the rating using the textual review. We had primarily
implemented different embeddings such as Term Frequency Inverse Document
Frequency (TFIDF) and the Count Vectors (CV). We had trained models on the most
popular conditions such as "Birth Control", "Depression" and "Pain" within the
data set and obtained good results while predicting the test data sets.

Journal-ref: 12th International Conference on Agents and Artificial
  Intelligence (ICAART 2020)
DOI: 10.5220/0008940304940505
\\
  In Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC), one sample can belong to more than
one class. It is observed that most MLTC tasks, there are dependencies or
correlations among labels. Existing methods tend to ignore the relationship
among labels. In this paper, a graph attention network-based model is proposed
to capture the attentive dependency structure among the labels. The graph
attention network uses a feature matrix and a correlation matrix to capture and
explore the crucial dependencies between the labels and generate classifiers
for the task. The generated classifiers are applied to sentence feature vectors
obtained from the text feature extraction network (BiLSTM) to enable end-to-end
training. Attention allows the system to assign different weights to neighbor
nodes per label, thus allowing it to learn the dependencies among labels
implicitly. The results of the proposed model are validated on five real-world
MLTC datasets. The proposed model achieves similar or better performance
compared to the previous state-of-the-art models.

Title: Word2Vec: Optimal Hyper-Parameters and Their Impact on NLP Downstream
  Tasks
Authors: Tosin P. Adewumi, Foteini Liwicki and Marcus Liwicki
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables
\\
  Word2Vec is a prominent tool for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
Similar inspiration is found in distributed embeddings for state-of-the-art
(sota) deep neural networks. However, wrong combination of hyper-parameters can
produce poor quality vectors. The objective of this work is to show optimal
combination of hyper-parameters exists and evaluate various combinations. We
compare them with the original model released by Mikolov. Both intrinsic and
extrinsic (downstream) evaluations, including Named Entity Recognition (NER)
and Sentiment Analysis (SA) were carried out. The downstream tasks reveal that
the best model is task-specific, high analogy scores don't necessarily
correlate positively with F1 scores and the same applies for more data.
Increasing vector dimension size after a point leads to poor quality or
performance. If ethical considerations to save time, energy and the environment
are made, then reasonably smaller corpora may do just as well or even better in
some cases. Besides, using a small corpus, we obtain better human-assigned
WordSim scores, corresponding Spearman correlation and better downstream (NER &
SA) performance compared to Mikolov's model, trained on 100 billion word
corpus.

entity extraction. With the help of a domain expert and text processing
methods, we construct a dataset annotated at the word-level by carefully
defining a labelling scheme to train a sequence model to recognize systems
engineering concepts. We use a pre-trained language model and fine-tune it with
the labeled dataset of concepts. In addition, we also create some essential
datasets for information such as abbreviations and definitions from the systems
engineering domain. Finally, we construct a simple knowledge graph using these
extracted concepts along with some hyponym relations.

Title: Rat big, cat eaten! Ideas for a useful deep-agent protolanguage
Authors: Marco Baroni
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Deep-agent communities developing their own language-like communication
protocol are a hot (or at least warm) topic in AI. Such agents could be very
useful in machine-machine and human-machine interaction scenarios long before
they have evolved a protocol as complex as human language. Here, I propose a
small set of priorities we should focus on, if we want to get as fast as
possible to a stage where deep agents speak a useful protolanguage.

Title: TLDR: Token Loss Dynamic Reweighting for Reducing Repetitive Utterance
  Generation
Authors: Shaojie Jiang, Thomas Wolf, Christof Monz, Maarten de Rijke
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, 1 table
\\
  Natural Language Generation (NLG) models are prone to generating repetitive
utterances. In this work, we study the repetition problem for encoder-decoder
models, using both recurrent neural network (RNN) and transformer
architectures. To this end, we consider the chit-chat task, where the problem
is more prominent than in other tasks that need encoder-decoder architectures.
We first study the influence of model architectures. By using pre-attention and
highway connections for RNNs, we manage to achieve lower repetition rates.
However, this method does not generalize to other models such as transformers.
We hypothesize that the deeper reason is that in the training corpora, there
are hard tokens that are more difficult for a generative model to learn than
others and, once learning has finished, hard tokens are still under-learned, so
that repetitive generations are more likely to happen. Based on this
hypothesis, we propose token loss dynamic reweighting (TLDR) that applies
differentiable weights to individual token losses. By using higher weights for
hard tokens and lower weights for easy tokens, NLG models are able to learn
individual tokens at different paces. Experiments on chit-chat benchmark
datasets show that TLDR is more effective in repetition reduction for both RNN
and transformer architectures than baselines using different weighting
functions.

Title: From Information Theory Puzzles in Deletion Channels to Deniability in
  Quantum Cryptography
Authors: Arash Atashpendar

\\
  From the output produced by a memoryless deletion channel with a uniformly
random input of known length $n$, one obtains a posterior distribution on the
channel input. The difference between the Shannon entropy of this distribution
and that of the uniform prior measures the amount of information about the
channel input which is conveyed by the output of length $m$. We first
conjecture on the basis of experimental data that the entropy of the posterior
is minimized by the constant strings $\texttt{000}\ldots$, $\texttt{111}\ldots$
and maximized by the alternating strings $\texttt{0101}\ldots$,
$\texttt{1010}\ldots$. We present related combinatorial theorems involving
binary (sub/super)-sequences and prove the minimal entropy conjecture for
single and double deletions using clustering techniques. We then prove the
minimization conjecture in the asymptotic limit using results from hidden word
statistics by showing how the analytic-combinatorial methods of Flajolet,
Szpankowski and Vall\'ee, relying on generating functions, can be applied to
resolve the case of fixed output length and $n\rightarrow\infty$.
  Next, we revisit the notion of deniability in quantum key exchange (QKE). We
introduce and formalize the notion of coercer-deniable QKE. We then establish a
connection between covert communication and deniability to propose DC-QKE, a
simple and provably secure construction for coercer-deniable QKE. We relate
deniability to fundamental concepts in quantum information theory and suggest a
generic approach based on entanglement distillation for achieving
information-theoretic deniability, followed by an analysis of other closely
related results such as the relation between the impossibility of
unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment and deniability. Finally, we
present an efficient coercion-resistant and quantum-secure voting scheme, based
on fully homomorphic encryption.

  Adversarial examples represent a great security threat for deep learning
systems, pushing researchers to develop suitable defense mechanisms. The use of
networks adopting error-correcting output codes (ECOC) has recently been
proposed to deal with white-box attacks. In this paper, we carry out an
in-depth investigation of the security achieved by the ECOC approach. In
contrast to previous findings, our analysis reveals that, when the attack in
the white-box framework is carried out properly, the ECOC scheme can be
attacked by introducing a rather small perturbation. We do so by considering
both the popular adversarial attack proposed by Carlini and Wagner (C&W) and a
new variant of C&W attack specifically designed for multi-label classification
architectures, like the ECOC-based structure. Experimental results regarding
different classification tasks demonstrate that ECOC networks can be
successfully attacked by both the original C&W attack and the new attack.

multinacci sequences under prime modulo. In this scheme, instead of exchanging
key matrix, we need to exchange the only pair of numbers $(\lambda, k)$, which
reduces the time complexity as well as space complexity and comes with a large
key-space.

Title: Denial of Service Attacks Detection in Software-Defined Wireless Sensor
  Networks
Authors: Gustavo A. Nunez Segura, Sotiris Skaperas, Arsenia Chorti, Lefteris

Categories: cs.CR cs.NI
\\
  Software-defined networking (SDN) is a promising technology to overcome many
challenges in wireless sensor networks (WSN), particularly with respect to
flexibility and reuse. Conversely, the centralization and the planes'
separation turn SDNs vulnerable to new security threats in the general context
of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. State-of-the-art approaches to
identify DDoS do not always take into consideration restrictions in typical
WSNs e.g., computational complexity and power constraints, while further
performance improvement is always a target. The objective of this work is to
propose a lightweight but very efficient DDoS attack detection approach using
change point analysis. Our approach has a high detection rate and linear
complexity, so that it is suitable for WSNs. We demonstrate the performance of
our detector in software-defined WSNs of 36 and 100 nodes with varying attack
intensity (the number of attackers ranges from 5% to 20% of nodes). We use
change point detectors to monitor anomalies in two metrics: the data packets
delivery rate and the control packets overhead. Our results show that with
increasing intensity of attack, our approach can achieve a detection rate close
to100% and that the type of attack can also be inferred.

Title: Man-in-the-Middle and Denial of Service Attacks in Wireless Secret Key
  Generation
Authors: Miroslav Mitev, Arsenia Chorti, E. Veronica Belmega, Martin Reed
Categories: cs.CR cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Wireless secret key generation (W-SKG) from shared randomness (e.g., from the
wireless channel fading realizations), is a well established scheme that can be
used for session key agreement. W-SKG approaches can be of particular interest
in delay constrained wireless networks and notably in the context of ultra
reliable low latency communications (URLLC) in beyond fifth generation (B5G)
systems. However, W-SKG schemes are known to be malleable over the so called
"advantage distillation" phase, during which observations of the shared
randomness are obtained at the legitimate parties. As an example, an active
attacker can act as a man-in-the-middle (MiM) by injecting pilot signals and/or
can mount denial of service attacks (DoS) in the form of jamming. This paper
investigates the impact of injection and reactive jamming attacks in W-SKG.
First, it is demonstrated that injection attacks can be reduced to -
potentially less harmful - jamming attacks by pilot randomization; a novel
system design with randomized QPSK pilots is presented. Subsequently, the
optimal jamming strategy is identified in a block fading additive white
Gaussian noise (BF-AWGN) channel in the presence of a reactive jammer, using a
game theoretic formulation. It is shown that the impact of a reactive jammer is
far more severe than that of a simple proactive jammer

Title: Learning Layout and Style Reconfigurable GANs for Controllable Image
  Synthesis
Authors: Wei Sun and Tianfu Wu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  With the remarkable recent progress on learning deep generative models, it
becomes increasingly interesting to develop models for controllable image
synthesis from reconfigurable inputs. This paper focuses on a recent emerged
task, layout-to-image, to learn generative models that are capable of
synthesizing photo-realistic images from spatial layout (i.e., object bounding
boxes configured in an image lattice) and style (i.e., structural and
appearance variations encoded by latent vectors). This paper first proposes an
intuitive paradigm for the task, layout-to-mask-to-image, to learn to unfold
object masks of given bounding boxes in an input layout to bridge the gap
between the input layout and synthesized images. Then, this paper presents a
method built on Generative Adversarial Networks for the proposed
layout-to-mask-to-image with style control at both image and mask levels.
Object masks are learned from the input layout and iteratively refined along
stages in the generator network. Style control at the image level is the same
as in vanilla GANs, while style control at the object mask level is realized by
a proposed novel feature normalization scheme, Instance-Sensitive and
Layout-Aware Normalization. In experiments, the proposed method is tested in
the COCO-Stuff dataset and the Visual Genome dataset with state-of-the-art
performance obtained.

Comments: Accepted to CVPR2020
\\
  We introduce a new task, Video-and-Language Inference, for joint multimodal
understanding of video and text. Given a video clip with aligned subtitles as
premise, paired with a natural language hypothesis based on the video content,
a model needs to infer whether the hypothesis is entailed or contradicted by
the given video clip. A new large-scale dataset, named Violin
(VIdeO-and-Language INference), is introduced for this task, which consists of
95,322 video-hypothesis pairs from 15,887 video clips, spanning over 582 hours
of video. These video clips contain rich content with diverse temporal
dynamics, event shifts, and people interactions, collected from two sources:
(i) popular TV shows, and (ii) movie clips from YouTube channels. In order to
address our new multimodal inference task, a model is required to possess
sophisticated reasoning skills, from surface-level grounding (e.g., identifying
objects and characters in the video) to in-depth commonsense reasoning (e.g.,
inferring causal relations of events in the video). We present a detailed
analysis of the dataset and an extensive evaluation over many strong baselines,
providing valuable insights on the challenges of this new task.

Title: Deep Grouping Model for Unified Perceptual Parsing
Authors: Zhiheng Li, Wenxuan Bao, Jiayang Zheng, Chenliang Xu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020
Journal-ref: CVPR 2020
\\
  The perceptual-based grouping process produces a hierarchical and
compositional image representation that helps both human and machine vision
systems recognize heterogeneous visual concepts. Examples can be found in the
classical hierarchical superpixel segmentation or image parsing works. However,
the grouping process is largely overlooked in modern CNN-based image
segmentation networks due to many challenges, including the inherent
incompatibility between the grid-shaped CNN feature map and the
irregular-shaped perceptual grouping hierarchy. Overcoming these challenges, we
propose a deep grouping model (DGM) that tightly marries the two types of
representations and defines a bottom-up and a top-down process for feature
exchanging. When evaluating the model on the recent Broden+ dataset for the
unified perceptual parsing task, it achieves state-of-the-art results while
having a small computational overhead compared to other contextual-based
segmentation models. Furthermore, the DGM has better interpretability compared
with modern CNN methods.

Title: DeepStrip: High Resolution Boundary Refinement
Authors: Peng Zhou, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, Gregg Wilensky and Larry S. Davis
Categories: cs.CV
Journal-ref: CVPR 2020
\\
  In this paper, we target refining the boundaries in high resolution images
given low resolution masks. For memory and computation efficiency, we propose
to convert the regions of interest into strip images and compute a boundary
prediction in the strip domain. To detect the target boundary, we present a
framework with two prediction layers. First, all potential boundaries are
predicted as an initial prediction and then a selection layer is used to pick
the target boundary and smooth the result. To encourage accurate prediction, a
loss which measures the boundary distance in the strip domain is introduced. In
addition, we enforce a matching consistency and C0 continuity regularization to
the network to reduce false alarms. Extensive experiments on both public and a
newly created high resolution dataset strongly validate our approach.

Title: BachGAN: High-Resolution Image Synthesis from Salient Object Layout
Authors: Yandong Li, Yu Cheng, Zhe Gan, Licheng Yu, Liqiang Wang, and Jingjing
  Liu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  We propose a new task towards more practical application for image generation
- high-quality image synthesis from salient object layout. This new setting
allows users to provide the layout of salient objects only (i.e., foreground
bounding boxes and categories), and lets the model complete the drawing with an
invented background and a matching foreground. Two main challenges spring from
this new task: (i) how to generate fine-grained details and realistic textures
without segmentation map input; and (ii) how to create a background and weave
it seamlessly into standalone objects. To tackle this, we propose Background
Hallucination Generative Adversarial Network (BachGAN), which first selects a
set of segmentation maps from a large candidate pool via a background retrieval
module, then encodes these candidate layouts via a background fusion module to
hallucinate a suitable background for the given objects. By generating the
hallucinated background representation dynamically, our model can synthesize
high-resolution images with both photo-realistic foreground and integral
background. Experiments on Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the
advantage of BachGAN over existing methods, measured on both visual fidelity of
generated images and visual alignment between output images and input layouts.

\\
  Image classification has become a key ingredient in the field of computer
vision. To enhance classification accuracy, current approaches heavily focus on
increasing network depth and width, e.g., inception modules, at the cost of
computational requirements. To mitigate this problem, in this paper a novel
dictionary learning method is proposed and tested with Chinese handwritten
numbers. We have considered three important characteristics to design the
dictionary: discriminability, sparsity, and classification error. We formulated
these metrics into a unified cost function. The proposed architecture i)
obtains an efficient sparse code in a novel feature space without relying on
$\ell_0$ and $\ell_1$ norms minimisation; and ii) includes the classification
error within the cost function as an extra constraint. Experimental results
show that the proposed method provides superior classification performance
compared to recent dictionary learning methods. With a classification accuracy
of $\sim$98\%, the results suggest that our proposed sparse learning algorithm
achieves comparable performance to existing well-known deep learning methods,
e.g., SqueezeNet, GoogLeNet and MobileNetV2, but with a fraction of parameters.

Comments: Accepted to Proc. IEEE Conf. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
  (CVPR), 2020
\\
  To date, instance segmentation is dominated by twostage methods, as pioneered
by Mask R-CNN. In contrast, one-stage alternatives cannot compete with Mask
R-CNN in mask AP, mainly due to the difficulty of compactly representing masks,
making the design of one-stage methods very challenging. In this work, we
propose a simple singleshot instance segmentation framework, termed mask
encoding based instance segmentation (MEInst). Instead of predicting the
two-dimensional mask directly, MEInst distills it into a compact and
fixed-dimensional representation vector, which allows the instance segmentation
task to be incorporated into one-stage bounding-box detectors and results in a
simple yet efficient instance segmentation framework. The proposed one-stage
MEInst achieves 36.4% in mask AP with single-model (ResNeXt-101-FPN backbone)
and single-scale testing on the MS-COCO benchmark. We show that the much
simpler and flexible one-stage instance segmentation method, can also achieve
competitive performance. This framework can be easily adapted for other
instance-level recognition tasks. Code is available at:

Title: Fastidious Attention Network for Navel Orange Segmentation
Authors: Xiaoye Sun, Gongyan Li, Shaoyun Xu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep learning achieves excellent performance in many domains, so we not only
apply it to the navel orange semantic segmentation task to solve the two
problems of distinguishing defect categories and identifying the stem end and
blossom end, but also propose a fastidious attention mechanism to further
improve model performance. This lightweight attention mechanism includes two
learnable parameters, activations and thresholds, to capture long-range
dependence. Specifically, the threshold picks out part of the spatial feature
map and the activation excite this area. Based on activations and thresholds
training from different types of feature maps, we design fastidious
self-attention module (FSAM) and fastidious inter-attention module (FIAM). And
then construct the Fastidious Attention Network (FANet), which uses U-Net as
the backbone and embeds these two modules, to solve the problems with semantic
segmentation for stem end, blossom end, flaw and ulcer. Compared with some
state-of-the-art deep-learning-based networks under our navel orange dataset,
experiments show that our network is the best performance with pixel accuracy
99.105%, mean accuracy 77.468%, mean IU 70.375% and frequency weighted IU
98.335%. And embedded modules show better discrimination of 5 categories
including background, especially the IU of flaw is increased by 3.165%.

  Image captioning models have been able to generate grammatically correct and
human understandable sentences. However most of the captions convey limited
information as the model used is trained on datasets that do not caption all
possible objects existing in everyday life. Due to this lack of prior
information most of the captions are biased to only a few objects present in
the scene, hence limiting their usage in daily life. In this paper, we attempt
to show the biased nature of the currently existing image captioning models and
present a new image captioning dataset, Egoshots, consisting of 978 real life
images with no captions. We further exploit the state of the art pre-trained
image captioning and object recognition networks to annotate our images and
show the limitations of existing works. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the
quality of the generated captions, we propose a new image captioning metric,
object based Semantic Fidelity (SF). Existing image captioning metrics can
evaluate a caption only in the presence of their corresponding annotations;
however, SF allows evaluating captions generated for images without
annotations, making it highly useful for real life generated captions.

Title: Real-time 3D Deep Multi-Camera Tracking

Comments: 17 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Tracking a crowd in 3D using multiple RGB cameras is a challenging task. Most
previous multi-camera tracking algorithms are designed for offline setting and
have high computational complexity. Robust real-time multi-camera 3D tracking
is still an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end
tracking pipeline, Deep Multi-Camera Tracking (DMCT), which achieves reliable
real-time multi-camera people tracking. Our DMCT consists of 1) a fast and
novel perspective-aware Deep GroudPoint Network, 2) a fusion procedure for
ground-plane occupancy heatmap estimation, 3) a novel Deep Glimpse Network for
person detection and 4) a fast and accurate online tracker. Our design fully
unleashes the power of deep neural network to estimate the "ground point" of
each person in each color image, which can be optimized to run efficiently and
robustly. Our fusion procedure, glimpse network and tracker merge the results
from different views, find people candidates using multiple video frames and
then track people on the fused heatmap. Our system achieves the
state-of-the-art tracking results while maintaining real-time performance.
Apart from evaluation on the challenging WILDTRACK dataset, we also collect two
more tracking datasets with high-quality labels from two different environments
and camera settings. Our experimental results confirm that our proposed
real-time pipeline gives superior results to previous approaches.

low dimensional. We use the intuition that it is much better to train the GAN
generator by minimizing the distributional distance between real and generated
images in a small dimensional feature space representing such a manifold than
on the original pixel-space. We use the feature space of the GAN discriminator
for such a representation. For distributional distance, we employ one of two
choices: the Fr\'{e}chet distance or direct optimal transport (OT); these
respectively lead us to two new GAN methods: Fr\'{e}chet-GAN and OT-GAN. The
idea of employing Fr\'{e}chet distance comes from the success of Fr\'{e}chet
Inception Distance as a solid evaluation metric in image generation.
Fr\'{e}chet-GAN is attractive in several ways. We propose an efficient,
numerically stable approach to calculate the Fr\'{e}chet distance and its
gradient. The Fr\'{e}chet distance estimation requires a significantly less
computation time than OT; this allows Fr\'{e}chet-GAN to use much larger
mini-batch size in training than OT. More importantly, we conduct experiments
on a number of benchmark datasets and show that Fr\'{e}chet-GAN (in particular)
and OT-GAN have significantly better image generation capabilities than the
existing representative primal and dual GAN approaches based on the Wasserstein
distance.

Title: Compact Deep Aggregation for Set Retrieval
Authors: Yujie Zhong, Relja Arandjelovi\'c, Andrew Zisserman
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 20 pages
\\
  The objective of this work is to learn a compact embedding of a set of
descriptors that is suitable for efficient retrieval and ranking, whilst
maintaining discriminability of the individual descriptors. We focus on a
specific example of this general problem -- that of retrieving images
containing multiple faces from a large scale dataset of images. Here the set
consists of the face descriptors in each image, and given a query for multiple
identities, the goal is then to retrieve, in order, images which contain all
the identities, all but one, \etc
  To this end, we make the following contributions: first, we propose a CNN
architecture -- {\em SetNet} -- to achieve the objective: it learns face
descriptors and their aggregation over a set to produce a compact fixed length
descriptor designed for set retrieval, and the score of an image is a count of
the number of identities that match the query; second, we show that this
compact descriptor has minimal loss of discriminability up to two faces per
image, and degrades slowly after that -- far exceeding a number of baselines;
third, we explore the speed vs.\ retrieval quality trade-off for set retrieval
using this compact descriptor; and, finally, we collect and annotate a large
dataset of images containing various number of celebrities, which we use for
evaluation and is publicly released.

Title: Neural encoding and interpretation for high-level visual cortices based
  on fMRI using image caption features
Authors: Kai Qiao, Chi Zhang, Jian Chen, Linyuan Wang, Li Tong, Bin Yan
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV q-bio.NC
\\
  On basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers are
devoted to designing visual encoding models to predict the neuron activity of
human in response to presented image stimuli and analyze inner mechanism of
human visual cortices. Deep network structure composed of hierarchical
processing layers forms deep network models by learning features of data on
specific task through big dataset. Deep network models have powerful and
hierarchical representation of data, and have brought about breakthroughs for
visual encoding, while revealing hierarchical structural similarity with the
manner of information processing in human visual cortices. However, previous
studies almost used image features of those deep network models pre-trained on
classification task to construct visual encoding models. Except for deep
network structure, the task or corresponding big dataset is also important for
deep network models, but neglected by previous studies. Because image
classification is a relatively fundamental task, it is difficult to guide deep
network models to master high-level semantic representations of data, which
causes into that encoding performance for high-level visual cortices is
limited. In this study, we introduced one higher-level vision task: image
caption (IC) task and proposed the visual encoding model based on IC features
(ICFVEM) to encode voxels of high-level visual cortices. Experiment
demonstrated that ICFVEM obtained better encoding performance than previous
deep network models pre-trained on classification task. In addition, the
interpretation of voxels was realized to explore the detailed characteristics
of voxels based on the visualization of semantic words, and comparative
analysis implied that high-level visual cortices behaved the correlative
representation of image content.

Title: Do Deep Minds Think Alike? Selective Adversarial Attacks for
  Fine-Grained Manipulation of Multiple Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Zain Khan, Jirong Yi, Raghu Mudumbai, Xiaodong Wu, Weiyu Xu

\\
  Recent works have demonstrated the existence of {\it adversarial examples}
targeting a single machine learning system. In this paper we ask a simple but
fundamental question of "selective fooling": given {\it multiple} machine
learning systems assigned to solve the same classification problem and taking
the same input signal, is it possible to construct a perturbation to the input
signal that manipulates the outputs of these {\it multiple} machine learning
systems {\it simultaneously} in arbitrary pre-defined ways? For example, is it
possible to selectively fool a set of "enemy" machine learning systems but does
not fool the other "friend" machine learning systems? The answer to this
question depends on the extent to which these different machine learning
systems "think alike". We formulate the problem of "selective fooling" as a
novel optimization problem, and report on a series of experiments on the MNIST
dataset. Our preliminary findings from these experiments show that it is in
fact very easy to selectively manipulate multiple MNIST classifiers
simultaneously, even when the classifiers are identical in their architectures,
training algorithms and training datasets except for random initialization
during training. This suggests that two nominally equivalent machine learning
systems do not in fact "think alike" at all, and opens the possibility for many
novel applications and deeper understandings of the working principles of deep
neural networks.

Authors: Jianyuan Guo, Kai Han, Yunhe Wang, Chao Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Han Wu,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted in CVPR 2020
\\
  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has achieved great success in image
classification task. Some recent works have managed to explore the automatic
design of efficient backbone or feature fusion layer for object detection.
However, these methods focus on searching only one certain component of object
detector while leaving others manually designed. We identify the inconsistency
between searched component and manually designed ones would withhold the
detector of stronger performance. To this end, we propose a hierarchical
trinity search framework to simultaneously discover efficient architectures for
all components (i.e. backbone, neck, and head) of object detector in an
end-to-end manner. In addition, we empirically reveal that different parts of
the detector prefer different operators. Motivated by this, we employ a novel
scheme to automatically screen different sub search spaces for different
components so as to perform the end-to-end search for each component on the
corresponding sub search space efficiently. Without bells and whistles, our
searched architecture, namely Hit-Detector, achieves 41.4\% mAP on COCO minival
set with 27M parameters. Our implementation is available at

Title: P $\approx$ NP, at least in Visual Question Answering
Authors: Shailza Jolly, Sebastian Palacio, Joachim Folz, Federico Raue, Jorn
  Hees, Andreas Dengel
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In recent years, progress in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) field has
largely been driven by public challenges and large datasets. One of the most
widely-used of these is the VQA 2.0 dataset, consisting of polar ("yes/no") and
non-polar questions. Looking at the question distribution over all answers, we
find that the answers "yes" and "no" account for 38 % of the questions, while
the remaining 62% are spread over the more than 3000 remaining answers. While
several sources of biases have already been investigated in the field, the
effects of such an over-representation of polar vs. non-polar questions remain
unclear. In this paper, we measure the potential confounding factors when polar
and non-polar samples are used jointly to train a baseline VQA classifier, and
compare it to an upper bound where the over-representation of polar questions
is excluded from the training. Further, we perform cross-over experiments to
analyze how well the feature spaces align. Contrary to expectations, we find no
evidence of counterproductive effects in the joint training of unbalanced
classes. In fact, by exploring the intermediate feature space of visual-text
embeddings, we find that the feature space of polar questions already encodes
sufficient structure to answer many non-polar questions. Our results indicate
that the polar (P) and the non-polar (NP) feature spaces are strongly aligned,
hence the expression P $\approx$ NP

Title: Instance Credibility Inference for Few-Shot Learning
Authors: Yikai Wang, Chengming Xu, Chen Liu, Li Zhang, Yanwei Fu
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: accepted by CVPR 2020
\\
  Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize new objects with extremely limited
training data for each category. Previous efforts are made by either leveraging
meta-learning paradigm or novel principles in data augmentation to alleviate
this extremely data-scarce problem. In contrast, this paper presents a simple
statistical approach, dubbed Instance Credibility Inference (ICI) to exploit
the distribution support of unlabeled instances for few-shot learning.
Specifically, we first train a linear classifier with the labeled few-shot
examples and use it to infer the pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. To
measure the credibility of each pseudo-labeled instance, we then propose to
solve another linear regression hypothesis by increasing the sparsity of the
incidental parameters and rank the pseudo-labeled instances with their sparsity
degree. We select the most trustworthy pseudo-labeled instances alongside the
labeled examples to re-train the linear classifier. This process is iterated
until all the unlabeled samples are included in the expanded training set, i.e.
the pseudo-label is converged for unlabeled data pool. Extensive experiments
under two few-shot settings show that our simple approach can establish new
state-of-the-arts on four widely used few-shot learning benchmark datasets
including miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and CUB. Our code is

Title: DCNAS: Densely Connected Neural Architecture Search for Semantic Image
  Segmentation
Authors: Xiong Zhang, Hongmin Xu, Hong Mo, Jianchao Tan, Cheng Yang, Wenqi Ren
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great potentials in automatically
designing scalable network architectures for dense image predictions. However,
existing NAS algorithms usually compromise on restricted search space and
search on proxy task to meet the achievable computational demands. To allow as
wide as possible network architectures and avoid the gap between target and
proxy dataset, we propose a Densely Connected NAS (DCNAS) framework, which
directly searches the optimal network structures for the multi-scale
representations of visual information, over a large-scale target dataset.
Specifically, by connecting cells with each other using learnable weights, we
introduce a densely connected search space to cover an abundance of mainstream
network designs. Moreover, by combining both path-level and channel-level
sampling strategies, we design a fusion module to reduce the memory consumption
of ample search space. We demonstrate that the architecture obtained from our
DCNAS algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performances on public semantic image
segmentation benchmarks, including 83.6% on Cityscapes, and 86.9% on PASCAL VOC
2012 (track w/o additional data). We also retain leading performances when
evaluating the architecture on the more challenging ADE20K and Pascal Context
dataset.

Title: Matrix Smoothing: A Regularization for DNN with Transition Matrix under
  Noisy Labels
Authors: Xianbin Lv, Dongxian Wu, Shu-Tao Xia
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: ICME 2020
\\
  Training deep neural networks (DNNs) in the presence of noisy labels is an
important and challenging task. Probabilistic modeling, which consists of a
classifier and a transition matrix, depicts the transformation from true labels
to noisy labels and is a promising approach. However, recent probabilistic
methods directly apply transition matrix to DNN, neglect DNN's susceptibility
to overfitting, and achieve unsatisfactory performance, especially under the
uniform noise. In this paper, inspired by label smoothing, we proposed a novel
method, in which a smoothed transition matrix is used for updating DNN, to
restrict the overfitting of DNN in probabilistic modeling. Our method is termed
Matrix Smoothing. We also empirically demonstrate that our method not only
improves the robustness of probabilistic modeling significantly, but also even
obtains a better estimation of the transition matrix.

Title: Zero-Assignment Constraint for Graph Matching with Outliers
Authors: Fudong Wang and Nan Xue and Jin-Gang Yu and Gui-Song Xia
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Graph matching (GM), as a longstanding problem in computer vision and pattern
recognition, still suffers from numerous cluttered outliers in practical
applications. To address this issue, we present the zero-assignment constraint
(ZAC) for approaching the graph matching problem in the presence of outliers.
The underlying idea is to suppress the matchings of outliers by assigning
zero-valued vectors to the potential outliers in the obtained optimal
correspondence matrix. We provide elaborate theoretical analysis to the
problem, i.e., GM with ZAC, and figure out that the GM problem with and without
outliers are intrinsically different, which enables us to put forward a
sufficient condition to construct valid and reasonable objective function.
Consequently, we design an efficient outlier-robust algorithm to significantly
reduce the incorrect or redundant matchings caused by numerous outliers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve the
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency, especially in
the presence of numerous outliers.

Title: Towards Backward-Compatible Representation Learning
Authors: Yantao Shen, Yuanjun Xiong, Wei Xia, and Stefano Soatto
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020 as oral
\\
  We propose a way to learn visual features that are compatible with previously
computed ones even when they have different dimensions and are learned via
different neural network architectures and loss functions. Compatible means
that, if such features are used to compare images, then "new" features can be
compared directly to "old" features, so they can be used interchangeably. This
enables visual search systems to bypass computing new features for all
previously seen images when updating the embedding models, a process known as
backfilling. Backward compatibility is critical to quickly deploy new embedding
models that leverage ever-growing large-scale training datasets and
improvements in deep learning architectures and training methods. We propose a
framework to train embedding models, called backward-compatible training (BCT),
as a first step towards backward compatible representation learning. In
experiments on learning embeddings for face recognition, models trained with
BCT successfully achieve backward compatibility without sacrificing accuracy,
thus enabling backfill-free model updates of visual embeddings.

Title: Severity Assessment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Using
  Quantitative Features from Chest CT Images
Authors: Zhenyu Tang, Wei Zhao, Xingzhi Xie, Zheng Zhong, Feng Shi, Jun Liu,
  Dinggang Shen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Background: Chest computed tomography (CT) is recognized as an important tool
for COVID-19 severity assessment. As the number of affected patients increase
rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may
lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize
automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest
CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting
assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age
45.3$\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used,
from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the
whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are
calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity
(non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each
quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of
COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross
validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive
rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of
quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the
whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to
the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the
right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left
lung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment
(non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising.
Several quantitative features, which have the potential to reflect the severity
of COVID-19, were revealed.

Title: Milking CowMask for Semi-Supervised Image Classification

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figured, submitted to ICML 2020
\\
  Consistency regularization is a technique for semi-supervised learning that
has recently been shown to yield strong results for classification with few
labeled data. The method works by perturbing input data using augmentation or
adversarial examples, and encouraging the learned model to be robust to these
perturbations on unlabeled data. Here, we evaluate the use of a recently
proposed augmentation method, called CowMasK, for this purpose. Using CowMask
as the augmentation method in semi-supervised consistency regularization, we
establish a new state-of-the-art result on Imagenet with 10% labeled data, with
a top-5 error of 8.76% and top-1 error of 26.06%. Moreover, we do so with a
method that is much simpler than alternative methods. We further investigate
the behavior of CowMask for semi-supervised learning by running many smaller
scale experiments on the small image benchmarks SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
where we achieve results competitive with the state of the art, and where we
find evidence that the CowMask perturbation is widely applicable. We open

Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Image-based Corn Kernel Detection and
  Counting

Comments: 8 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Precise in-season corn grain yield estimates enable farmers to make real-time
accurate harvest and grain marketing decisions minimizing possible losses of
profitability. A well developed corn ear can have up to 800 kernels, but
manually counting the kernels on an ear of corn is labor-intensive, time
consuming and prone to human error. From an algorithmic perspective, the
detection of the kernels from a single corn ear image is challenging due to the
large number of kernels at different angles and very small distance among the
kernels. In this paper, we propose a kernel detection and counting method based
on a sliding window approach. The proposed method detect and counts all corn
kernels in a single corn ear image taken in uncontrolled lighting conditions.
The sliding window approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for
kernel detection. Then, a non-maximum suppression (NMS) is applied to remove
overlapping detections. Finally, windows that are classified as kernel are
passed to another CNN regression model for finding the (x,y) coordinates of the
center of kernel image patches. Our experiments indicate that the proposed
method can successfully detect the corn kernels with a low detection error and
is also able to detect kernels on a batch of corn ears positioned at different
angles.

Title: Pseudo-Labeling for Small Lesion Detection on Diabetic Retinopathy
  Images
Authors: Qilei Chen, Ping Liu, Jing Ni, Yu Cao, Benyuan Liu, Honggang Zhang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a primary cause of blindness in working-age
people worldwide. About 3 to 4 million people with diabetes become blind
because of DR every year. Diagnosis of DR through color fundus images is a
common approach to mitigate such problem. However, DR diagnosis is a difficult
and time consuming task, which requires experienced clinicians to identify the
presence and significance of many small features on high resolution images.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has proved to be a promising approach for
automatic biomedical image analysis recently. In this work, we investigate
lesion detection on DR fundus images with CNN-based object detection methods.
Lesion detection on fundus images faces two unique challenges. The first one is
that our dataset is not fully labeled, i.e., only a subset of all lesion
instances are marked. Not only will these unlabeled lesion instances not
contribute to the training of the model, but also they will be mistakenly
counted as false negatives, leading the model move to the opposite direction.
The second challenge is that the lesion instances are usually very small,
making them difficult to be found by normal object detectors. To address the
first challenge, we introduce an iterative training algorithm for the
semi-supervised method of pseudo-labeling, in which a considerable number of
unlabeled lesion instances can be discovered to boost the performance of the
lesion detector. For the small size targets problem, we extend both the input
size and the depth of feature pyramid network (FPN) to produce a large CNN
feature map, which can preserve the detail of small lesions and thus enhance
the effectiveness of the lesion detector. The experimental results show that
our proposed methods significantly outperform the baselines.

  The Online Action Detection (OAD) problem needs to be revisited. Unlike
traditional offline action detection approaches, where the evaluation metrics
are clear and well established, in the OAD setting we find very few works and
no consensus on the evaluation protocols to be used. In this work we propose to
rethink the OAD scenario, clearly defining the problem itself and the main
characteristics that the models which are considered online must comply with.
We also introduce a novel metric: the Instantaneous Accuracy ($IA$). This new
metric exhibits an \emph{online} nature and solves most of the limitations of
the previous metrics. We conduct a thorough experimental evaluation on 3
challenging datasets, where the performance of various baseline methods is
compared to that of the state-of-the-art. Our results confirm the problems of
the previous evaluation protocols, and suggest that an IA-based protocol is
more adequate to the online scenario. The baselines models and a development
kit with the novel evaluation protocol are publicly available:

  When we humans look at a video of human-object interaction, we can not only
infer what is happening but we can even extract actionable information and
imitate those interactions. On the other hand, current recognition or geometric
approaches lack the physicality of action representation. In this paper, we
take a step towards a more physical understanding of actions. We address the
problem of inferring contact points and the physical forces from videos of
humans interacting with objects. One of the main challenges in tackling this
problem is obtaining ground-truth labels for forces. We sidestep this problem
by instead using a physics simulator for supervision. Specifically, we use a
simulator to predict effects and enforce that estimated forces must lead to the
same effect as depicted in the video. Our quantitative and qualitative results

Title: Learning Inverse Rendering of Faces from Real-world Videos
Authors: Yuda Qiu, Zhangyang Xiong, Kai Han, Zhongyuan Wang, Zixiang Xiong,

Comments: First two authors contributed equally.

\\
  In this paper we examine the problem of inverse rendering of real face
images. Existing methods decompose a face image into three components (albedo,
normal, and illumination) by supervised training on synthetic face data.
However, due to the domain gap between real and synthetic face images, a model
trained on synthetic data often does not generalize well to real data.
Meanwhile, since no ground truth for any component is available for real
images, it is not feasible to conduct supervised learning on real face images.
To alleviate this problem, we propose a weakly supervised training approach to
train our model on real face videos, based on the assumption of consistency of
albedo and normal across different frames, thus bridging the gap between real
and synthetic face images. In addition, we introduce a learning framework,
called IlluRes-SfSNet, to further extract the residual map to capture the
global illumination effects that give the fine details that are largely ignored
in existing methods. Our network is trained on both real and synthetic data,
benefiting from both. We comprehensively evaluate our methods on various
benchmarks, obtaining better inverse rendering results than the
state-of-the-art.

Title: Are Labels Necessary for Neural Architecture Search?

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Existing neural network architectures in computer vision --- whether designed
by humans or by machines --- were typically found using both images and their
associated labels. In this paper, we ask the question: can we find high-quality
neural architectures using only images, but no human-annotated labels? To
answer this question, we first define a new setup called Unsupervised Neural
Architecture Search (UnNAS). We then conduct two sets of experiments. In
sample-based experiments, we train a large number (500) of diverse
architectures with either supervised or unsupervised objectives, and find that
the architecture rankings produced with and without labels are highly
correlated. In search-based experiments, we run a well-established NAS
algorithm (DARTS) using various unsupervised objectives, and report that the
architectures searched without labels can be competitive to their counterparts
searched with labels. Together, these results reveal the potentially surprising
finding that labels are not necessary, and the image statistics alone may be
sufficient to identify good neural architectures.

Title: Grounded Situation Recognition
Authors: Sarah Pratt, Mark Yatskar, Luca Weihs, Ali Farhadi, Aniruddha Kembhavi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We introduce Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR), a task that requires
producing structured semantic summaries of images describing: the primary
activity, entities engaged in the activity with their roles (e.g. agent, tool),
and bounding-box groundings of entities. GSR presents important technical
challenges: identifying semantic saliency, categorizing and localizing a large
and diverse set of entities, overcoming semantic sparsity, and disambiguating
roles. Moreover, unlike in captioning, GSR is straightforward to evaluate. To
study this new task we create the Situations With Groundings (SWiG) dataset
which adds 278,336 bounding-box groundings to the 11,538 entity classes in the
imsitu dataset. We propose a Joint Situation Localizer and find that jointly
predicting situations and groundings with end-to-end training handily
outperforms independent training on the entire grounding metric suite with
relative gains between 8% and 32%. Finally, we show initial findings on three
exciting future directions enabled by our models: conditional querying, visual
chaining, and grounded semantic aware image retrieval. Code and data available

Title: Correspondence Networks with Adaptive Neighbourhood Consensus

Comments: CVPR 2020. Project page: https://ancnet.avlcode.org/
\\
  In this paper, we tackle the task of establishing dense visual
correspondences between images containing objects of the same category. This is
a challenging task due to large intra-class variations and a lack of dense
pixel level annotations. We propose a convolutional neural network
architecture, called adaptive neighbourhood consensus network (ANC-Net), that
can be trained end-to-end with sparse key-point annotations, to handle this
challenge. At the core of ANC-Net is our proposed non-isotropic 4D convolution
kernel, which forms the building block for the adaptive neighbourhood consensus
module for robust matching. We also introduce a simple and efficient
multi-scale self-similarity module in ANC-Net to make the learned feature
robust to intra-class variations. Furthermore, we propose a novel orthogonal
loss that can enforce the one-to-one matching constraint. We thoroughly
evaluate the effectiveness of our method on various benchmarks, where it
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Negative Margin Matters: Understanding Margin in Few-shot Classification

Comments: Code is available at https://github.com/bl0/negative-margin.few-shot
\\
  This paper introduces a negative margin loss to metric learning based
few-shot learning methods. The negative margin loss significantly outperforms
regular softmax loss, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three standard
few-shot classification benchmarks with few bells and whistles. These results
are contrary to the common practice in the metric learning field, that the
margin is zero or positive. To understand why the negative margin loss performs
well for the few-shot classification, we analyze the discriminability of
learned features w.r.t different margins for training and novel classes, both
empirically and theoretically. We find that although negative margin reduces
the feature discriminability for training classes, it may also avoid falsely
mapping samples of the same novel class to multiple peaks or clusters, and thus
benefit the discrimination of novel classes. Code is available at
https://github.com/bl0/negative-margin.few-shot.

Title: Memory Enhanced Global-Local Aggregation for Video Object Detection
Authors: Yihong Chen, Yue Cao, Han Hu, Liwei Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR2020
\\
  How do humans recognize an object in a piece of video? Due to the
deteriorated quality of single frame, it may be hard for people to identify an
occluded object in this frame by just utilizing information within one image.
We argue that there are two important cues for humans to recognize objects in
videos: the global semantic information and the local localization information.
Recently, plenty of methods adopt the self-attention mechanisms to enhance the
features in key frame with either global semantic information or local
localization information. In this paper we introduce memory enhanced
global-local aggregation (MEGA) network, which is among the first trials that
takes full consideration of both global and local information. Furthermore,
empowered by a novel and carefully-designed Long Range Memory (LRM) module, our
proposed MEGA could enable the key frame to get access to much more content
than any previous methods. Enhanced by these two sources of information, our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet VID dataset. Code is
available at \url{https://github.com/Scalsol/mega.pytorch}.

\\
  In spite of the rapidly advancing global technological environment, the
professional participation of women in technology, big data, analytics,
artificial intelligence and information systems related domains remains
proportionately low. Furthermore, it is of no less concern that the number of
women in leadership in these domains are in even lower proportions. In spite of
numerous initiatives to improve the participation of women in technological
domains, there is an increasing need to gain additional insights into this
phenomenon especially since it occurs in nations and geographies which have
seen a sharp rise in overall female education, without such increase
translating into a corresponding spurt in information systems and technological
roles for women. The present paper presents findings from an exploratory
analysis and outlines a framework to gain insights into educational factors in
the emerging technology waves influencing the role of, and impact upon, women.
We specifically identify ways for learning and self-efficacy as key factors,
which together lead us to the Advancement of Women in Technology (AWT) insights
framework. Based on the AWT framework, we also proposition principles that can
be used to encourage higher professional engagement of women in emerging and
advanced technologies. Key Words- Women's Education, Technology, Artificial
Intelligence, Knowing, Confidence, Self-Efficacy, Learning.

\\
  The reappearance of measles in the US and Europe, a disease considered
eliminated in early 2000s, has been accompanied by a growing debate on the
merits of vaccination on social media. In this study we examine the extent to
which the vaccination debate on Twitter is conductive to potential outreach to
the vaccination hesitant. We focus on Italy, one of the countries most affected
by the latest measles outbreaks. We discover that the vaccination skeptics, as
well as the advocates, reside in their own distinct "echo chambers". The
structure of these communities differs as well, with skeptics arranged in a
tightly connected cluster, and advocates organizing themselves around few
authoritative hubs. At the center of these echo chambers we find the ardent
supporters, for which we build highly accurate network- and content-based
classifiers (attaining 95% cross-validated accuracy). Insights of this study
provide several avenues for potential future interventions, including
network-guided targeting, accounting for the political context, and monitoring
of alternative sources of information.

\\
  The Subgraph Matching (SM) problem consists of finding all the embeddings of
a given small graph, called the query, into a large graph, called the target.
The SM problem has been widely studied for simple graphs, i.e. graphs where
there is exactly one edge between two nodes and nodes have single labels, but
few approaches have been devised for labeled multigraphs, i.e. graphs having
possibly multiple labels on nodes in which pair of nodes may have multiple
labeled edges between them. Here we present MultiRI, a novel algorithm for the
Sub-Multigraph Matching (SMM) problem, i.e. subgraph matching in labeled
multigraphs. MultiRI improves on the state-of-the-art by computing
compatibility domains and symmetry breaking conditions on query nodes to filter
the search space of possible solutions. Empirically, we show that MultiRI
outperforms the state-of-the-art method for the SMM problem in both synthetic
and real graphs, with a multiplicative speedup between five and ten for large
graphs, by using a limited amount of memory.

trends in trajectory data management, ranging from trajectory pre-processing,
storage, common trajectory analytic tools, such as querying spatial-only and
spatial-textual trajectory data, and trajectory clustering. We also explore
four closely related analytical tasks commonly used with trajectory data in
interactive or real-time processing. Deep trajectory learning is also reviewed
for the first time. Finally, we outline the essential qualities that a
trajectory management system should possess in order to maximize flexibility.

Title: Property Graph Schema Optimization for Domain-Specific Knowledge Graphs
Authors: Chuan Lei, Rana Alotaibi, Abdul Quamar, Vasilis Efthymiou, and Fatma

Categories: cs.DB
Comments: 17 pages
\\
  Enterprises are creating domain-specific knowledge graphs by curating and
integrating their business data from multiple sources. The data in these
knowledge graphs can be described using ontologies, which provide a semantic
abstraction to define the content in terms of the entities and the
relationships of the domain. The rich semantic relationships in an ontology
contain a variety of opportunities to reduce edge traversals and consequently
improve the graph query performance. Although there has been a lot of effort to
build systems that enable efficient querying over knowledge graphs, the problem
of schema optimization for query performance has been largely ignored in the
graph setting. In this work, we show that graph schema design has significant
impact on query performance, and then propose optimization algorithms that
exploit the opportunities from the domain ontology to generate efficient
property graph schemas. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
present an ontology-driven approach for property graph schema optimization. We
conduct empirical evaluations with two real-world knowledge graphs from medical
and financial domains. The results show that the schemas produced by the
optimization algorithms achieve up to 2 orders of magnitude speed-up compared
to the baseline approach.

Comments: Extended version of a EuroSys'20 paper
\\
  Online applications now routinely replicate their data at multiple sites
around the world. In this paper we present Atlas, the first state-machine
replication protocol tailored for such planet-scale systems. Atlas does not
rely on a distinguished leader, so clients enjoy the same quality of service
independently of their geographical locations. Furthermore, client-perceived
latency improves as we add sites closer to clients. To achieve this, Atlas
minimizes the size of its quorums using an observation that concurrent data
center failures are rare. It also processes a high percentage of accesses in a
single round trip, even when these conflict. We experimentally demonstrate that
Atlas consistently outperforms state-of-the-art protocols in planet-scale
scenarios. In particular, Atlas is up to two times faster than Flexible Paxos
with identical failure assumptions, and more than doubles the performance of
Egalitarian Paxos in the YCSB benchmark.

  As data structures and mathematical objects used for complex systems
modeling, hypergraphs sit nicely poised between on the one hand the world of
network models, and on the other that of higher-order mathematical abstractions
from algebra, lattice theory, and topology. They are able to represent complex
systems interactions more faithfully than graphs and networks, while also being
some of the simplest classes of systems representing topological structures as
collections of multidimensional objects connected in a particular pattern. In
this paper we discuss the role of (undirected) hypergraphs in the science of
complex networks, and provide a mathematical overview of the core concepts
needed for hypernetwork modeling, including duality and the relationship to
bicolored graphs, quantitative adjacency and incidence, the nature of walks in
hypergraphs, and available topological relationships and properties. We close
with a brief discussion of two example applications: biomedical databases for
disease analysis, and domain-name system (DNS) analysis of cyber data.

Title: Further Results on Colored Range Searching
Authors: Timothy M. Chan, Qizheng He, Yakov Nekrich
Categories: cs.DS cs.CG
Comments: full version of a SoCG'20 paper
\\
  We present a number of new results about range searching for colored (or
"categorical") data:
  1. For a set of $n$ colored points in three dimensions, we describe
randomized data structures with $O(n\mathop{\rm polylog}n)$ space that can
report the distinct colors in any query orthogonal range (axis-aligned box) in
$O(k\mathop{\rm polyloglog} n)$ expected time, where $k$ is the number of
distinct colors in the range, assuming that coordinates are in
$\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Previous data structures require $O(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}
+ k)$ query time. Our result also implies improvements in higher constant
dimensions.
  2. Our data structures can be adapted to halfspace ranges in three dimensions
(or circular ranges in two dimensions), achieving $O(k\log n)$ expected query
time. Previous data structures require $O(k\log^2n)$ query time.
  3. For a set of $n$ colored points in two dimensions, we describe a data
structure with $O(n\mathop{\rm polylog}n)$ space that can answer colored
"type-2" range counting queries: report the number of occurrences of every
distinct color in a query orthogonal range. The query time is $O(\frac{\log
n}{\log\log n} + k\log\log n)$, where $k$ is the number of distinct colors in
the range. Naively performing $k$ uncolored range counting queries would
require $O(k\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ time.
  Our data structures are designed using a variety of techniques, including
colored variants of randomized incremental construction (which may be of
independent interest), colored variants of shallow cuttings, and bit-packing
tricks.

Title: On Structural Parameterizations of Node Kayles
Authors: Yasuaki Kobayashi
Categories: cs.DS math.CO
Comments: a preliminary version was presented at JCDCG^3 2018
\\
  Node Kayles is a well-known two-player impartial game on graphs: Given an
undirected graph, each player alternately chooses a vertex not adjacent to
previously chosen vertices, and a player who cannot choose a new vertex loses
the game. The problem of deciding if the first player has a winning strategy in
this game is known to be PSPACE-complete. There are a few studies on
algorithmic aspects of this problem. In this paper, we consider the problem
from the viewpoint of fixed-parameter tractability. We show that the problem is
fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the size of a minimum vertex cover
or the modular-width of a given graph. Moreover, we give a polynomial
kernelization with respect to neighborhood diversity.

Categories: cs.DS
\\
  The representation of a dynamic ordered set of $n$ integer keys drawn from a
universe of size $m$ is a fundamental data structuring problem. Many solutions
to this problem achieve optimal time but take polynomial space, therefore
preserving time optimality in the \emph{compressed} space regime is the problem
we address in this work. For a polynomial universe $m = n^{\Theta(1)}$, we give
a solution that takes $\textsf{EF}(n,m) + o(n)$ bits, where $\textsf{EF}(n,m)
\leq n\lceil \log_2(m/n)\rceil + 2n$ is the cost in bits of the
\emph{Elias-Fano} representation of the set, and supports random access to the
$i$-th smallest element in $O(\log n/ \log\log n)$ time, updates and
predecessor search in $O(\log\log n)$ time. These time bounds are optimal.

\\
  Among the various key networks in the human body, the nervous system occupies
central importance. The debilitating effects of spinal cord injuries (SCI)
impact a significant number of people throughout the world, and to date, there
is no satisfactory method to treat them. In this paper, we review the major
treatment techniques for SCI that include promising solutions based on
information and communication technology (ICT) and identify the key
characteristics of such systems. We then introduce two novel ICT-based
treatment approaches for SCI. The first proposal is based on neural interface
systems (NIS) with enhanced feedback, where the external machines are
interfaced with the brain and the spinal cord such that the brain signals are
directly routed to the limbs for movement. The second proposal relates to the
design of self-organizing artificial neurons (ANs) that can be used to replace
the injured or dead biological neurons. Apart from SCI treatment, the proposed
methods may also be utilized as enabling technologies for neural interface
applications by acting as bio-cyber interfaces between the nervous system and
machines. Furthermore, under the framework of Internet of Bio- Nano Things
(IoBNT), experience gained from SCI treatment techniques can be transferred to
nano communication research to develop intra-body applications, including
remote monitoring of the body and automatized targeted drug delivery.

Title: Minimising Good-for-Games automata is NP complete
Authors: Sven Schewe
Categories: cs.FL
MSC-class: 68Q45
ACM-class: F.4.3
\\
  This paper discusses the hardness of finding minimal good-for-games (GFG)
Buchi, Co-Buchi, and parity automata with state based acceptance. The problem
appears to sit between finding small deterministic and finding small
nondeterministic automata, where minimality is NP-complete and PSPACE-complete,
respectively. However, recent work of Radi and Kupferman has shown that
minimising Co-Buchi automata with transition based acceptance is tractable,
which suggests that the complexity of minimising GFG automata might be cheaper
than minimising deterministic automata.
  We show for the standard state based acceptance that the minimality of a GFG
automaton is NP-complete for Buchi, Co-Buchi, and parity GFG automata. The
proofs are a surprisingly straight forward generalisation of the proofs from
deterministic Buchi automata: they use a similar reductions, and the same hard

Title: Last Round Convergence and No-Instant Regret in Repeated Games with
  Asymmetric Information
Authors: Le Cong Dinh, Long Tran-Thanh, Tri-Dung Nguyen, Alain B. Zemkoho
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  This paper considers repeated games in which one player has more information
about the game than the other players. In particular, we investigate repeated
two-player zero-sum games where only the column player knows the payoff matrix
A of the game. Suppose that while repeatedly playing this game, the row player
chooses her strategy at each round by using a no-regret algorithm to minimize
her (pseudo) regret. We develop a no-instant-regret algorithm for the column
player to exhibit last round convergence to a minimax equilibrium. We show that
our algorithm is efficient against a large set of popular no-regret algorithms
of the row player, including the multiplicative weight update algorithm, the
online mirror descent method/follow-the-regularized-leader, the linear
multiplicative weight update algorithm, and the optimistic multiplicative
weight update.

Title: A Misreport- and Collusion-Proof Crowdsourcing Mechanism without Quality
  Verification
Authors: Kun Li, Shengling Wang, Xiuzhen Cheng, Qin Hu
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  Quality control plays a critical role in crowdsourcing. The state-of-the-art
work is not suitable for large-scale crowdsourcing applications, since it is a
long haul for the requestor to verify task quality or select professional
workers in a one-by-one mode. In this paper, we propose a misreport- and
collusion-proof crowdsourcing mechanism, guiding workers to truthfully report
the quality of submitted tasks without collusion by designing a mechanism, so
that workers have to act the way the requestor would like. In detail, the
mechanism proposed by the requester makes no room for the workers to obtain
profit through quality misreport and collusion, and thus, the quality can be
controlled without any verification. Extensive simulation results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. Finally, the importance and
originality of our work lie in that it reveals some interesting and even
counterintuitive findings: 1) a high-quality worker may pretend to be a
low-quality one; 2) the rise of task quality from high-quality workers may not
result in the increased utility of the requestor; 3) the utility of the
requestor may not get improved with the increasing number of workers. These
findings can boost forward looking and strategic planning solutions for
crowdsourcing.

Title: Simultaneous 2nd Price Item Auctions with No-Underbidding
Authors: Michal Feldman and Galia Shabtai
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: submitted to EC2020
\\
  We study the price of anarchy (PoA) of simultaneous 2nd price auctions (S2PA)
under a natural condition of {\em no underbidding}. No underbidding means that
an agent's bid on every item is at least its marginal value given the outcome.
In a 2nd price auction, underbidding on an item is weakly dominated by bidding
the item's marginal value. Indeed, the no underbidding assumption is justified
both theoretically and empirically.
  We establish bounds on the PoA of S2PA under no underbidding for different
valuation classes, in both full-information and incomplete information
settings. To derive our results, we introduce a new parameterized property of
auctions, namely $(\gamma,\delta)$-revenue guaranteed, and show that every
auction that is $(\gamma,\delta)$-revenue guaranteed has PoA at least
$\gamma/(1+\delta)$. An auction that is both $(\lambda,\mu)$-smooth and
$(\gamma,\delta)$-revenue guaranteed has PoA at least
$(\gamma+\lambda)/(1+\delta+\mu)$. Via extension theorems, these bounds extend
to coarse correlated equilibria in full information settings, and to Bayesian
PoA (BPoA) in settings with incomplete information.
  We show that S2PA with submodular valuations and no underbidding is
$(1,1)$-revenue guaranteed, implying that the PoA is at least $\frac{1}{2}$.
Together with the known $(1,1)$-smoothness (under the standard no overbididng
assumption), it gives PoA of $2/3$ and this is tight.
  For valuations beyond submodular valuations we employ a stronger condition of
{\em set no underbidding}, which extends the no underbidding condition to sets
of items. We show that S2PA with set no underbidding is $(1,1)$-revenue
guaranteed for arbitrary valuations, implying a PoA of at least $1/2$. Together
with no overbidding we get a lower bound of $\frac{2}{3}$ on the Bayesian PoA
for XOS valuations, and on the PoA for subadditive valuations.

  Personas can help raise awareness among stakeholders about users' needs.
While personas are made-up people, they are based on facts gathered from user
research. Personas can also be used to raise awareness of universal design and
accessibility needs of people with disabilities. We review the current state of
the art of the personas and review some research and industry projects that use
them. We outline techniques that can be used to create personas with
disabilities. This includes advice on how to get more information about
assistive technology and how to better include people with disabilities in the
persona creation process. We also describe our use of personas with
disabilities in several projects and discuss how it has helped to find
accessibility issues.

Title: Unfair Exposure of Artists in Music Recommendation
Authors: Himan Abdollahpouri, Robin Burke, Masoud Mansoury
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  Fairness in machine learning has been studied by many researchers. In
particular, fairness in recommender systems has been investigated to ensure the
recommendations meet certain criteria with respect to certain sensitive
features such as race, gender etc. However, often recommender systems are
multi-stakeholder environments in which the fairness towards all stakeholders
should be taken care of. It is well-known that the recommendation algorithms
suffer from popularity bias; few popular items are over-recommended which leads
to the majority of other items not getting proportionate attention. This bias
has been investigated from the perspective of the users and how it makes the
final recommendations skewed towards popular items in general. In this paper,
however, we investigate the impact of popularity bias in recommendation
algorithms on the provider of the items (i.e. the entities who are behind the
recommended items). Using a music dataset for our experiments, we show that,
due to some biases in the algorithms, different groups of artists with varying
degrees of popularity are systematically and consistently treated differently
than others.

Comments: Published in The Twenty-Eighth Text REtrieval Conference Proceedings
  (TREC 2019)
\\
  The goal of the TREC Fair Ranking track was to develop a benchmark for
evaluating retrieval systems in terms of fairness to different content
providers in addition to classic notions of relevance. As part of the
benchmark, we defined standardized fairness metrics with evaluation protocols
and released a dataset for the fair ranking problem. The 2019 task focused on
reranking academic paper abstracts given a query. The objective was to fairly
represent relevant authors from several groups that were unknown at the system
submission time. Thus, the track emphasized the development of systems which
have robust performance across a variety of group definitions. Participants
were provided with querylog data (queries, documents, and relevance) from
Semantic Scholar. This paper presents an overview of the track, including the
task definition, descriptions of the data and the annotation process, as well
as a comparison of the performance of submitted systems.

\\
  Comment sections below online news articles enjoy growing popularity among
readers. However, the overwhelming number of comments makes it infeasible for
the average news consumer to read all of them and hinders engaging discussions.
Most platforms display comments in chronological order, which neglects that
some of them are more relevant to users and are better conversation starters.
In this paper, we systematically analyze user engagement in the form of the
upvotes and replies that a comment receives. Based on comment texts, we train a
model to distinguish comments that have either a high or low chance of
receiving many upvotes and replies. Our evaluation on user comments from
TheGuardian.com compares recurrent and convolutional neural network models, and
a traditional feature-based classifier. Further, we investigate what makes some
comments more engaging than others. To this end, we identify engagement
triggers and arrange them in a taxonomy. Explanation methods for neural
networks reveal which input words have the strongest influence on our model's
predictions. In addition, we evaluate on a dataset of product reviews, which
exhibit similar properties as user comments, such as featuring upvotes for
helpfulness.

Title: Massive Access in Multi-cell Wireless Networks Using Reed-Muller Codes
Authors: Pei Yang, Dongning Guo, and Hongwen Yang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 30 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Providing connectivity to a massive number of devices is a key challenge in
5G wireless systems. In particular, it is crucial to develop efficient methods
for active device identification and message decoding in a multi-cell network
with fading and path loss uncertainties. In this paper, we design such a scheme
using second-order Reed-Muller (RM) sequences. For given positive integer $m$,
a codebook is generated with up to $2^{m(m+3)/2}$ codewords of length $2^m$,
where each codeword is a unique RM sequence determined by a matrix-vector pair
with binary entries. This allows every device to send $m(m+3)/2$ bits of
information where an arbitrary number of these bits can be used to represent
the identity of a node, and the remaining bits represent a message. There can
be up to $2^{m(m+3)/2}$ devices in total. Using an iterative algorithm, an
access point can estimate the matrix-vector pairs of each nearby device, as
long as not too many devices transmit simultaneously. To improve the
performance, we also describe an enhanced RM coding scheme with slotting. We
show that both the computational complexity and the error performance of the
latter algorithm exceed another state-of-the-art algorithm. The device
identification and message decoding scheme developed in this work can serve as
the basis for grant-free massive access for billions of devices with hundreds
of simultaneously active devices in each cell.

Title: Wavelet Compressibility of Compound Poisson Processes
Authors: Shayan Aziznejad, Julien Fageot
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we characterize the wavelet compressibility of compound
Poisson processes. To that end, we expand a given compound Poisson process over
the Haar wavelet basis and analyse its asymptotic approximation properties. By
considering only the nonzero wavelet coefficients up to a given scale, what we
call the sparse approximation, we exploit the extreme sparsity of the wavelet
expansion that derives from the piecewise-constant nature of compound Poisson
processes. More precisely, we provide nearly-tight lower and upper bounds for
the mean $L_2$-sparse approximation error of compound Poisson processes. Using
these bounds, we then prove that the sparse approximation error has a
sub-exponential and super-polynomial asymptotic behavior. We illustrate these
theoretical results with numerical simulations on compound Poisson processes.
In particular, we highlight the remarkable ability of wavelet-based
dictionaries in achieving highly compressible approximations of compound
Poisson processes.

Title: Latency Minimization for Task Offloading in Hierarchical Fog-Computing
  C-RAN Networks
Authors: Yijin Pan, Huilin Jiang, Huiling Zhu, and Jiangzhou Wang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: accepted by ICC 2020
\\
  Fog-computing network combines the cloud computing and fog access points
(FAPs) equipped with mobile edge computing (MEC) servers together to support
computation-intensive tasks for mobile users. However, as FAPs have limited
computational capabilities and are solely assisted by a remote cloud center in
the baseband processing unit (BBU) of the cloud radio access (C-RAN) network,
the latency benefits of this fog-computing C-RAN network may be worn off when
facing a large number of offloading requests. In this paper, we investigate the
delay minimization problem for task offloading in a hierarchical fog-computing
C-RAN network, which consists of three tiers of computational services: MEC
server in radio units, MEC server in distributed units, and the cloud computing
in central units. The receive beamforming vectors, task allocation, computing
speed for offloaded tasks in each server and the transmission bandwidth split
of fronthaul links are optimized by solving the formulated mixed integer
programming problem. The simulation results validate the superiority of the
proposed hierarchical fog-computing C-RAN network in terms of the delay
performance.

\\
  Shannon's channel coding theorem characterizes the maximal rate of
information that can be reliably transmitted over a communication channel when
optimal encoding and decoding strategies are used. In many scenarios, however,
practical considerations such as channel uncertainty and implementation
constraints rule out the use of an optimal decoder. The mismatched decoding
problem addresses such scenarios by considering the case that the decoder
cannot be optimized, but is instead fixed as part of the problem statement.
This problem is not only of direct interest in its own right, but also has
close connections with other long-standing theoretical problems in information
theory.
  In this monograph, we survey both classical literature and recent
developments on the mismatched decoding problem, with an emphasis on achievable
random-coding rates for memoryless channels. We present two widely-considered
achievable rates known as the generalized mutual information (GMI) and the LM
rate, and overview their derivations and properties. In addition, we survey
several improved rates via multi-user coding techniques, as well as recent
developments and challenges in establishing converse bounds, and an analogous
mismatched encoding problem in rate-distortion theory. Throughout the
monograph, we highlight a variety of applications and connections with other
prominent information theory problems.

Title: Generalized Wireless-Powered Communications: When to Activate Wireless
  Power Transfer?
Authors: Qingqing Wu, Guangchi Zhang, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Wen Chen, and
  Robert Schober
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: TVT
\\
  Wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) is a key technology to power
energy-limited massive devices, such as on-board wireless sensors in autonomous
vehicles, for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Conventional WPCNs rely
only on dedicated downlink wireless power transfer (WPT), which is practically
inefficient due to the significant energy loss in wireless signal propagation.
Meanwhile, ambient energy harvesting is highly appealing as devices can
scavenge energy from various existing energy sources (e.g., solar energy and
cellular signals). Unfortunately, the randomness of the availability of these
energy sources cannot guarantee stable communication services. Motivated by the
above, we consider a generalized WPCN where the devices can not only harvest
energy from a dedicated multiple-antenna power station (PS), but can also
exploit stored energy stemming from ambient energy harvesting. Since the
dedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient,
WPT may not be needed to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR). To analytically
characterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition for WPT activation and
reveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we
further derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases that WPT is
activated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that when
WPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on
the devices' stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue.
Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation.

Title: Symbol Detection for Massive MIMO AF Relays Using Approximate Bayesian
  Inference
Authors: Haochuan Zhang and Qiuyun Zou
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  For massive MIMO AF relays, symbol detection becomes a practical issue when
the number of antennas is not large enough, since linear methods are
non-optimal and optimal methods are exponentially complex. This paper proposes
a new detection algorithm that offers Bayesian-optimal MSE at the cost of
$O(n^3)$ complexity per iteration. The algorithm is in essence a hybrid of two
methods recently developed for deep learning, with particular optimization for
relay. As a hybrid, it inherits from the two a state evolution formulism, where
the asymptotic MSE can be precisely predicted through a scalar equivalent
model. The algorithm also degenerates easily to many results well-known when
single-hop considered.

Title: Secure Groupcast with Shared Keys
Authors: Hua Sun
Categories: cs.IT cs.CR math.IT
\\
  We consider a transmitter and $K$ receivers, each of which shares a key
variable with the transmitter. Through a noiseless broadcast channel, the
transmitter wishes to send a common message $W$ securely to $N$ out of the $K$
receivers while the remaining $K-N$ receivers learn no information about $W$.
We are interested in the maximum message rate, i.e., the maximum number of bits
of $W$ that can be securely groupcast to the legitimate receivers per key block
and the minimum broadcast bandwidth, i.e., the minimum number of bits of the
broadcast information required to securely groupcast the message bits.
  We focus on the setting of combinatorial keys, where every subset of the $K$
receivers share an independent key of arbitrary size. Under this combinatorial
key setting, the maximum message rate is characterized for the following
scenarios - 1) $N=1$ or $N=K-1$, i.e., secure unicast to 1 receiver with $K-1$
eavesdroppers or secure groupcast to $K-1$ receivers with $1$ eavesdropper, 2)
$N=2, K=4$, i.e., secure groupcast to $2$ out of 4 receivers, and 3) the
symmetric setting where the key size for any subset of the same cardinality is
equal for any $N,K$. Further, for the latter two cases, the minimum broadcast
bandwidth for the maximum message rate is characterized.

Title: Robust Recovery of Sparse Nonnegative Weights from Mixtures of
  Positive-Semidefinite Matrices
Authors: Fabian Jaensch and Peter Jung
Categories: cs.IT math.IT math.OC
Comments: 13 pages; 3 figures
\\
  We consider a structured estimation problem where an observed matrix is
assumed to be generated as an $s$-sparse linear combination of $N$ given
$n\times n$ positive-semidefinite matrices. Recovering the unknown
$N$-dimensional and $s$-sparse weights from noisy observations is an important
problem in various fields of signal processing and also a relevant
pre-processing step in covariance estimation. We will present related recovery
guarantees and focus on the case of nonnegative weights. The problem is
formulated as a convex program and can be solved without further tuning. Such
robust, non-Bayesian and parameter-free approaches are important for
applications where prior distributions and further model parameters are
unknown. Motivated by explicit applications in wireless communication, we will
consider the particular rank-one case, where the known matrices are outer
products of iid. zero-mean subgaussian $n$-dimensional complex vectors. We show
that, for given $n$ and $N$, one can recover nonnegative $s$--sparse weights
with a parameter-free convex program once $s\leq O(n^2 / \log^2(N/n^2)$. Our
error estimate scales linearly in the instantaneous noise power whereby the
convex algorithm does not need prior bounds on the noise. Such estimates are
important if the magnitude of the additive distortion depends on the unknown
itself.

Title: Linearly Self-Equivalent APN Permutations in Small Dimension

Comments: 25 pages
\\
  All almost perfect nonlinear (APN) permutations that we know to date admit a
special kind of linear self-equivalence, i.e., there exists a permutation $G$
in their CCZ-class and two linear permutations $A$ and $B$, such that $G \circ
A = B \circ G$. After providing a survey on the known APN functions with a
focus on the existence of self equivalences, we explicitly search for APN
permutations in dimension 6, 7, and 8 that admit such a linear self
equivalence. In dimension six, we were able to conduct an exhaustive search and
obtain that there is only one such APN permutation up to CCZ-equivalence. In
dimensions 7 and 8, we exhaustively searched through parts of the space and
conclude that the linear self equivalences of such APN permutations must be of
a special form. As one interesting result in dimension 7, we obtain that all
APN permutation polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_2$ must be (up to
CCZ-equivalence) monomial functions.

  We propose a fast, non-Bayesian method for producing uncertainty scores in
the output of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) using a data-driven
interval propagating network. This interval neural network (INN) has interval
valued parameters and propagates its input using interval arithmetic. The INN
produces sensible lower and upper bounds encompassing the ground truth. We
provide theoretical justification for the validity of these bounds.
Furthermore, its asymmetric uncertainty scores offer additional, directional
information beyond what Gaussian-based, symmetric variance estimation can
provide. We find that noise in the data is adequately captured by the intervals
produced with our method. In numerical experiments on an image reconstruction
task, we demonstrate the practical utility of INNs as a proxy for the
prediction error in comparison to two state-of-the-art uncertainty
quantification methods. In summary, INNs produce fast, theoretically justified
uncertainty scores for DNNs that are easy to interpret, come with added
information and pose as improved error proxies - features that may prove useful
in advancing the usability of DNNs especially in sensitive applications such as
health care.

percent over the previous state-of-the-art of 62.6 percent by combining Wild

Title: Deep Networks as Logical Circuits: Generalization and Interpretation
Authors: Christopher Snyder, Sriram Vishwanath
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Not only are Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) black box models, but also we
frequently conceptualize them as such. We lack good interpretations of the
mechanisms linking inputs to outputs. Therefore, we find it difficult to
analyze in human-meaningful terms (1) what the network learned and (2) whether
the network learned. We present a hierarchical decomposition of the DNN
discrete classification map into logical (AND/OR) combinations of intermediate
(True/False) classifiers of the input. Those classifiers that can not be
further decomposed, called atoms, are (interpretable) linear classifiers. Taken
together, we obtain a logical circuit with linear classifier inputs that
computes the same label as the DNN. This circuit does not structurally resemble
the network architecture, and it may require many fewer parameters, depending
on the configuration of weights. In these cases, we obtain simultaneously an
interpretation and generalization bound (for the original DNN), connecting two
fronts which have historically been investigated separately. Unlike compression
techniques, our representation is. We motivate the utility of this perspective
by studying DNNs in simple, controlled settings, where we obtain superior
generalization bounds despite using only combinatorial information (e.g. no
margin information). We demonstrate how to "open the black box" on the MNIST
dataset. We show that the learned, internal, logical computations correspond to
semantically meaningful (unlabeled) categories that allow DNN descriptions in
plain English. We improve the generalization of an already trained network by
interpreting, diagnosing, and replacing components the logical circuit that is
the DNN.

Title: RelatIF: Identifying Explanatory Training Examples via Relative
  Influence
Authors: Elnaz Barshan, Marc-Etienne Brunet, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this work, we focus on the use of influence functions to identify relevant
training examples that one might hope "explain" the predictions of a machine
learning model. One shortcoming of influence functions is that the training
examples deemed most "influential" are often outliers or mislabelled, making
them poor choices for explanation. In order to address this shortcoming, we
separate the role of global versus local influence. We introduce RelatIF, a new
class of criteria for choosing relevant training examples by way of an
optimization objective that places a constraint on global influence. RelatIF
considers the local influence that an explanatory example has on a prediction
relative to its global effects on the model. In empirical evaluations, we find
that the examples returned by RelatIF are more intuitive when compared to those
found using influence functions.

Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  Humans can continuously learn new knowledge as their experience grows. In
contrast, previous learning in deep neural networks can quickly fade out when
they are trained on a new task. In this paper, we hypothesize this problem can
be avoided by learning a set of generalized parameters, that are neither
specific to old nor new tasks. In this pursuit, we introduce a novel
meta-learning approach that seeks to maintain an equilibrium between all the
encountered tasks. This is ensured by a new meta-update rule which avoids
catastrophic forgetting. In comparison to previous meta-learning techniques,
our approach is task-agnostic. When presented with a continuum of data, our
model automatically identifies the task and quickly adapts to it with just a
single update. We perform extensive experiments on five datasets in a
class-incremental setting, leading to significant improvements over the state
of the art methods (e.g., a 21.3% boost on CIFAR100 with 10 incremental tasks).
Specifically, on large-scale datasets that generally prove difficult cases for
incremental learning, our approach delivers absolute gains as high as 19.1% and
7.4% on ImageNet and MS-Celeb datasets, respectively.

  Building on recent progress at the intersection of combinatorial optimization

presence of heavily optimized combinatorial solvers together with some
improvements in architecture design, we advance state-of-the-art on deep graph
matching benchmarks for keypoint correspondence. In addition, we highlight the
conceptual advantages of incorporating solvers into deep learning
architectures, such as the possibility of post-processing with a strong
multi-graph matching solver or the indifference to changes in the training
setting. Finally, we propose two new challenging experimental setups.

Title: Pipelined Backpropagation at Scale: Training Large Models without
  Batches
Authors: Atli Kosson, Vitaliy Chiley, Abhinav Venigalla, Joel Hestness, Urs
  K\"oster
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC stat.ML
\\
  Parallelism is crucial for accelerating the training of deep neural networks.
Pipeline parallelism can provide an efficient alternative to traditional data
parallelism by allowing workers to specialize. Performing mini-batch SGD using
pipeline parallelism has the overhead of filling and draining the pipeline.
Pipelined Backpropagation updates the model parameters without draining the
pipeline. This removes the overhead but introduces stale gradients and
inconsistency between the weights used on the forward and backward passes,
reducing final accuracy and the stability of training. We introduce Spike
Compensation and Linear Weight Prediction to mitigate these effects. Analysis
on a convex quadratic shows that both methods effectively counteract staleness.
We train multiple convolutional networks at a batch size of one, completely
replacing batch parallelism with fine-grained pipeline parallelism. With our
methods, Pipelined Backpropagation achieves full accuracy on CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet without hyperparameter tuning.

Title: CAZSL: Zero-Shot Regression for Pushing Models by Generalizing Through
  Context
Authors: Wenyu Zhang, Skyler Seto, Devesh K. Jha
Categories: cs.LG cs.RO stat.ML
\\
  Learning accurate models of the physical world is required for a lot of
robotic manipulation tasks. However, during manipulation, robots are expected
to interact with unknown workpieces so that building predictive models which
can generalize over a number of these objects is highly desirable. In this
paper, we study the problem of designing learning agents which can generalize
their models of the physical world by building context-aware learning models.
The purpose of these agents is to quickly adapt and/or generalize their notion
of physics of interaction in the real world based on certain features about the
interacting objects that provide different contexts to the predictive models.
With this motivation, we present context-aware zero shot learning (CAZSL,
pronounced as 'casual') models, an approach utilizing a Siamese network
architecture, embedding space masking and regularization based on context
variables which allows us to learn a model that can generalize to different
parameters or features of the interacting objects. We test our proposed
learning algorithm on the recently released Omnipush datatset that allows
testing of meta-learning capabilities using low-dimensional data.

  This paper aims at revisiting Graph Convolutional Neural Networks by bridging
the gap between spectral and spatial design of graph convolutions. We
theoretically demonstrate some equivalence of the graph convolution process
regardless it is designed in the spatial or the spectral domain. The obtained
general framework allows to lead a spectral analysis of the most popular
ConvGNNs, explaining their performance and showing their limits. Moreover, the
proposed framework is used to design new convolutions in spectral domain with a
custom frequency profile while applying them in the spatial domain. We also
propose a generalization of the depthwise separable convolution framework for
graph convolutional networks, what allows to decrease the total number of
trainable parameters by keeping the capacity of the model. To the best of our
knowledge, such a framework has never been used in the GNNs literature. Our
proposals are evaluated on both transductive and inductive graph learning
problems. Obtained results show the relevance of the proposed method and
provide one of the first experimental evidence of transferability of spectral
filter coefficients from one graph to another. Our source codes are publicly

Title: Unsupervised domain adaptation with exploring more statistics and
  discriminative information
Authors: Yuntao Du, Ruiting Zhang, Yikang Cao, Xiaowen Zhang, Zhiwen Tan, and
  Chongjun Wang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Unsupervised domain adaptation aims at transferring knowledge from the
labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Previous methods mainly
learn a domain-invariant feature transformation, where the cross-domain
discrepancy can be reduced. Maximum Mean Discrepancy(MMD) is the most popular
statistic to measure domain discrepancy. However, these methods may suffer from
two challenges. 1) MMD-based methods only measure the first-order statistic
information across domains, while other useful information such as second-order
statistic information has been ignored. 2) The classifier trained on the source
domain may confuse to distinguish the correct class from a similar class, and
the phenomenon is called class confusion. In this paper, we propose a method
called \emph{Unsupervised domain adaptation with exploring more statistics and
discriminative information}(MSDI), which tackle these two problems in the
principle of structural risk minimization. We adopt the recently proposed
statistic called MMCD to measure domain discrepancy which can capture both
first-order and second-order statistics simultaneously in RKHS. Besides, we
proposed to learn more discriminative features to avoid class confusion, where
the inner of the classifier predictions with their transposes are used to
reflect the confusion relationship between different classes. Moreover, we
minimizing source empirical risk and adopt manifold regularization to explore
geometry information in the target domain. MSDI learns a domain-invariant
classifier in a unified learning framework incorporating the above objectives.
We conduct comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets and the
results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: A Survey of Deep Learning for Scientific Discovery
Authors: Maithra Raghu, Eric Schmidt
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Over the past few years, we have seen fundamental breakthroughs in core
problems in machine learning, largely driven by advances in deep neural
networks. At the same time, the amount of data collected in a wide array of
scientific domains is dramatically increasing in both size and complexity.
Taken together, this suggests many exciting opportunities for deep learning
applications in scientific settings. But a significant challenge to this is
simply knowing where to start. The sheer breadth and diversity of different
deep learning techniques makes it difficult to determine what scientific
problems might be most amenable to these methods, or which specific combination
of methods might offer the most promising first approach. In this survey, we
focus on addressing this central issue, providing an overview of many widely
used deep learning models, spanning visual, sequential and graph structured
data, associated tasks and different training methods, along with techniques to
use deep learning with less data and better interpret these complex models ---
two central considerations for many scientific use cases. We also include
overviews of the full design process, implementation tips, and links to a
plethora of tutorials, research summaries and open-sourced deep learning
pipelines and pretrained models, developed by the community. We hope that this
survey will help accelerate the use of deep learning across different
scientific domains.

Title: On-the-Fly Adaptation of Source Code Models using Meta-Learning
Authors: Disha Shrivastava, Hugo Larochelle and Daniel Tarlow
Categories: cs.LG cs.SE stat.ML
\\
  The ability to adapt to unseen, local contexts is an important challenge that
successful models of source code must overcome. One of the most popular
approaches for the adaptation of such models is dynamic evaluation. With
dynamic evaluation, when running a model on an unseen file, the model is
updated immediately after having observed each token in that file. In this
work, we propose instead to frame the problem of context adaptation as a
meta-learning problem. We aim to train a base source code model that is best
able to learn from information in a file to deliver improved predictions of
missing tokens. Unlike dynamic evaluation, this formulation allows us to select
more targeted information (support tokens) for adaptation, that is both before
and after a target hole in a file. We consider an evaluation setting that we
call line-level maintenance, designed to reflect the downstream task of code
auto-completion in an IDE. Leveraging recent developments in meta-learning such
as first-order MAML and Reptile, we demonstrate improved performance in
experiments on a large scale Java GitHub corpus, compared to other adaptation
baselines including dynamic evaluation. Moreover, our analysis shows that,
compared to a non-adaptive baseline, our approach improves performance on
identifiers and literals by 44\% and 15\%, respectively. Our implementation can
be found at: https://github.com/shrivastavadisha/meta_learn_source_code

Title: Integrating Informativeness, Representativeness and Diversity in
  Pool-Based Sequential Active Learning for Regression
Authors: Ziang Liu and Dongrui Wu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Int'l Joint Conf. on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Glasgow, UK, July 2020
\\
  In many real-world machine learning applications, unlabeled samples are easy
to obtain, but it is expensive and/or time-consuming to label them. Active
learning is a common approach for reducing this data labeling effort. It
optimally selects the best few samples to label, so that a better machine
learning model can be trained from the same number of labeled samples. This
paper considers active learning for regression (ALR) problems. Three essential
criteria -- informativeness, representativeness, and diversity -- have been
proposed for ALR. However, very few approaches in the literature have
considered all three of them simultaneously. We propose three new ALR
approaches, with different strategies for integrating the three criteria.
Extensive experiments on 12 datasets in various domains demonstrated their
effectiveness.

\\
  Research on automated, image based identification of clothing categories and
fashion landmarks has recently gained significant interest due to its potential
impact on areas such as robotic clothing manipulation, automated clothes
sorting and recycling, and online shopping. Several public and annotated
fashion datasets have been created to facilitate research advances in this
direction. In this work, we make the first step towards leveraging the data and
techniques developed for fashion image analysis in vision-based robotic
clothing manipulation tasks. We focus on techniques that can generalize from
large-scale fashion datasets to less structured, small datasets collected in a
robotic lab. Specifically, we propose training data augmentation methods such
as elastic warping, and model adjustments such as rotation invariant
convolutions to make the model generalize better. Our experiments demonstrate
that our approach outperforms stateof-the art models with respect to clothing
category classification and fashion landmark detection when tested on
previously unseen datasets. Furthermore, we present experimental results on a
new dataset composed of images where a robot holds different garments,
collected in our lab.

\\
  This paper presents a new approach to classification of high dimensional
spectroscopy data and demonstrates that it outperforms other current
state-of-the art approaches. The specific task we consider is identifying
whether samples contain chlorinated solvents or not, based on their Raman
spectra. We also examine robustness to classification of outlier samples that
are not represented in the training set (negative outliers). A novel
application of a locally-connected neural network (NN) for the binary
classification of spectroscopy data is proposed and demonstrated to yield
improved accuracy over traditionally popular algorithms. Additionally, we
present the ability to further increase the accuracy of the locally-connected
NN algorithm through the use of synthetic training spectra and we investigate
the use of autoencoder based one-class classifiers and outlier detectors.
Finally, a two-step classification process is presented as an alternative to
the binary and one-class classification paradigms. This process combines the
locally-connected NN classifier, the use of synthetic training data, and an
autoencoder based outlier detector to produce a model which is shown to both
produce high classification accuracy, and be robust to the presence of negative
outliers.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its worth in a series of artificial
domains, and is beginning to show some successes in real-world scenarios.
However, much of the research advances in RL are hard to leverage in real-world
systems due to a series of assumptions that are rarely satisfied in practice.
In this work, we identify and formalize a series of independent challenges that
embody the difficulties that must be addressed for RL to be commonly deployed
in real-world systems. For each challenge, we define it formally in the context
of a Markov Decision Process, analyze the effects of the challenge on
state-of-the-art learning algorithms, and present some existing attempts at
tackling it. We believe that an approach that addresses our set of proposed
challenges would be readily deployable in a large number of real world
problems. Our proposed challenges are implemented in a suite of continuous
control environments called realworldrl-suite which we propose an as an
open-source benchmark.

Title: robROSE: A robust approach for dealing with imbalanced data in fraud
  detection
Authors: Bart Baesens, Sebastiaan H\"oppner, Irene Ortner, and Tim Verdonck
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.AP stat.ML
\\
  A major challenge when trying to detect fraud is that the fraudulent
activities form a minority class which make up a very small proportion of the
data set. In most data sets, fraud occurs in typically less than 0.5% of the
cases. Detecting fraud in such a highly imbalanced data set typically leads to
predictions that favor the majority group, causing fraud to remain undetected.
We discuss some popular oversampling techniques that solve the problem of
imbalanced data by creating synthetic samples that mimic the minority class. A
frequent problem when analyzing real data is the presence of anomalies or
outliers. When such atypical observations are present in the data, most
oversampling techniques are prone to create synthetic samples that distort the
detection algorithm and spoil the resulting analysis. A useful tool for anomaly
detection is robust statistics, which aims to find the outliers by first
fitting the majority of the data and then flagging data observations that
deviate from it. In this paper, we present a robust version of ROSE, called
robROSE, which combines several promising approaches to cope simultaneously
with the problem of imbalanced data and the presence of outliers. The proposed
method achieves to enhance the presence of the fraud cases while ignoring
anomalies. The good performance of our new sampling technique is illustrated on
simulated and real data sets and it is shown that robROSE can provide better
insight in the structure of the data. The source code of the robROSE algorithm
is made freely available.

Title: Adversarial Examples and the Deeper Riddle of Induction: The Need for a
  Theory of Artifacts in Deep Learning
Authors: Cameron Buckner
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 24 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Deep learning is currently the most widespread and successful technology in
artificial intelligence. It promises to push the frontier of scientific
discovery beyond current limits. However, skeptics have worried that deep
neural networks are black boxes, and have called into question whether these
advances can really be deemed scientific progress if humans cannot understand
them. Relatedly, these systems also possess bewildering new vulnerabilities:
most notably a susceptibility to "adversarial examples". In this paper, I argue
that adversarial examples will become a flashpoint of debate in philosophy and
diverse sciences. Specifically, new findings concerning adversarial examples
have challenged the consensus view that the networks' verdicts on these cases
are caused by overfitting idiosyncratic noise in the training set, and may
instead be the result of detecting predictively useful "intrinsic features of
the data geometry" that humans cannot perceive (Ilyas et al., 2019). These
results should cause us to re-examine responses to one of the deepest puzzles
at the intersection of philosophy and science: Nelson Goodman's "new riddle" of
induction. Specifically, they raise the possibility that progress in a number
of sciences will depend upon the detection and manipulation of useful features
that humans find inscrutable. Before we can evaluate this possibility, however,
we must decide which (if any) of these inscrutable features are real but
available only to "alien" perception and cognition, and which are distinctive
artifacts of deep learning-for artifacts like lens flares or Gibbs phenomena
can be similarly useful for prediction, but are usually seen as obstacles to
scientific theorizing. Thus, machine learning researchers urgently need to
develop a theory of artifacts for deep neural networks, and I conclude by
sketching some initial directions for this area of research.

Title: Using Counterfactual Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for
  Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving
Authors: Patrick Hart and Alois Knoll
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO stat.ML
\\
  In decision-making for autonomous vehicles, we need to predict other
vehicle's behaviors or learn their behavior implicitly using machine learning.
However, often the predictions and learned models have errors or might be wrong
altogether which can lead to dangerous situations. Therefore, decision-making
algorithms should consider counterfactual reasoning such as: what would happen
if the other agents will behave in a certain way? The approach we present in
this paper is two-fold: First, during training, we randomly select behavior
models from a behavior model pool and assign them to the other vehicles in the
scenario, such as more passive or aggressive behavior models. Second, during
the application, we derive several virtual worlds from the actual world that
have the same initial state. In each of these worlds, we also assign behavior
models from the behavior model pool to others. We then evolve these virtual
worlds for a defined time-horizon. This enables us to apply counterfactual
reasoning by asking what would happen if the actual world evolves as in the
virtual world. In uncertain environments, this makes it possible to generate
more probable risk estimates and, thus, to enable safer decision-making. We
conduct studies using a lane-change scenario that shows the advantages of
counterfactual reasoning using learned policies and virtual worlds to estimate
their risk and performance.

Title: Triad State Space Construction for Chaotic Signal Classification with

  Inspired by the well-known permutation entropy (PE), an effective image
encoding scheme for chaotic time series, Triad State Space Construction (TSSC),
is proposed. The TSSC image can recognize higher-order temporal patterns and
identify new forbidden regions in time series motifs beyond the Bandt-Pompe
probabilities. The Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) is widely used in
image classification. The ConvNet classifier based on TSSC images

Title: A general framework for causal classification

\\
  In many applications, there is a need to predict the effect of an
intervention on different individuals from data. For example, which customers
are persuadable by a product promotion? which groups would benefit from a new
policy? These are typical causal classification questions involving the effect
or the \emph{change} in outcomes made by an intervention. The questions cannot
be answered with traditional classification methods as they only deal with
static outcomes. In marketing research these questions are often answered with
uplift modelling, using experimental data. Some machine learning methods have
been proposed for heterogeneous causal effect estimation using either
experimental or observational data. In principle these methods can be used for
causal classification, but a limited number of methods, mainly tree based, on
causal heterogeneity modelling, are inadequate for various real world
applications. In this paper, we propose a general framework for causal
classification, as a generalisation of both uplift modelling and causal
heterogeneity modelling. When developing the framework, we have identified the
conditions where causal classification in both observational and experimental
data can be resolved by a na\"{\i}ve solution using off-the-shelf
classification methods, which supports flexible implementations for various
applications. Experiments have shown that our framework with off-the-shelf
classification methods is as competitive as the tailor-designed uplift
modelling and heterogeneous causal effect modelling methods.

Title: Beyond the Ground-Truth: An Evaluator-Generator Framework for Group-wise
  Learning-to-Rank in E-Commerce
Authors: Guangda Huzhang, Zhen-Jia Pang, Yongqing Gao, Wen-Ji Zhou, Qing Da,
  An-Xiang Zeng, and Yang Yu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Learning-to-rank (LTR) has become a key technology in E-commerce
applications. Previous LTR approaches followed the supervised learning paradigm
so that learned models should match the labeled data point-wisely or
pair-wisely. However, we have noticed that global context information,
including the total order of items in the displayed webpage, can play an
important role in interactions with the customers. Therefore, to approach the
best global ordering, the exploration in a large combinatorial space of items
is necessary, which requires evaluating orders that may not appear in the
labeled data. In this scenario, we first show that the classical data-based
metrics can be inconsistent with online performance, or even misleading. We
then propose to learn an evaluator and search the best model guided by the
evaluator, which forms the evaluator-generator framework for training the
group-wise LTR model. The evaluator is learned from the labeled data, and is
enhanced by incorporating the order context information. The generator is
trained with the supervision of the evaluator by reinforcement learning to
generate the best order in the combinatorial space. Our experiments in one of
the world's largest retail platforms disclose that the learned evaluator is a
much better indicator than classical data-based metrics. Moreover, our LTR
model achieves a significant improvement ($\textgreater2\%$) from the current
industrial-level pair-wise models in terms of both Conversion Rate (CR) and
Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) in online A/B tests.

Title: Bag of biterms modeling for short texts
Authors: Anh Phan Tuan, Bach Tran, Thien Nguyen Huu, Linh Ngo Van, Khoat Than
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Analyzing texts from social media encounters many challenges due to their
unique characteristics of shortness, massiveness, and dynamic. Short texts do
not provide enough context information, causing the failure of the traditional
statistical models. Furthermore, many applications often face with massive and
dynamic short texts, causing various computational challenges to the current
batch learning algorithms. This paper presents a novel framework, namely Bag of
Biterms Modeling (BBM), for modeling massive, dynamic, and short text
collections. BBM comprises of two main ingredients: (1) the concept of Bag of
Biterms (BoB) for representing documents, and (2) a simple way to help
statistical models to include BoB. Our framework can be easily deployed for a
large class of probabilistic models, and we demonstrate its usefulness with two
well-known models: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Hierarchical Dirichlet
Process (HDP). By exploiting both terms (words) and biterms (pairs of words),
the major advantages of BBM are: (1) it enhances the length of the documents
and makes the context more coherent by emphasizing the word connotation and
co-occurrence via Bag of Biterms, (2) it inherits inference and learning
algorithms from the primitive to make it straightforward to design online and
streaming algorithms for short texts. Extensive experiments suggest that BBM
outperforms several state-of-the-art models. We also point out that the BoB
representation performs better than the traditional representations (e.g, Bag
of Words, tf-idf) even for normal texts.

Title: Obliviousness Makes Poisoning Adversaries Weaker
Authors: Sanjam Garg, Somesh Jha, Saeed Mahloujifar, Mohammad Mahmoody,
  Abhradeep Thakurta
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Poisoning attacks have emerged as a significant security threat to machine
learning (ML) algorithms. It has been demonstrated that adversaries who make
small changes to the training set, such as adding specially crafted data
points, can hurt the performance of the output model. Most of these attacks
require the full knowledge of training data or the underlying data
distribution. In this paper we study the power of oblivious adversaries who do
not have any information about the training set. We show a separation between
oblivious and full-information poisoning adversaries. Specifically, we
construct a sparse linear regression problem for which LASSO estimator is
robust against oblivious adversaries whose goal is to add a non-relevant
features to the model with certain poisoning budget. On the other hand,
non-oblivious adversaries, with the same budget, can craft poisoning examples
based on the rest of the training data and successfully add non-relevant
features to the model.

  This paper reports on our experiences with verifying automotive C code by
state-of-the-art open source software model checkers. The embedded C code is
automatically generated from Simulink open-loop controller models. Its diverse
features (decision logic, floating-point and pointer arithmetic, rate limiters
and state-flow systems) and the extensive use of floating-point variables make
verifying the code highly challenging. Our study reveals large discrepancies in
coverage - which is at most only 20% of all requirements --- and tool strength
compared to results from the main annual software verification competition. A
hand-crafted, simple extension of the verifier CBMC with $k$-induction delivers
results on 63% of the requirements while the proprietary BTC EmbeddedValidator
covers 80% and obtains bounded verification results for most of the remaining
requirements.

DOI: 10.1109/DCOSS.2018.00020
\\
  Distributed diffusion is a powerful algorithm for multi-task state estimation
which enables networked agents to interact with neighbors to process input data
and diffuse information across the network. Compared to a centralized approach,
diffusion offers multiple advantages that include robustness to node and link
failures. In this paper, we consider distributed diffusion for multi-task
estimation where networked agents must estimate distinct but correlated states
of interest by processing streaming data. By exploiting the adaptive weights
used for diffusing information, we develop attack models that drive normal
agents to converge to states selected by the attacker. The attack models can be
used for both stationary and non-stationary state estimation. In addition, we
develop a resilient distributed diffusion algorithm under the assumption that
the number of compromised nodes in the neighborhood of each normal node is
bounded by $F$ and we show that resilience may be obtained at the cost of
performance degradation. Finally, we evaluate the proposed attack models and
resilient distributed diffusion algorithm using stationary and non-stationary
multi-target localization.

Authors: Michel Duprez and Vanessa Lleras and Alexei Lozinski
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 65N30, 65N85
\\
  We extend a fictitious domain-type finite element method, called $\phi$-FEM
and introduced in arXiv:1903.03703 [math.NA], to the case of Neumann boundary
conditions. The method is based on a multiplication by the level-set function
and does not require a boundary fitted mesh. Unlike other recent fictitious
domain-type methods (XFEM, CutFEM), our approach does not need any non-standard
numerical integration on cut mesh elements or on the actual boundary. We prove
the optimal convergence of $\phi$-FEM and the fact that the discrete problem is
well conditioned inependently of the mesh cuts. The numerical experiments
confirm the theoretical results.

Title: Uniform error bounds of an exponential wave integrator for the long-time
  dynamics of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation
Authors: Yue Feng and Wenfan Yi
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 24 pages, 3 figures
\\
  We establish uniform error bounds of an exponential wave integrator Fourier
pseudospectral (EWI-FP) method for the long-time dynamics of the nonlinear
Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a cubic nonlinearity whose strength is
characterized by $\varepsilon^2$ with $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$ a dimensionless
parameter. When $0 < \varepsilon \ll 1$, the problem is equivalent to the
long-time dynamics of the NKGE with small initial data (and $O(1)$ cubic
nonlinearity), while the amplitude of the initial data (and the solution) is at
$O(\varepsilon)$. For the long-time dynamics of the NKGE up to the time at
$O(1/\varepsilon^{2})$, the resolution and error bounds of the classical
numerical methods depend significantly on the small parameter $\varepsilon$,
which causes severe numerical burdens as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$. The EWI-FP
method is fully explicit, symmetric in time and has many superior properties in
solving wave equations. By adapting the energy method combined with the method
of mathematical induction, we rigorously carry out the uniform error bounds of
the EWI-FP discretization at $O(h^{m_0} + \varepsilon^{2-\beta}\tau^2)$ up to
the time at $O(1/\varepsilon^{\beta})$ with $0 \leq \beta \leq 2$, mesh size
$h$, time step $\tau$ and $m_0$ an integer depending on the regularity of the
solution. By a rescaling in time, our results are straightforwardly extended to
the error bounds and $\varepsilon$-scalability (or meshing strategy
requirement) of the EWI-FP method for an oscillatory NKGE, whose solution
propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ and $O(\varepsilon^{\beta})$ in
space and time, respectively, and wave speed at $O(\varepsilon^{-\beta})$.
Finally, extensive numerical results are reported to confirm our error
estimates.

Title: A Primal-Dual Weak Galerkin Method for Div-Curl Systems with

Categories: math.NA cs.NA

  This article presents a new primal-dual weak Galerkin finite element method
for the tangential boundary value problem of div-curl systems with
low-regularity solutions. The numerical scheme is based on a weak formulation,
called the primal equation, involving no partial derivatives for the exact
solution supplemented by the its dual form in the context of weak Galerkin.
Optimal order error estimates in $L^2$ are established for vector fields with
$H^\alpha(\Omega)$-regularity, $\alpha>0$. The mathematical theory was derived
for connected domains with general topological properties (namely, arbitrary
Betti numbers). Numerical results are reported to not only verify the
theoretical convergence but also demonstrate the performance of the new method.

Title: Efficient Randomized Algorithms for Subspace System Identification
Authors: Rachel Minster, Arvind K. Saibaba, Jishnudeep Kar, Aranya Chakrabortty
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA) is a data-driven approach for
subspace system identification and is widely used in many areas of engineering.
However, the computational cost of the ERA is dominated by a step that involves
the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a large, dense matrix with block
Hankel structure. This paper develops computationally efficient algorithms for
reducing the computational cost of the SVD step by using randomized subspace
iteration and exploiting the block Hankel structure of the matrix. We provide a
detailed analysis of the error in the identified system matrices and the
computational cost of the proposed algorithms. We demonstrate the accuracy and
computational benefits of our algorithms on two test problems: the first
involves a partial differential equation that models the cooling of steel
rails, and the second is an application from power systems engineering.

Title: Data-driven surrogates for high dimensional models using Gaussian
  process regression on the Grassmann manifold
Authors: Dimitris G. Giovanis and Michael D. Shields
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 31 pages, 22 Figures
\\
  This paper introduces a surrogate modeling scheme based on Grassmannian
manifold learning to be used for cost-efficient predictions of high-dimensional
stochastic systems. The method exploits subspace-structured features of each
solution by projecting it onto a Grassmann manifold. The method utilizes a
solution clustering approach in order to identify regions of the parameter
space over which solutions are sufficiently similarly such that they can be
interpolated on the Grassmannian. In this clustering, the reduced-order
solutions are partitioned into disjoint clusters on the Grassmann manifold
using the eigen-structure of properly defined Grassmannian kernels and, the
Karcher mean of each cluster is estimated. Then, the points in each cluster are
projected onto the tangent space with origin at the corresponding Karcher mean
using the exponential mapping. For each cluster, a Gaussian process regression
model is trained that maps the input parameters of the system to the reduced
solution points of the corresponding cluster projected onto the tangent space.
Using this Gaussian process model, the full-field solution can be efficiently
predicted at any new point in the parameter space. In certain cases, the
solution clusters will span disjoint regions of the parameter space. In such
cases, for each of the solution clusters we utilize a second, density-based
spatial clustering to group their corresponding input parameter points in the
Euclidean space. The proposed method is applied to two numerical examples. The
first is a nonlinear stochastic ordinary differential equation with uncertain
initial conditions. The second involves modeling of plastic deformation in a
model amorphous solid using the Shear Transformation Zone theory of plasticity.

Title: A Bi-fidelity Ensemble Kalman Method for PDE-Constrained Inverse
  Problems
Authors: Han Gao, Jian-Xun Wang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn
Comments: 33 pages. 9 figures
\\
  Mathematical modeling and simulation of complex physical systems based on
partial differential equations (PDEs) have been widely used in engineering and
industrial applications. To enable reliable predictions, it is crucial yet
challenging to calibrate the model by inferring unknown parameters/fields
(e.g., boundary conditions, mechanical properties, and operating parameters)
from sparse and noisy measurements, which is known as a PDE-constrained inverse
problem. In this work, we develop a novel bi-fidelity (BF) ensemble Kalman
inversion method to tackle this challenge, leveraging the accuracy of
high-fidelity models and the efficiency of low-fidelity models. The core
concept is to build a BF model with a limited number of high-fidelity samples
for efficient forward propagations in the iterative ensemble Kalman inversion.
Compared to existing inversion techniques, salient features of the proposed
methods can be summarized as follow: (1) achieving the accuracy of
high-fidelity models but at the cost of low-fidelity models, (2) being robust
and derivative-free, and (3) being code non-intrusive, enabling ease of
deployment for different applications. The proposed method has been assessed by
three inverse problems that are relevant to fluid dynamics, including both
parameter estimation and field inversion. The numerical results demonstrate the
excellent performance of the proposed BF ensemble Kalman inversion approach,
which drastically outperforms the standard Kalman inversion in terms of
efficiency and accuracy.

\\
  It was recently shown in [4] that, for $L_2$-approximation of functions from
a Hilbert space, function values are almost as powerful as arbitrary linear
information, if the approximation numbers are square-summable. That is, we
showed that \[
  e_n \,\lesssim\, \sqrt{\frac{1}{k_n} \sum_{j\geq k_n} a_j^2} \qquad \text{
with }\quad k_n \asymp \frac{n}{\ln(n)}, \] where $e_n$ are the sampling
numbers and $a_k$ are the approximation numbers. In particular, if
$(a_k)\in\ell_2$, then $e_n$ and $a_n$ are of the same polynomial order. For
this, we presented an explicit (weighted least squares) algorithm based on
i.i.d. random points and proved that this works with positive probability. This
implies the existence of a good deterministic sampling algorithm.
  Here, we present a modification of the proof in [4] that shows that the same
algorithm works with probability at least $1-{n^{-c}}$ for all $c>0$.

ACM-class: G.3; J.2
\\
  We introduce a new micro-macro Markov chain Monte Carlo method (mM-MCMC) with
indirect reconstruction to sample invariant distributions of molecular dynamics
systems that exhibit a time-scale separation between the microscopic (fast)
dynamics, and the macroscopic (slow) dynamics of some low-dimensional set of
reaction coordinates. The algorithm enhances exploration of the state space in
the presence of metastability by allowing larger proposal moves at the
macroscopic level, on which a conditional accept-reject procedure is applied.
Only when the macroscopic proposal is accepted, the full microscopic state is
reconstructed from the newly sampled reaction coordinate value and is subjected
to a second accept/reject procedure. The computational gain stems from the fact
that most proposals are rejected at the macroscopic level, at low computational
cost, while microscopic states, once reconstructed, are almost always accepted.
This paper discusses an indirect method to reconstruct microscopic samples from
macroscopic reaction coordinate values, that can also be applied in cases where
direct reconstruction is cumbersome. The indirect reconstruction method
generates a microscopic sample by performing a biased microscopic simulation,
starting from the previous microscopic sample and driving the microscopic state
towards the proposed reaction coordinate value. We show numerically that the
mM-MCMC scheme with indirect reconstruction can significantly extend the range
of applicability of the mM-MCMC method.

Title: Algebraic entropy fixes and convex limiting for continuous finite
  element discretizations of scalar hyperbolic conservation laws
Authors: Dmitri Kuzmin and Manuel Quezada de Luna
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  In this work, we modify a continuous Galerkin discretization of a scalar
hyperbolic conservation law using new algebraic correction procedures. Discrete
entropy conditions are used to determine the minimal amount of entropy
stabilization and constrain antidiffusive corrections of a property-preserving
low-order scheme. The addition of a second-order entropy dissipative component
to the antidiffusive part of a nearly entropy conservative numerical flux is
generally insufficient to prevent violations of local bounds in shock regions.
Our monolithic convex limiting technique adjusts a given target flux in a
manner which guarantees preservation of invariant domains, validity of local
maximum principles, and entropy stability. The new methodology combines the
advantages of modern entropy stable/entropy conservative schemes and their
local extremum diminishing counterparts. The process of algebraic flux
correction is based on inequality constraints which provably provide the
desired properties. No free parameters are involved. The proposed algebraic
fixes are readily applicable to unstructured meshes, finite element methods,
general time discretizations, and steady-state residuals. Numerical studies of
explicit entropy-constrained schemes are performed for linear and nonlinear
test problems.

Title: An Immersed Lagrangian-Eulerian Method for Fluid-Structure Interaction
Authors: Ebrahim M. Kolahdouz, Amneet P.S. Bhalla, Brent A. Craven, Boyce E.
  Griffith
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This paper introduces a sharp interface method to simulate fluid-structure
interaction (FSI) involving arbitrary rigid bodies immersed in viscous
incompressible fluids. This approach, which we refer to as an immersed
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ILE) method, integrates aspects of partitioned and
immersed FSI formulations by solving separate momentum equations for the fluid
and solid domains, as in a partitioned formulation, while also using
non-conforming discretizations of the moving fluid and structure, as in an
immersed formulation. A Dirichlet-Neumann coupling scheme is used, in which the
motion of the immersed solid is driven by fluid traction forces evaluated along
the fluid-structure interface, and the motion of fluid along that interface is
constrained to match the solid velocity, so as to enforce the no-slip
condition. We introduce a penalty approach that weakly imposes the no-slip
condition along the fluid-solid interface. In the coupling strategy, a separate
discretization of the fluid-structure interface is tethered to the volumetric
solid mesh via stiff spring-like penalty forces. Our fluid-structure
interaction scheme relies on a recently developed immersed interface method for
discrete geometries, which enables the accurate determination of both
velocities and stresses along the fluid-structure interface. The effectiveness
of this straightforward FSI methodology is extensively tested against benchmark
computational and experimental studies in two and three spatial dimensions,
including for geometries with non-smooth features. Unlike commonly used
partitioned methods, which can suffer from so-called added mass effect
instabilities, our methodology avoids subiterations between fluid and solid
solvers or complex handling of the fluid pressure, and it retains stability for
models involving extremely low, nearly equal, equal, and high solid-fluid
density ratios.

attractive global optimization capability of evolutionary algorithms. However,
ENAS suffers from extremely high computation costs because a large number of
performance evaluations is usually required in evolutionary optimization and
training deep neural networks is itself computationally very intensive. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a new evolutionary framework for fast
ENAS based on directed acyclic graph, in which parents are randomly sampled and
trained on each mini-batch of training data. In addition, a node inheritance
strategy is adopted to generate offspring individuals and their fitness is
directly evaluated without training. To enhance the feature processing
capability of the evolved neural networks, we also encode a channel attention
mechanism in the search space. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the widely
used datasets, in comparison with 26 state-of-the-art peer algorithms. Our
experimental results show the proposed algorithm is not only computationally
much more efficiently, but also highly competitive in learning performance.

Title: Utilizing Differential Evolution into optimizing targeted cancer
  treatments

  Balaz
Categories: cs.NE
\\
  Working towards the development of an evolvable cancer treatment simulator,
the investigation of Differential Evolution was considered, motivated by the
high efficiency of variations of this technique in real-valued problems. A
basic DE algorithm, namely "DE/rand/1" was used to optimize the simulated
design of a targeted drug delivery system for tumor treatment on PhysiCell
simulator. The suggested approach proved to be more efficient than a standard
genetic algorithm, which was not able to escape local minima after a predefined
number of generations. The key attribute of DE that enables it to outperform
standard EAs, is the fact that it keeps the diversity of the population high,
throughout all the generations. This work will be incorporated with ongoing
research in a more wide applicability platform that will design, develop and
evaluate targeted drug delivery systems aiming cancer tumours.

\\
  Conventional optimization methodologies may be hindered when the automated
search is stuck into local optima because of a deceptive objective function
landscape. Consequently, open ended search methodologies, such as novelty
search, have been proposed to tackle this issue. Overlooking the objective,
while putting pressure into discovering novel solutions may lead to better
solutions in practical problems. Novelty search was employed here to optimize
the simulated design of a targeted drug delivery system for tumor treatment
under the PhysiCell simulator. A hybrid objective equation was used containing
both the actual objective of an effective tumour treatment and the novelty
measure of the possible solutions. Different weights of the two components of
the hybrid equation were investigated to unveil the significance of each one.

  Multitasking optimization is an emerging research field which has attracted
lot of attention in the scientific community. The main purpose of this paradigm
is how to solve multiple optimization problems or tasks simultaneously by
conducting a single search process. The main catalyst for reaching this
objective is to exploit possible synergies and complementarities among the
tasks to be optimized, helping each other by virtue of the transfer of
knowledge among them (thereby being referred to as Transfer Optimization). In
this context, Evolutionary Multitasking addresses Transfer Optimization
problems by resorting to concepts from Evolutionary Computation for
simultaneous solving the tasks at hand. This work contributes to this trend by
proposing a novel algorithmic scheme for dealing with multitasking
environments. The proposed approach, coined as Coevolutionary Bat Algorithm,
finds its inspiration in concepts from both co-evolutionary strategies and the
metaheuristic Bat Algorithm. We compare the performance of our proposed method
with that of its Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm counterpart over 15
different multitasking setups, composed by eight reference instances of the
discrete Traveling Salesman Problem. The experimentation and results stemming
therefrom support the main hypothesis of this study: the proposed
Coevolutionary Bat Algorithm is a promising meta-heuristic for solving
Evolutionary Multitasking scenarios.

\\
  The generation of multiphase porous electrode microstructures is a critical
step in the optimisation of electrochemical energy storage devices. This work
implements a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DC-GAN) for
generating realistic n-phase microstructural data. The same network
architecture is successfully applied to two very different three-phase
microstructures: A lithium-ion battery cathode and a solid oxide fuel cell
anode. A comparison between the real and synthetic data is performed in terms
of the morphological properties (volume fraction, specific surface area,
triple-phase boundary) and transport properties (relative diffusivity), as well
as the two-point correlation function. The results show excellent agreement
between for datasets and they are also visually indistinguishable. By modifying
the input to the generator, we show that it is possible to generate
microstructure with periodic boundaries in all three directions. This has the
potential to significantly reduce the simulated volume required to be
considered representative and therefore massively reduce the computational cost
of the electrochemical simulations necessary to predict the performance of a
particular microstructure during optimisation.

  In today's day and time solving real-world complex problems has become
fundamentally vital and critical task. Many of these are combinatorial
problems, where optimal solutions are sought rather than exact solutions.
Traditional optimization methods are found to be effective for small scale
problems. However, for real-world large scale problems, traditional methods
either do not scale up or fail to obtain optimal solutions or they end-up
giving solutions after a long running time. Even earlier artificial
intelligence based techniques used to solve these problems could not give
acceptable results. However, last two decades have seen many new methods in AI
based on the characteristics and behaviors of the living organisms in the
nature which are categorized as bio-inspired or nature inspired optimization
algorithms. These methods, are also termed meta-heuristic optimization methods,
have been proved theoretically and implemented using simulation as well used to
create many useful applications. They have been used extensively to solve many
industrial and engineering complex problems due to being easy to understand,
flexible, simple to adapt to the problem at hand and most importantly their
ability to come out of local optima traps. This local optima avoidance property
helps in finding global optimal solutions. This paper is aimed at understanding
how nature has inspired many optimization algorithms, basic categorization of
them, major bio-inspired optimization algorithms invented in recent time with
their applications.

Categories: cs.NE
\\
  Recent studies have shown that metaplastic synapses can retain information
longer than simple binary synapses and are beneficial for continual learning.
In this paper, we explore the multistate metaplastic synapse characteristics in
the context of high retention and reception of information. Inherent behavior
of a memristor emulating the multistate synapse is employed to capture the
metaplastic behavior. An integrated neural network study for learning and
memory retention is performed by integrating the synapse in a $5\times3$
crossbar at the circuit level and $128\times128$ network at the architectural
level. An on-device training circuitry ensures the dynamic learning in the
network. In the $128\times128$ network, it is observed that the number of input
patterns the multistate synapse can classify is $\simeq$ 2.1x that of a simple
binary synapse model, at a mean accuracy of $\geq$ 75% .

Title: Memory Organization for Energy-Efficient Learning and Inference in
  Digital Neuromorphic Accelerators
Authors: Clemens JS Schaefer, Patrick Faley, Emre O Neftci, Siddharth Joshi
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: submitted to ISCAS2020
\\
  The energy efficiency of neuromorphic hardware is greatly affected by the
energy of storing, accessing, and updating synaptic parameters. Various methods
of memory organisation targeting energy-efficient digital accelerators have
been investigated in the past, however, they do not completely encapsulate the
energy costs at a system level. To address this shortcoming and to account for
various overheads, we synthesize the controller and memory for different
encoding schemes and extract the energy costs from these synthesized blocks.
Additionally, we introduce functional encoding for structured connectivity such
as the connectivity in convolutional layers. Functional encoding offers a 58%
reduction in the energy to implement a backward pass and weight update in such
layers compared to existing index-based solutions. We show that for a 2 layer
spiking neural network trained to retain a spatio-temporal pattern, bitmap
(PB-BMP) based organization can encode the sparser networks more efficiently.
This form of encoding delivers a 1.37x improvement in energy efficiency coming
at the cost of a 4% degradation in network retention accuracy as measured by
the van Rossum distance.

  We introduce a recurrent neural network model of working memory combining
short-term and long-term components. e short-term component is modelled using a
gated reservoir model that is trained to hold a value from an input stream when
a gate signal is on. e long-term component is modelled using conceptors in
order to store inner temporal patterns (that corresponds to values). We combine
these two components to obtain a model where information can go from long-term
memory to short-term memory and vice-versa and we show how standard operations
on conceptors allow to combine long-term memories and describe their effect on
short-term memory.

Title: Improved Binary Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm
Authors: Rafet Durgut
Categories: cs.NE cs.AI
\\
  The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is an evolutionary optimization
algorithm based on swarm intelligence and inspired by the honey bees' food
search behavior. Since the ABC algorithm has been developed to achieve optimal
solutions by searching in the continuous search space, modification is required
to apply this method to binary optimization problems. In this paper, we improve
the ABC algorithm to solve binary optimization problems and call it the
improved binary Artificial Bee Colony (ibinABC). The proposed method consists
of an update mechanism based on fitness values and processing different number
of decision variables. Thus, we aim to prevent the ABC algorithm from getting
stuck in a local minimum by increasing its exploration ability. We compare the
ibinABC algorithm with three variants of the ABC and other meta-heuristic
algorithms in the literature. For comparison, we use the wellknown OR-Library
dataset containing 15 problem instances prepared for the uncapacitated facility
location problem. Computational results show that the proposed method is
superior to other methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness. The
source code of the algorithm will be available on GitHub after reviewing
process

Title: Giving Up Control: Neurons as Reinforcement Learning Agents
Authors: Jordan Ott
Categories: cs.NE cs.AI
\\
  Artificial Intelligence has historically relied on planning, heuristics, and
handcrafted approaches designed by experts. All the while claiming to pursue
the creation of Intelligence. This approach fails to acknowledge that
intelligence emerges from the dynamics within a complex system. Neurons in the
brain are governed by local rules, where no single neuron, or group of neurons,
coordinates or controls the others. This local structure gives rise to the
appropriate dynamics in which intelligence can emerge. Populations of neurons
must compete with their neighbors for resources, inhibition, and activity
representation. At the same time, they must cooperate, so the population and
organism can perform high-level functions. To this end, we introduce modeling
neurons as reinforcement learning agents. Where each neuron may be viewed as an
independent actor, trying to maximize its own self-interest. By framing
learning in this way, we open the door to an entirely new approach to building
intelligent systems.

Title: T2FSNN: Deep Spiking Neural Networks with Time-to-first-spike Coding
Authors: Seongsik Park, Seijoon Kim, Byunggook Na, Sungroh Yoon
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted to DAC 2020
\\
  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained considerable interest due to their
energy-efficient characteristics, yet lack of a scalable training algorithm has
restricted their applicability in practical machine learning problems. The deep
neural network-to-SNN conversion approach has been widely studied to broaden
the applicability of SNNs. Most previous studies, however, have not fully
utilized spatio-temporal aspects of SNNs, which has led to inefficiency in
terms of number of spikes and inference latency. In this paper, we present
T2FSNN, which introduces the concept of time-to-first-spike coding into deep
SNNs using the kernel-based dynamic threshold and dendrite to overcome the
aforementioned drawback. In addition, we propose gradient-based optimization
and early firing methods to further increase the efficiency of the T2FSNN.
According to our results, the proposed methods can reduce inference latency and
number of spikes to 22% and less than 1%, compared to those of burst coding,
which is the state-of-the-art result on the CIFAR-100.

Categories: cs.NE cs.LG
\\
  The success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be attributed to its deep
structure, that learns invariant feature representation at multiple levels of
abstraction. Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) use spatiotemporal
spike patterns to encode and transmit information, which is biologically
realistic, and suitable for ultra-low-power event-driven neuromorphic
implementation. Therefore, Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DSNNs) represent a
promising direction in artificial intelligence, with the potential to benefit
from the best of both worlds. However, the training of DSNNs is challenging
because standard error back-propagation (BP) algorithms are not directly
applicable. In this paper, we first establish an understanding of why error
back-propagation does not work well in DSNNs. To address this problem, we
propose a simple yet efficient Rectified Linear Postsynaptic Potential function
(ReL-PSP) for spiking neurons and propose a Spike-Timing-Dependent
Back-Propagation (STDBP) learning algorithm for DSNNs. In the proposed learning
algorithm, the timing of individual spikes is used to carry information
(temporal coding), and learning (back-propagation) is performed based on spike
timing in an event-driven manner. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed learning algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in spike time
based learning algorithms of SNNs. This work investigates the contribution of
dynamics in spike timing to information encoding, synaptic plasticity and
decision making, providing a new perspective to design of future DSNNs.

Title: A Novel Hybrid GWO with WOA for Global Numerical Optimization and

\\
  A recent metaheuristic algorithm, such as Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA),
was proposed. The idea of proposing this algorithm belongs to the hunting
behavior of the humpback whale. However, WOA suffers from poor performance in
the exploitation phase and stagnates in the local best solution. Grey Wolf
Optimization (GWO) is a very competitive algorithm comparing to other common
metaheuristic algorithms as it has a super performance in the exploitation
phase while it is tested on unimodal benchmark functions. Therefore, the aim of
this paper is to hybridize GWO with WOA to overcome the problems. GWO can
perform well in exploiting optimal solutions. In this paper, a hybridized WOA
with GWO which is called WOAGWO is presented. The proposed hybridized model
consists of two steps. Firstly, the hunting mechanism of GWO is embedded into
the WOA exploitation phase with a new condition which is related to GWO.
Secondly, a new technique is added to the exploration phase to improve the
solution after each iteration. Experimentations are tested on three different
standard test functions which are called benchmark functions: 23 common
functions, 25 CEC2005 functions and 10 CEC2019 functions. The proposed WOAGWO
is also evaluated against original WOA, GWO and three other commonly used
algorithms. Results show that WOAGWO outperforms other algorithms depending on
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Finally, WOAGWO is likewise applied to solve an
engineering problem such as pressure vessel design. Then the results prove that
WOAGWO achieves optimum solution which is better than WOA and Fitness Dependent
Optimizer (FDO).

\\
  The MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS) is one of the best-known Ant Colony
Optimization (ACO) algorithms proven to be efficient at finding satisfactory
solutions to many difficult combinatorial optimization problems. The slow-down
in Moore's law, and the availability of graphics processing units (GPUs)
capable of conducting general-purpose computations at high speed, has sparked
considerable research efforts into the development of GPU-based ACO
implementations. In this paper, we discuss a range of novel ideas for improving
the GPU-based parallel MMAS implementation, allowing it to better utilize the
computing power offered by two subsequent Nvidia GPU architectures.
Specifically, based on the weighted reservoir sampling algorithm we propose a
novel parallel implementation of the node selection procedure, which is at the
heart of the MMAS and other ACO algorithms. We also present a memory-efficient
implementation of another key-component -- the tabu list structure -- which is
used in the ACO's solution construction stage. The proposed implementations,
combined with the existing approaches, lead to a total of six MMAS variants,
which are evaluated on a set of Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances
ranging from 198 to 3,795 cities. The results show that our MMAS implementation
is competitive with state-of-the-art GPU-based and multi-core CPU-based
parallel ACO implementations: in fact, the times obtained for the Nvidia V100
Volta GPU were up to 7.18x and 21.79x smaller, respectively. The fastest of the
proposed MMAS variants is able to generate over 1 million candidate solutions
per second when solving a 1,002-city instance. Moreover, we show that, combined
with the 2-opt local search heuristic, the proposed parallel MMAS finds
high-quality solutions for the TSP instances with up to 18,512 nodes.

Title: Accelerated Analog Neuromorphic Computing

\\
  This paper presents the concepts behind the BrainScales (BSS) accelerated
analog neuromorphic computing architecture. It describes the second-generation
BrainScales-2 (BSS-2) version and its most recent in-silico realization, the
HICANN-X Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), as it has been
developed as part of the neuromorphic computing activities within the European
Human Brain Project (HBP). While the first generation is implemented in an
180nm process, the second generation uses 65nm technology. This allows the
integration of a digital plasticity processing unit, a highly-parallel micro
processor specially built for the computational needs of learning in an
accelerated analog neuromorphic systems. The presented architecture is based
upon a continuous-time, analog, physical model implementation of neurons and
synapses, resembling an analog neuromorphic accelerator attached to build-in
digital compute cores. While the analog part emulates the spike-based dynamics
of the neural network in continuous-time, the latter simulates biological
processes happening on a slower time-scale, like structural and parameter
changes. Compared to biological time-scales, the emulation is highly
accelerated, i.e. all time-constants are several orders of magnitude smaller
than in biology. Programmable ion channel emulation and inter-compartmental
conductances allow the modeling of nonlinear dendrites, back-propagating
action-potentials as well as NMDA and Calcium plateau potentials. To extend the
usability of the analog accelerator, it also supports vector-matrix
multiplication. Thereby, BSS-2 supports inference of deep convolutional
networks as well as local-learning with complex ensembles of spiking neurons
within the same substrate.

\\
  In recent years, a large number of smart devices will be connected in
Internet of Things (IoT) using an ad hoc network, which needs more frequency
spectra. The cognitive radio (CR) technology can improve spectrum utilization
in an opportunistic communication manner for IoT, forming a promising paradigm
known as cognitive radio ad hoc networks,CRAHNs. However, dynamic spectrum
availability and mobile devices/persons make it difficult to develop an
efficient data transmission scheme for CRAHNs under an obstacle environment.
Opportunistic routing can leverage the broadcast nature of wireless channels to
enhance network performance. Inspired by this, in this paper, we propose an
Obstacle aware Opportunistic Data Transmission scheme (OODT) in CRAHNs from a
computational geometry perspective, considering energy efficiency and social
features. In the proposed scheme, we exploit a new routing metric, which is
based on an obstacle avoiding algorithm using a polygon boundary 1-searcher
technology, and an auction model for selecting forwarding candidates. In
addition, we prove that the candidate selection problem is NP-hard and propose
a heuristic algorithm for candidate selection. The simulation results show that
the proposed scheme can achieve better performance than existing schemes.

paper, the mobile Internet experience for Germany is evaluated with the help of
crowdsourcing from the perspective of an end user. We statistically analyze a
dataset with throughput measurements on the end device from Tutela Ltd., which
covers more than 2.5 million throughput tests across Germany from January to
July 2019. We give insights into this emerging methodology and highlight the
benefits of this method. The paper contains statistics and conclusions for
several large cities as well as regions in Germany compared to general
statements for Germany, since individual measurements and averages often only
imprecisely reflect the situation. The goal is to give a holistic view of the
performance of the current mobile network in Germany. Reading this paper, it
becomes evident that reliable statements about the quality of the mobile
network for Germany depend on a large number of peculiarities in different
regions with their own performance characteristics due to different network
deployments and population numbers.

Title: A Software-Defined Solution for Managing Fog Computing Resources in
  Sensor Networks
Authors: Patricia Cardoso, Jose Moura, Rui Marinheiro
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: 8 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables, 16 references
\\
  The fast growth of Internet-connected embedded devices demands for new
capabilities at the network edge. These new capabilities are local processing,
fast communications, and resource virtualization. The current work aims to
address the previous capabilities by designing and deploying a new proposal,
which offers on-demand activation of offline IoT fog computing assets via a
Software Defined Networking (SDN) based solution combined with containerization
and sensor virtualization. We present and discuss performance and functional
outcomes from emulated tests made on our proposal. Analysing the performance
results, the system latency has two parts. The first part is about the delay
induced by limitations on the networking resources. The second part of the
system latency is due to the on-demand activation of the required processing
resources, which are initially powered off towards a more sustainable system
operation. In addition, analysing the functional results, when a real IoT
protocol is used, we evidence our proposal viability to be deployed with the
necessary orchestration in distributed scenarios involving embedded devices,
actuators, controllers, and brokers at the network edge.

Title: Design, Implementation and Control of an Underactuated Hand Exoskeleton
Authors: Mine Sarac Stroppa
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: PhD thesis from Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in 2017
\\
  I present the design, implementation and control of a novel, linkage-based,
underactuated hand exoskeleton aimed to assist patients with hand disabilities
during grasping tasks for robot assisted physical rehabilitation or robot
assisted activities of daily living. Even though the proposed exoskeleton was
designed with the purpose of assisting users during interactions with real
objects around them, its use can be extended for haptic applications as well.
In this thesis, I will deeply mention the exoskeletons in the literature,
detail the design decisions and implement various control strategies to use
this exoskeleton for different applications in the future.

Title: Risk-Aware Planning and Assignment for Ground Vehicles using Uncertain
  Perception from Aerial Vehicles
Authors: Vishnu D. Sharma, Maymoonah Toubeh, Lifeng Zhou, and Pratap Tokekar
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  We propose a risk-aware framework for multi-robot, multi-demand assignment
and planning in unknown environments. Our motivation is disaster response and
search-and-rescue scenarios where ground vehicles must reach demand locations
as soon as possible. We consider a setting where the terrain information is
available only in the form of an aerial, georeferenced image. Deep learning
techniques can be used for semantic segmentation of the aerial image to create
a cost map for safe ground robot navigation. Such segmentation may still be
noisy. Hence, we present a joint planning and perception framework that
accounts for the risk introduced due to noisy perception. Our contributions are
two-fold: (i) we show how to use Bayesian deep learning techniques to extract
risk at the perception level; and (ii) use a risk-theoretical measure, CVaR,
for risk-aware planning and assignment. The pipeline is theoretically
established, then empirically analyzed through two datasets. We find that
accounting for risk at both levels produces quantifiably safer paths and
assignments.

Title: Functionally Divided Manipulation Synergy for Controlling Multi-fingered
  Hands
Authors: Kazuki Higashi, Keisuke Koyama, Ryuta Ozawa, Kazuyuki Nagata, Weiwei

\\
  Synergy supplies a practical approach for expressing various postures of a
multi-fingered hand. However, a conventional synergy defined for reproducing
grasping postures cannot perform general-purpose tasks expected for a
multi-fingered hand. Locking the position of particular fingers is essential
for a multi-fingered hand to manipulate an object. When using conventional
synergy based control to manipulate an object, which requires locking some
fingers, the coordination of joints is heavily restricted, decreasing the
dexterity of the hand. We propose a functionally divided manipulation synergy
(FDMS) method, which provides a synergy-based control to achieves both
dimensionality reduction and in-hand manipulation. In FDMS, first, we define
the function of each finger of the hand as either "manipulation" or "fixed."
Then, we apply synergy control only to the fingers having the manipulation
function, so that dexterous manipulations can be realized with few control
inputs. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is experimentally verified.

Title: Integrating Combined Task and Motion Planning with Compliant Control
Authors: Hao Chen, Juncheng Li, Weiwei Wan, Zhifeng Huang, and Kensuke Harada
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Planning a motion for inserting pegs remains an open problem. The difficulty
lies in both the inevitable errors in the grasps of a robotic hand and absolute
precision problems in robot joint motors. This paper proposes an integral
method to solve the problem. The method uses combined task and motion planning
to plan the grasps and motion for a dual-arm robot to pick up the objects and
move them to assembly poses. Then, it controls the dual-arm robot using a
compliant strategy (a combination of linear search, spiral search, and
impedance control) to finish up the insertion. The method is implemented on a
dual-arm Universal Robots 3 robot. Six objects, including a connector with
fifteen peg-in-hole pairs for detailed analysis and other five objects with
different contours of pegs and holes for additional validation, were tested by
the robot. Experimental results show reasonable force-torque signal changes and
end-effector position changes. The proposed method exhibits high robustness and
high fidelity in successfully conducting planned peg-in-hole tasks.

Title: Incremental Skill Learning of Stable Dynamical Systems
Authors: Matteo Saveriano and Dongheui Lee
Categories: cs.RO
DOI: 10.1109/IROS.2018.8594474
\\
  Efficient skill acquisition, representation, and on-line adaptation to
different scenarios has become of fundamental importance for assistive robotic
applications. In the past decade, dynamical systems (DS) have arisen as a
flexible and robust tool to represent learned skills and to generate motion
trajectories. This work presents a novel approach to incrementally modify the
dynamics of a generic autonomous DS when new demonstrations of a task are
provided. A control input is learned from demonstrations to modify the
trajectory of the system while preserving the stability properties of the
reshaped DS. Learning is performed incrementally through Gaussian process
regression, increasing the robot's knowledge of the skill every time a new
demonstration is provided. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated with experiments on a publicly available dataset of complex
motions.

\\
  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must share space with human pedestrians, both in
on-road cases such as cars at pedestrian crossings and off-road cases such as
delivery vehicles navigating through crowds on high-streets. Unlike static and
kinematic obstacles, pedestrians are active agents with complex, interactive
motions. Planning AV actions in the presence of pedestrians thus requires
modelling of their probable future behaviour as well as detection and tracking
which enable such modelling. This narrative review article is Part II of a pair
which together survey the current technology stack involved in this process,
organising recent research into a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from low level
image detection to high-level psychological models, from the perspective of an
AV designer. This self-contained Part II covers the higher levels of this
stack, consisting of models of pedestrian behaviour, from prediction of
individual pedestrians' likely destinations and paths, to game theoretic models
of interactions between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles. This survey
clearly shows that, although there are good models for optimal walking
behaviour, high-level psychological and social modelling of pedestrian
behaviour still remains an open research question that requires many conceptual
issues to be clarified by the community. At these levels, early work has been
done on descriptive and qualitative models of behaviour, but much work is still
needed to translate them into quantitative algorithms for practical AV control.

Title: GISNet: Graph-Based Information Sharing Network For Vehicle Trajectory
  Prediction
Authors: Ziyi Zhao, Haowen Fang, Zhao Jin, Qinru Qiu
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  The trajectory prediction is a critical and challenging problem in the design
of an autonomous driving system. Many AI-oriented companies, such as Google
Waymo, Uber and DiDi, are investigating more accurate vehicle trajectory
prediction algorithms. However, the prediction performance is governed by lots
of entangled factors, such as the stochastic behaviors of surrounding vehicles,
historical information of self-trajectory, and relative positions of neighbors,
etc. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based information sharing network
(GISNet) that allows the information sharing between the target vehicle and its
surrounding vehicles. Meanwhile, the model encodes the historical trajectory
information of all the vehicles in the scene. Experiments are carried out on
the public NGSIM US-101 and I-80 Dataset and the prediction performance is
measured by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The quantitative and qualitative
experimental results show that our model significantly improves the trajectory
prediction accuracy, by up to 50.00%, compared to existing models.

Title: Patch Quality and Diversity of Invariant-Guided Search-Based Program
  Repair
Authors: Zhen Yu Ding
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Most automatic program repair techniques rely on test cases to specify
correct program behavior. Due to test cases' frequently incomplete coverage of
desired behavior, however, patches often overfit and fail to generalize to
broader requirements. Moreover, in the absence of perfectly correct outputs,
methods to ensure higher patch quality, such as merging together several
patches or a human evaluating patch recommendations, benefit from having access
to a diverse set of patches, making patch diversity a potentially useful trait.
We evaluate the correctness and diversity of patches generated by GenProg and
an invariant-based diversity-enhancing extension described in our prior work.
We find no evidence that promoting diversity changes the correctness of patches
in a positive or negative direction. Using invariant- and test case
generation-driven metrics for measuring semantic diversity, we find no observed
semantic differences between patches for most bugs, regardless of the repair
technique used.

\\
  Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers
frequently integrate code into a common codebase. After the code is integrated,
the CI server runs a test suite and other tools to produce a set of reports
(e.g., output of linters and tests). If the result of a CI test run is
unexpected, developers have the option to manually restart the build,
re-running the same test suite on the same code; this can reveal build
flakiness, if the restarted build outcome differs from the original build. In
this study, we analyze restarted builds, flaky builds, and their impact on the
development workflow. We observe that developers restart at least 1.72% of
builds, amounting to 56,522 restarted builds in our Travis CI dataset. We
observe that more mature and more complex projects are more likely to include
restarted builds. The restarted builds are mostly builds that are initially
failing due to a test, network problem, or a Travis CI limitations such as
execution timeout. Finally, we observe that restarted builds have a major
impact on development workflow. Indeed, in 54.42% of the restarted builds, the
developers analyze and restart a build within an hour of the initial failure.
This suggests that developers wait for CI results, interrupting their workflow
to address the issue. Restarted builds also slow down the merging of pull
requests by a factor of three, bringing median merging time from 16h to 48h.

Title: Applying the Isabelle Insider Framework to Airplane Security
Authors: Florian Kamm\"uller and Manfred Kerber
Categories: cs.SE cs.LO
\\
  Avionics is one of the fields in which verification methods have been
pioneered and brought a new level of reliability to systems used in safety
critical environments. Tragedies, like the 2015 insider attack on a German
airplane, in which all 150 people on board died, show that safety and security
crucially depend not only on the well functioning of systems but also on the
way how humans interact with the systems. Policies are a way to describe how
humans should behave in their interactions with technical systems, formal
reasoning about such policies requires integrating the human factor into the
verification process. In this paper, we report on our work on using logical
modelling and analysis of infrastructure models and policies with actors to
scrutinize security policies in the presence of insiders. We model insider
attacks on airplanes in the Isabelle Insider framework. This application
motivates the use of an extension of the framework with Kripke structures and
the temporal logic CTL to enable reasoning on dynamic system states.
Furthermore, we illustrate that Isabelle modelling and invariant reasoning
reveal subtle security assumptions. We summarize by providing a methodology for
the development of policies that satisfy stated properties.

  This paper explains the design of a social network analysis framework,
developed under DARPA's SocialSim program, with novel architecture that models
human emotional, cognitive and social factors. Our framework is both theory and
data-driven, and utilizes domain expertise. Our simulation effort helps in
understanding how information flows and evolves in social media platforms. We
focused on modeling three information domains: cryptocurrencies, cyber threats,
and software vulnerabilities for the three interrelated social environments:
GitHub, Reddit, and Twitter. We participated in the SocialSim DARPA Challenge
in December 2018, in which our models were subjected to extensive performance
evaluation for accuracy, generalizability, explainability, and experimental
power. This paper reports the main concepts and models, utilized in our social
media modeling effort in developing a multi-resolution simulation at the user,
community, population, and content levels.

Title: The Degree-Dependent Threshold Model: Towards a Better Understanding of
  Opinion Dynamics on Online Social Networks
Authors: Ece C. Mutlu and Ivan Garibay
Categories: cs.SI physics.soc-ph
Comments: 5 figures
\\
  With the rapid growth of online social media, people become increasingly
overwhelmed by the volume and the content of the information present in the
environment. The threshold model is currently one of the most common methods to
capture the effect of people on others' opinions and emotions. Although many
studies employ and try to improve upon the threshold model, the search for an
appropriate threshold function for defining human behavior is an essential and
yet unattained quest. The definition of heterogeneity in thresholds of
individuals is oftentimes poorly defined, which leads to the rather simplistic
use of uniform and binary functions, albeit they are far from representing the
reality. In this study, we use Twitter data of size 30,704,025 tweets to mimic
the adoption of a new opinion. Our results show that the threshold is not only
correlated with the out-degree of nodes, which contradicts other studies but
also correlated with nodes' in-degree. Therefore, we simulated two cases in
which thresholds are out-degree and in-degree dependent, separately. We
concluded that the system is more likely to reach a consensus when thresholds
are in-degree dependent; however, the time elapsed until all nodes fix their
opinions is significantly higher in this case. Additionally, we did not observe
a notable effect of mean-degree on either the average opinion or the fixation
time of opinions for both cases, and increasing seed size has a negative effect
on reaching a consensus. Although threshold heterogeneity has a slight
influence on the average opinion, the positive effect of heterogeneity on
reaching a consensus is more pronounced when thresholds are in-degree
dependent.

Title: Continuous Activity Maximization in Online Social Networks
Authors: Jianxiong Guo, Tiantian Chen, Weili Wu
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  Activity maximization is a task of seeking a small subset of users in a given
social network that makes the expected total activity benefit maximized. This
is a generalization of many real applications. In this paper, we extend
activity maximization problem to that under the general marketing strategy
$\vec{x}$, which is a $d$-dimensional vector from a lattice space and has
probability $h_u(\vec{x})$ to activate a node $u$ as a seed. Based on that, we
propose the continuous activity maximization (CAM) problem, where the domain is
continuous and the seed set we select conforms to a certain probability
distribution. It is a new topic to study the problem about information
diffusion under the lattice constraint, thus, we address the problem
systematically here. First, we analyze the hardness of CAM and how to compute
the objective function of CAM accurately and effectively. We prove this
objective function is monotone, but not DR-submodular and not DR-supermodular.
Then, we develop a monotone and DR-submodular lower bound and upper bound of
CAM, and apply sampling techniques to design three unbiased estimators for CAM,
its lower bound and upper bound. Next, adapted from IMM algorithm and sandwich
approximation framework, we obtain a data-dependent approximation ratio. This
process can be considered as a general method to solve those maximization
problem on lattice but not DR-submodular. Last, we conduct experiments on three
real-world datasets to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of our
proposed algorithms.

Title: A Heterogeneous Dynamical Graph Neural Networks Approach to Quantify
  Scientific Impact
Authors: Fan Zhou, Xovee Xu, Ce Li, Goce Trajcevski, Ting Zhong, Kunpeng Zhang
Categories: cs.SI cs.DL cs.LG physics.soc-ph
\\
  Quantifying and predicting the long-term impact of scientific writings or
individual scholars has important implications for many policy decisions, such
as funding proposal evaluation and identifying emerging research fields. In
this work, we propose an approach based on Heterogeneous Dynamical Graph Neural
Network (HDGNN) to explicitly model and predict the cumulative impact of papers
and authors. HDGNN extends heterogeneous GNNs by incorporating temporally
evolving characteristics and capturing both structural properties of attributed
graph and the growing sequence of citation behavior. HDGNN is significantly
different from previous models in its capability of modeling the node impact in
a dynamic manner while taking into account the complex relations among nodes.
Experiments conducted on a real citation dataset demonstrate its superior
performance of predicting the impact of both papers and authors.

Title: Asymptotic Security of Control Systems by Covert Reaction: Repeated
  Signaling Game with Undisclosed Belief
Authors: Hampei Sasahara, Serkan Saritas, Henrik Sandberg
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  This study investigates the relationship between resilience of control
systems to attacks and the information available to malicious attackers.
Specifically, it is shown that control systems are guaranteed to be secure in
an asymptotic manner by rendering reactions against potentially harmful actions
covert. The behaviors of the attacker and the defender are analyzed through a
repeated signaling game with an undisclosed belief under covert reactions. In
the typical setting of signaling games, reactions conducted by the defender are
supposed to be public information and the measurability enables the attacker to
accurately trace transitions of the defender's belief on existence of a
malicious attacker. In contrast, the belief in the game considered in this
paper is undisclosed and hence common equilibrium concepts can no longer be
employed for the analysis. To surmount this difficulty, a novel framework for
decision of reasonable strategies of the players in the game is introduced.
Based on the presented framework, it is revealed that any reasonable strategy
chosen by a rational malicious attacker converges to the benign behavior as
long as the reactions performed by the defender are unobservable to the
attacker. The result provides an explicit relationship between resilience and
information, which indicates the importance of covertness of reactions for
designing secure control systems.

Title: Cooperative Hypothesis Testing by Two Observers with Asymmetric
  Information
Authors: Aneesh Raghavan and John S. Baras
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Journal Paper to be published
\\
  In this paper, we consider the binary hypothesis testing problem with two
observers. There are two possible states of nature (or hypotheses).
Observations are collected by two observers. The observations are statistically
related to the true state of nature. Given the observations, the objective of
both observers is to find out what is the true state of nature. We present four
different approaches to address the problem. In the first (centralized)
approach, the observations collected by both observers are sent to a central
coordinator where hypothesis testing is performed. In the second approach, each
observer performs hypothesis testing based on locally collected observations.
Then they exchange binary information to arrive at a consensus. In the third
approach, each observer constructs an aggregated probability space based on the
observations collected by it and the decision it receives from the alternate
observer and performs hypothesis testing in the new probability space. In this
approach also they exchange binary information to arrive at consensus. In the
fourth approach, if observations collected by the observers are independent
conditioned on the hypothesis we show the construction of the aggregated sample
space can be skipped. In this case, the observers exchange real-valued
information to achieve consensus. Given the same fixed number of samples, n, n
sufficiently large, for the centralized (first) and decentralized (second)
approaches, it has been shown that if the observations collected by the
observers are independent conditioned on the hypothesis, then the minimum
probability that the two observers agree and are wrong in the decentralized
approach is upper bounded by the minimum probability of error achieved in the
centralized approach.

data-driven model invalidation problem can be solved using a tractable
feasibility check. Our proposed approach consists of two main components: (i) a
data-driven abstraction part that uses the noisy sampled data to
over-approximate the unknown Lipschitz continuous dynamics with upper and lower
functions, and (ii) an optimization-based model invalidation component that
determines the incompatibility of the data-driven abstraction with a newly
observed length-T output trajectory. Finally, we discuss several methods to
reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm and demonstrate their
effectiveness with a simulation example of swarm intent identification.

Title: Order Effects of Measurements in Multi-Agent Hypothesis Testing
Authors: Aneesh Raghavan and John S. Baras
Categories: eess.SY cs.MA cs.SY
Comments: Journal Paper to be published
\\
  All propositions from the set of events for an agent in a multi-agent system
might not be simultaneously verifiable. In this paper, we revisit the concepts
of \textit{event-state-operation structure} and \textit{relationship of
incompatibility} from literature and use them as a tool to study the algebraic
structure of the set of events. We present an example from multi-agent
hypothesis testing where the set of events does not form a Boolean algebra but
forms an ortholattice. A possible construction of a 'noncommutative probability
space', accounting for \textit{incompatible events} (events which cannot be
simultaneously verified) is discussed. As a possible decision-making problem in
such a probability space, we consider the binary hypothesis testing problem. We
present two approaches to this decision-making problem. In the first approach,
we represent the available data as coming from measurements modeled via
projection valued measures (PVM) and retrieve the results of the underlying
detection problem solved using classical probability models. In the second
approach, we represent the measurements using positive operator valued measures
(POVM). We prove that the minimum probability of error achieved in the second
approach is the same as in the first approach.

Title: Event-Driven Receding Horizon Control For On-line Distributed Persistent
  Monitoring on Graphs
Authors: Shirantha Welikala and Christos G. Cassandras
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  This paper considers the optimal multi-agent persistent monitoring problem
defined on a set of nodes (targets) interconnected according to a fixed graph
topology (PMG). The objective is to minimize a measure of mean overall node
state uncertainty evaluated over a finite time interval via controlling the
motion of the team of agents. A class of threshold-based parametric controllers
has been proposed in a prior work as a distributed on-line solution to this PMG
problem. However, this approach involves a lengthy and computationally
intensive parameter tuning process, which can still result in low performing
solutions. Recent works have focused on appending a centralized off-line stage
to the aforementioned parameter tuning process so as to improve its
performance. However, this comes at the cost of sacrificing the on-line
distributed nature of the original solution while also increasing the
associated computational cost. Moreover, such parametric control approaches are
slow to react to compensate for possible state perturbations. Motivated by
these challenges, this paper proposes a computationally cheap novel
event-driven receding horizon control (ED-RHC) approach as a distributed
on-line solution to the PMG problem. In particular, the discrete-event nature
of the PMG systems is exploited in this work to determine locally (i.e., both
temporally and spatially) optimum trajectory decisions for each agent to make
at different discrete event times on its trajectory. Numerical results obtained
from this ED-RHC method show significant improvements compared to state of the
art distributed on-line parametric control solutions.

  Approximately 18 percent of the 3.2 million smartphone applications rely on
integrated graphics processing units (GPUs) to achieve competitive performance.
Graphics performance, typically measured in frames per second, is a strong
function of the GPU frequency, which in turn has a significant impact on mobile
processor power consumption. Consequently, dynamic power management algorithms
have to assess the performance sensitivity to the frequency accurately to
choose the operating frequency of the GPU effectively. Since the impact of GPU
frequency on performance varies rapidly over time, there is a need for online
performance models that can adapt to varying workloads. This paper presents a
light-weight adaptive runtime performance model that predicts the frame
processing time of graphics workloads at runtime without apriori
characterization. We employ this model to estimate the frame time sensitivity
to the GPU frequency, i.e., the partial derivative of the frame time with
respect to the GPU frequency. The proposed model does not rely on any parameter
learned offline. Our experiments on commercial platforms with common GPU
benchmarks show that the mean absolute percentage error in frame time and frame
time sensitivity prediction are 4.2 and 6.7 percent, respectively.

  Power systems are subject to fundamental changes due to the increasing infeed
of renewable energy sources. Taking the accompanying decentralization of power
generation into account, the concept of prosumer-based microgrids gives the
opportunity to rethink structuring and operation of power systems from scratch.
In a prosumer-based microgrid, each power grid node can feed energy into the
grid and draw energy from the grid. The concept allows for spatial aggregation
such that also an interaction between microgrids can be represented as a
prosumer-based microgrid. The contribution of this work is threefold: (i) we
propose a decentralized hierarchical control approach in a network including
different time scales, (ii) we use iterative learning control to compensate
periodic demand patterns and save lower layer control energy and (iii) we
assure asymptotic stability and monotonic convergence in the iteration domain
for the linearized dynamics and validate the performance by simulating the
nonlinear dynamics.

\\
  We propose an on-line supervisory control scheme for discrete event systems
(DESs), where a control specification is described by a fragment of linear
temporal logic. On the product automaton of the DES and an acceptor for the
specification, we define a ranking function that returns the minimum number of
steps required to reach an accepting state from each state. In addition, we
introduce a permissiveness function that indicates a time-varying permissive
level. At each step during the on-line control scheme, the supervisor refers to
the permissiveness function as well as the ranking function in order to
guarantee the control specification while handling the tradeoff between its
permissiveness and acceptance of the specification. The proposed scheme is
demonstrated in a surveillance problem for a mobile robot.

Title: Payload-agnostic Decoupling and Hybrid Vibration Isolation Control for a

\\
  Payload-specific vibration control may be suitable for a particular task but
lacks generality and transferability required for adapting to the various
payload. Self-decoupling and robust vibration control are the crucial problems
to achieve payload-agnostic vibration control. However, there are problems
still unsolved.
  In this article, we present a maglev vibration isolation platform (MVIP),
which aims to attenuate vibration in the payload-agnostic task under a dynamic
environment. Since efforts trying to suppress disturbance will encounter
inevitable coupling problems, we analyzed the reasons resulting in it and
proposed unique and effective solutions.
  To achieve payload-agnostic vibration control, we proposed a new control
strategy, which is the main contribution of this article. It consists of a
self-construct radial basis function neural network inversion (SRBFNNI)
decoupling scheme and hybrid adaptive feed-forward internal model control
(HAFIMC). The former one enables the MVIP to create a self inverse model with
little prior knowledge and achieving self-decoupling. For the unique structure
of MVIP, the vibration control problem is stated and addressed by the proposed
HAFIMC, which utilizes the adaptive part to deal with the periodical
disturbance and the internal mode part to deal with the stability.

Title: Stability Analysis of Droop-Controlled Inverter-Based Power Grids via
  Timescale Separation
Authors: Stefanos Baros, Christoforos N. Hadjicostis, and Francis O'Sullivan
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  We consider the problem of stability analysis for distribution grids with
droop-controlled inverters and dynamic distribution power lines. The inverters
are modeled as voltage sources with controllable frequency and amplitude. This
problem is very challenging for large networks as numerical simulations and
detailed eigenvalue analysis are impactical. Motivated by the above
limitations, we present in this paper a systematic and computationally
efficient framework for stability analysis of inverter-based distribution
grids. To design our framework, we use tools from singular perturbation and
Lyapunov theories. Interestingly, we show that stability of the fast dynamics
of the power grid depends only on the voltage droop gains of the inverters
while, stability of the slow dynamics, depends on both voltage and frequency
droop gains. Finally, by leveraging these timescale separation properties, we
derive sufficient conditions on the frequency and voltage droop gains of the
inverters that warrant stability of the full system. We illustrate our
theoretical results through a numerical example on the IEEE 13-bus distribution
grid.

Title: Bounded state Estimation over Finite-State Channels: Relating

Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1902.00726
\\
  We investigate bounded state estimation of linear systems over finite-state
erasure and additive noise channels in which the noise is governed by a
finite-state machine without any statistical structure. Upper and lower bounds
on their zero-error capacities are derived, revealing a connection with the
topological entropy of the channel dynamics. Some examples are introduced and
separate capacity bounds based on their specific features are derived and
compared with bounds from topological entropy. Necessary and sufficient
conditions for linear state estimation with bounded errors via such channels
are then obtained, by extending previous results for nonstochastic memoryless
channels to finite-state channels. These estimation conditions bring together
the topological entropies of the linear system and the discrete channel.

\\
  In this paper, we consider discrete-time partially observed mean-field games
with the risk-sensitive optimality criterion. We introduce risk-sensitivity
behaviour for each agent via an exponential utility function. In the game
model, each agent is weakly coupled with the rest of the population through its
individual cost and state dynamics via the empirical distribution of states. We
establish the mean-field equilibrium in the infinite-population limit using the
technique of converting the underlying original partially observed stochastic
control problem to a fully observed one on the belief space and the dynamic
programming principle. Then, we show that the mean-field equilibrium policy,
when adopted by each agent, forms an approximate Nash equilibrium for games
with sufficiently many agents. We first consider finite-horizon cost function,
and then, discuss extension of the result to infinite-horizon cost in the
next-to-last section of the paper.

\\
  We present the design, implementation and experimental validation of a
supervisory predictive control approach for an electrical heating system
featuring a phase change slurry as heat storage and transfer medium. The
controller optimizes the energy flows that are used as set points for the heat
generation and energy distribution components. The optimization handles the
thermal and electrical subsystems simultaneously and is able to switch between
different objectives. We show the control can be implemented on low-cost
embedded hardware and validate it with an experimental test bed comprising an
installation of the complete heating system, including all hydraulic and all
electrical components. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of
both, a heat pump heating system with a phase change slurry, and the optimal
control approach. The main control objectives, i.e., thermal comfort and
maximum self-consumption of solar energy, can be met. In addition, the system
and its controller provide a load shifting potential.

Title: R-FORCE: Robust Learning for Random Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Yang Zheng, Eli Shlizerman
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Github Repository: https://github.com/shlizee/R-FORCE
\\
  Random Recurrent Neural Networks (RRNN) are the simplest recurrent networks
to model and extract features from sequential data. The simplicity however
comes with a price; RRNN are known to be susceptible to diminishing/exploding
gradient problem when trained with gradient-descent based optimization. To
enhance robustness of RRNN, alternative training approaches have been proposed.
Specifically, FORCE learning approach proposed a recursive least squares
alternative to train RRNN and was shown to be applicable even for the
challenging task of target-learning, where the network is tasked with
generating dynamic patterns with no guiding input. While FORCE training
indicates that solving target-learning is possible, it appears to be effective
only in a specific regime of network dynamics (edge-of-chaos). We thereby
investigate whether initialization of RRNN connectivity according to a tailored
distribution can guarantee robust FORCE learning. We are able to generate such
distribution by inference of four generating principles constraining the
spectrum of the network Jacobian to remain in stability region. This
initialization along with FORCE learning provides a robust training method,
i.e., Robust-FORCE (R-FORCE). We validate R-FORCE performance on various target
functions for a wide range of network configurations and compare with
alternative methods. Our experiments indicate that R-FORCE facilitates
significantly more stable and accurate target-learning for a wide class of
RRNN. Such stability becomes critical in modeling multi-dimensional sequences
as we demonstrate on modeling time-series of human body joints during physical
movements.

Title: TRACER: A Framework for Facilitating Accurate and Interpretable
  Analytics for High Stakes Applications

Comments: A version of this preprint will appear in ACM SIGMOD 2020
\\
  In high stakes applications such as healthcare and finance analytics, the
interpretability of predictive models is required and necessary for domain
practitioners to trust the predictions. Traditional machine learning models,
e.g., logistic regression (LR), are easy to interpret in nature. However, many
of these models aggregate time-series data without considering the temporal
correlations and variations. Therefore, their performance cannot match up to
recurrent neural network (RNN) based models, which are nonetheless difficult to
interpret. In this paper, we propose a general framework TRACER to facilitate
accurate and interpretable predictions, with a novel model TITV devised for
healthcare analytics and other high stakes applications such as financial
investment and risk management. Different from LR and other existing RNN-based
models, TITV is designed to capture both the time-invariant and the
time-variant feature importance using a feature-wise transformation subnetwork
and a self-attention subnetwork, for the feature influence shared over the
entire time series and the time-related importance respectively. Healthcare
analytics is adopted as a driving use case, and we note that the proposed
TRACER is also applicable to other domains, e.g., fintech. We evaluate the
accuracy of TRACER extensively in two real-world hospital datasets, and our
doctors/clinicians further validate the interpretability of TRACER in both the
patient level and the feature level. Besides, TRACER is also validated in a
high stakes financial application and a critical temperature forecasting
application. The experimental results confirm that TRACER facilitates both
accurate and interpretable analytics for high stakes applications.

\\
  The posthoc verification protocol [J. F. Fitzsimons, M. Hajdu{\v s}ek, and T.
Morimae, Physical Review Letters {\bf120}, 040501 (2018)] enables an
information-theoretically-sound non-interactive verification of quantum
computing, but the message from the prover to the verifier is quantum and the
verifier has to do single-qubit measurements. The Mahadev protocol removes
these quantum parts, but the soundness becomes the computational one. In this
paper, we construct an information-theoretically-sound non-interactive
classical verification protocol for quantum computing with a trusted center.
The trusted center sends random BB84 states to the prover, and the classical
descriptions of these BB84 states to the verifier. The messages from the center
to the prover and the verifier are independent of the instance. By slightly
modifying our protocol, we also construct a non-interactive statistical
zero-knowledge proof system for QMA with the trusted center.

\\
  Given a linear dynamical system affected by stochastic noise, we consider the
problem of selecting an optimal set of sensors (at design-time) to minimize the
trace of the steady state a priori or a posteriori error covariance of the
Kalman filter, subject to certain selection budget constraints. We show the
fundamental result that there is no polynomial-time constant-factor
approximation algorithm for this problem. This contrasts with other classes of
sensor selection problems studied in the literature, which typically pursue
constant-factor approximations by leveraging greedy algorithms and
submodularity (or supermodularity) of the cost function. Here, we provide a
specific example showing that greedy algorithms can perform arbitrarily poorly
for the problem of design-time sensor selection for Kalman filtering. We then
study the problem of attacking (i.e., removing) a set of installed sensors,
under predefined attack budget constraints, to maximize the trace of the steady
state a priori or a posteriori error covariance of the Kalman filter. Again, we
show that there is no polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm
for this problem, and show specifically that greedy algorithms can perform
arbitrarily poorly.

Authors: Shashwat Sharma, Piero Triverio
Categories: physics.comp-ph cs.CE
Comments: 14 pages, 20 figures
\\
  Surface integral equation (SIE) methods are of great interest for the
numerical solution of Maxwell's equations in the presence of homogeneous
objects. However, existing SIE algorithms have limitations, either in terms of
scalability, frequency range, or material properties. We present a scalable SIE
algorithm based on the generalized impedance boundary condition which can
efficiently handle, in a unified manner, both dielectrics and conductors over a
wide range of conductivity, size and frequency. We devise an efficient strategy
for the iterative solution of the resulting equations, with efficient
preconditioners and an object-specific use of the adaptive integral method.
With a rigorous error analysis, we demonstrate that the adaptive integral
method can be applied over a wide range of frequencies and conductivities.
Several numerical examples, drawn from different applications, demonstrate the
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Categories: stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  The dominant approaches to text representation in natural language rely on
learning embeddings on massive corpora which have convenient properties such as
compositionality and distance preservation. In this paper, we develop a novel
method to learn a heavy-tailed embedding with desirable regularity properties
regarding the distributional tails, which allows to analyze the points far away
from the distribution bulk using the framework of multivariate extreme value
theory. In particular, a classifier dedicated to the tails of the proposed
embedding is obtained which performance outperforms the baseline. This
classifier exhibits a scale invariance property which we leverage by
introducing a novel text generation method for label preserving dataset
augmentation. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real text data demonstrate
the relevance of the proposed framework and confirm that this method generates
meaningful sentences with controllable attribute, e.g. positive or negative
sentiment.

\\
  The emerging applications of machine learning algorithms on mobile devices
motivate us to offload the computation tasks of training a model or deploying a
trained one to the cloud. One of the major challenges in this setup is to
guarantee the privacy of the client's data. Various methods have been proposed
to protect privacy in the literature. Those include (i) adding noise to the
client data, which reduces the accuracy of the result, (ii) using secure
multiparty computation, which requires significant communication among the
computing nodes or with the client, (iii) relying on homomorphic encryption
methods, which significantly increases computation load. In this paper, we
propose an alternative approach to protect the privacy of user data. The
proposed scheme relies on a cluster of servers where at most $T$ of them for
some integer $T$, may collude, that each running a deep neural network. Each
server is fed with the client data, added with a $\textit{strong}$ noise. This
makes the information leakage to each server information-theoretically
negligible. On the other hand, the added noises for different servers are
$\textit{correlated}$. This correlation among queries allows the system to be
$\textit{trained}$ such that the client can recover the final result with high
accuracy, by combining the outputs of the servers, with minor computation
efforts. Simulation results for various datasets demonstrate the accuracy of
the proposed approach.

Title: Learning to Correct Overexposed and Underexposed Photos
Authors: Mahmoud Afifi, Konstantinos G. Derpanis, Bj\"orn Ommer, Michael S.

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Capturing photographs with wrong exposures remains a major source of errors
in camera-based imaging. Exposure problems are categorized as either: (i)
overexposed, where the camera exposure was too long, resulting in bright and
washed-out image regions, or (ii) underexposed, where the exposure was too
short, resulting in dark regions. Both under- and overexposure greatly reduce
the contrast and visual appeal of an image. Prior work mainly focuses on
underexposed images or general image enhancement. In contrast, our proposed
method targets both over- and underexposure errors in photographs. We formulate
the exposure correction problem as two main sub-problems: (i) color enhancement
and (ii) detail enhancement. Accordingly, we propose a coarse-to-fine deep
neural network (DNN) model, trainable in an end-to-end manner, that addresses
each sub-problem separately. A key aspect of our solution is a new dataset of
over 24,000 images exhibiting a range of exposure values with a corresponding
properly exposed image. Our method achieves results on par with existing
state-of-the-art methods on underexposed images and yields significant
improvements for images suffering from overexposure errors.

Title: Covid-19: Automatic detection from X-Ray images utilizing Transfer
  Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Ioannis D. Apostolopoulos, Tzani Bessiana
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG physics.med-ph
\\
  In this study, a dataset of X-Ray images from patients with common pneumonia,
Covid-19, and normal incidents was utilized for the automatic detection of the
Coronavirus. The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architectures proposed over
recent years for medical image classification. Specifically, the procedure
called transfer learning was adopted. With transfer learning, the detection of
various abnormalities in small medical image datasets is an achievable target,
often yielding remarkable results. The dataset utilized in this experiment is a
collection of 1427 X-Ray images. 224 images with confirmed Covid-19, 700 images
with confirmed common pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions are
included. The data was collected from the available X-Ray images on public
medical repositories. With transfer learning, an overall accuracy of 97.82% in
the detection of Covid-19 is achieved.

Title: Weakly-supervised 3D coronary artery reconstruction from two-view
  angiographic images

\\
  The reconstruction of three-dimensional models of coronary arteries is of
great significance for the localization, evaluation and diagnosis of stenosis
and plaque in the arteries, as well as for the assisted navigation of
interventional surgery. In the clinical practice, physicians use a few angles
of coronary angiography to capture arterial images, so it is of great practical
value to perform 3D reconstruction directly from coronary angiography images.
However, this is a very difficult computer vision task due to the complex shape
of coronary blood vessels, as well as the lack of data set and key point
labeling. With the rise of deep learning, more and more work is being done to
reconstruct 3D models of human organs from medical images using deep neural
networks. We propose an adversarial and generative way to reconstruct three
dimensional coronary artery models, from two different views of angiographic
images of coronary arteries. With 3D fully supervised learning and 2D weakly
supervised learning schemes, we obtained reconstruction accuracies that
outperform state-of-art techniques.

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Coronary angiography is an indispensable assistive technique for cardiac
interventional surgery. Segmentation and extraction of blood vessels from
coronary angiography videos are very essential prerequisites for physicians to
locate, assess and diagnose the plaques and stenosis in blood vessels. This
article proposes a new video segmentation framework that can extract the
clearest and most comprehensive coronary angiography images from a video
sequence, thereby helping physicians to better observe the condition of blood
vessels. This framework combines a 3D convolutional layer to extract
spatial--temporal information from a video sequence and a 2D CE--Net to
accomplish the segmentation task of an image sequence. The input is a few
continuous frames of angiographic video, and the output is a mask of
segmentation result. From the results of segmentation and extraction, we can
get good segmentation results despite the poor quality of coronary angiography
video sequences.

  The brain exhibits capabilities of fast incremental learning from few noisy
examples, as well as the ability to associate similar memories in
autonomously-created categories and to combine contextual hints with sensory
perceptions. Together with sleep, these mechanisms are thought to be key
components of many high-level cognitive functions. Yet, little is known about
the underlying processes and the specific roles of different brain states. In
this work, we exploited the combination of context and perception in a
thalamo-cortical model based on a soft winner-take-all circuit of excitatory
and inhibitory spiking neurons. After calibrating this model to express awake
and deep-sleep states with features comparable with biological measures, we
demonstrate the model capability of fast incremental learning from few
examples, its resilience when proposed with noisy perceptions and contextual
signals, and an improvement in visual classification after sleep due to induced
synaptic homeostasis and association of similar memories.

Authors: Noga Alon

MSC-class: 05C35, 05C50
\\
  An $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph is a $d$ regular graph on $n$ vertices in which the
absolute value of any nontrivial eigenvalue is at most $\lambda$. For any
constant $d \geq 3$, $\epsilon>0$ and all sufficiently large $n$ we show that
there is a deterministic poly(n) time algorithm that outputs an $(n,d,
\lambda)$-graph (on exactly $n$ vertices) with $\lambda \leq 2
\sqrt{d-1}+\epsilon$. For any $d=p+2$ with $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$ prime and all
sufficiently large $n$, we describe a strongly explicit construction of an
$(n,d, \lambda)$-graph (on exactly $n$ vertices) with $\lambda \leq \sqrt
{2(d-1)} + \sqrt{d-2} +o(1) (< (1+\sqrt 2) \sqrt {d-1}+o(1))$, with the $o(1)$
term tending to $0$ as $n$ tends to infinity. For every $\epsilon >0$,
$d>d_0(\epsilon)$ and $n>n_0(d,\epsilon)$ we present a strongly explicit
construction of an $(m,d,\lambda)$-graph with $\lambda < (2+\epsilon) \sqrt d$
and $m=n+o(n)$. All constructions are obtained by starting with known ones of
Ramanujan or nearly Ramanujan graphs, modifying or packing them in an
appropriate way. The spectral analysis relies on the delocalization of
eigenvectors of regular graphs in cycle-free neighborhoods.

  Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma is a very useful tool of extremal combinatorics.
Recently, several refinements of this seminal result were obtained for special,

combinatorial context. In particular, we stress the link to the theory of
(structural) sparsity, which leads to alternative proofs, refinements and
solutions of open problems. It is interesting to note that many of these
classes present challenging problems. Nevertheless, from the point of view of
regularity lemma type statements, they appear as "gentle" classes.

  The need for solving optimization problems is prevalent in a wide range of
physical applications, including neuroscience, network design, biological
systems, socio-economics, and chemical reactions. Many of these are classified
as non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard and thus become intractable to
solve as the system scales to a large number of elements. Recent research
advances in photonics have sparked interest in using a network of coupled
degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPO's) to effectively find the
ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian, which can be used to solve other
combinatorial optimization problems through polynomial-time mapping. Here,
using the nanophotonic silicon-nitride platform, we propose a network of
on-chip spatial-multiplexed DOPO's for the realization of a photonic coherent
Ising machine. We demonstrate the generation and coupling of two
microresonator-based DOPO's on a single chip. Through a reconfigurable phase
link, we achieve both in-phase and out-of-phase operation, which can be
deterministically achieved at a fast regeneration speed of 400 kHz with a large
phase tolerance. Our work provides the critical building blocks towards the
realization of a chip-scale photonic Ising machine.

Title: Redesigning Photonic Interconnects with Silicon-on-Sapphire Device
  Platform for Ultra-Low-Energy On-Chip Communication
Authors: Venkata Sai Praneeth Karempudi, Sairam Sri Vatsavai, Ishan Thakkar
Categories: physics.app-ph cs.ET
Comments: Submitted and Accepted at GLSVLSI 2020
\\
  Traditional silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform based on-chip photonic
interconnects have limited energy-bandwidth scalability due to the optical
non-linearity induced power constraints of the constituent photonic devices. In
this paper, we propose to break this scalability barrier using a new
silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) based photonic device platform. Our physical-layer
characterization results show that SOS-based photonic devices have negligible
optical non-linearity effects in the mid-infrared region near 4{\mu}m, which
drastically alleviates their power constraints. Our link-level analysis shows
that SOS-based photonic devices can be used to realize photonic links with
aggregated data rate of more than 1 Tb/s, which recently has been deemed
unattainable for the SOI-based photonic on-chip links. We also show that such
high-throughput SOS-based photonic links can significantly improve the
energy-efficiency of on-chip photonic communication architectures. Our
system-level analysis results position SOS-based photonic interconnects to pave
the way for realizing ultra-low-energy (< 1 pJ/bit) on-chip data transfers.

Title: Multi-Lead ECG Classification via an Information-Based Attention
  Convolutional Neural Network
Authors: Hao Tung, Chao Zheng, Xinsheng Mao, and Dahong Qian
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML
\\
  Objective: A novel structure based on channel-wise attention mechanism is
presented in this paper. Embedding with the proposed structure, an efficient
classification model that accepts multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as input
is constructed. Methods: One-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN)
have proven to be effective in pervasive classification tasks, enabling the
automatic extraction of features while classifying targets. We implement the
Residual connection and design a structure which can learn the weights from the
information contained in different channels in the input feature map during the
training process. An indicator named mean square deviation is introduced to
monitor the performance of a particular model segment in the classification
task on the two out of the five ECG classes. The data in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia
database is used and a series of control experiments is conducted. Results:
Utilizing both leads of the ECG signals as input to the neural network
classifier can achieve better classification results than those from using
single channel inputs in different application scenarios. Models embedded with
the channel-wise attention structure always achieve better scores on
sensitivity and precision than the plain Resnet models. The proposed model
exceeds the performance of most of the state-of-the-art models in ventricular
ectopic beats (VEB) classification, and achieves competitive scores for
supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB). Conclusion: Adopting more lead ECG
signals as input can increase the dimensions of the input feature maps, helping
to improve both the performance and generalization of the network model.
Significance: Due to its end-to-end characteristics, and the extensible
intrinsic for multi-lead heart diseases diagnosing, the proposed model can be
used for the real-time ECG tracking of ECG waveforms for Holter or wearable
devices.

Title: Nonconvex sparse regularization for deep neural networks and its
  optimality
Authors: Ilsang Ohn, Yongdai Kim
Categories: math.ST cs.LG stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  Recent theoretical studies proved that deep neural network (DNN) estimators
obtained by minimizing empirical risk with a certain sparsity constraint can
attain optimal convergence rates for regression and classification problems.
However, the sparsity constraint requires to know certain properties of the
true model, which are not available in practice. Moreover, computation is
difficult due to the discrete nature of the sparsity constraint. In this paper,
we propose a novel penalized estimation method for sparse DNNs, which resolves
the aforementioned problems existing in the sparsity constraint. We establish
an oracle inequality for the excess risk of the proposed sparse-penalized DNN
estimator and derive convergence rates for several learning tasks. In
particular, we prove that the sparse-penalized estimator can adaptively attain
minimax convergence rates for various nonparametric regression problems. For
computation, we develop an efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm that
guarantees the monotonic reduction of the objective function.

Categories: cond-mat.quant-gas cs.LG quant-ph
\\
  In this work we present a general machine learning based scheme to optimize
experimental control. The method utilizes the neural network to learn the
relation between the control parameters and the control goal, with which the
optimal control parameters can be obtained. The main challenge of this approach
is that the labeled data obtained from experiments are not abundant. The
central idea of our scheme is to use the active learning to overcome this
difficulty. As a demonstration example, we apply our method to control
evaporative cooling experiments in cold atoms. We have first tested our method
with simulated data and then applied our method to real experiments. We
demonstrate that our method can successfully reach the best performance within
hundreds of experimental runs. Our method does not require knowledge of the
experimental system as a prior and is universal for experimental control in
different systems.

Title: Analysis of Greenhouse Gases
Authors: Shalin Shah
Categories: physics.ao-ph cs.LG
\\
  Climate change is a result of a complex system of interactions of greenhouse
gases (GHG), the ocean, land, ice, and clouds. Large climate change models use
several computers and solve several equations to predict the future climate.
The equations may include simple polynomials to partial differential equations.
Because of the uptake mechanism of the land and ocean, greenhouse gas emissions
can take a while to affect the climate. The IPCC has published reports on how
greenhouse gas emissions may affect the average temperature of the troposphere
and the predictions show that by the end of the century, we can expect a
temperature increase from 0:8 C to 5 C. In this article, I use Linear
Regression (LM), Quadratic Regression and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) on
monthly GHG data going back several years and try to predict the temperature
anomalies based on counterfactuals. The results are quite similar to the IPCC
reports.

Title: Time series and machine learning to forecast the water quality from
  satellite data
Authors: Maryam R. Al Shehhi and Abdullah Kaya
Categories: physics.ao-ph cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Managing the quality of water for present and future generations of coastal
regions should be a central concern of both citizens and public officials.
Remote sensing can contribute to the management and monitoring of coastal water
and pollutants. Algal blooms are a coastal pollutant that is a cause of
concern. Many satellite data, such as MODIS, have been used to generate
water-quality products to detect the blooms such as chlorophyll a (Chl-a), a
photosynthesis index called fluorescence line height (FLH), and sea surface
temperature (SST). It is important to characterize the spatial and temporal
variations of these water quality products by using the mathematical models of
these products. However, for monitoring, pollution control boards will need
nowcasts and forecasts of any pollution. Therefore, we aim to predict the
future values of the MODIS Chl-a, FLH, and SST of the water. This will not be
limited to one type of water but, rather, will cover different types of water
varying in depth and turbidity. This is very significant because the temporal
trend of Chl-a, FLH, and SST is dependent on the geospatial and water
properties. For this purpose, we will decompose the time series of each pixel
into several components: trend, intra-annual variations, seasonal cycle, and
stochastic stationary. We explore three such time series machine learning
models that can characterize the non-stationary time series data and predict
future values, including the Seasonal ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving
Average) (SARIMA), regression, and neural network. The results indicate that
all these methods are effective at modelling Chl-a, FLH, and SST time series
and predicting the values reasonably well. However, regression and neural
network are found to be the best at predicting Chl-a in all types of water
(turbid and shallow). Meanwhile, the SARIMA model provides the best prediction
of FLH and SST.

Title: Improving data-driven global weather prediction using deep convolutional
  neural networks on a cubed sphere
Authors: Jonathan A. Weyn, Dale R. Durran, Rich Caruana
Categories: physics.ao-ph cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Manuscript submitted to Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems
\\
  We present a significantly-improved data-driven global weather forecasting
framework using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to forecast several
basic atmospheric variables on a global grid. New developments in this
framework include an offline volume-conservative mapping to a cubed-sphere
grid, improvements to the CNN architecture, and the minimization of the loss
function over multiple steps in a prediction sequence. The cubed-sphere
remapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution
operations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding
in the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely
stable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks
and longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly
outperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical
numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are
worse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP
system. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface
temperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time
scales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the
prescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing. Although it is
currently less accurate than operational weather forecasting models, our
data-driven CNN executes much faster than those models, suggesting that machine
learning could prove to be a valuable tool for large-ensemble forecasting.

\\
  Industrial applications frequently pose a notorious challenge for
state-of-the-art methods in the contexts of optimization, designing experiments
and modeling unknown physical response. This problem is aggravated by limited
availability of clean data, uncertainty in available physics-based models and
additional logistic and computational expense associated with experiments. In
such a scenario, Bayesian methods have played an impactful role in alleviating
the aforementioned obstacles by quantifying uncertainty of different types
under limited resources. These methods, usually deployed as a framework, allows
decision makers to make informed choices under uncertainty while being able to
incorporate information on the the fly, usually in the form of data, from
multiple sources while being consistent with the physical intuition about the
problem. This is a major advantage that Bayesian methods bring to fruition
especially in the industrial context. This paper is a compendium of the
Bayesian modeling methodology that is being consistently developed at GE
Research. The methodology, called GE's Bayesian Hybrid Modeling (GEBHM), is a
probabilistic modeling method, based on the Kennedy and O'Hagan framework, that
has been continuously scaled-up and industrialized over several years. In this
work, we explain the various advancements in GEBHM's methods and demonstrate
their impact on several challenging industrial problems.

Title: Quantum Semantic Learning by Reverse Annealing an Adiabatic Quantum
  Computer
Authors: Lorenzo Rocutto, Claudio Destri, Enrico Prati
Categories: quant-ph cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Boltzmann Machines constitute a class of neural networks with applications to
image reconstruction, pattern classification and unsupervised learning in
general. Their most common variants, called Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs) exhibit a good trade-off between computability on existing silicon-based
hardware and generality of possible applications.
  Still, the diffusion of RBMs is quite limited, since their training process
proves to be hard. The advent of commercial Adiabatic Quantum Computers (AQCs)
raised the expectation that the implementations of RBMs on such quantum devices
could increase the training speed with respect to conventional hardware. To
date, however, the implementation of RBM networks on AQCs has been limited by
the low qubit connectivity when each qubit acts as a node of the neural
network.
  Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a complete RBM on AQCs, thanks to an
embedding that associates its nodes to virtual qubits, thus outperforming
previous implementations based on incomplete graphs.
  Moreover, to accelerate the learning, we implement a semantic quantum search
which, contrary to previous proposals, takes the input data as initial boundary
conditions to start each learning step of the RBM, thanks to a reverse
annealing schedule. Such an approach, unlike the more conventional forward
annealing schedule, allows sampling configurations in a meaningful neighborhood
of the training data, mimicking the behavior of the classical Gibbs sampling
algorithm.
  We show that the learning based on reverse annealing quickly raises the
sampling probability of a meaningful subset of the set of the configurations.
Even without a proper optimization of the annealing schedule, the RBM
semantically trained by reverse annealing achieves better scores on
reconstruction tasks.

Title: Estimating Treatment Effects with Observed Confounders and Mediators
Authors: Shantanu Gupta, Zachary C. Lipton, David Childers
Categories: stat.ME cs.LG econ.EM stat.ML
\\
  Given a causal graph, the do-calculus can express treatment effects as
functionals of the observational joint distribution that can be estimated
empirically. Sometimes the do-calculus identifies multiple valid formulae,
prompting us to compare the statistical properties of the corresponding
estimators. For example, the backdoor formula applies when all confounders are
observed and the frontdoor formula applies when an observed mediator transmits
the causal effect. In this paper, we investigate the over-identified scenario
where both confounders and mediators are observed, rendering both estimators
valid. Addressing the linear Gaussian causal model, we derive the finite-sample
variance for both estimators and demonstrate that either estimator can dominate
the other by an unbounded constant factor depending on the model parameters.
Next, we derive an optimal estimator, which leverages all observed variables to
strictly outperform the backdoor and frontdoor estimators. We also present a
procedure for combining two datasets, with confounders observed in one and
mediators in the other. Finally, we evaluate our methods on both simulated data
and the IHDP and JTPA datasets.

Title: Adaptive machine learning strategies for network calibration of IoT
  smart air quality monitoring devices

\\
  Air Quality Multi-sensors Systems (AQMS) are IoT devices based on low cost
chemical microsensors array that recently have showed capable to provide
relatively accurate air pollutant quantitative estimations. Their availability
permits to deploy pervasive Air Quality Monitoring (AQM) networks that will
solve the geographical sparseness issue that affect the current network of AQ
Regulatory Monitoring Systems (AQRMS). Unfortunately their accuracy have shown
limited in long term field deployments due to negative influence of several
technological issues including sensors poisoning or ageing, non target gas
interference, lack of fabrication repeatability, etc. Seasonal changes in
probability distribution of priors, observables and hidden context variables
(i.e. non observable interferents) challenge field data driven calibration
models which short to mid term performances recently rose to the attention of
Urban authorithies and monitoring agencies. In this work, we address this non
stationary framework with adaptive learning strategies in order to prolong the
validity of multisensors calibration models enabling continuous learning.
Relevant parameters influence in different network and note-to-node
recalibration scenario is analyzed. Results are hence useful for pervasive
deployment aimed to permanent high resolution AQ mapping in urban scenarios as
well as for the use of AQMS as AQRMS backup systems providing data when AQRMS
data are unavailable due to faults or scheduled mainteinance.

Title: From unbiased MDI Feature Importance to Explainable AI for Trees
Authors: Markus Loecher
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.02106
\\
  We attempt to give a unifying view of the various recent attempts to (i)
improve the interpretability of tree-based models and (ii) debias the the
default variable-importance measure in random Forests, Gini importance. In
particular, we demonstrate a common thread among the out-of-bag based bias
correction methods and their connection to local explanation for trees. In
addition, we point out a bias caused by the inclusion of inbag data in the
newly developed explainable AI for trees algorithms.

Title: Is the Juice Worth the Squeeze? Machine Learning (ML) In and For
  Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)
Authors: Johannes Dahlke, Kristina Bogner, Matthias Mueller, Thomas Berger,
  Andreas Pyka and Bernd Ebersberger
Categories: econ.TH cs.MA
Comments: 25 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, discussion paper
\\
  In recent years, many scholars praised the seemingly endless possibilities of
using machine learning (ML) techniques in and for agent-based simulation models
(ABM). To get a more comprehensive understanding of these possibilities, we
conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) and classify the literature on the
application of ML in and for ABM according to a theoretically derived
classification scheme. We do so to investigate how exactly machine learning has
been utilized in and for agent-based models so far and to critically discuss
the combination of these two promising methods. We find that, indeed, there is
a broad range of possible applications of ML to support and complement ABMs in
many different ways, already applied in many different disciplines. We see
that, so far, ML is mainly used in ABM for two broad cases: First, the
modelling of adaptive agents equipped with experience learning and, second, the
analysis of outcomes produced by a given ABM. While these are the most
frequent, there also exist a variety of many more interesting applications.
This being the case, researchers should dive deeper into the analysis of when
and how which kinds of ML techniques can support ABM, e.g. by conducting a more
in-depth analysis and comparison of different use cases. Nonetheless, as the
application of ML in and for ABM comes at certain costs, researchers should not
use ML for ABMs just for the sake of doing it.

Title: On the geometry of discrete contact mechanics

Categories: math-ph cs.NA math.MP math.NA
MSC-class: Primary 34C25, Secondary 37E40, 70K40
\\
  In this paper, we continue the construction of variational integrators
adapted to contact geometry started in \cite{VBS}, in particular, we introduce
a discrete Herglotz Principle and the corresponding discrete Herglotz Equations
for a discrete Lagrangian in the contact setting. This allows us to develop
convenient numerical integrators for contact Lagrangian systems that are
conformally contact by construction. The existence of an exact Lagrangian
function is also discussed.

Title: Robust Least Squares for Quantized Data
Authors: Richard Clancy and Stephen Becker
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables
MSC-class: 65K05, 90C99
\\
  In this paper we formulate and solve a robust least squares problem for a
system of linear equations subject to quantization error. Ordinary least
squares fails to consider uncertainty in the data matrices, modeling all noise
in the observed signal. Total least squares accounts for uncertainty in the
data matrix, but necessarily increases the condition number of the system
compared to ordinary least squares. Tikhonov regularization or ridge
regression, is frequently employed to combat ill-conditioning, but requires
heuristic parameter tuning which presents a host of challenges and places
strong assumptions on parameter prior distributions. The proposed method also
requires selection of a parameter, but it can be chosen in a natural way, e.g.,
a matrix rounded to the 4th digit uses an uncertainty bounding parameter of
0.5e-4. We show here that our robust method is theoretically appropriate,
tractable, and performs favorably against ordinary and total least squares for
both residual and absolute error reduction.

Title: Non-parallel Voice Conversion System with WaveNet Vocoder and Collapsed
  Speech Suppression
Authors: Yi-Chiao Wu, Patrick Lumban Tobing, Kazuhiro Kobayashi, Tomoki
  Hayashi, and Tomoki Toda
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: 13 pages, 13 figures, 1 table, accepted to publish in IEEE Access
\\
  In this paper, we integrate a simple non-parallel voice conversion (VC)
system with a WaveNet (WN) vocoder and a proposed collapsed speech suppression
technique. The effectiveness of WN as a vocoder for generating high-fidelity
speech waveforms on the basis of acoustic features has been confirmed in recent
works. However, when combining the WN vocoder with a VC system, the distorted
acoustic features, acoustic and temporal mismatches, and exposure bias usually
lead to significant speech quality degradation, making WN generate some very
noisy speech segments called collapsed speech. To tackle the problem, we take
conventional-vocoder-generated speech as the reference speech to derive a
linear predictive coding distribution constraint (LPCDC) to avoid the collapsed
speech problem. Furthermore, to mitigate the negative effects introduced by the
LPCDC, we propose a collapsed speech segment detector (CSSD) to ensure that the
LPCDC is only applied to the problematic segments to limit the loss of quality
to short periods. Objective and subjective evaluations are conducted, and the
experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, which
further improves the speech quality of our previous non-parallel VC system
submitted to Voice Conversion Challenge 2018.

Title: Speech Quality Factors for Traditional and Neural-Based Low Bit Rate
  Vocoders
Authors: Wissam A. Jassim, Jan Skoglund, Michael Chinen, Andrew Hines
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: 6 pages, 11 figures, conference
\\
  This study compares the performances of different algorithms for coding
speech at low bit rates. In addition to widely deployed traditional vocoders, a
selection of recently developed generative-model-based coders at different bit
rates are contrasted. Performance analysis of the coded speech is evaluated for
different quality aspects: accuracy of pitch periods estimation, the word error
rates for automatic speech recognition, and the influence of speaker gender and
coding delays. A number of performance metrics of speech samples taken from a
publicly available database were compared with subjective scores. Results from
subjective quality assessment do not correlate well with existing full
reference speech quality metrics. The results provide valuable insights into
aspects of the speech signal that will be used to develop a novel metric to
accurately predict speech quality from generative-model-based coders.

\\
  The objective of this paper is 'open-set' speaker recognition of unseen
speakers, where ideal embeddings should be able to condense information into a
compact utterance-level representation that has small intra-class (same
speaker) and large inter-class (different speakers) distance.
  A popular belief in speaker recognition is that networks trained with
classification objectives outperform metric learning methods. In this paper, we
present an extensive evaluation of most recent loss functions for speaker
recognition on the VoxCeleb dataset. We demonstrate that even the vanilla
triplet loss shows competitive performance compared to classification-based
losses, and those trained with our angular metric learning objective outperform
state-of-the-art methods.
