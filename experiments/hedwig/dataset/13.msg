Title: On Consequentialism and Fairness
Authors: Dallas Card and Noah A. Smith
Categories: cs.AI cs.CY cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Recent work on fairness in machine learning has primarily emphasized how to
define, quantify, and encourage "fair" outcomes. Less attention has been paid,
however, to the ethical foundations which underlie such efforts. Among the
ethical perspectives that should be taken into consideration is
consequentialism, the position that, roughly speaking, outcomes are all that
matter. Although consequentialism is not free from difficulties, and although
it does not necessarily provide a tractable way of choosing actions (because of
the combined problems of uncertainty, subjectivity, and aggregation), it
nevertheless provides a powerful foundation from which to critique the existing
literature on machine learning fairness. Moreover, it brings to the fore some
of the tradeoffs involved, including the problem of who counts, the pros and
cons of using a policy, and the relative value of the distant future. In this
paper we provide a consequentialist critique of common definitions of fairness
within machine learning, as well as a machine learning perspective on
consequentialism. We conclude with a broader discussion of the issues of
learning and randomization, which have important implications for the ethics of
automated decision making systems.

  To reflect the evolving knowledge on the Web this paper considers ontologies
based on folksonomies according to a new concept structure called
"Folksodriven" to represent folksonomies. This paper describes a research
program for studying Folksodriven tags interactions leading to Folksodriven
cluster behavior. The goal of the research is to understand the type of simple
local interactions which produce complex and purposive group behaviors on
Folksodriven tags. We describe a synthetic, bottom-up approach to studying
group behavior, consisting of designing and testing a variety of social
interactions and cultural scenarios with Folksodriven tags. We propose a set of
basic interactions which can be used to structure and simplify the process of
both designing and analyzing emergent group behaviors. The presented behavior
repertories was developed and tested on a folksonomy environment.

Title: Coarse-Grained Complexity for Dynamic Algorithms
Authors: Sayan Bhattacharya, Danupon Nanongkai, Thatchaphol Saranurak
Categories: cs.CC cs.DS
Comments: To be published at SODA 2020. The abstract is truncated
\\
  To date, the only way to argue polynomial lower bounds for dynamic algorithms
is via fine-grained complexity arguments. These arguments rely on strong
assumptions about specific problems such as the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis (SETH) and the Online Matrix-Vector Multiplication Conjecture (OMv).
While they have led to many exciting discoveries, dynamic algorithms still miss
out some benefits and lessons from the traditional ``coarse-grained'' approach
that relates together classes of problems such as P and NP. In this paper we
initiate the study of coarse-grained complexity theory for dynamic algorithms.
Below are among questions that this theory can answer.
  What if dynamic Orthogonal Vector (OV) is easy in the cell-probe model? A
research program for proving polynomial unconditional lower bounds for dynamic
OV in the cell-probe model is motivated by the fact that many conditional lower
bounds can be shown via reductions from the dynamic OV problem. Since the
cell-probe model is more powerful than word RAM and has historically allowed
smaller upper bounds, it might turn out that dynamic OV is easy in the
cell-probe model, making this research direction infeasible. Our theory implies
that if this is the case, there will be very interesting algorithmic
consequences: If dynamic OV can be maintained in polylogarithmic worst-case
update time in the cell-probe model, then so are several important dynamic
problems such as $k$-edge connectivity, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate mincut,
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate matching, planar nearest neighbors, Chan's subset
union and 3-vs-4 diameter. The same conclusion can be made when we replace
dynamic OV by, e.g., subgraph connectivity, single source reachability, Chan's
subset union, and 3-vs-4 diameter.
  Lower bounds for $k$-edge connectivity via dynamic OV? (see the full abstract
in the pdf file).

Title: Algorithmic Number On the Forehead Protocols Yielding Dense
  Ruzsa-Szemer\'{e}di Graphs and Hypergraphs
Authors: Noga Alon and Adi Shraibman
Categories: cs.CC math.CO
\\
  We describe algorithmic Number On the Forehead protocols that provide dense
Ruzsa-Szemer\'{e}di graphs. One protocol leads to a simple and natural
extension of the original construction of Ruzsa and Szemer\'{e}di. The graphs
induced by this protocol have $n$ vertices, $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$ edges, and are
decomposable into $n^{1+O(1/\log \log n)}$ induced matchings. Another protocol
is an explicit (and slightly simpler) version of the construction of Alon,
Moitra and Sudakov, producing graphs with similar properties. We also
generalize the above protocols to more than three players, in order to
construct dense uniform hypergraphs in which every edge lies in a positive
small number of simplices.

Title: Learning Numeral Embeddings
Authors: Chengyue Jiang, Zhonglin Nian, Kaihao Guo, Shanbo Chu, Yinggong Zhao,
  Libin Shen, Haofen Wang, Kewei Tu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Word embedding is an essential building block for deep learning methods for
natural language processing. Although word embedding has been extensively
studied over the years, the problem of how to effectively embed numerals, a
special subset of words, is still underexplored. Existing word embedding
methods do not learn numeral embeddings well because there are an infinite
number of numerals and their individual appearances in training corpora are
highly scarce. In this paper, we propose two novel numeral embedding methods
that can handle the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem for numerals. We first
induce a finite set of prototype numerals using either a self-organizing map or
a Gaussian mixture model. We then represent the embedding of a numeral as a
weighted average of the prototype number embeddings. Numeral embeddings
represented in this manner can be plugged into existing word embedding learning
approaches such as skip-gram for training. We evaluated our methods and showed
its effectiveness on four intrinsic and extrinsic tasks: word similarity,
embedding numeracy, numeral prediction, and sequence label

Title: Deep Reinforced Self-Attention Masks for Abstractive Summarization
  (DR.SAS)
Authors: Ankit Chadha and Mohamed Masoud
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  We present a novel architectural scheme to tackle the abstractive
summarization problem based on the CNN/DMdataset which fuses Reinforcement
Learning (RL) withUniLM, which is a pre-trained Deep Learning Model, to solve
various natural language tasks. We have tested the limits of learning
fine-grained attention in Transformers to improve the summarization quality.
UniLM applies attention to the entire token space in a global fashion. We
propose DR.SAS which applies the Actor-Critic (AC) algorithm to learn a dynamic
self-attention distribution over the tokens to reduce redundancy and generate
factual and coherent summaries to improve the quality of summarization. After
performing hyperparameter tuning, we achievedbetter ROUGE results compared to
the baseline. Our model tends to be more extractive/factual yet coherent in
detail because of optimization over ROUGE rewards. We present detailed error
analysis with examples of the strengths and limitations of our model. Our
codebase will be publicly available on our GitHub.

Title: Simultaneous Identification of Tweet Purpose and Position
Authors: Rahul Radhakrishnan Iyer, Yulong Pei, Katia Sycara
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Tweet classification has attracted considerable attention recently. Most of
the existing work on tweet classification focuses on topic classification,
which classifies tweets into several predefined categories, and sentiment
classification, which classifies tweets into positive, negative and neutral.
Since tweets are different from conventional text in that they generally are of
limited length and contain informal, irregular or new words, so it is difficult
to determine user intention to publish a tweet and user attitude towards
certain topic. In this paper, we aim to simultaneously classify tweet purpose,
i.e., the intention for user to publish a tweet, and position, i.e.,
supporting, opposing or being neutral to a given topic. By transforming this
problem to a multi-label classification problem, a multi-label classification
method with post-processing is proposed. Experiments on real-world data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and the results outperform the
individual classification methods.

Title: Deep Attentive Ranking Networks for Learning to Order Sentences
Authors: Pawan Kumar, Dhanajit Brahma, Harish Karnick, Piyush Rai
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted in AAAI 2020
\\
  We present an attention-based ranking framework for learning to order
sentences given a paragraph. Our framework is built on a bidirectional sentence
encoder and a self-attention based transformer network to obtain an input order
invariant representation of paragraphs. Moreover, it allows seamless training
using a variety of ranking based loss functions, such as pointwise, pairwise,
and listwise ranking. We apply our framework on two tasks: Sentence Ordering
and Order Discrimination. Our framework outperforms various state-of-the-art
methods on these tasks on a variety of evaluation metrics. We also show that it
achieves better results when using pairwise and listwise ranking losses, rather
than the pointwise ranking loss, which suggests that incorporating relative
positions of two or more sentences in the loss function contributes to better
learning.

Title: Building chatbots from large scale domain-specific knowledge bases:
  challenges and opportunities
Authors: Walid Shalaby, Adriano Arantes, Teresa GonzalezDiaz, Chetan Gupta
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Popular conversational agents frameworks such as Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) and
Google Actions (gActions) offer unprecedented opportunities for facilitating
the development and deployment of voice-enabled AI solutions in various
verticals. Nevertheless, understanding user utterances with high accuracy
remains a challenging task with these frameworks. Particularly, when building
chatbots with large volume of domain-specific entities. In this paper, we
describe the challenges and lessons learned from building a large scale virtual
assistant for understanding and responding to equipment-related complaints. In
the process, we describe an alternative scalable framework for: 1) extracting
the knowledge about equipment components and their associated problem entities
from short texts, and 2) learning to identify such entities in user utterances.
We show through evaluation on a real dataset that the proposed framework,
compared to off-the-shelf popular ones, scales better with large volume of
entities being up to 30% more accurate, and is more effective in understanding
user utterances with domain-specific entities.

Title: Stacked DeBERT: All Attention in Incomplete Data for Text Classification
Authors: Gwenaelle Cunha Sergio and Minho Lee
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  In this paper, we propose Stacked DeBERT, short for Stacked Denoising
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. This novel model
improves robustness in incomplete data, when compared to existing systems, by
designing a novel encoding scheme in BERT, a powerful language representation
model solely based on attention mechanisms. Incomplete data in natural language
processing refer to text with missing or incorrect words, and its presence can
hinder the performance of current models that were not implemented to withstand
such noises, but must still perform well even under duress. This is due to the
fact that current approaches are built for and trained with clean and complete
data, and thus are not able to extract features that can adequately represent
incomplete data. Our proposed approach consists of obtaining intermediate input
representations by applying an embedding layer to the input tokens followed by
vanilla transformers. These intermediate features are given as input to novel
denoising transformers which are responsible for obtaining richer input
representations. The proposed approach takes advantage of stacks of multilayer
perceptrons for the reconstruction of missing words' embeddings by extracting
more abstract and meaningful hidden feature vectors, and bidirectional
transformers for improved embedding representation. We consider two datasets
for training and evaluation: the Chatbot Natural Language Understanding
Evaluation Corpus and Kaggle's Twitter Sentiment Corpus. Our model shows
improved F1-scores and better robustness in informal/incorrect texts present in
tweets and in texts with Speech-to-Text error in the sentiment and intent
classification tasks.

Title: Chemical-induced Disease Relation Extraction with Dependency Information
  and Prior Knowledge
Authors: Huiwei Zhou, Shixian Ning, Yunlong Yang, Zhuang Liu, Chengkun Lang,
  Yingyu Lin
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Published on Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 13 pages

DOI: 10.1016/j.jbi.2018.07.007
\\
  Chemical-disease relation (CDR) extraction is significantly important to
various areas of biomedical research and health care. Nowadays, many
large-scale biomedical knowledge bases (KBs) containing triples about entity
pairs and their relations have been built. KBs are important resources for
biomedical relation extraction. However, previous research pays little
attention to prior knowledge. In addition, the dependency tree contains
important syntactic and semantic information, which helps to improve relation
extraction. So how to effectively use it is also worth studying. In this paper,
we propose a novel convolutional attention network (CAN) for CDR extraction.
Firstly, we extract the shortest dependency path (SDP) between chemical and
disease pairs in a sentence, which includes a sequence of words, dependency
directions, and dependency relation tags. Then the convolution operations are
performed on the SDP to produce deep semantic dependency features. After that,
an attention mechanism is employed to learn the importance/weight of each
semantic dependency vector related to knowledge representations learned from
KBs. Finally, in order to combine dependency information and prior knowledge,
the concatenation of weighted semantic dependency representations and knowledge
representations is fed to the softmax layer for classification. Experiments on
the BioCreative V CDR dataset show that our method achieves comparable
performance with the state-of-the-art systems, and both dependency information
and prior knowledge play important roles in CDR extraction task.

Categories: cs.CR cs.SE
Comments: 27th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution
  and Reengineering (SANER). London, Ontario, Canada, February 18-21, 2020
\\
  Web communication has become an indispensable characteristic of mobile apps.
However, it is not clear what data the apps transmit, to whom, and what
consequences such transmissions have. We analyzed the web communications found
in mobile apps from the perspective of security. We first manually studied 160
Android apps to identify the commonly-used communication libraries, and to
understand how they are used in these apps. We then developed a tool to
statically identify web API URLs used in the apps, and restore the JSON data
schemas including the type and value of each parameter. We extracted 9,714
distinct web API URLs that were used in 3,376 apps. We found that developers
often use the java.net package for network communication, however, third-party
libraries like OkHttp are also used in many apps. We discovered that insecure
HTTP connections are seven times more prevalent in closed-source than in
open-source apps, and that embedded SQL and JavaScript code is used in web
communication in more than 500 different apps. This finding is devastating; it
leaves billions of users and API service providers vulnerable to attack.

Title: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility: Utilizing Privacy
  Technology for the Greater Bad
Authors: Sarah Cline and Jacob Aronoff
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  As people across the world become increasingly aware of how their privacy is
compromised in this digital era, the field of Privacy Enhancing Technologies,
or PETs, has boomed. The first workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technology was in
2000, then called the "Workshop on Design Issues in Anonymity and
Unobservability." By 2007, the workshop had ballooned into a full symposium. In
2015, the first issue of the Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies
journal was published. This year in 2019, there were 4 volumes of Proceedings
on Privacy Enhancing Technologies published, containing a total of 66 papers.
Of these papers, we identified 14 which specifically describe PETs that have
been newly developed or utilized in a new way. We focused on 3 papers that
seemed to have widespread use cases. Some of these use cases, however, include
criminal activity. While heavily focused on adversarial actions and capability,
much of security research does not focus on or consider the social science and
motivations behind bad actors. We believe that this is a critical factor to
consider when working on the problem of cybercrime. In this paper, we will
analyze some of the cutting edge PETs and the potential risks associated with
them from the lenses of computer science and criminal justice. We argue that
the continued development of privacy enhancing technology contributes to the
global rise of cybercrime.

Title: Reparo: Publicly Verifiable Layer to Repair Blockchains
Authors: Sri Aravinda Krishnan Thyagarajan, Adithya Bhat, Bernardo Magri,
  Daniel Tschudi and Aniket Kate
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Although blockchains aim for immutability as their core feature, several
instances have exposed the harms with perfect immutability. The permanence of
illicit content inserted in Bitcoin poses a challenge to law enforcement
agencies like Interpol, and millions of dollars are lost in buggy smart
contracts in Ethereum. A line of research then spawned on Redactable
blockchains with the aim of solving the problem of redacting illicit contents
from both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. However, all the
existing proposals follow the build-new-chain approach for redactions, and
cannot be integrated with existing systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
  We present Reparo, a generic protocol that acts as a publicly verifiable
layer on top of any blockchain to perform repairs, ranging from fixing buggy
contracts to removing illicit contents from the chain. Reparo facilitates
additional functionalities for blockchains while maintaining the same provable
security guarantee; thus, Reparo can be integrated with existing blockchains
and start performing repairs on the pre-existent data. Any system user may
propose a repair and a deliberation process ensues resulting in a decision that
complies with the repair policy of the chain and is publicly verifiable.
  Our Reparo layer can be easily tailored to different consensus requirements,
does not require heavy cryptographic machinery and can, therefore, be
efficiently instantiated in any permission-ed or -less setting. We demonstrate
it by giving efficient instantiations of Reparo on top of Ethereum (with PoS
and PoW), Bitcoin, and Cardano. Moreover, we evaluate Reparo with Ethereum
mainnet and show that the cost of fixing several prominent smart contract bugs
is almost negligible. For instance, the cost of repairing the prominent Parity
Multisig wallet bug with Reparo is as low as 0.000000018% of the Ethers that
can be retrieved after the fix.

Title: Privacy for Rescue: A New Testimony Why Privacy is Vulnerable In Deep
  Models
Authors: Ruiyuan Gao, Ming Dun, Hailong Yang, Zhongzhi Luan, Depei Qian
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  The huge computation demand of deep learning models and limited computation
resources on the edge devices calls for the cooperation between edge device and
cloud service by splitting the deep models into two halves. However,
transferring the intermediates results from the partial models between edge
device and cloud service makes the user privacy vulnerable since the attacker
can intercept the intermediate results and extract privacy information from
them. Existing research works rely on metrics that are either impractical or
insufficient to measure the effectiveness of privacy protection methods in the
above scenario, especially from the aspect of a single user. In this paper, we
first present a formal definition of the privacy protection problem in the
edge-cloud system running DNN models. Then, we analyze the-state-of-the-art
methods and point out the drawbacks of their methods, especially the evaluation
metrics such as the Mutual Information (MI). In addition, we perform several
experiments to demonstrate that although existing methods perform well under
MI, they are not effective enough to protect the privacy of a single user. To
address the drawbacks of the evaluation metrics, we propose two new metrics
that are more accurate to measure the effectiveness of privacy protection
methods. Finally, we highlight several potential research directions to
encourage future efforts addressing the privacy protection problem.

  The control of the cryptography is more than ever a recurrent issue. As the
current international regulation does not apply in the signatory countries, the
concept of enforcing backdoors in encryption system is reborn with more
strength. This paper deals with a particular class of stream cipher backdoors.
This class, under a different form, has been widely used by the industry in the
80s and 90s in the context of the export control rules imposed by the US to the
Western countries. We propose here a new system -- called BSEA-2, with a
128-bit secret key -- which is a seemingly minor modification of BSEA-1, a
system proposed in \cite{filiol_bsea1}. BSEA-2 illustrates, in a simple and
didactic~\textemdash~it has been also designed for a MSc cryptanalysis
course~\textemdash~but efficient way the concept of key-dependent cryptographic
security. The aim is to keep control on encryption means that a
country/provider could provide to another country/client for which the secret

Title: Schemes for Privacy Data Destruction in a NAND Flash Memory
Authors: Na-Young Ahn, Dong Hoon Lee
Categories: cs.CR cs.SY eess.SP eess.SY
Comments: Pages 181305 - 181313
\\
  We propose schemes for efficiently destroying privacy data in a NAND flash
memory. Generally, even if privcy data is discarded from NAND flash memories,
there is a high probability that the data will remain in an invalid block. This
is a management problem that arises from the specificity of a program operation
and an erase operation of NAND flash memories. When updating pages or
performing a garbage collection, there is a problem that valid data remains in
at least one unmapped memory block. Is it possible to apply the obligation to
delete privacy data from existing NAND flash memory? This paper is the answer
to this question. We propose a partial overwriting scheme, a SLC programming
scheme, and a deletion duty pulse application scheme for invalid pages to
effectively solve privacy data destruction issues due to the remaining data.
Such privacy data destruction schemes basically utilize at least one state in
which data can be written to the programmed cells based on a multi-level cell
program operation. Our privacy data destruction schemes have advantages in
terms of block management as compared with conventional erase schemes, and are
very economical in terms of time and cost. The proposed privacy data
destruction schemes can be easily applied to many storage devices and data
centers using NAND flash memories.

Title: HMM-guided frame querying for bandwidth-constrained video search
Authors: Bhairav Chidambaram, Mason McGill, Pietro Perona
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 4 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We design an agent to search for frames of interest in video stored on a
remote server, under bandwidth constraints. Using a convolutional neural
network to score individual frames and a hidden Markov model to propagate
predictions across frames, our agent accurately identifies temporal regions of
interest based on sparse, strategically sampled frames. On a subset of the
ImageNet-VID dataset, we demonstrate that using a hidden Markov model to
interpolate between frame scores allows requests of 98% of frames to be
omitted, without compromising frame-of-interest classification accuracy.

Title: Erase and Restore: Simple, Accurate and Resilient Detection of $L_2$
  Adversarial Examples
Authors: Fei Zuo, Qiang Zeng
Categories: cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  By adding carefully crafted perturbations to input images, adversarial
examples (AEs) can be generated to mislead neural-network-based image
classifiers. $L_2$ adversarial perturbations by Carlini and Wagner (CW) are
regarded as among the most effective attacks. While many countermeasures
against AEs have been proposed, detection of adaptive CW $L_2$ AEs has been
very inaccurate. Our observation is that those deliberately altered pixels in
an $L_2$ AE, altogether, exert their malicious influence. By randomly erasing
some pixels from an $L_2$ AE and then restoring it with an inpainting
technique, such an AE, before and after the steps, tends to have different
classification results, while a benign sample does not show this symptom. Based
on this, we propose a novel AE detection technique, Erase and Restore (E\&R),
that exploits the limitation of $L_2$ attacks. On two popular image datasets,
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, our experiments show that the proposed technique is able
to detect over 98% of the AEs generated by CW and other $L_2$ algorithms and
has a very low false positive rate on benign images. Moreover, our approach
demonstrate strong resilience to adaptive attacks. While adding noises and
inpainting each have been well studied, by combining them together, we deliver
a simple, accurate and resilient detection technique against adaptive $L_2$
AEs.

Title: Handwritten Optical Character Recognition (OCR): A Comprehensive
  Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
Authors: Jamshed Memon, Maira Sami, Rizwan Ahmed Khan
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Given the ubiquity of handwritten documents in human transactions, Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) of documents have invaluable practical worth.
Optical character recognition is a science that enables to translate various
types of documents or images into analyzable, editable and searchable data.
During last decade, researchers have used artificial intelligence / machine
learning tools to automatically analyze handwritten and printed documents in
order to convert them into electronic format. The objective of this review
paper is to summarize research that has been conducted on character recognition
of handwritten documents and to provide research directions. In this Systematic
Literature Review (SLR) we collected, synthesized and analyzed research
articles on the topic of handwritten OCR (and closely related topics) which
were published between year 2000 to 2018. We followed widely used electronic
databases by following pre-defined review protocol. Articles were searched
using keywords, forward reference searching and backward reference searching in
order to search all the articles related to the topic. After carefully
following study selection process 142 articles were selected for this SLR. This
review article serves the purpose of presenting state of the art results and
techniques on OCR and also provide research directions by highlighting research
gaps.

Title: DeepFakes and Beyond: A Survey of Face Manipulation and Fake Detection
Authors: Ruben Tolosana, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez, Julian Fierrez, Aythami Morales,
  Javier Ortega-Garcia
Categories: cs.CV cs.MM
\\
  The free access to large-scale public databases, together with the fast
progress of deep learning techniques, in particular Generative Adversarial
Networks, have led to the generation of very realistic fake contents with its
corresponding implications towards society in this era of fake news. This
survey provides a thorough review of techniques for manipulating face images
including DeepFake methods, and methods to detect such manipulations. In
particular, four types of facial manipulation are reviewed: i) entire face
synthesis, ii) face identity swap (DeepFakes), iii) facial attributes
manipulation, and iv) facial expression manipulation. For each manipulation
type, we provide details regarding manipulation techniques, existing public
databases, and key benchmarks for technology evaluation of fake detection
methods, including a summary of results from those evaluations. Among the
different databases available and discussed in the survey, FaceForensics++ is
for example one of the most widely used for detecting both face identity swap
and facial expression manipulations, with results in the literature in the
range of 90-100% of manipulation detection accuracy.
  In addition to the survey information, we also discuss trends and provide an
outlook of the ongoing work in this field, e.g., the recently announced
DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC).

Title: A Coarse-to-Fine Adaptive Network for Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation
Authors: Yihua Cheng, Shiyao Huang, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, Feng Lu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 9 pages, 7figures, AAAI-20
\\
  Human gaze is essential for various appealing applications. Aiming at more
accurate gaze estimation, a series of recent works propose to utilize face and
eye images simultaneously. Nevertheless, face and eye images only serve as
independent or parallel feature sources in those works, the intrinsic
correlation between their features is overlooked. In this paper we make the
following contributions: 1) We propose a coarse-to-fine strategy which
estimates a basic gaze direction from face image and refines it with
corresponding residual predicted from eye images. 2) Guided by the proposed
strategy, we design a framework which introduces a bi-gram model to bridge gaze
residual and basic gaze direction, and an attention component to adaptively
acquire suitable fine-grained feature. 3) Integrating the above innovations, we
construct a coarse-to-fine adaptive network named CA-Net and achieve
state-of-the-art performances on MPIIGaze and EyeDiap.

Title: Multi-organ Segmentation over Partially Labeled Datasets with
  Multi-scale Feature Abstraction
Authors: Xi Fang, Pingkun Yan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper presents a unified training strategy that enables a novel
multi-scale deep neural network to be trained on multiple partially labeled
datasets for multi-organ segmentation. Multi-scale contextual information is
effective for pixel-level label prediction, i.e. image segmentation. However,
such important information is only partially exploited by the existing methods.
In this paper, we propose a new network architecture for multi-scale feature
abstraction, which integrates pyramid feature analysis into an image
segmentation model. To bridge the semantic gap caused by directly merging
features from different scales, an equal convolutional depth mechanism is
proposed. In addition, we develop a deep supervision mechanism for refining
outputs in different scales. To fully leverage the segmentation features from
different scales, we design an adaptive weighting layer to fuse the outputs in
an automatic fashion. All these features together integrate into a
pyramid-input pyramid-output network for efficient feature extraction. Last but
not least, to alleviate the hunger for fully annotated data in training deep
segmentation models, a unified training strategy is proposed to train one
segmentation model on multiple partially labeled datasets for multi-organ
segmentation with a novel target adaptive loss. Our proposed method was
evaluated on four publicly available datasets, including BTCV, LiTS, KiTS and
Spleen, where very promising performance has been achieved. The source code of
this work is publicly shared at https://github.com/DIAL-RPI/PIPO-FAN for others

mechanisms.

  Autonomous driving is becoming one of the leading industrial research areas.
Therefore many automobile companies are coming up with semi to fully autonomous
driving solutions. Among these solutions, lane detection is one of the vital
driver-assist features that play a crucial role in the decision-making process
of the autonomous vehicle. A variety of solutions have been proposed to detect
lanes on the road, which ranges from using hand-crafted features to the
state-of-the-art end-to-end trainable deep learning architectures. Most of
these architectures are trained in a traffic constrained environment. In this
paper, we propose a novel solution to multi-lane detection, which outperforms
state of the art methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. To achieve this,
we also offer a dataset with a more intuitive labeling scheme as compared to
other benchmark datasets. Using our approach, we are able to obtain a lane
segmentation accuracy of 99.87% running at 54.53 fps (average).

Title: Low-Budget Unsupervised Label Query through Domain Alignment Enforcement
Authors: Jurandy Almeida, Cristiano Saltori, Paolo Rota, and Nicu Sebe
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep learning revolution happened thanks to the availability of a massive
amount of labelled data which have contributed to the development of models
with extraordinary inference capabilities. Despite the public availability of a
large quantity of datasets, it is often necessary to generate a new set of
labelled data to address specific requirements. In addition, the production of
labels is costly and sometimes it requires a specific expertise to be
fulfilled. In this work, we introduce a new problem called low budget
unsupervised label query that consists in a model trained to suggests to the
user a set of samples to be labelled, from a completely unlabelled dataset, to
maximize the classification accuracy on that dataset. We propose to adopt a
domain alignment model, modified to enforce consistency, to align a known
dataset (source) and the dataset to be labelled (target). Finally, we propose a
novel sample selection method based on uniform entropy sampling, named UNFOLD,
which is deterministic and steadily outperforms other baselines as well as
competing models on a large variety of publicly available datasets.

Title: ZeroQ: A Novel Zero Shot Quantization Framework
Authors: Yaohui Cai, Zhewei Yao, Zhen Dong, Amir Gholami, Michael W. Mahoney,
  Kurt Keutzer
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Quantization is a promising approach for reducing the inference time and
memory footprint of neural networks. However, most existing quantization
methods require access to the original training dataset for retraining during
quantization. This is often not possible for applications with sensitive or
proprietary data, e.g., due to privacy and security concerns. Existing
zero-shot quantization methods use different heuristics to address this, but
they result in poor performance, especially when quantizing to ultra-low
precision. Here, we propose ZeroQ , a novel zero-shot quantization framework to
address this. ZeroQ enables mixed-precision quantization without any access to
the training or validation data. This is achieved by optimizing for a Distilled
Dataset, which is engineered to match the statistics of batch normalization
across different layers of the network. ZeroQ supports both uniform and
mixed-precision quantization. For the latter, we introduce a novel Pareto
frontier based method to automatically determine the mixed-precision bit
setting for all layers, with no manual search involved. We extensively test our
proposed method on a diverse set of models, including ResNet18/50/152,
MobileNetV2, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNext, and InceptionV3 on ImageNet, as well as
RetinaNet-ResNet50 on the Microsoft COCO dataset. In particular, we show that
ZeroQ can achieve 1.71\% higher accuracy on MobileNetV2, as compared to the
recently proposed DFQ method. Importantly, ZeroQ has a very low computational
overhead, and it can finish the entire quantization process in less than 30s
(0.5\% of one epoch training time of ResNet50 on ImageNet). We have
open-sourced the ZeroQ
framework\footnote{https://github.com/amirgholami/ZeroQ}.

Title: Video Saliency Prediction Using Enhanced Spatiotemporal Alignment
  Network
Authors: Jin Chen, Huihui Song, Kaihua Zhang, Bo Liu, Qingshan Liu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Due to a variety of motions across different frames, it is highly challenging
to learn an effective spatiotemporal representation for accurate video saliency
prediction (VSP). To address this issue, we develop an effective spatiotemporal
feature alignment network tailored to VSP, mainly including two key
sub-networks: a multi-scale deformable convolutional alignment network (MDAN)
and a bidirectional convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-ConvLSTM) network.
The MDAN learns to align the features of the neighboring frames to the
reference one in a coarse-to-fine manner, which can well handle various
motions. Specifically, the MDAN owns a pyramidal feature hierarchy structure
that first leverages deformable convolution (Dconv) to align the
lower-resolution features across frames, and then aggregates the aligned
features to align the higher-resolution features, progressively enhancing the
features from top to bottom. The output of MDAN is then fed into the
Bi-ConvLSTM for further enhancement, which captures the useful long-time
temporal information along forward and backward timing directions to
effectively guide attention orientation shift prediction under complex scene
transformation. Finally, the enhanced features are decoded to generate the
predicted saliency map. The proposed model is trained end-to-end without any
intricate post processing. Extensive evaluations on four VSP benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves favorable performance against
state-of-the-art methods. The source codes and all the results will be
released.

Title: Video Cloze Procedure for Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Learning
Authors: Dezhao Luo, Chang Liu, Yu Zhou, Dongbao Yang, Can Ma, Qixiang Ye,
  Weiping Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: AAAI2020(Oral)
\\
  We propose a novel self-supervised method, referred to as Video Cloze
Procedure (VCP), to learn rich spatial-temporal representations. VCP first
generates "blanks" by withholding video clips and then creates "options" by
applying spatio-temporal operations on the withheld clips. Finally, it fills
the blanks with "options" and learns representations by predicting the
categories of operations applied on the clips. VCP can act as either a proxy
task or a target task in self-supervised learning. As a proxy task, it converts
rich self-supervised representations into video clip operations (options),
which enhances the flexibility and reduces the complexity of representation
learning. As a target task, it can assess learned representation models in a
uniform and interpretable manner. With VCP, we train spatial-temporal
representation models (3D-CNNs) and apply such models on action recognition and
video retrieval tasks. Experiments on commonly used benchmarks show that the
trained models outperform the state-of-the-art self-supervised models with
significant margins.

Title: BlendMask: Top-Down Meets Bottom-Up for Instance Segmentation
Authors: Hao Chen, Kunyang Sun, Zhi Tian, Chunhua Shen, Yongming Huang,
  Youliang Yan
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages
\\
  Instance segmentation is one of the fundamental vision tasks. Recently, fully
convolutional instance segmentation methods have drawn much attention as they
are often simpler and more efficient than two-stage approaches like Mask R-CNN.
To date, almost all such approaches fall behind the two-stage Mask R-CNN method
in mask precision when models have similar computation complexity, leaving
great room for improvement.
  In this work, we achieve improved mask prediction by effectively combining
instance-level information with semantic information with lower-level
fine-granularity. Our main contribution is a blender module which draws
inspiration from both top-down and bottom-up instance segmentation approaches.
The proposed BlendMask can effectively predict dense per-pixel
position-sensitive instance features with very few channels, and learn
attention maps for each instance with merely one convolution layer, thus being
fast in inference. BlendMask can be easily incorporated with the
state-of-the-art one-stage detection frameworks and outperforms Mask R-CNN
under the same training schedule while being 20% faster. A light-weight version
of BlendMask achieves $ 34.2% $ mAP at 25 FPS evaluated on a single 1080Ti GPU
card. Because of its simplicity and efficacy, we hope that our BlendMask could
serve as a simple yet strong baseline for a wide range of instance-wise
prediction tasks.

  Neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved breakthrough success in a great
number of applications in the past few years. It could be time to take a step
back and analyze the good and bad aspects in the field of NAS. A variety of
algorithms search architectures under different search space. These searched
architectures are trained using different setups, e.g., hyper-parameters, data
augmentation, regularization. This raises a comparability problem when
comparing the performance of various NAS algorithms. NAS-Bench-101 has shown
success to alleviate this problem. In this work, we propose an extension to
NAS-Bench-101: NAS-Bench-102 with a different search space, results on multiple
datasets, and more diagnostic information. NAS-Bench-102 has a fixed search
space and provides a unified benchmark for almost any up-to-date NAS
algorithms. The design of our search space is inspired from the one used in the
most popular cell-based searching algorithms, where a cell is represented as a
DAG. Each edge here is associated with an operation selected from a predefined
operation set. For it to be applicable for all NAS algorithms, the search space
defined in NAS-Bench-102 includes all possible architectures generated by 4
nodes and 5 associated operation options, which results in 15,625 candidates in
total. The training log and the performance for each architecture candidate are
provided for three datasets. This allows researchers to avoid unnecessary
repetitive training for selected candidate and focus solely on the search
algorithm itself. The training time saved for every candidate also largely
improves the efficiency of many methods. We provide additional diagnostic
information such as fine-grained loss and accuracy, which can give inspirations
to new designs of NAS algorithms. In further support, we have analyzed it from
many aspects and benchmarked 10 recent NAS algorithms.

\\
  Semantic segmentation with deep learning has achieved great progress in
classifying the pixels in the image. However, the local location information is
usually ignored in the high-level feature extraction by the deep learning,
which is important for image semantic segmentation. To avoid this problem, we
propose a graph model initialized by a fully convolutional network (FCN) named
Graph-FCN for image semantic segmentation. Firstly, the image grid data is
extended to graph structure data by a convolutional network, which transforms
the semantic segmentation problem into a graph node classification problem.
Then we apply graph convolutional network to solve this graph node
classification problem. As far as we know, it is the first time that we apply
the graph convolutional network in image semantic segmentation. Our method
achieves competitive performance in mean intersection over union (mIOU) on the
VOC dataset(about 1.34% improvement), compared to the original FCN model.

Title: First image then video: A two-stage network for spatiotemporal video
  denoising
Authors: Ce Wang, S. Kevin Zhou, Zhiwei Cheng
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Video denoising is to remove noise from noise-corrupted data, thus recovering
true signals via spatiotemporal processing. Existing approaches for
spatiotemporal video denoising tend to suffer from motion blur artifacts, that
is, the boundary of a moving object tends to appear blurry especially when the
object undergoes a fast motion, causing optical flow calculation to break down.
In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a first-image-then-video
two-stage denoising neural network, consisting of an image denoising module for
spatially reducing intra-frame noise followed by a regular spatiotemporal video
denoising module. The intuition is simple yet powerful and effective: the first
stage of image denoising effectively reduces the noise level and, therefore,
allows the second stage of spatiotemporal denoising for better modeling and
learning everywhere, including along the moving object boundaries. This
two-stage network, when trained in an end-to-end fashion, yields the
state-of-the-art performances on the video denoising benchmark Vimeo90K dataset
in terms of both denoising quality and computation. It also enables an
unsupervised approach that achieves comparable performance to existing
supervised approaches.

identification of insects is complex and arduous. How to apply artificial
intelligence technology and digital image processing methods to automatic
identification of insect species is a hot issue in current research. In this
paper, the problem of automatic detection and classification recognition of

butterfly classification is proposed. On the basis of YOLO algorithm, by
synthesizing the results of YOLO models with different training mechanisms, a
butterfly automatic detection and classification recognition algorithm based on
YOLO algorithm is proposed. It greatly improves the generalization ability of
YOLO algorithm and makes it have better ability to solve small sample problems.
The experimental results show that the proposed annotation method and
integrated YOLO algorithm have high accuracy and recognition rate in butterfly
automatic detection and recognition.

  In this paper, we present preliminary results on the use of deep learning
techniques to integrate the users self-body and other participants into a
head-mounted video see-through augmented virtuality scenario. It has been
previously shown that seeing users bodies in such simulations may improve the
feeling of both self and social presence in the virtual environment, as well as
user performance. We propose to use a convolutional neural network for real
time semantic segmentation of users bodies in the stereoscopic RGB video
streams acquired from the perspective of the user. We describe design issues as
well as implementation details of the system and demonstrate the feasibility of
using such neural networks for merging users bodies in an augmented virtuality
simulation.

Title: Lightweight Residual Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Network
Authors: Fahimeh Fooladgar and Shohreh Kasaei
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Extremely efficient convolutional neural network architectures are one of the
most important requirements for limited computing power devices (such as
embedded and mobile devices). Recently, some architectures have been proposed
to overcome this limitation by considering specific hardware-software
equipment. In this paper, the residual densely connected blocks are proposed to
guaranty the deep supervision, efficient gradient flow, and feature reuse
abilities of convolutional neural network. The proposed method decreases the
cost of training and inference processes without using any special
hardware-software equipment by just reducing the number of parameters and
computational operations while achieving a feasible accuracy. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is more
efficient than the AlexNet and VGGNet in terms of model size, required
parameters, and even accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated on the ImageNet,
MNIST, Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. It achieves
state-of-the-art results on the Fashion MNIST dataset and reasonable results on
the others. The obtained results show that the proposed model is superior to
efficient models such as the SqueezNet and is also comparable with the
state-of-the-art efficient models such as CondenseNet and ShuffleNet.

Title: PrivacyNet: Semi-Adversarial Networks for Multi-attribute Face Privacy
Authors: Vahid Mirjalili, Sebastian Raschka, Arun Ross
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 13 pages, 9 figures
\\
  In recent years, the utilization of biometric information has become more and
more common for various forms of identity verification and user authentication.
However, as a consequence of the widespread use and storage of biometric
information, concerns regarding sensitive information leakage and the
protection of users' privacy have been raised. Recent research efforts targeted
these concerns by proposing the Semi-Adversarial Networks (SAN) framework for
imparting gender privacy to face images. The objective of SAN is to perturb
face image data such that it cannot be reliably used by a gender classifier but
can still be used by a face matcher for matching purposes. In this work, we
propose a novel Generative Adversarial Networks-based SAN model, PrivacyNet,
that is capable of imparting selective soft biometric privacy to multiple
soft-biometric attributes such as gender, age, and race. While PrivacyNet is
capable of perturbing different sources of soft biometric information reliably
and simultaneously, it also allows users to choose to obfuscate specific
attributes, while preserving others. The results from extensive experiments on
five independent face image databases demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
model in imparting selective multi-attribute privacy to face images.

Title: Learning from Learning Machines: Optimisation, Rules, and Social Norms
Authors: Travis LaCroix and Yoshua Bengio
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  There is an analogy between machine learning systems and economic entities in
that they are both adaptive, and their behaviour is specified in a more-or-less
explicit way. It appears that the area of AI that is most analogous to the
behaviour of economic entities is that of morally good decision-making, but it
is an open question as to how precisely moral behaviour can be achieved in an
AI system. This paper explores the analogy between these two complex systems,
and we suggest that a clearer understanding of this apparent analogy may help
us forward in both the socio-economic domain and the AI domain: known results
in economics may help inform feasible solutions in AI safety, but also known
results in AI may inform economic policy. If this claim is correct, then the
recent successes of deep learning for AI suggest that more implicit
specifications work better than explicit ones for solving such problems.

Title: User Acceptance of Usable Blockchain-Based Research Data Sharing System:
  An Extended TAM Based Study
Authors: Ajay Kumar Shrestha and Julita Vassileva
Categories: cs.CY cs.CR cs.GT
Comments: To appear in IEEE TPS 2019
\\
  Blockchain technology has evolved as a promising means to transform data
management models in many domains including healthcare, agricultural research,
tourism domains etc. In the research community, a usable blockchain-based
system can allow users to create a proof of ownership and provenance of the
research work, share research data without losing control and ownership of it,
provide incentives for sharing and give users full transparency and control
over who access their data, when and for what purpose. The initial adoption of
such blockchain-based systems is necessary for continued use of the services,
but their user acceptance behavioral model has not been well investigated in
the literature. In this paper, we take the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as
a foundation and extend the external constructs to uncover how the perceived
ease of use, perceived usability, quality of the system and perceived enjoyment
influence the intention to use the blockchain-based system. We based our study
on user evaluation of a prototype of a blockchain-based research data sharing
framework using a TAM validated questionnaire. Our results show that, overall,
all the individual constructs of the behavior model significantly influence the
intention to use the system while their collective effect is found to be
insignificant. The quality of the system and the perceived enjoyment have
stronger influence on the perceived usefulness. However, the effect of
perceived ease of use on the perceived usefulness is not supported. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our findings.

  As the influence and use of artificial intelligence (AI) have grown and its
transformative potential has become more apparent, many questions have been
raised regarding the economic, political, and social implications of its use.
Public opinion plays an important role in these discussions, influencing
product adoption, commercial development, research funding, and regulation. In
this paper we present results of a survey of public opinion of artificial
intelligence conducted with 10,005 respondents spanning eight countries and six
continents. We report widespread perception that AI will have significant
impact on society, and highlight public optimism about applications for
healthcare as well as public concerns about privacy and job loss. We also
identify four key sentiments (exciting, useful, worrying, and futuristic) whose
prevalence distinguishes response to AI in different countries.

\\
  The ISO 26262 is currently the dominant standard for assuring functional
safety of electrical and electronic systems in the automotive industry. The
Functional Safety Concept (FSC) subphase in the standard requires the
Preliminary Architectural Assumptions (PAA) for allocation of functional safety
requirements (FSRs). This paper justifies the need for, and defines a process
ATRIUM, for consistent design of the PAA. ATRIUM is subsequently applied in an
industrial case study for a function enabling highly automated driving at one
of the largest heavy vehicle manufacturers in Europe, Scania CV AB. The
findings from this study, which contributed to ATRIUM's institutionalization at
Scania, are presented. The benefits of the proposed process include (i) a fast
and flexible way to refine the PAA, and a framework to (ii) incorporate
information from legacy systems into safety design and (iii) rigorously track
and document the assumptions and rationale behind architectural decisions under
uncertain information. The contributions of this paper are the (i) analysis of
the problem (ii) the process ATRIUM and (iii) findings and the discussion from
the case study at Scania.

Comments: To appear, AI Magazine
\\
  With the maturing of AI and multiagent systems research, we have a tremendous
opportunity to direct these advances towards addressing complex societal
problems. In pursuit of this goal of AI for Social Impact, we as AI researchers
must go beyond improvements in computational methodology; it is important to
step out in the field to demonstrate social impact. To this end, we focus on
the problems of public safety and security, wildlife conservation, and public
health in low-resource communities, and present research advances in multiagent
systems to address one key cross-cutting challenge: how to effectively deploy
our limited intervention resources in these problem domains. We present case
studies from our deployments around the world as well as lessons learned that
we hope are of use to researchers who are interested in AI for Social Impact.
In pushing this research agenda, we believe AI can indeed play an important
role in fighting social injustice and improving society.

Title: Human Comprehension of Fairness in Machine Learning

Categories: cs.CY cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Bias in machine learning has manifested injustice in several areas, such as
medicine, hiring, and criminal justice. In response, computer scientists have
developed myriad definitions of fairness to correct this bias in fielded
algorithms. While some definitions are based on established legal and ethical
norms, others are largely mathematical. It is unclear whether the general
public agrees with these fairness definitions, and perhaps more importantly,
whether they understand these definitions. We take initial steps toward
bridging this gap between ML researchers and the public, by addressing the
question: does a non-technical audience understand a basic definition of ML
fairness? We develop a metric to measure comprehension of one such
definition--demographic parity. We validate this metric using online surveys,
and study the relationship between comprehension and sentiment, demographics,
and the application at hand.

  Cyberphysical systems (CPS) are ubiquitous in our personal and professional
lives, and they promise to dramatically improve micro-communities (e.g., urban
farms, hospitals), macro-communities (e.g., cities and metropolises), urban
structures (e.g., smart homes and cars), and living structures (e.g., human
bodies, synthetic genomes). The question that we address in this article
pertains to designing these CPS systems to be resilient-from-the-ground-up, and
through progressive learning, resilient-by-reaction. An optimally designed
system is resilient to both unique attacks and recurrent attacks, the latter
with a lower overhead. Overall, the notion of resilience can be thought of in
the light of three main sources of lack of resilience, as follows: exogenous
factors, such as natural variations and attack scenarios; mismatch between
engineered designs and exogenous factors ranging from DDoS (distributed
denial-of-service) attacks or other cybersecurity nightmares, so called "black
swan" events, disabling critical services of the municipal electrical grids and
other connected infrastructures, data breaches, and network failures; and the
fragility of engineered designs themselves encompassing bugs, human-computer
interactions (HCI), and the overall complexity of real-world systems. In the
paper, our focus is on design and deployment innovations that are broadly
applicable across a range of CPS application areas.

\\
  Undergraduate programs in science and engineering include at least one course
in basic programming, but seldom presented in a contextualized format, where
computing is a tool for thinking and learning in the discipline. We have
created a series of learning modules to embed computing in engineering
education, and share this content under permissive public licenses. The modules
are created as a set of lessons using Jupyter notebooks, and complemented by
online courses in the Open edX platform, using new integrations we developed.
Learning sequences in the online course pull content dynamically from public
Jupyter notebooks and assessments are auto-graded on-the-fly, using our Jupyter
Viewer and Jupyter Grader third-party extensions for Open edX (XBlocks). The
learning content is modularized and designed for reuse in various formats. In
one of these formats---short but intense workshops---our university library is
leveraging the curriculum to offer extra-curricular training for all, at high
demands.

Title: Cost of Dietary Data Acquisition with Smart Group Catering
Authors: Jiapeng Dong and Pengju Wang and Weiqiang Sun
Categories: cs.CY
Comments: Will be presented on the Computing Conference 2020, London, Jul. 2020
\\
  The need for dietary data management is growing with public awareness of food
intakes. As a result, there are increasing deployments of smart canteens where
dietary data is collected through either Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
or Computer Vision(CV)-based solutions. As human labor is involved in both
cases, manpower allocation is critical to data quality. Where manpower
requirements are underestimated, data quality is compromised. This paper has
studied the relation between the quality of dietary data and the manpower
invested, using numerical simulations based on real data collected from
multiple smart canteens. We found that in both RFID and CV-based systems, the
long-term cost of dietary data acquisition is dominated by manpower. Our study
provides a comprehensive understanding of the cost composition for dietary data
acquisition and useful insights toward future cost effective systems.

Title: The Offense-Defense Balance of Scientific Knowledge: Does Publishing AI
  Research Reduce Misuse?
Authors: Toby Shevlane, Allan Dafoe
Categories: cs.CY cs.AI
\\
  There is growing concern over the potential misuse of artificial intelligence
(AI) research. Publishing scientific research can facilitate misuse of the
technology, but the research can also contribute to protections against misuse.
This paper addresses the balance between these two effects. Our theoretical
framework elucidates the factors governing whether the published research will
be more useful for attackers or defenders, such as the possibility for adequate
defensive measures, or the independent discovery of the knowledge outside of
the scientific community. The balance will vary across scientific fields.
However, we show that the existing conversation within AI has imported concepts
and conclusions from prior debates within computer security over the disclosure
of software vulnerabilities. While disclosure of software vulnerabilities often
favours defence, this cannot be assumed for AI research. The AI research
community should consider concepts and policies from a broad set of adjacent
fields, and ultimately needs to craft policy well-suited to its particular
challenges.

Title: Complexity and Efficient Algorithms for Data Inconsistency Evaluating
  and Repairing
Authors: Dongjing Miao, Zhipeng Cai, Jianzhong Li, Xiangyu Gao, Xianmin Liu
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  Data inconsistency evaluating and repairing are major concerns in data
quality management. As the basic computing task, optimal subset repair is not
only applied for cost estimation during the progress of database repairing, but
also directly used to derive the evaluation of database inconsistency.
Computing an optimal subset repair is to find a minimum tuple set from an
inconsistent database whose remove results in a consistent subset left. Tight
bound on the complexity and efficient algorithms are still unknown. In this
paper, we improve the existing complexity and algorithmic results, together
with a fast estimation on the size of optimal subset repair. We first
strengthen the dichotomy for optimal subset repair computation problem, we show
that it is not only APXcomplete, but also NPhard to approximate an optimal
subset repair with a factor better than $17/16$ for most cases. We second show
a $(2-0.5^{\tiny\sigma-1})$-approximation whenever given $\sigma$ functional
dependencies, and a $(2-\eta_k+\frac{\eta_k}{k})$-approximation when an
$\eta_k$-portion of tuples have the $k$-quasi-Tur$\acute{\text{a}}$n property
for some $k>1$. We finally show a sublinear estimator on the size of optimal
\textit{S}-repair for subset queries, it outputs an estimation of a ratio
$2n+\epsilon n$ with a high probability, thus deriving an estimation of
FD-inconsistency degree of a ratio $2+\epsilon$. To support a variety of subset
queries for FD-inconsistency evaluation, we unify them as the
$\subseteq$-oracle which can answer membership-query, and return $p$ tuples
uniformly sampled whenever given a number $p$. Experiments are conducted on
range queries as an implementation of $\subseteq$-oracle, and results show the
efficiency of our FD-inconsistency degree estimator.

  In this paper we take the common position that AI systems are limited more by
the integrity of the data they are learning from than the sophistication of
their algorithms, and we take the uncommon position that the solution to
achieving better data integrity in the enterprise is not to clean and validate
data ex-post-facto whenever needed (the so-called data lake approach to data
management, which can lead to data scientists spending 80% of their time
cleaning data), but rather to formally and automatically guarantee that data
integrity is preserved as it transformed (migrated, integrated, composed,
queried, viewed, etc) throughout the enterprise, so that data and programs that
depend on that data need not constantly be re-validated for every particular
use.

\\
  Resource Description Framework (RDF) can seen as a solution in today's
landscape of knowledge representation research. An RDF language has symmetrical
features because subjects and objects in triples can be interchangeably used.
Moreover, the regularity and symmetry of the RDF language allow knowledge
representation that is easily processed by machines, and because its structure
is similar to natural languages, it is reasonably readable for people. RDF
provides some useful features for generalized knowledge representation. Its
distributed nature, due to its identifier grounding in IRIs, naturally scales
to the size of the Web. However, its use is often hidden from view and is,
therefore, one of the less well-known of the knowledge representation
frameworks. Therefore, we summarise RDF v1.0 and v1.1 to broaden its audience
within the knowledge representation community. This article reviews current
approaches, tools, and applications for mapping from relational databases to
RDF and from XML to RDF. We discuss RDF serializations, including formats with
support for multiple graphs and we analyze RDF compression proposals. Finally,
we present a summarized formal definition of RDF 1.1 that provides additional
insights into the modeling of reification, blank nodes, and entailments.

Title: AIR -- A Light-Weight Yet High-Performance Dataflow Engine based on
  Asynchronous Iterative Routing
Authors: Vinu E. Venugopal, Martin Theobald, Samira Chaychi and Amal Tawakuli

\\
  Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPSs) are among the currently most
emerging topics in data management, with applications ranging from real-time
event monitoring to processing complex dataflow programs and big data
analytics. The major market players in this domain are clearly represented by
Apache Spark and Flink, which provide a variety of frontend APIs for SQL,
statistical inference, machine learning, stream processing, and many others.
Yet rather few details are reported on the integration of these engines into
the underlying High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure and the
communication protocols they use. Spark and Flink, for example, are implemented
in Java and still rely on a dedicated master node for managing their control
flow among the worker nodes in a compute cluster.
  In this paper, we describe the architecture of our AIR engine, which is
designed from scratch in C++ using the Message Passing Interface (MPI),
pthreads for multithreading, and is directly deployed on top of a common HPC
workload manager such as SLURM. AIR implements a light-weight, dynamic sharding
protocol (referred to as "Asynchronous Iterative Routing"), which facilitates a
direct and asynchronous communication among all client nodes and thereby
completely avoids the overhead induced by the control flow with a master node
that may otherwise form a performance bottleneck. Our experiments over a
variety of benchmark settings confirm that AIR outperforms Spark and Flink in
terms of latency and throughput by a factor of up to 15; moreover, we
demonstrate that AIR scales out much better than existing DSPSs to clusters
consisting of up to 8 nodes and 224 cores.

Title: Ripple: A Practical Declarative Programming Framework for Serverless
  Compute
Authors: Shannon Joyner, Michael MacCoss, Christina Delimitrou, Hakim
  Weatherspoon
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Serverless computing has emerged as a promising alternative to
infrastructure- (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS)cloud platforms for
applications with ample parallelism and intermittent activity. Serverless
promises greater resource elasticity, significant cost savings, and simplified
application deployment. All major cloud providers, including Amazon, Google,
and Microsoft, have introduced serverless to their public cloud offerings. For
serverless to reach its potential, there is a pressing need for programming
frameworks that abstract the deployment complexity away from the user. This
includes simplifying the process of writing applications for serverless
environments, automating task and data partitioning, and handling scheduling
and fault tolerance.
  We present Ripple, a programming framework designed to specifically take
applications written for single-machine execution and allow them to take
advantage of the task parallelism of serverless. Ripple exposes a simple
interface that users can leverage to express the high-level dataflow of a wide
spectrum of applications, including machine learning (ML) analytics, genomics,
and proteomics. Ripple also automates resource provisioning, meeting
user-defined QoS targets, and handles fault tolerance by eagerly detecting
straggler tasks. We port Ripple over AWS Lambda and show that, across a set of
diverse applications, it provides an expressive and generalizable programming
framework that simplifies running data-parallel applications on serverless, and
can improve performance by up to 80x compared to IaaS/PaaS clouds for similar
costs.

Title: Using Nesting to Push the Limits of Transactional Data Structure
  Libraries
Authors: Gal Assa, Hagar Meir, Guy Golan-Gueta, Idit Keidar, Alexander
  Spiegelman
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Transactional data structure libraries (TDSL) combine the ease-of-programming
of transactions with the high performance and scalability of custom-tailored
concurrent data structures. They can be very efficient thanks to their ability
to exploit data structure semantics in order to reduce overhead, aborts, and
wasted work compared to general-purpose software transactional memory. However,
TDSLs were not previously used for complex use-cases involving long
transactions and a variety of data structures.
  In this paper, we boost the performance and usability of a TDSL, allowing it
to support complex applications. A key idea is nesting. Nested transactions
create checkpoints within a longer transaction, so as to limit the scope of
abort, without changing the semantics of the original transaction. We build a
Java TDSL with built-in support for nesting in a number of data structures. We
conduct a case study of a complex network intrusion detection system that
invests a significant amount of work to process each packet. Our study shows
that our library outperforms TL2 twofold without nesting, and by up to 16x when
nesting is used. Finally, we discuss cross-library nesting, namely dynamic
composition of transactions from multiple libraries.

Title: The Demise of Single-Authored Publications in Computer Science: A
  Citation Network Analysis
Authors: Brian K. Ryu
Categories: cs.DL cs.CY
Comments: 10 pages, 10 figures
\\
  In this study, I analyze the DBLP bibliographic database to study role of
single author publications in the computer science literature between 1940 and
2019. I examine the demographics and reception by computing the population
fraction, citation statistics, and PageRank scores of single author
publications over the years. Both the population fraction and reception have
been continuously declining since the 1940s. The overall decaying trend of
single author publications is qualitatively consistent with those observed in
other scientific disciplines, though the diminution is taking place several
decades later than those in the natural sciences. Additionally, I analyze the
scope and volume of single author publications, using page length and reference
count as first-order approximations of the scope of publications. Although both
metrics on average show positive correlations with citation count, single
author papers show no significant difference in page or reference counts
compared to the rest of the publications, suggesting that there exist other
factors that impact the citations of single author publications.

Title: Publishing computational research -- A review of infrastructures for

ACM-class: A.1; D.1; E.0; I.0
\\
  Funding agencies increasingly ask applicants to include data and software
management plans into proposals. In addition, the author guidelines of
scientific journals and conferences more often include a statement on data
availability, and some reviewers reject unreproducible submissions. This trend
towards open science increases the pressure on authors to provide access to the
source code and data underlying the computational results in their scientific
papers. Still, publishing reproducible articles is a demanding task and not
achieved simply by providing access to code scripts and data files.
Consequently, several projects develop solutions to support the publication of
executable analyses alongside articles considering the needs of the
aforementioned stakeholders. The key contribution of this paper is a review of
applications addressing the issue of publishing executable computational
research results. We compare the approaches across properties relevant for the
involved stakeholders, e.g., provided features and deployment options, and also
critically discuss trends and limitations. The review can support publishers to
decide which system to integrate into their submission process, editors to
recommend tools for researchers, and authors of scientific papers to adhere to
reproducibility principles.

Title: Multi-transversals for Triangles and the Tuza's Conjecture
Authors: Parinya Chalermsook, Samir Khuller, Pattara Sukprasert, Sumedha Uniyal
Categories: cs.DM cs.DS math.CO
Comments: Accepted at SODA'20
\\
  In this paper, we study a primal and dual relationship about triangles: For
any graph $G$, let $\nu(G)$ be the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles in
$G$, and $\tau(G)$ be the minimum subset $F$ of edges such that $G \setminus F$
is triangle-free. It is easy to see that $\nu(G) \leq \tau(G) \leq 3 \nu(G)$,
and in fact, this rather obvious inequality holds for a much more general
primal-dual relation between $k$-hyper matching and covering in hypergraphs.
Tuza conjectured in $1981$ that $\tau(G) \leq 2 \nu(G)$, and this question has
received attention from various groups of researchers in discrete mathematics,
settling various special cases such as planar graphs and generalized to bounded
maximum average degree graphs, some cases of minor-free graphs, and very dense
graphs. Despite these efforts, the conjecture in general graphs has remained
wide open for almost four decades.
  In this paper, we provide a proof of a non-trivial consequence of the
conjecture; that is, for every $k \geq 2$, there exist a (multi)-set $F
\subseteq E(G): |F| \leq 2k \nu(G)$ such that each triangle in $G$ overlaps at
least $k$ elements in $F$. Our result can be seen as a strengthened statement
of Krivelevich's result on the fractional version of Tuza's conjecture (and we
give some examples illustrating this.) The main technical ingredient of our
result is a charging argument, that locally identifies edges in $F$ based on a
local view of the packing solution. This idea might be useful in further
studying the primal-dual relations in general and the Tuza's conjecture in
particular.

Title: New Competitive Analysis Results of Online List Scheduling Algorithm
Authors: Rakesh Mohanty, Debasis Dwibedy, Shreeya Swagatika Sahoo
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 9 pages, In Proceeding of the 14th Annual ADMA Conference 2018, India
\\
  Online algorithm has been an emerging area of interest for researchers in
various domains of computer science. The online $m$-machine list scheduling
problem introduced by Graham has gained theoretical as well as practical
significance in the development of competitive analysis as a performance
measure for online algorithms. In this paper, we study and explore the
performance of Graham's online \textit{list scheduling algorithm(LSA)} for
independent jobs. In the literature, \textit{LSA} has already been proved to be
$2-\frac{1}{m}$ competitive, where $m$ is the number of machines. We present
two new upper bound results on competitive analysis of \textit{LSA}. We obtain
upper bounds on the competitive ratio of $2-\frac{2}{m}$ and
$2-\frac{m^2-m+1}{m^2}$ respectively for practically significant two special
classes of input job sequences. Our analytical results can motivate the
practitioners to design improved competitive online algorithms for the
$m$-machine list scheduling problem by characterization of real life input
sequences.

Title: Near-Optimal Schedules for Simultaneous Multicasts
Authors: Bernhard Haeupler, D Ellis Hershkowitz, David Wajc
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We study the store-and-forward packet routing problem for simultaneous
multicasts, in which multiple packets have to be forwarded along given trees as
fast as possible.
  This is a natural generalization of the seminal work of Leighton, Maggs and
Rao, which solved this problem for unicasts, i.e. the case where all trees are
paths. They showed the existence of asymptotically optimal $O(C + D)$-length
schedules, where the congestion $C$ is the maximum number of packets sent over
an edge and the dilation $D$ is the maximum depth of a tree. This improves over
the trivial $O(CD)$ length schedules.
  We prove a lower bound for multicasts, which shows that there do not always
exist schedules of non-trivial length, $o(CD)$. On the positive side, we
construct $O(C+D+\log^2 n)$-length schedules in any $n$-node network. These
schedules are near-optimal, since our lower bound shows that this length cannot
be improved to $O(C+D) + o(\log n)$.

Title: A polynomial-time partitioning algorithm for weighted cactus graphs
Authors: Maike Buchin and Leonie Selbach
Categories: cs.DS cs.CG
\\
  Partitioning problems where the goal is to partition a graph into connected
components are known to be NP-hard for some graph classes but polynomial-time
solvable for others. We consider different variants of the $(l,u)$-partition
problem: the $p$-$(l,u)$-partition problem and the minimum resp. maximum
$(l,u)$-partition problem. That is partitioning a graph into exactly $p$ or a
minimal resp. maximal number of clusters such that every cluster fulfills the
following weight condition: the weight of each cluster should to be at least
$l$ and at most $u$. These kind of partitioning problems are NP-hard for
series-parallel graphs but can be solved in polynomial time on trees. In this
paper we present partitioning algorithms for cactus graphs to show that these
partition problems are polynomial-time solvable for this graph class as well.

Title: Approximating Text-to-Pattern Hamming Distances
Authors: Timothy M. Chan, Shay Golan, Tomasz Kociumaka, Tsvi Kopelowitz, Ely
  Porat
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We revisit a fundamental problem in string matching: given a pattern of
length m and a text of length n, both over an alphabet of size $\sigma$,
compute the Hamming distance between the pattern and the text at every
location. Several $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms have been proposed in
the literature, with running time of the form $O(\epsilon^{-O(1)}n\log n\log
m)$, all using fast Fourier transform (FFT). We describe a simple
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that is faster and does not need FFT.
Combining our approach with additional ideas leads to numerous new results:
  - We obtain the first linear-time approximation algorithm; the running time
is $O(\epsilon^{-2}n)$.
  - We obtain a faster exact algorithm computing all Hamming distances up to a
given threshold k; its running time improves previous results by logarithmic
factors and is linear if $k\le\sqrt m$.
  - We obtain approximation algorithms with better $\epsilon$-dependence using
rectangular matrix multiplication. The time-bound is $\~O(n)$ when the pattern
is sufficiently long: $m\ge \epsilon^{-28}$. Previous algorithms require
$\~O(\epsilon^{-1}n)$ time.
  - When k is not too small, we obtain a truly sublinear-time algorithm to find
all locations with Hamming distance approximately (up to a constant factor)
less than k, in $O((n/k^{\Omega(1)}+occ)n^{o(1)})$ time, where occ is the
output size. The algorithm leads to a property tester, returning true if an
exact match exists and false if the Hamming distance is more than $\delta m$ at
every location, running in $\~O(\delta^{-1/3}n^{2/3}+\delta^{-1}n/m)$ time.
  - We obtain a streaming algorithm to report all locations with Hamming
distance approximately less than k, using $\~O(\epsilon^{-2}\sqrt k)$ space.
Previously, streaming algorithms were known for the exact problem with \~O(k)
space or for the approximate problem with $\~O(\epsilon^{-O(1)}\sqrt m)$ space.

Title: Spectral Independence in High-Dimensional Expanders and Applications to
  the Hardcore Model
Authors: Nima Anari, Kuikui Liu, Shayan Oveis Gharan
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We say a probability distribution $\mu$ is spectrally independent if an
associated correlation matrix has a bounded largest eigenvalue for the
distribution and all of its conditional distributions. We prove that if $\mu$
is spectrally independent, then the corresponding high dimensional simplicial
complex is a local spectral expander. Using a line of recent works on mixing
time of high dimensional walks on simplicial complexes
\cite{KM17,DK17,KO18,AL19}, this implies that the corresponding Glauber
dynamics mixes rapidly and generates (approximate) samples from $\mu$.
  As an application, we show that natural Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly (in
polynomial time) to generate a random independent set from the hardcore model
up to the uniqueness threshold. This improves the quasi-polynomial running time
of Weitz's deterministic correlation decay algorithm \cite{Wei06} for
estimating the hardcore partition function, also answering a long-standing open
problem of mixing time of Glauber dynamics \cite{LV97,LV99,DG00,Vig01,EHSVY16}.

Title: Analysis and Evaluation of Non-Blocking Interpolation Search Trees
Authors: Aleksandar Prokopec, Trevor Brown, Dan Alistarh
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We start by summarizing the recently proposed implementation of the first
non-blocking concurrent interpolation search tree (C-IST) data structure. We
then analyze the individual operations of the C-IST, and show that they are
correct and linearizable. We furthermore show that lookup (and several other
non-destructive operations) are wait-free, and that the insert and delete
operations are lock-free. We continue by showing that the C-IST has the
following properties. For arbitrary key distributions, this data structure
ensures worst-case $O(\log n + p)$ amortized time for search, insertion and
deletion traversals. When the input key distributions are smooth, lookups run
in expected $O(\log \log n + p)$ time, and insertion and deletion run in
expected amortized $O(\log \log n + p)$ time, where $p$ is a bound on the
number of threads. Finally, we present an extended experimental evaluation of
the non-blocking IST performance.

Title: Lightform: Procedural Effects for Projected AR
Authors: Brittany Factura, Laura LaPerche, Phil Reyneri, Brett Jones, Kevin
  Karsch
Categories: cs.GR
\\
  Projected augmented reality, also called projection mapping or video mapping,
is a form of augmented reality that uses projected light to directly augment 3D
surfaces, as opposed to using pass-through screens or headsets. The value of
projected AR is its ability to add a layer of digital content directly onto
physical objects or environments in a way that can be instantaneously viewed by
multiple people, unencumbered by a screen or additional setup.
  Because projected AR typically involves projecting onto non-flat, textured
objects (especially those that are conventionally not used as projection
surfaces), the digital content needs to be mapped and aligned to precisely fit
the physical scene to ensure a compelling experience. Current projected AR
techniques require extensive calibration at the time of installation, which is
not conducive to iteration or change, whether intentional (the scene is
reconfigured) or not (the projector is bumped or settles). The workflows are
undefined and fragmented, thus making it confusing and difficult for many to
approach projected AR. For example, a digital artist may have the software
expertise to create AR content, but could not complete an installation without
experience in mounting, blending, and realigning projector(s); the converse is
true for many A/V installation teams/professionals. Projection mapping has
therefore been limited to high-end event productions, concerts, and films,
because it requires expensive, complex tools, and skilled teams ($100K+
budgets).
  Lightform provides a technology that makes projected AR approachable,
practical, intelligent, and robust through integrated hardware and
computer-vision software. Lightform brings together and unites a currently
fragmented workflow into a single cohesive process that provides users with an
approachable and robust method to create and control projected AR experiences.

Title: Coalition-Safe Equilibria with Virtual Payoffs
Authors: Aggelos Kiayias and Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: 36 pages
\\
  Consider a set of parties invited to execute a protocol $\Pi$. The protocol
will incur some cost to run while in the end (or at regular intervals), it will
populate and update local tables that assign (virtual) rewards to participants.
Each participant aspires to offset the costs of participation by these virtual
payoffs that are provided in the course of the protocol. In this setting, we
introduce and study a notion of coalition-safe equilibrium. In particular, we
consider a strategic coalition of participants that is centrally coordinated
and potentially deviates from $\Pi$ with the objective to increase its utility
with respect to the view of {\em at least one} of the other participants. The
protocol $\Pi$ is called a coalition-safe equilibrium with virtual payoffs
(EVP) if no such protocol deviation exists. We apply our notion to study
incentives in blockchain protocols. We proceed to use our framework to provide
a unified picture of incentives in the Bitcoin blockchain, for absolute and
relative rewards based utility functions, as well as prove novel results
regarding incentives of the Fruitchain blockchain protocol [PODC 2017] showing
that the equilibrium condition holds for collusions up to $n-1$ players for
absolute rewards based utility functions and less than $n/2$ for relative
rewards based utility functions, with the latter result holding for any "weakly
fair" blockchain protocol, a new property that we introduce and may be of
independent interest.

Title: Quick or cheap? Breaking points in dynamic markets
Authors: Panayotis Mertikopoulos and Bary S. R. Pradelski and Heinrich H. Nax
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: 32 pages, 2 tables
\\
  We examine two-sided markets where players arrive stochastically over time
and are drawn from a continuum of types. The cost of matching a client and
provider varies, so a social planner is faced with two contending objectives:
a) to reduce players' waiting time before getting matched; and b) to form
efficient pairs in order to reduce matching costs. We show that such markets
are characterized by a quick-or-cheap dilemma: Under a large class of
distributional assumptions, there is no 'free lunch', i.e., there exists no
clearing schedule that is simultaneously optimal along both objectives. We
further identify a unique breaking point signifying a stark reduction in
matching cost contrasted by an increase in waiting time. Generalizing this
model, we identify two regimes: one, where no free lunch exists; the other,
where a window of opportunity opens to achieve a free lunch. Remarkably, greedy
scheduling is never optimal in this setting.

\\
  In recent years, commodity mobile devices equipped with cameras and inertial
measurement units (IMUs) have attracted much research and design effort for
augmented reality (AR) and robotics applications. Based on such sensors, many
commercial AR toolkits and public benchmark datasets have been made available
to accelerate hatching and validating new ideas. To lower the difficulty and
enhance the flexibility in accessing the rich raw data of typical AR sensors on
mobile devices, this paper present the mobile AR sensor (MARS) logger for two
of the most popular mobile operating systems, Android and iOS. The logger
highlights the best possible synchronization between the camera and the IMU
allowed by a mobile device, and efficient saving of images at about 30Hz, and
recording the metadata relevant to AR applications. This logger has been tested
on a relatively large spectrum of mobile devices, and the collected data has
been used for analyzing the sensor characteristics. We see that this
application will facilitate research and development related to AR and
robotics, so it has been open sourced at

  Systems powered by artificial intelligence are being developed to be more
user-friendly by communicating with users in a progressively human-like
conversational way. Chatbots, also known as dialogue systems, interactive
conversational agents, or virtual agents are an example of such systems used in
a wide variety of applications ranging from customer support in the business
domain to companionship in the healthcare sector. It is becoming increasingly
important to develop chatbots that can best respond to the personalized needs
of their users so that they can be as helpful to the user as possible in a real
human way. This paper investigates and compares three popular existing chatbots
API offerings and then propose and develop a voice interactive and multilingual
chatbot that can effectively respond to users mood, tone, and language using
IBM Watson Assistant, Tone Analyzer, and Language Translator. The chatbot was
evaluated using a use case that was targeted at responding to users needs
regarding exam stress based on university students survey data generated using
Google Forms. The results of measuring the chatbot effectiveness at analyzing
responses regarding exam stress indicate that the chatbot responding
appropriately to the user queries regarding how they are feeling about exams
76.5%. The chatbot could also be adapted for use in other application areas
such as student info-centers, government kiosks, and mental health support
systems.

Title: NeuroBoun: An inquiry-based approach for exploring scientific literature
  -- a use case in neuroscience
Authors: S. Uskudarli, E. G\"okdeniz, and R. Canbeyli

  Online scientific publications provide vast opportunities for researchers.
Alas, the quantity and the rate of increase in the articles make the
utilization of these resources very challenging. This work presents as
inquiry-based approach to support the articulation of complex inter-related
queries to gain insights regarding how these subjects have been studied in
conjunction with one another as reported in the scientific literature. For this
purpose we introduce inquiries that represent inter-related subqueries that are

  Personalized recommendation is ubiquitous, playing an important role in many
online services. Substantial research has been dedicated to learning vector
representations of users and items with the goal of predicting a user's
preference for an item based on the similarity of the representations.
Techniques range from classic matrix factorization to more recent deep learning
based methods. However, we argue that existing methods do not make full use of
the information that is available from user-item interaction data and the
similarities between user pairs and item pairs. In this work, we develop a
graph convolution-based recommendation framework, named Multi-Graph Convolution
Collaborative Filtering (Multi-GCCF), which explicitly incorporates multiple
graphs in the embedding learning process. Multi-GCCF not only expressively
models the high-order information via a partite user-item interaction graph,
but also integrates the proximal information by building and processing
user-user and item-item graphs. Furthermore, we consider the intrinsic
difference between user nodes and item nodes when performing graph convolution
on the bipartite graph. We conduct extensive experiments on four publicly
accessible benchmarks, showing significant improvements relative to several
state-of-the-art collaborative filtering and graph neural network-based
recommendation models. Further experiments quantitatively verify the
effectiveness of each component of our proposed model and demonstrate that the
learned embeddings capture the important relationship structure.

Title: An infinite family of linear codes supporting 4-designs
Authors: Chunming Tang, Cunsheng Ding
Categories: cs.IT math.CO math.IT
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1910.08265
\\
  The first linear code supporting a $4$-design was the $[11, 6, 5]$ ternary
Golay code discovered in 1949 by Golay. In the past 71 years, sporadic linear
codes holding $4$-designs or $5$-designs were discovered and many infinite
families of linear codes supporting $3$-designs were constructed. However, the
question as to whether there is an infinite family of linear codes holding an
infinite family of $t$-designs for $t\geq 4$ remains open for 71 years. This
paper settles this long-standing problem by presenting an infinite family of
BCH codes of length $2^{2m+1}+1$ over $\mathrm{GF}(2^{2m+1})$ holding an
infinite family of $4$-$(2^{2m+1}+1, 6, 2^{2m}-4)$ designs. Moreover, an
infinite family of linear codes holding the spherical design $S(3, 5, 4^m+1)$
is presented.

  The advent of Industry 4.0 with massive connectivity places significant
strains on the current spectrum resources, and challenges the industry and
regulators to respond promptly with new disruptive spectrum management
strategies. The current radio development, with certain elements of
intelligence, is nowhere near showing an agile response to the complex radio
environments. Following the line of intelligence, we propose to classify
spectrum intelligent radio into three streams: classical signal processing,
machine learning (ML), and contextual adaptation. We focus on the ML approach,
and propose a new intelligent radio architecture with three hierarchical forms:
perception, understanding, and reasoning. The proposed perception method
achieves fully blind multi-level spectrum sensing. The understanding method
accurately predicts the primary users' coverage across a large area, and the
reasoning method performs a near-optimal idle channel selection. Opportunities,
challenges, and future visions are also discussed for the realization of a
fully intelligent radio.

Title: Learning-Aided Deep Path Prediction for Sphere Decoding in Large MIMO
  Systems
Authors: Doyeon Weon and Kyungchun Lee
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT
Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures
\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel learning-aided sphere decoding (SD) scheme
for large multiple-input--multiple-output systems, namely, deep path
prediction-based sphere decoding (DPP-SD). In this scheme, we employ a neural
network (NN) to predict the minimum metrics of the ``deep'' paths in sub-trees
before commencing the tree search in SD. To reduce the complexity of the NN, we
employ the input vector with a reduced dimension rather than using the original
received signals and full channel matrix. The outputs of the NN, i.e., the
predicted minimum path metrics, are exploited to determine the search order
between the sub-trees, as well as to optimize the initial search radius, which
may reduce the computational complexity of SD. For further complexity
reduction, an early termination scheme based on the predicted minimum path
metrics is also proposed. Our simulation results show that the proposed DPP-SD
scheme provides a significant reduction in computational complexity compared
with the conventional SD algorithm, despite achieving near-optimal performance.

Title: Hybrid Combining Based on Constant Phase Shifters and Active/Inactive
  Switches
Authors: Eduard E. Bahingayi and Kyungchun Lee
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: 28 pages, 11 figures
\\
  In this paper, we propose a new hybrid analog and digital combining
architecture for millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. The proposed structure employs antenna
subset selection per radio frequency (RF) chain based on active/inactive
switches and uses constant phase shifters (CPS) to control the phases of
signals in the RF circuit. In this scheme, for each RF chain, a subset of
receive antennas that contribute more to the desired signal power than the
interference power is chosen for signal combining in the analog domain, whereas
other receive antennas are excluded from signal combining, thereby enhancing
sum-rates. Simultaneously, the proposed structure reduces power consumption in
the RF circuit by exclusively activating switches that correspond to the
antennas selected for each RF chain. We also develop three low-complexity
algorithms for per-RF chain antenna subset selection. Finally, through
numerical simulation, we show that the proposed structure provides higher
spectral efficiency and higher energy efficiency than conventional hybrid
analog and digital combining schemes for mmWave MU-MIMO systems.

Title: 3D UAV Trajectory and Communication Design for Simultaneous Uplink and
  Downlink Transmission
Authors: Meng Hua, Luxi Yang, Qingqing Wu, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: This is a pre-print version article submitted to IEEE transactions on
  communications
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided
simultaneous uplink and downlink transmission networks, where one UAV acting as
a disseminator is connected to multiple access points, and the other UAV acting
as a base station (BS) collects data from numerous sensor nodes. The goal of
this paper is to maximize the sum of the UAV-BS and UAV-AP system throughput by
jointly optimizing the 3D UAV trajectory, communication scheduling, and
UAV-AP/SN transmit power. We first consider a special case where the UAV-BS and
UAV-AP trajectories are pre-determined. Although the resulting problem is an
integer and non-convex optimization problem, a globally optimal solution is
obtained by applying the polyblock outer approximation (POA) method based on
the problem's hidden monotonic structure. Subsequently, for the general case
considering the 3D UAV trajectory optimization, an efficient iterative
algorithm is proposed to alternately optimize the divided sub-problem based on
the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed design is able to achieve significant system
throughput gain over the benchmarks. In addition, the SCA-based method can
achieve nearly the same performance as the POA based method with much lower
computational complexity.

  Although the commercialization of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks is
just in its initial stage, sixth-generation (6G) research effort has been
kicked off from the academic and industrial points of view. Researches on the
candidate technologies of 6G, such as ultra-massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO), terahertz communications, artificial intelligence (AI)
empowered wireless networks, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs),
are all in full swing. Among them, RISs are regarded as a promising emerging
hardware technology to improve the spectrum and energy efficiency of wireless
networks by artificially reconfiguring the propagation environment of
electromagnetic waves. Due to the unique advantages in enhancing wireless
communications, RISs have become a hot topic in recent researches. In this
article, we focus on three main challenges of implementing RISs in wireless
networks, namely, channel state information acquisition, passive information
transfer, and resource allocation of RIS-aided communication systems. We
summarize the state-of-the-art solutions and explore potential research
directions. Furthermore, we enumerate promising application scenarios of RISs,
such as edge intelligence, unmanned-aerial-vehicle communications, and so
forth.

Title: Subexponential and Linear Subpacketization Coded Caching via Line Graphs
  and Projective Geometry
Authors: Hari Hara Suthan Chittoor, Prasad Krishnan, K V Sushena Sree, Bhavana
  MVN
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted to IEEE TIT. This is an unified and extended version of our
  work presented in parts at ITW 2018, ISIT 2019, ISCIT 2019 and GLOBECOM 2019
\\
  Large gains in the rate of cache-aided broadcast communication are obtained
using coded caching, but to obtain this most existing centralized coded caching
schemes require that the files at the server be divisible into a large number
of parts (this number is called subpacketization). In fact, most schemes
require the subpacketization to be growing asymptotically as exponential in
some $r^{th}$ root of the number of users $K$. On the other extreme, few
schemes having subpacketization linear in $K$ are known; however they require
large number of users to exist, or they offer only little gain in rate. In this
work, we propose a new framework known as \textit{caching line graphs} for
centralized coded caching and utilize projective geometries over finite fields
to construct two new coded caching schemes with low subpacketization and
moderate rate gains. Both the schemes achieve the same asymptotic
subpacketization, which is exponential in $O((\log K)^2)$ (thus improving on
the root-of-$K$ exponent). The first scheme has a larger cache requirement but
has at most a constant rate (with increasing $K$), while the second has small
cache requirement but has a larger rate. As a special case of our second
scheme, we get a new linear subpacketization scheme, which has a more flexible
range of parameters than existing linear subpacketization schemes. We also
present two new lower bounds on the optimal rate of coded caching for a given
subpacketization level. Extending our techniques, we also obtain low
subpacketization schemes for other multi-receiver settings such as D2D
communications, distributed computing, and the cache-aided interference
channel. We validate the performance of all our schemes via extensive numerical
comparisons.

\\
  Many modern data analytics applications on graphs operate on domains where
graph topology is not known a priori, and hence its determination becomes part
of the problem definition, rather than serving as prior knowledge which aids
the problem solution. Part III of this monograph starts by addressing ways to
learn graph topology, from the case where the physics of the problem already
suggest a possible topology, through to most general cases where the graph
topology is learned from the data. A particular emphasis is on graph topology
definition based on the correlation and precision matrices of the observed
data, combined with additional prior knowledge and structural conditions, such
as the smoothness or sparsity of graph connections. For learning sparse graphs
(with small number of edges), the least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator, known as LASSO is employed, along with its graph specific variant,
graphical LASSO. For completeness, both variants of LASSO are derived in an
intuitive way, and explained. An in-depth elaboration of the graph topology
learning paradigm is provided through several examples on physically well
defined graphs, such as electric circuits, linear heat transfer, social and
computer networks, and spring-mass systems. As many graph neural networks (GNN)
and convolutional graph networks (GCN) are emerging, we have also reviewed the
main trends in GNNs and GCNs, from the perspective of graph signal filtering.
Tensor representation of lattice-structured graphs is next considered, and it
is shown that tensors (multidimensional data arrays) are a special class of
graph signals, whereby the graph vertices reside on a high-dimensional regular
lattice structure. This part of monograph concludes with two emerging
applications in financial data processing and underground transportation
networks modeling.

Title: Mobility-Aware Content Placement for Device-to-Device Caching Systems
Authors: Jaeyoung Song, and Wan Choi
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  User mobility has a large effect on optimal content placement in D2D caching
networks. Since a typical user can communicate neighboring users who stay in
the D2D communication area of the typical user, the optimal content placement
should be changed according to the user mobility. Under consideration of
randomness of incoming and outgoing users, we formulate an optimization problem
to minimize the average data load of a BS. It is proved that minimization of
the average data load of a BS can be transformed to maximization of a monotonic
submodular function with a matroid constraint, for which a greedy algorithm can
find near-optimal solutions. Moreover, when motions of neighboring users are
rapid, the optimal content placement is derived in closed-form, aided by
reasonable approximation and relaxation. In the high mobility regime, the
optimal content placement is shown to cache partial amounts of the most popular
contents.

butterfly structure, more precisely the closed butterfly also yields

permutations in the literature with the best known boomerang uniformity over

Title: Joint 3D Maneuver and Power Adaptation for Secure UAV Communication with
  CoMP Reception

\\
  This paper studies a secrecy unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication
system with coordinated multi-point (CoMP) reception, in which one UAV sends
confidential messages to a set of cooperative ground receivers (GRs), in the
presence of several suspicious eavesdroppers. In particular, we consider two
types of eavesdroppers that are non-colluding and colluding, respectively.
Under this setup, we exploit the UAV's maneuver in three dimensional (3D) space
together with transmit power adaptation for optimizing the secrecy
communication performance. First, we consider the quasi-stationary UAV
scenario, where we jointly optimize the UAV's 3D placement and transmit power
control to maximize the secrecy rate. Under both non-colluding and colluding
eavesdroppers, we obtain the optimal solutions to the joint 3D placement and
transmit power control problems in well structures. Next, we consider the
mobile UAV scenario, where we jointly optimize the UAV's 3D trajectory and
transmit power allocation to maximize the average secrecy rate during the whole
communication period. To deal with the difficult joint 3D trajectory and
transmit power allocation problems, we present alternating-optimization-based
approaches to obtain high-quality solutions. Finally, we provide numerical
results to validate the performance of our proposed designs. It is shown that
due to the consideration of CoMP reception, our proposed design with 3D
maneuver significantly outperforms the conventional design with two dimensional
(2D) (horizontal) maneuver only, by exploiting the additional degrees of
freedom in altitudes. It is also shown that the non-colluding and colluding
eavesdroppers lead to distinct 3D UAV maneuver behaviors.

Title: On the Interactive Capacity of Finite-State Protocols
Authors: Assaf Ben-Yishai, Young-Han Kim, Rotem Oshman, and Ofer Shayevitz
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1908.07367
\\
  The interactive capacity of a noisy channel is the highest possible rate at
which arbitrary interactive protocols can be simulated reliably over the
channel. Determining the interactive capacity is notoriously difficult, and the
best known lower bounds are far below the associated Shannon capacity, which
serves as a trivial (and also generally the best known) upper bound. This paper
considers the more restricted setup of simulating finite-state protocols. It is
shown that all two-state protocols, as well as rich families of arbitrary
finite-state protocols, can be simulated at the Shannon capacity, establishing
the interactive capacity for those families of protocols.

Title: Expand-and-Randomize: An Algebraic Approach to Secure Computation
Authors: Yizhou Zhao and Hua Sun
Categories: cs.IT cs.CR math.IT
\\
  We consider the secure computation problem in a minimal model, where Alice
and Bob each holds an input and wish to securely compute a function of their
inputs at Carol without revealing any additional information about the inputs.
For this minimal secure computation problem, we propose a novel coding scheme
built from two steps. First, the function to be computed is expanded such that
it can be recovered while additional information might be leaked. Second, a
randomization step is applied to the expanded function such that the leaked
information is protected. We implement this expand-and-randomize coding scheme
with two algebraic structures - the finite field and the modulo ring of
integers, where the expansion step is realized with the addition operation and
the randomization step is realized with the multiplication operation over the
respective algebraic structures.

Title: Ordered Reliability Bits Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding
Authors: Ken R. Duffy
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) can, unusually, decode any
forward error correction block code. The original algorithm assumed that the
decoder received only hard decision demodulated to inform its decoding. As the
incorporation of soft information is known to improve decoding precision, here
we introduce Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND, that, for binary block code of
length $n$, avails of no more than $\lceil \log_2(n)\rceil$ bits of
code-book-independent quantized soft detection information per received bit to
determine an accurate decoding. ORBGRAND is shown to provide better block error
rate performance than CA-SCL, a state of the art CA-Polar decoder, with low
complexity. Random Linear Codes of the same rate, decoded with ORBGRAND, are
shown to have comparable block-error and complexity performance.

Title: Computational model discovery with reinforcement learning
Authors: Maxime Bassenne and Adri\'an Lozano-Dur\'an
Categories: cs.LG physics.flu-dyn stat.ML
\\
  The motivation of this study is to leverage recent breakthroughs in
artificial intelligence research to unlock novel solutions to important
scientific problems encountered in computational science. To address the human
intelligence limitations in discovering reduced-order models, we propose to
supplement human thinking with artificial intelligence. Our three-pronged
strategy consists of learning (i) models expressed in analytical form, (ii)
which are evaluated a posteriori, and iii) using exclusively integral
quantities from the reference solution as prior knowledge. In point (i), we
pursue interpretable models expressed symbolically as opposed to black-box
neural networks, the latter only being used during learning to efficiently
parameterize the large search space of possible models. In point (ii), learned
models are dynamically evaluated a posteriori in the computational solver
instead of based on a priori information from preprocessed high-fidelity data,
thereby accounting for the specificity of the solver at hand such as its
numerics. Finally in point (iii), the exploration of new models is solely
guided by predefined integral quantities, e.g., averaged quantities of
engineering interest in Reynolds-averaged or large-eddy simulations (LES). We
use a coupled deep reinforcement learning framework and computational solver to
concurrently achieve these objectives. The combination of reinforcement
learning with objectives (i), (ii) and (iii) differentiate our work from
previous modeling attempts based on machine learning. In this report, we
provide a high-level description of the model discovery framework with
reinforcement learning. The method is detailed for the application of
discovering missing terms in differential equations. An elementary
instantiation of the method is described that discovers missing terms in the
Burgers' equation.

  In the post-industrial world, data science and analytics have gained
paramount importance regarding digital data privacy. Improper methods of
establishing privacy for accessible datasets can compromise large amounts of
user data even if the adversary has a small amount of preliminary knowledge of
a user. Many researchers have been developing high-level privacy-preserving
mechanisms that also retain the statistical integrity of the data to apply to
machine learning. Recent developments of differential privacy, such as the
Laplace and Privelet mechanisms, drastically decrease the probability that an
adversary can distinguish the elements in a data set and thus extract user
information. In this paper, we develop three privacy-preserving mechanisms with
the discrete M-band wavelet transform that embed noise into data. The first two
methods (LS and LS+) add noise through a Laplace-Sigmoid distribution that
multiplies Laplace-distributed values with the sigmoid function, and the third
method utilizes pseudo-quantum steganography to embed noise into the data. We
then show that our mechanisms successfully retain both differential privacy and
learnability through statistical analysis in various machine learning
environments.

Title: On the Resilience of Deep Learning for Reduced-voltage FPGAs

\\
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are inherently computation-intensive and also
power-hungry. Hardware accelerators such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs) are a promising solution that can satisfy these requirements for both
embedded and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. In FPGAs, as well as
CPUs and GPUs, aggressive voltage scaling below the nominal level is an
effective technique for power dissipation minimization. Unfortunately, bit-flip
faults start to appear as the voltage is scaled down closer to the transistor
threshold due to timing issues, thus creating a resilience issue.
  This paper experimentally evaluates the resilience of the training phase of
DNNs in the presence of voltage underscaling related faults of FPGAs,
especially in on-chip memories. Toward this goal, we have experimentally
evaluated the resilience of LeNet-5 and also a specially designed network for
CIFAR-10 dataset with different activation functions of Rectified Linear Unit
(Relu) and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh). We have found that modern FPGAs are
robust enough in extremely low-voltage levels and that low-voltage related
faults can be automatically masked within the training iterations, so there is
no need for costly software- or hardware-oriented fault mitigation techniques
like ECC. Approximately 10% more training iterations are needed to fill the gap
in the accuracy. This observation is the result of the relatively low rate of
undervolting faults, i.e., <0.1\%, measured on real FPGA fabrics. We have also
increased the fault rate significantly for the LeNet-5 network by randomly
generated fault injection campaigns and observed that the training accuracy
starts to degrade. When the fault rate increases, the network with Tanh
activation function outperforms the one with Relu in terms of accuracy, e.g.,
when the fault rate is 30% the accuracy difference is 4.92%.

Title: Deep Learning Training with Simulated Approximate Multipliers

\\
  This paper presents by simulation how approximate multipliers can be utilized
to enhance the training performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Approximate multipliers have significantly better performance in terms of
speed, power, and area compared to exact multipliers. However, approximate
multipliers have an inaccuracy which is defined in terms of the Mean Relative
Error (MRE). To assess the applicability of approximate multipliers in
enhancing CNN training performance, a simulation for the impact of approximate
multipliers error on CNN training is presented. The paper demonstrates that
using approximate multipliers for CNN training can significantly enhance the
performance in terms of speed, power, and area at the cost of a small negative
impact on the achieved accuracy. Additionally, the paper proposes a hybrid
training method which mitigates this negative impact on the accuracy. Using the
proposed hybrid method, the training can start using approximate multipliers
then switches to exact multipliers for the last few epochs. Using this method,
the performance benefits of approximate multipliers in terms of speed, power,
and area can be attained for a large portion of the training stage. On the
other hand, the negative impact on the accuracy is diminished by using the
exact multipliers for the last epochs of training.

Title: Visual Evaluation of Generative Adversarial Networks for Time Series

Comments: To appear in the Proceedings of the Human-Centered AI:

  November 7-9, 2019
\\
  A crucial factor to trust Machine Learning (ML) algorithm decisions is a good
representation of its application field by the training dataset. This is
particularly true when parts of the training data have been artificially
generated to overcome common training problems such as lack of data or
imbalanced dataset. Over the last few years, Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) have shown remarkable results in generating realistic data. However,
this ML approach lacks an objective function to evaluate the quality of the
generated data. Numerous GAN applications focus on generating image data mostly
because they can be easily evaluated by a human eye. Less efforts have been
made to generate time series data. Assessing their quality is more complicated,
particularly for technical data. In this paper, we propose a human-centered
approach supporting a ML or domain expert to accomplish this task using Visual
Analytics (VA) techniques. The presented approach consists of two views, namely
a GAN Iteration View showing similarity metrics between real and generated data
over the iterations of the generation process and a Detailed Comparative View
equipped with different time series visualizations such as TimeHistograms, to
compare the generated data at different iteration steps. Starting from the GAN
Iteration View, the user can choose suitable iteration steps for detailed
inspection. We evaluate our approach with a usage scenario that enabled an
efficient comparison of two different GAN models.

Title: Protecting GANs against privacy attacks by preventing overfitting
Authors: Sumit Mukherjee, Yixi Xu, Anusua Trivedi, Juan Lavista Ferres
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made releasing of synthetic
images a viable approach to share data without releasing the original dataset.
It has been shown that such synthetic data can be used for a variety of
downstream tasks such as training classifiers that would otherwise require the
original dataset to be shared. However, recent work has shown that the GAN
models and their synthetically generated data can be used to infer the training
set membership by an adversary who has access to the entire dataset and some
auxiliary information. Here we develop a new GAN architecture (privGAN) which
provides protection against this mode of attack while leading to negligible
loss in downstream performances. Our architecture explicitly prevents
overfitting to the training set thereby providing implicit protection against
white-box attacks. The main contributions of this paper are: i) we propose a
novel GAN architecture that can generate synthetic data in a privacy preserving
manner and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model against white--box
attacks on several benchmark datasets, ii) we provide a theoretical
understanding of the optimal solution of the GAN loss function, iii) we
demonstrate on two common benchmark datasets that synthetic images generated by
privGAN lead to negligible loss in downstream performance when compared against
non--private GANs. While we have focosued on benchmarking privGAN exclusively
of image datasets, the architecture of privGAN is not exclusive to image
datasets and can be easily extended to other types of datasets.

\\
  We introduce Grinch, a new algorithm for large-scale, non-greedy hierarchical
clustering with general linkage functions that compute arbitrary similarity
between two point sets. The key components of Grinch are its rotate and graft
subroutines that efficiently reconfigure the hierarchy as new points arrive,
supporting discovery of clusters with complex structure. Grinch is motivated by
a new notion of separability for clustering with linkage functions: we prove
that when the model is consistent with a ground-truth clustering, Grinch is
guaranteed to produce a cluster tree containing the ground-truth, independent
of data arrival order. Our empirical results on benchmark and author
coreference datasets (with standard and learned linkage functions) show that
Grinch is more accurate than other scalable methods, and orders of magnitude
faster than hierarchical agglomerative clustering.

Title: No Spurious Local Minima in Deep Quadratic Networks
Authors: Abbas Kazemipour, Brett Larsen and Shaul Druckmann
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Despite their practical success, a theoretical understanding of the loss
landscape of neural networks has proven challenging due to the
high-dimensional, non-convex, and highly nonlinear structure of such models. In
this paper, we characterize the training landscape of the quadratic loss
landscape for neural networks with quadratic activation functions. We prove
existence of spurious local minima and saddle points which can be escaped
easily with probability one when the number of neurons is greater than or equal
to the input dimension and the norm of the training samples is used as a
regressor. We prove that deep overparameterized neural networks with quadratic
activations benefit from similar nice landscape properties. Our theoretical
results are independent of data distribution and fill the existing gap in
theory for two-layer quadratic neural networks. Finally, we empirically
demonstrate convergence to a global minimum for these problems.

Title: Long-Term Visitation Value for Deep Exploration in Sparse Reward
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Simone Parisi, Davide Tateo, Maximilian Hensel, Carlo D'Eramo, Jan
  Peters, Joni Pajarinen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Reinforcement learning with sparse rewards is still an open challenge.
Classic methods rely on getting feedback via extrinsic rewards to train the
agent, and in situations where this occurs very rarely the agent learns slowly
or cannot learn at all. Similarly, if the agent receives also rewards that
create suboptimal modes of the objective function, it will likely prematurely
stop exploring. More recent methods add auxiliary intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. However, auxiliary rewards lead to a non-stationary
target for the Q-function. In this paper, we present a novel approach that (1)
plans exploration actions far into the future by using a long-term visitation
count, and (2) decouples exploration and exploitation by learning a separate
function assessing the exploration value of the actions. Contrary to existing
methods which use models of reward and dynamics, our approach is off-policy and
model-free. We further propose new tabular environments for benchmarking
exploration in reinforcement learning. Empirical results on classic and novel
benchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in
environments with sparse rewards, especially in the presence of rewards that
create suboptimal modes of the objective function. Results also suggest that
our approach scales gracefully with the size of the environment. Source code is

Title: Reinforcement Learning with Goal-Distance Gradient
Authors: Kai Jiang, XiaoLong Qin
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Reinforcement learning usually uses the feedback rewards of environmental to
train agents. But the rewards in the actual environment are sparse, and even
some environments will not rewards. Most of the current methods are difficult
to get a good performance in a sparse reward environment. For environments
without feedback rewards, a reward must be artificially defined. We present a
method that does not rely on environmental rewards to solve the problem of
sparse rewards. At the same time, the above two problems are solved, and it can
be applied to more complicated environments and real-world environments. We
used the number of steps transferred between states as the distance to replace
the rewards of environmental. In order to solve the problem caused by the long
distance between the start and the goal in a more complicated environment, we
add bridge points to our method to establish a connection between the start and
the goal. Experiments show that our method can be applied to more environments
where distance cannot be estimated in advance.

Title: PatDNN: Achieving Real-Time DNN Execution on Mobile Devices with
  Pattern-based Weight Pruning

  Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating
  Systems (ASPLOS 20)
\\
  With the emergence of a spectrum of high-end mobile devices, many
applications that formerly required desktop-level computation capability are
being transferred to these devices. However, executing the inference of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) is still challenging considering high computation and
storage demands, specifically, if real-time performance with high accuracy is
needed. Weight pruning of DNNs is proposed, but existing schemes represent two
extremes in the design space: non-structured pruning is fine-grained, accurate,
but not hardware friendly; structured pruning is coarse-grained,
hardware-efficient, but with higher accuracy loss. In this paper, we introduce
a new dimension, fine-grained pruning patterns inside the coarse-grained
structures, revealing a previously unknown point in design space. With the
higher accuracy enabled by fine-grained pruning patterns, the unique insight is
to use the compiler to re-gain and guarantee high hardware efficiency. In other
words, our method achieves the best of both worlds, and is desirable across
theory/algorithm, compiler, and hardware levels. The proposed PatDNN is an
end-to-end framework to efficiently execute DNN on mobile devices with the help
of a novel model compression technique (pattern-based pruning based on extended
ADMM solution framework) and a set of thorough architecture-aware compiler- and
code generation-based optimizations (filter kernel reordering, compressed
weight storage, register load redundancy elimination, and parameter
auto-tuning). Evaluation results demonstrate that PatDNN outperforms three
state-of-the-art end-to-end DNN frameworks, TensorFlow Lite, TVM, and Alibaba
Mobile Neural Network with speedup up to 44.5x, 11.4x, and 7.1x, respectively,
with no accuracy compromise. Real-time inference of representative large-scale
DNNs (e.g., VGG-16, ResNet-50) can be achieved using mobile devices.

Title: Dual Adversarial Domain Adaptation
Authors: Yuntao Du, Zhiwen Tan, Qian Chen, Xiaowen Zhang, Yirong Yao, Chongjun
  Wang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Unsupervised domain adaptation aims at transferring knowledge from the
labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Previous adversarial
domain adaptation methods mostly adopt the discriminator with binary or
$K$-dimensional output to perform marginal or conditional alignment
independently. Recent experiments have shown that when the discriminator is
provided with domain information in both domains and label information in the
source domain, it is able to preserve the complex multimodal information and
high semantic information in both domains. Following this idea, we adopt a
discriminator with $2K$-dimensional output to perform both domain-level and
class-level alignments simultaneously in a single discriminator. However, a
single discriminator can not capture all the useful information across domains
and the relationships between the examples and the decision boundary are rarely
explored before. Inspired by multi-view learning and latest advances in domain
adaptation, besides the adversarial process between the discriminator and the
feature extractor, we also design a novel mechanism to make two discriminators
pit against each other, so that they can provide diverse information for each
other and avoid generating target features outside the support of the source
domain. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to explore a dual
adversarial strategy in domain adaptation. Moreover, we also use the
semi-supervised learning regularization to make the representations more
discriminative. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify
that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

Title: Ensemble emotion recognizing with multiple modal physiological signals

Comments: under review for Multimedia tools and applications
\\
  Physiological signals that provide the objective repression of human
affective states are attracted increasing attention in the emotion recognition
field. However, the single signal is difficult to obtain completely and
accurately description for emotion. Multiple physiological signals fusing
models, building the uniform classification model by means of consistent and
complementary information from different emotions to improve recognition
performance. Original fusing models usually choose the particular
classification method to recognition, which is ignoring different distribution
of multiple signals. Aiming above problems, in this work, we propose an emotion
classification model through multiple modal physiological signals for different
emotions. Features are extracted from EEG, EMG, EOG signals for characterizing
emotional state on valence and arousal levels. For characterization, four bands
filtering theta, beta, alpha, gamma for signal preprocessing are adopted and
three Hjorth parameters are computing as features. To improve classification
performance, an ensemble classifier is built. Experiments are conducted on the
benchmark DEAP datasets. For the two-class task, the best result on arousal is
94.42\%, the best result on valence is 94.02\%, respectively. For the
four-class task, the highest average classification accuracy is 90.74, and it
shows good stability. The influence of different peripheral physiological
signals for results is also analyzed in this paper.

Title: Lossless Compression of Deep Neural Networks

Categories: cs.LG cs.DS math.OC stat.ML
Comments: Under review
\\
  Deep neural networks have been successful in many predictive modeling tasks,
such as image and language recognition, where large neural networks are often
used to obtain good accuracy. Consequently, it is challenging to deploy these
networks under limited computational resources, such as in mobile devices. In
this work, we introduce an algorithm that removes units and layers of a neural
network while not changing the output that is produced, which thus implies a
lossless compression. This algorithm, which we denote as LEO (Lossless
Expressiveness Optimization), relies on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
to identify Rectifier Linear Units (ReLUs) with linear behavior over the input
domain. By using L1 regularization to induce such behavior, we can benefit from
training over a larger architecture than we would later use in the environment
where the trained neural network is deployed.

Title: Meta Reinforcement Learning with Autonomous Inference of Subtask
  Dependencies
Authors: Sungryull Sohn, Hyunjae Woo, Jongwook Choi, Honglak Lee
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: In ICLR 2020
\\
  We propose and address a novel few-shot RL problem, where a task is
characterized by a subtask graph which describes a set of subtasks and their
dependencies that are unknown to the agent. The agent needs to quickly adapt to
the task over few episodes during adaptation phase to maximize the return in
the test phase. Instead of directly learning a meta-policy, we develop a
Meta-learner with Subtask Graph Inference(MSGI), which infers the latent
parameter of the task by interacting with the environment and maximizes the
return given the latent parameter. To facilitate learning, we adopt an
intrinsic reward inspired by upper confidence bound (UCB) that encourages
efficient exploration. Our experiment results on two grid-world domains and
StarCraft II environments show that the proposed method is able to accurately
infer the latent task parameter, and to adapt more efficiently than existing
meta RL and hierarchical RL methods.

Title: A Comprehensive and Modularized Statistical Framework for Gradient Norm
  Equality in Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Zhaodong Chen, Lei Deng, Bangyan Wang, Guoqi Li, Yuan Xie
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Under review as a regular paper in TPAMI
\\
  In recent years, plenty of metrics have been proposed to identify networks
that are free of gradient explosion and vanishing. However, due to the
diversity of network components and complex serial-parallel hybrid connections
in modern DNNs, the evaluation of existing metrics usually requires strong
assumptions, complex statistical analysis, or has limited application fields,
which constraints their spread in the community. In this paper, inspired by the
Gradient Norm Equality and dynamical isometry, we first propose a novel metric
called Block Dynamical Isometry, which measures the change of gradient norm in
individual block. Because our Block Dynamical Isometry is norm-based, its
evaluation needs weaker assumptions compared with the original dynamical
isometry. To mitigate the challenging derivation, we propose a highly
modularized statistical framework based on free probability. Our framework
includes several key theorems to handle complex serial-parallel hybrid
connections and a library to cover the diversity of network components.
Besides, several sufficient prerequisites are provided. Powered by our metric
and framework, we analyze extensive initialization, normalization, and network
structures. We find that Gradient Norm Equality is a universal philosophy
behind them. Then, we improve some existing methods based on our analysis,
including an activation function selection strategy for initialization
techniques, a new configuration for weight normalization, and a depth-aware way
to derive coefficients in SeLU. Moreover, we propose a novel normalization
technique named second moment normalization, which is theoretically 30% faster
than batch normalization without accuracy loss. Last but not least, our
conclusions and methods are evidenced by extensive experiments on multiple
models over CIFAR10 and ImageNet.

\\
  Kernel methods form a theoretically-grounded, powerful and versatile
framework to solve nonlinear problems in signal processing and machine
learning. The standard approach relies on the \emph{kernel trick} to perform
pairwise evaluations of a kernel function, leading to scalability issues for
large datasets due to its linear and superlinear growth with respect to the
training data. Recently, we proposed \emph{no-trick} (NT) kernel adaptive
filtering (KAF) that leverages explicit feature space mappings using
data-independent basis with constant complexity. The inner product defined by
the feature mapping corresponds to a positive-definite finite-rank kernel that
induces a finite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).
Information theoretic learning (ITL) is a framework where information theory
descriptors based on non-parametric estimator of Renyi entropy replace
conventional second-order statistics for the design of adaptive systems. An
RKHS for ITL defined on a space of probability density functions simplifies
statistical inference for supervised or unsupervised learning. ITL criteria
take into account the higher-order statistical behavior of the systems and
signals as desired. However, this comes at a cost of increased computational
complexity. In this paper, we extend the NT kernel concept to ITL for improved
information extraction from the signal without compromising scalability.
Specifically, we focus on a family of fast, scalable, and accurate estimators
for ITL using explicit inner product space (EIPS) kernels. We demonstrate the
superior performance of EIPS-ITL estimators and combined NT-KAF using EIPS-ITL
cost functions through experiments.

controllers which act for a limited, variable amount of time. The options
framework describes such behaviours as consisting of a subset of states in
which they can initiate, an internal policy and a stochastic termination
condition. However, much of the subsequent work on option discovery has ignored
the initiation set, because of difficulty in learning it from data. We provide
a generalization of initiation sets suitable for general function
approximation, by defining an interest function associated with an option. We
derive a gradient-based learning algorithm for interest functions, leading to a
new interest-option-critic architecture. We investigate how interest functions
can be leveraged to learn interpretable and reusable temporal abstractions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach through quantitative and
qualitative results, in both discrete and continuous environments.

Title: Online Similarity Learning with Feedback for Invoice Line Item Matching
Authors: Chandresh Kumar Maurya, Neelamadhav Gantayat, Sampath Dechu, Tomas

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The procure to pay process (P2P) in large enterprises is a back-end business
process which deals with the procurement of products and services for
enterprise operations. Procurement is done by issuing purchase orders to
impaneled vendors and invoices submitted by vendors are paid after they go
through a rigorous validation process. Agents orchestrating P2P process often
encounter the problem of matching a product or service descriptions in the
invoice to those in purchase order and verify if the ordered items are what
have been supplied or serviced. For example, the description in the invoice and
purchase order could be TRES 739mL CD KER Smooth and TRES 0.739L CD KER Smth
which look different at word level but refer to the same item. In a typical P2P
process, agents are asked to manually select the products which are similar
before invoices are posted for payment. This step in the business process is
manual, repetitive, cumbersome, and costly. Since descriptions are not
well-formed sentences, we cannot apply existing semantic and syntactic text
similarity approaches directly. In this paper, we present two approaches to
solve the above problem using various types of available agent's recorded
feedback data. If the agent's feedback is in the form of a relative ranking
between descriptions, we use similarity ranking algorithm. If the agent's
feedback is absolute such as match or no-match, we use classification
similarity algorithm. We also present the threats to the validity of our
approach and present a possible remedy making use of product taxonomy and
catalog. We showcase the comparative effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed approaches over many benchmarks and real-world data sets.

  Mining graph data has become a popular research topic in computer science and
has been widely studied in both academia and industry given the increasing
amount of network data in the recent years. However, the huge amount of network
data has posed great challenges for efficient analysis. This motivates the
advent of graph representation which maps the graph into a low-dimension vector
space, keeping original graph structure and supporting graph inference. The
investigation on efficient representation of a graph has profound theoretical
significance and important realistic meaning, we therefore introduce some basic
ideas in graph representation/network embedding as well as some representative
models in this chapter.

Title: Ensembles of Many Diverse Weak Defenses can be Strong: Defending Deep
  Neural Networks Against Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Ying Meng, Jianhai Su, Jason O'Kane, Pooyan Jamshidi
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
Comments: 18 pages, 24 figures
\\
  Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance across many domains, machine
learning systems are highly vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations.
Although defense approaches have been proposed in recent years, many have been
bypassed by even weak adversarial attacks. An early
study~\cite{he2017adversarial} shows that ensembles created by combining
multiple weak defenses (i.e., input data transformations) are still weak. We
show that it is indeed possible to construct effective ensembles using weak
defenses to block adversarial attacks. However, to do so requires a diverse set
of such weak defenses. In this work, we propose Athena, an extensible framework
for building effective defenses to adversarial attacks against machine learning
systems. Here we conducted a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate several
realizations of Athena. More specifically, we evaluated the effectiveness of 5
ensemble strategies with a diverse set of many weak defenses that comprise
transforming the inputs (e.g., rotation, shifting, noising, denoising, and many
more) before feeding them to target deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. We
evaluate the effectiveness of the ensembles with adversarial examples generated
by 9 various adversaries (i.e., FGSM, CW, etc.) in 4 threat models (i.e.,
zero-knowledge, black-box, gray-box, white-box) on MNIST. We also explain, via
a comprehensive empirical study, why building defenses based on the idea of
many diverse weak defenses works, when it is most effective, and what its
inherent limitations and overhead are.

  Machine learning (ML) is quickly emerging as a powerful tool with diverse
applications across an extremely broad spectrum of disciplines and commercial
endeavors. Typically, ML is used as a black box that provides little
illuminating rationalization of its output. In the current work, we aim to
better understand the generic intuition underlying unsupervised ML with a focus
on physical systems. The systems that are studied here as test cases comprise
of six different 2-dimensional (2-D) particulate systems of different
complexities. It is noted that the findings of this study are generic to any
unsupervised ML problem and are not restricted to materials systems alone.
Three rudimentary unsupervised ML techniques are employed on the adjacency
(connectivity) matrix of the six studied systems: (i) using principal
eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, (ii) spectral
decomposition, and (iii) a Potts model based community detection technique in
which a modularity function is maximized. We demonstrate that, while solving a
completely classical problem, ML technique produces features that are
distinctly connected to quantum mechanical solutions. Dissecting these features
help us to understand the deep connection between the classical non-linear
world and the quantum mechanical linear world through the kaleidoscope of ML
technique, which might have far reaching consequences both in the arena of
physical sciences and ML.

Title: Kernelized Support Tensor Train Machines
Authors: Cong Chen, Kim Batselier, Wenjian Yu, Ngai Wong
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Tensor, a multi-dimensional data structure, has been exploited recently in
the machine learning community. Traditional machine learning approaches are
vector- or matrix-based, and cannot handle tensorial data directly. In this
paper, we propose a tensor train (TT)-based kernel technique for the first
time, and apply it to the conventional support vector machine (SVM) for image
classification. Specifically, we propose a kernelized support tensor train
machine that accepts tensorial input and preserves the intrinsic kernel
property. The main contributions are threefold. First, we propose a TT-based
feature mapping procedure that maintains the TT structure in the feature space.
Second, we demonstrate two ways to construct the TT-based kernel function while
considering consistency with the TT inner product and preservation of
information. Third, we show that it is possible to apply different kernel
functions on different data modes. In principle, our method tensorizes the
standard SVM on its input structure and kernel mapping scheme. Extensive
experiments are performed on real-world tensor data, which demonstrates the
superiority of the proposed scheme under few-sample high-dimensional inputs.

  Pre-training a deep neural network on the ImageNet dataset is a common
practice for training deep learning models, and generally yields improved
performance and faster training times. The technique of pre-training on one
task and then retraining on a new one is called transfer learning. In this
paper we analyse the effectiveness of using deep transfer learning for
character recognition tasks. We perform three sets of experiments with varying
levels of similarity between source and target tasks to investigate the
behaviour of different types of knowledge transfer. We transfer both parameters
and features and analyse their behaviour. Our results demonstrate that no
significant advantage is gained by using a transfer learning approach over a
traditional machine learning approach for our character recognition tasks. This
suggests that using transfer learning does not necessarily presuppose a better
performing model in all cases.

\\
  Many real-world control problems involve both discrete decision variables -
such as the choice of control modes, gear switching or digital outputs - as
well as continuous decision variables - such as velocity setpoints, control
gains or analogue outputs. However, when defining the corresponding optimal
control or reinforcement learning problem, it is commonly approximated with
fully continuous or fully discrete action spaces. These simplifications aim at
tailoring the problem to a particular algorithm or solver which may only
support one type of action space. Alternatively, expert heuristics are used to
remove discrete actions from an otherwise continuous space. In contrast, we
propose to treat hybrid problems in their 'native' form by solving them with
hybrid reinforcement learning, which optimizes for discrete and continuous
actions simultaneously. In our experiments, we first demonstrate that the
proposed approach efficiently solves such natively hybrid reinforcement
learning problems. We then show, both in simulation and on robotic hardware,
the benefits of removing possibly imperfect expert-designed heuristics. Lastly,
hybrid reinforcement learning encourages us to rethink problem definitions. We
propose reformulating control problems, e.g. by adding meta actions, to improve
exploration or reduce mechanical wear and tear.

Title: Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs with Debate Dynamics

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: AAAI-2020
\\
  We propose a novel method for automatic reasoning on knowledge graphs based
on debate dynamics. The main idea is to frame the task of triple classification
as a debate game between two reinforcement learning agents which extract
arguments -- paths in the knowledge graph -- with the goal to promote the fact
being true (thesis) or the fact being false (antithesis), respectively. Based
on these arguments, a binary classifier, called the judge, decides whether the
fact is true or false. The two agents can be considered as sparse, adversarial
feature generators that present interpretable evidence for either the thesis or
the antithesis. In contrast to other black-box methods, the arguments allow
users to get an understanding of the decision of the judge. Since the focus of
this work is to create an explainable method that maintains a competitive
predictive accuracy, we benchmark our method on the triple classification and
link prediction task. Thereby, we find that our method outperforms several
baselines on the benchmark datasets FB15k-237, WN18RR, and Hetionet. We also
conduct a survey and find that the extracted arguments are informative for
users.

Title: Reject Illegal Inputs with Generative Classifier Derived from Any
  Discriminative Classifier
Authors: Xin Wang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Generative classifiers have been shown promising to detect illegal inputs
including adversarial examples and out-of-distribution samples. Supervised Deep
Infomax~(SDIM) is a scalable end-to-end framework to learn generative
classifiers. In this paper, we propose a modification of SDIM termed
SDIM-\emph{logit}. Instead of training generative classifier from scratch,
SDIM-\emph{logit} first takes as input the logits produced any given
discriminative classifier, and generate logit representations; then a
generative classifier is derived by imposing statistical constraints on logit
representations. SDIM-\emph{logit} could inherit the performance of the
discriminative classifier without loss. SDIM-\emph{logit} incurs a negligible
number of additional parameters, and can be efficiently trained with base
classifiers fixed. We perform \emph{classification with rejection}, where test
samples whose class conditionals are smaller than pre-chosen thresholds will be
rejected without predictions. Experiments on illegal inputs, including
adversarial examples, samples with common corruptions, and
out-of-distribution~(OOD) samples show that allowed to reject a portion of test
samples, SDIM-\emph{logit} significantly improves the performance on the left
test sets.

\\
  Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data is an important goal in building
reliable machine learning systems. Especially in autonomous systems, wrong
predictions for OOD inputs can cause safety critical situations. As a first
step towards a solution, we consider the problem of detecting such data in a
value-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) setting. Modelling this problem as
a one-class classification problem, we propose a framework for
uncertainty-based OOD classification: UBOOD. It is based on the effect that an
agent's epistemic uncertainty is reduced for situations encountered during
training (in-distribution), and thus lower than for unencountered (OOD)
situations. Being agnostic towards the approach used for estimating epistemic
uncertainty, combinations with different uncertainty estimation methods, e.g.
approximate Bayesian inference methods or ensembling techniques are possible.
We further present a first viable solution for calculating a dynamic
classification threshold, based on the uncertainty distribution of the training
data. Evaluation shows that the framework produces reliable classification
results when combined with ensemble-based estimators, while the combination
with concrete dropout-based estimators fails to reliably detect OOD situations.
In summary, UBOOD presents a viable approach for OOD classification in deep RL
settings by leveraging the epistemic uncertainty of the agent's value function.

\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success as a general
framework for learning how to make decisions. However, this success relies on
the interactive hand-tuning of a reward function by RL experts. On the other
hand, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) seeks to learn a reward function
from readily-obtained human demonstrations. Yet, IRL suffers from two major
limitations: 1) reward ambiguity - there are an infinite number of possible
reward functions that could explain an expert's demonstration and 2)
heterogeneity - human experts adopt varying strategies and preferences, which
makes learning from multiple demonstrators difficult due to the common
assumption that demonstrators seeks to maximize the same reward. In this work,
we propose a method to jointly infer a task goal and humans' strategic
preferences via network distillation. This approach enables us to distill a
robust task reward (addressing reward ambiguity) and to model each strategy's
objective (handling heterogeneity). We demonstrate our algorithm can better
recover task reward and strategy rewards and imitate the strategies in two
simulated tasks and a real-world table tennis task.

obtain the feature representations. We propose a method for learning these

Title: Adversarial Policies in Learning Systems with Malicious Experts
Authors: S. Rasoul Etesami, Negar Kiyavash, H. Vincent Poor
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.MA stat.ML
\\
  We consider a learning system based on the conventional multiplicative weight
(MW) rule that combines experts' advice to predict a sequence of true outcomes.
It is assumed that one of the experts is malicious and aims to impose the
maximum loss on the system. The loss of the system is naturally defined to be
the aggregate absolute difference between the sequence of predicted outcomes
and the true outcomes. We consider this problem under both offline and online
settings. In the offline setting where the malicious expert must choose its
entire sequence of decisions a priori, we show somewhat surprisingly that a
simple greedy policy of always reporting false prediction is asymptotically
optimal with an approximation ratio of $1+O(\sqrt{\frac{\ln N}{N}})$, where $N$
is the total number of prediction stages. In particular, we describe a policy
that closely resembles the structure of the optimal offline policy. For the
online setting where the malicious expert can adaptively make its decisions, we
show that the optimal online policy can be efficiently computed by solving a
dynamic program in $O(N^2)$. Our results provide a new direction for
vulnerability assessment of commonly used learning algorithms to adversarial
attacks where the threat is an integral part of the system.

  Marine buoys aid in the battle against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated

however, may be disrupted by natural causes and buoy vandalism. To minimize the
effects of buoy disruption on a buoy network, we propose a more robust buoy
placement using dropout k-means and dropout k-median.
  We apply dropout k-means and dropout k-median to determine locations for
deploying marine buoys in the Gabonese waters near West Africa. We simulated
the passage of ships using historical Automatic Identification System (AIS)
data, then compared the ship detection probability of dropout k-means to
classic k-means and dropout k-median to classic k-median, taking into account
that the current sensor detection radius is 10km. With 5 buoys, the buoy
arrangement computed by classic k-means, dropout k-means, classic k-median and
dropout k-median have ship detection probabilities of 38%, 45%, 48% and 52%.

\\
  Recent technological advances have led to unprecedented amounts of generated
data that originate from the Web, sensor networks and social media. Analytics
in terms of defeasible reasoning - for example for decision making - could
provide richer knowledge of the underlying domain. Traditionally, defeasible
reasoning has focused on complex knowledge structures over small to medium
amounts of data, but recent research efforts have attempted to parallelize the
reasoning process over theories with large numbers of facts. Such work has
shown that traditional defeasible logics come with overheads that limit
scalability. In this work, we design a new logic for defeasible reasoning, thus
ensuring scalability by design. We establish several properties of the logic,
including its relation to existing defeasible logics. Our experimental results
indicate that our approach is indeed scalable and defeasible reasoning can be
applied to billions of facts.

Categories: cs.MS cs.PL
\\
  We address the problem of optimizing mixed sparse and dense tensor algebra in
a compiler. We show that standard loop transformations, such as strip-mining,
tiling, collapsing, parallelization and vectorization, can be applied to
irregular loops over sparse iteration spaces. We also show how these
transformations can be applied to the contiguous value arrays of sparse tensor
data structures, which we call their position space, to unlock load-balanced
tiling and parallelism.
  We have prototyped these concepts in the open-source TACO system, where they
are exposed as a scheduling API similar to the Halide domain-specific language
for dense computations. Using this scheduling API, we show how to optimize
mixed sparse/dense tensor algebra expressions, how to generate load-balanced
code by scheduling sparse tensor algebra in position space, and how to generate
sparse tensor algebra GPU code. Our evaluation shows that our transformations
let us generate good code that is competitive with many hand-optimized
implementations from the literature.

Title: Tensor-Tensor Products for Optimal Representation and Compression

\\
  In this era of big data, data analytics and machine learning, it is
imperative to find ways to compress large data sets such that intrinsic
features necessary for subsequent analysis are not lost. The traditional
workhorse for data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction has been the
matrix SVD, which presupposes that the data has been arranged in matrix format.
Our main goal in this study is to show that high-dimensional data sets are more
compressible when treated as tensors (aka multiway arrays) and compressed via
tensor-SVDs under the tensor-tensor product structures in (Kilmer and Martin,
2011; Kernfeld et al., 2015). We begin by proving Eckart Young optimality
results for families of tensor-SVDs under two different truncation strategies.
As such optimality properties can be proven in both matrix and tensor-based
algebras, a fundamental question arises: does the tensor construct subsume the
matrix construct in terms of representation efficiency? The answer is yes, as
shown when we prove that a tensor-tensor representation of an equal dimensional
spanning space can be superior to its matrix counterpart. We then investigate
how the compressed representation provided by the truncated tensor-SVD is
related both theoretically and in compression performance to its closest
tensor-based analogue, truncated HOSVD (De Lathauwer et al., 2000; De Lathauwer
and Vandewalle, 2004), thereby showing the potential advantages of our
tensor-based algorithms. Finally, we propose new tensor truncated SVD variants,
namely multi-way tensor SVDs, provide further approximated representation
efficiency and discuss under which conditions they are considered optimal. We
conclude with a numerical study demonstrating the utility of the theory.

Title: A fully discrete local discontinuous Galerkin method with the
  generalized numerical flux to solve the tempered fractional
  reaction-diffusion equation
Authors: Leilei Wei, Yinnian He
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  The tempered fractional diffusion equation could be recognized as the
generalization of the classic fractional diffusion equation that the truncation
effects are included in the bounded domains. This paper focuses on designing
the high order fully discrete local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method based
on the generalized alternating numerical fluxes for the tempered fractional
diffusion equation. From a practical point of view, the generalized alternating
numerical flux which is different from the purely alternating numerical flux
has a broader range of applications. We first design an efficient finite
difference scheme to approximate the tempered fractional derivatives and then a
fully discrete LDG method for the tempered fractional diffusion equation. We
prove that the scheme is unconditionally stable and convergent with the order
$O(h^{k+1}+\tau^{2-\alpha})$, where $h, \tau$ and $k$ are the step size in
space, time and the degree of piecewise polynomials, respectively. Finally
numerical experimets are performed to show the effectiveness and testify the
accuracy of the method.

Title: Isogeometric Residual Minimization Method (iGRM) for Stokes and
  Time-Dependent Stokes Problems
Authors: Marcin Los, Judit Munoz-Matute, Ignacio Muga, Maciej Paszynski
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 31 pages, 10 figures
\\
  We investigate the application of the residual minimization method (RM) to
stabilize the non-stationary Stokes problem. We discretize the trial and test
spaces with higher continuity B-spline basis functions from isogeometric
analysis (IGA) on a regular patch of elements. We first consider the RM with
IGA to stabilize H^1_0, L^2_0 formulation of the stationary Stokes problem. We
call our method the isoGeometric Residual Minimization (iGRM). Then, we focus
on the non-stationary Stokes problem discretized with IGA in space. We employ a
time integration scheme that preserves the Kronecker product structure of the
matrix and we use RM to stabilize the problem in every time step. We propose a
linear computational cost solver utilizing the Kronecker product structure of
the iGRM system. We test our method on a manufactured solution problem and the
cavity flow problem.

  In this paper we consider a system of two coupled nonlinear
diffusion--reaction partial differential equations (PDEs) which model the
growth of biofilm and consumption of the nutrient. At the scale of interest the
biofilm density is subject to a pointwise constraint, thus the biofilm PDE is
framed as a parabolic variational inequality. We derive rigorous error
estimates for a finite element (FE) approximation to the coupled nonlinear
system and confirm experimentally that the numerical approximation converges at
the predicted rate. We also show simulations in which we track the free
boundary in the domains which resemble the pore scale geometry and in which we
test the different modeling assumptions.

  We perform the linear growth analysis for a new PDE-based model for
poromechanical processes (formulated in mixed form using the solid deformation,
fluid pressure, and total pressure) interacting with diffusing and reacting
solutes in the medium. We find parameter regions that lead to interesting
behaviour of the coupled system. These mutual dependences between deformation
and diffusive patterns are of substantial relevance in the study of
morphoelastic changes in biomaterials. We provide a set of computational
examples in 2D and 3D that can be used to form a better understanding on how,
and up to which extent, the deformations of the porous structure dictate the
generation and suppression of spatial patterning dynamics, also related to the
onset of mechanochemical waves.

Title: Stable discretisations of high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods on
  equidistant and scattered points
Authors: Jan Glaubitz and Philipp Oeffner
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: Accepted in Applied Numerical Mathematics (Elsevier)
\\
  In this work, we propose and investigate stable high-order collocation-type
discretisations of the discontinuous Galerkin method on equidistant and
scattered collocation points. We do so by incorporating the concept of discrete
least squares into the discontinuous Galerkin framework. Discrete least squares
approximations allow us to construct stable and high-order accurate
approximations on arbitrary collocation points, while discrete least squares
quadrature rules allow us their stable and exact numerical integration. Both
methods are computed efficiently by using bases of discrete orthogonal
polynomials. Thus, the proposed discretisation generalises known classes of
discretisations of the discontinuous Galerkin method, such as the discontinuous
Galerkin collocation spectral element method. We are able to prove conservation
and linear $L^2$-stability of the proposed discretisations. Finally, numerical
tests investigate their accuracy and demonstrate their extension to nonlinear
conservation laws, systems, longtime simulations, and a variable coefficient
problem in two space dimensions.

Title: Nested Column Generation decomposition for solving the Routing and
  Spectrum Allocation problem in Elastic Optical Networks
Authors: Julian Enoch, Brigitte Jaumard
Categories: cs.NI cs.DS math.OC
\\
  With the continued growth of Internet traffic, and the scarcity of the
optical spectrum, there is a continuous need to optimize the usage of this
resource. In the process of provisioning elastic optical networks using the
flexible frequency grid paradigm, telecommunication operators must deal with a
combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-complete namely the Routing and
Spectrum Allocation(RSA) problem.Following on our previous study (Enoch &
Jaumard, 2018), where we used Integer Linear Programming, and proposed a Column
Generation algorithm based on a Lightpath decomposition, which proved to be the
most efficient so far,we now consider the traditional Configuration
decomposition that has been studied in other works in the past. In the process,
we created an new mathematical model using two variable sets instead of a
single variable set. Equally important,we independently rediscovered the Nested
Column Generation technique, and we used it to propose an algorithm that led to
a considerable improvement on the previous algorithms that use the same
Configuration decomposition. When compared to the latest such existing study
(Jaumard & Daryalal, 2016), our algorithm achieved an accuracy gap of 1% as
opposed to 14.3% for the previous study, and a running time two orders of
magnitude faster on average.

Authors: Farid Na\"it-Abdesselam, Ahmad Alsharoa, Mohamed Selim, Daji Qiao,

Categories: cs.NI
\\
  In this paper, we consider the use of UAVs to provide wireless connectivity
services, for example after failures of wireless network components or to
simply provide additional bandwidth on demand, and introduce the concept of
UAVs as a service (UaaS). To facilitate UaaS, we introduce a novel framework,
dubbed D3S, which consists of four phases: demand, decision, deployment, and
service. The main objective of this framework is to develop efficient and
realistic solutions to implement these four phases. The technical problems
include determining the type and number of UAVs to be deployed, and also their
final locations (e.g., hovering or on-ground), which is important for serving
certain applications. These questions will be part of the decision phase. They
also include trajectory planning of UAVs when they have to travel between
charging stations and deployment locations and may have to do this several
times. These questions will be part of the deployment phase. The service phase
includes the implementation of the backbone communication and data routing
between UAVs and between UAVs and ground control stations.

Title: SharpEdge: An Asynchronous and Core-Agnostic Solution to Guarantee
  Bounded-Delays
Authors: Soheil Abbasloo, H. Jonathan Chao
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: Under Review
\\
  What are the key properties that a network should have to provide
bounded-delay guarantees for the packets? In this paper, we attempt to answer
this question. To that end, we explore the theory of bounded-delay networks and
provide the necessary and the sufficient conditions required to have
deterministic bounded-delays in the network.
  We prove that as long as a network is work-conserving, independent of the
packet scheduling and queue management algorithms used in the switches, it is
sufficient to shape the traffic~\textit{properly} at the edge of the network to
meet hard bounded-delays in the network.
  Using the derived theorems, we present SharpEdge, a novel design to meet
deterministic bounded-delays in the network. To the best of our knowledge,
SharpEdge is the first scheme that can meet all following key properties: 1) it
supports coexistence of different classes of traffic, while it can guarantee
their different required bounded-delays 2) it does not require any changes in
the core of the network, 3) it supports both periodic and bursty traffic
patterns, and 4) it does not require any time synchronization between network
devices.

Title: Characterizing Delay and Control Traffic of the Cellular MME with IoT
  Support
Authors: Christian Vitale and Carla Fabiana Chiasserini and Francesco
  Malandrino and Senay Semu Tadesse
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  One of the main use cases for advanced cellular networks is represented by
massive Internet-of-things (MIoT), i.e., an enormous number of IoT devices that
transmit data toward the cellular network infrastructure. To make cellular MIoT
a reality, data transfer and control procedures specifically designed for the
support of IoT are needed. For this reason, 3GPP has introduced the Control
Plane Cellular IoT optimization, which foresees a simplified bearer
instantiation, with the Mobility Management Entity (MME) handling both control
and data traffic. The performance of the MME has therefore become critical, and
properly scaling its computational capability can determine the ability of the
whole network to tackle MIoT effectively. In particular, considering
virtualized networks and the need for an efficient allocation of computing
resources, it is paramount to characterize the MME performance as the MIoT
traffic load changes. We address this need by presenting compact, closed-form
expressions linking the number of IoT sources with the rate at which bearers
are requested, and such a rate with the delay incurred by the IoT data. We show
that our analysis, supported by testbed experiments and verified through
large-scale simulations, represents a valuable tool to make effective scaling
decisions in virtualized cellular core networks.

Title: Integrating Low-Power Wide-Area Networks for Enhanced Scalability and
  Extended Coverage
Authors: Mahbubur Rahman and Abusayeed Saifullah
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking
DOI: 10.1109/TNET.2020.2963886
\\
  Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are evolving as an enabling technology
for Internet-of-Things (IoT) due to their capability of communicating over long
distances at very low transmission power. Existing LPWAN technologies, however,
face limitations in meeting scalability and covering very wide areas which make
their adoption challenging for future IoT applications, especially in
infrastructure-limited rural areas. To address this limitation, in this paper,
we consider achieving scal-ability and extended coverage by integrating
multiple LPWANs. SNOW (Sensor Network Over White Spaces), a recently proposed
LPWAN architecture over the TV white spaces, has demonstrated its advantages
over existing LPWANs in performance and energy-efficiency. In this paper, we
propose to scale up LPWANs through a seamless integration of multiple SNOWs
which enables concurrent inter-SNOW and intra-SNOW communications. We then
formulate the tradeoff between scalability and inter-SNOW interference as a
constrained optimization problem whose objective is to maximize scalability by
managing white space spectrum sharing across multiple SNOWs. We also prove the
NP-hardness of this problem. To this extent, We propose an intuitive
polynomial-time heuristic algorithm for solving the scalability optimization
problem which is highly efficient in practice. For the sake of theoretical
bound, we also propose a simple polynomial-time 1/2-approximation algorithm for
the scalability optimization problem. Hardware experiments through deployment
in an area of (25x15)sq. km as well as large scale simulations demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithms and feasibility of achieving scalability
through seamless integration of SNOWs with high reliability, low latency, and
energy efficiency.

Title: Optimal Scheduling of Content Caching Subject to Deadline
Authors: Ghafour Ahani and Di Yuan
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Content caching at the edge of network is a promising technique to alleviate
the burden of backhaul networks. In this paper, we consider content caching
along time in a base station with limited cache capacity. As the popularity of
contents may vary over time, the contents of cache need to be updated
accordingly. In addition, a requested content may have a delivery deadline
within which the content need to be obtained. Motivated by these, we address
optimal scheduling of content caching in a time-slotted system under delivery
deadline and cache capacity constraints. The objective is to minimize a cost
function that captures the load of backhaul links. For our optimization problem
we prove its NP-hardness via a reduction from the Partition problem. For
problem solving, via a mathematical reformulation, we develop a solution
approach based on repeatedly applying a column generation algorithm and a
problem-tailored rounding algorithm. In addition, two greedy algorithms are
developed based on existing algorithms from the literature. Finally, we present
extensive simulations that verify the effectiveness of our solution approach in
obtaining near-to-optimal solutions in comparison to greedy algorithms. The
solutions obtained from our solution approach are within 1% from the global
optimum.

Title: Multi-Armed Bandits for Decentralized AP selection in Enterprise WLANs
Authors: Marc Carrascosa and Boris Bellalta
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  WiFi densification leads to the existence of multiple overlapping coverage
areas, which allows user stations (STAs) to choose between different Access
Points (APs). The standard WiFi association method makes the STAs select the AP
with the strongest signal, which in many cases leads to underutilization of
some APs while overcrowding others. To mitigate this situation, Reinforcement
Learning techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandits can be used to dynamically
learn the optimal mapping between APs and STAs, and so redistribute the STAs
among the available APs accordingly. This is an especially challenging problem
since the network response observed by a given STA depends on the behavior of
the others, and so it is very difficult to predict without a global view of the
network.
  In this paper, we focus on solving this problem in a decentralized way, where
STAs independently explore the different APs inside their coverage range, and
select the one that better satisfy their needs. To do it, we propose a novel
approach called Opportunistic epsilon-greedy with Stickiness that halts the
exploration when a suitable AP is found, only resuming the exploration after
several unsatisfactory association rounds. With this approach, we reduce
significantly the network response dynamics, improving the ability of the STAs
to find a solution faster, as well as achieving a more efficient use of the
network resources.
  We investigate how the characteristics of the scenario (position of the APs
and STAs, traffic loads, and channel allocation strategies) impact the learning
process and the achievable performance. We also show that not all the STAs have
to implement the proposed solution to improve their performance. Finally, we
study the case where stations arrive progressively to the system, showing that
the considered approach is also suitable in such a non-stationary set-up.

Title: Let's Share: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Resource Sharing in Mobile

  Swami and Jian Li
Categories: cs.NI cs.DC cs.MA
Comments: The paper is currently under review in IEEE Transactions on Network
  and Service Management
\\
  Mobile edge computing seeks to provide resources to different delay-sensitive
applications. This is a challenging problem as an edge cloud-service provider
may not have sufficient resources to satisfy all resource requests.
Furthermore, allocating available resources optimally to different applications
is also challenging. Resource sharing among different edge cloud-service
providers can address the aforementioned limitation as certain service
providers may have resources available that can be ``rented'' by other service
providers. However, edge cloud service providers can have different objectives
or \emph{utilities}. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and effective
mechanism to share resources among service providers, while considering the
different objectives of various providers. We model resource sharing as a
multi-objective optimization problem and present a solution framework based on
\emph{Cooperative Game Theory} (CGT). We consider the strategy where each
service provider allocates resources to its native applications first and
shares the remaining resources with applications from other service providers.
We prove that for a monotonic, non-decreasing utility function, the game is
canonical and convex. Hence, the \emph{core} is not empty and the grand
coalition is stable. We propose two algorithms \emph{Game-theoretic Pareto
optimal allocation} (GPOA) and \emph{Polyandrous-Polygamous Matching based
Pareto Optimal Allocation} (PPMPOA) that provide allocations from the core.
Hence the obtained allocations are \emph{Pareto} optimal and the grand
coalition of all the service providers is stable. Experimental results confirm
that our proposed resource sharing framework improves utilities of edge
cloud-service providers and application request satisfaction.

situation for victims, especially accident occurs in highways imposes great

Title: A Noxious Market for Personal Data
Authors: Abdul Abdulrahim and Michael Famoroti
Categories: cs.OH
Comments: Presented at NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on Machine Learning for the
  Developing World
\\
  Many policymakers, academics and governments have advocated for exchangeable
property rights over information as it presents a market solution to what could
be considered a market failure. Particularly in jurisdictions such as Africa,
Asia or South America, where weaker legal protections and fleeting regulatory
enforcement leaves data subjects vulnerable or exploited regardless of the
outcome. We argue that whether we could achieve this personal data economy in
which individuals have ownership rights akin to property rights over their data
should be approached with caution as a solution to ensuring individuals have
agency over their data across different legal landscapes. We present an
objection to the use of property rights, a market solution, due to the
\textit{noxious} nature of personal data - which is founded on Satz and
Sandel's objection to markets.

  This paper illustrates the MIR (Mobile Intelligent Robotics) Vehicle: a
feasible option of transforming an electric ride-on-car into a modular Graphics
Processing Unit (GPU) powered autonomous platform equipped with the capability
that supports test and deployment of various intelligent autonomous vehicles
algorithms. To use a platform for research, two components must be provided:
perception and control. The sensors such as incremental encoders, an Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU), a camera, and a LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR)
must be able to be installed on the platform to add the capability of
environmental perception. A microcontroller-powered control box is designed to
properly respond to the environmental changes by regulating drive and steering
motors. This drive-by-wire capability is controlled by a GPU powered laptop
computer where high-level perception algorithms are processed and complex
actions are generated by various methods including behavior cloning using deep
neural networks. The main goal of this paper is to provide an adequate and
comprehensive approach for fabricating a cost-effective platform that would
contribute to the research quality from the wider community. The proposed
platform is to use a modular and hierarchical software architecture where the
lower and simpler motor controls are taken care of by microcontroller programs,
and the higher and complex algorithms are processed by a GPU powered laptop
computer. The platform uses the Robot Operating System (ROS) as middleware to
maintain the modularity of the perceptions and decision-making modules. It is
expected that the level three and above autonomous vehicle systems and Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can be tested on and deployed to the platform
with a decent real-time system behavior due to the capabilities and
affordability of the proposed platform.

Title: Local Stability of PD Controlled Bipedal Walking Robots
Authors: Shishir Kolathaya
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We establish stability results for PD tracking control laws in bipedal
walking robots. Stability of PD control laws for continuous robotic systems is
an established result, and we extend this for hybrid robotic systems, an
alternating sequence of continuous and discrete events. Bipedal robots have the
leg-swing as the continuous event, and the foot-strike as the discrete event.
In addition, bipeds largely have underactuations due to the interactions
between feet and ground. For each continuous event, we establish that the
convergence rate of the tracking error can be regulated via appropriate tuning
of the PD gains; and for each discrete event, we establish that this
convergence rate sufficiently overcomes the nonlinear impacts by assumptions on
the hybrid zero dynamics. The main contributions are 1) Extension of the
stability results of PD control laws for underactuated robotic systems, and 2)
Exponential ultimate boundedness of hybrid periodic orbits under the assumption
of exponential stability of their projections to the hybrid zero dynamics.
Towards the end, we will validate these results in a 2-link bipedal walker in
simulation.

\\
  Surgical robots have had clinical use since the mid 1990s. Robot-assisted
surgeries offer many benefits over the conventional approach including lower
risk of infection and blood loss, shorter recovery, and an overall safer
procedure for patients. The past few decades have shown many emerging surgical
robotic platforms that can work in complex and confined channels of the
internal human organs and improve the cognitive and physical skills of the
surgeons during the operation. Advanced technologies for sensing, actuation,
and intelligent control have enabled multiple surgical devices to
simultaneously operate within the human body at low cost and with more
efficiency. Despite advances, current surgical intervention systems are not
able to execute autonomous tasks and make cognitive decisions that are
analogous to that of humans. This paper will overview a historical development
of surgery from conventional open to robotic-assisted approaches with
discussion on the capabilities of advanced intelligent systems and devices that
are currently implemented in existing surgical robotic systems. It will also
revisit available autonomous surgical platforms with comments on the essential
technologies, existing challenges, and suggestions for the future development
of intelligent robotic-assisted surgical systems towards the achievement of
fully autonomous operation.

Title: Close-Proximity Underwater Terrain Mapping Using Learning-based Coarse
  Range Estimation
Authors: Bilal Arain, Feras Dayoub, Paul Rigby, Matthew Dunbabin
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages, 13 figures, submitted to IEEE RA-L
\\
  This paper presents a novel approach to underwater terrain mapping for
Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) operating in close proximity to complex
3D environments. The approach leverages a coarse learning-based scene range
estimator from monocular images, which can filter transient objects such as
fish and lighting aberrations. The proposed methodology then creates a
probabilistic elevation map of the terrain using a learning-based scene range
estimator as a sensor. The approach considers uncertainty in estimated scene
range and robot pose as the AUV moves through the environment. The resulting
elevation map can be used for reactive path planning and obstacle avoidance to
allow robotic systems to follow the underwater terrain as closely as possible.
The performance of our approach is evaluated in simulation by comparing the
reconstructed terrain to ground truth reference maps in an photo-realistic
underwater environment. The method is also demonstrated using field data
collected within a coral reef environment by an AUV.

  As the aging population grows at a rapid rate, there is an ever growing need
for service robot platforms that can provide daily assistance at practical
speed with reliable performance. In order to assist with daily tasks such as
fetching a beverage, a service robot must be able to perceive its environment
and generate corresponding motion trajectories. This becomes a challenging and
computationally complex problem when the environment is unknown and thus the
path planner must sample numerous trajectories that often are sub-optimal,
extending the execution time. To address this issue, we propose a unique
strategy of integrating a 3D object detection pipeline with a kinematically
optimal manipulation planner to significantly increase speed performance at
runtime. In addition, we develop a new robotic butler system for a wheeled
humanoid that is capable of fetching requested objects at 24% of the speed a
human needs to fulfill the same task. The proposed system was evaluated and
demonstrated in a real-world environment setup as well as in public exhibition.

Title: Motion Generation Interface of ROS to PODO Software Framework for
  Wheeled Huamanoid Robot
Authors: Moonyoung Lee, Yujin Heo, Saihim Cho, Hyunsub Park, Jun-Ho Oh
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: IEEE Int. Conf. on Advanced Robotics (ICAR), 2019
\\
  This paper discusses the development of robot motion generation interface
between a real-time software architecture and a non-real-time robot operating
system. In order for robots to execute intelligent manipulation or navigation,
close integration of high-level perception and low-level control is required.
However, many available open-source perception modules are developed in ROS,
which operates on Linux OS that don't guarantee RT performance. This can lead
to non-deterministic responses and stability problems that can adversely affect
robot control. As a result, many robotic systems devote RTOS for low-level
motion control. Similarly, the humanoid robot platform developed at KAIST,
Hubo, utilizes a custom real-time software framework called PODO. Although PODO
provides easy interface for motion generation, it lacks interface to high-level
frameworks such as ROS. As such, we present a new motion generation interface
between ROS and PODO that enables users to generate motion trajectories through
standard ROS messages while leveraging a real-time motion controller. With the
proposed communication interface, we demonstrate series of manipulator tasks on
the actual wheeled humanoid platform, M-Hubo. The overall communication
interface responsiveness was at most 27 milliseconds.

Title: From Drinking Philosophers to Wandering Robots
Authors: Yunus Emre Sahin, Necmiye Ozay
Categories: cs.RO cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 13 pages, 7 figures. Under submission for a journal
\\
  In this paper, we consider the multi-robot path execution problem where a
group of robots move on predefined paths from their initial to target positions
while avoiding collisions and deadlocks in the face of asynchrony. We first
show that this problem can be reformulated as a distributed resource allocation
problem and, in particular, as an instance of the well-known Drinking
Philosophers Problem (DrPP). By careful construction of the drinking sessions
capturing shared resources, we show that any existing solutions to DrPP can be
used to design robot control policies that are collectively collision and
deadlock-free. We then propose modifications to an existing DrPP algorithm to
allow more concurrent behavior, and provide conditions under which our method
is deadlock-free. Our method do not require robots to know or to estimate the
speed profiles of other robots, and results in distributed control policies. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our method on simulation examples, which show
competitive performance against the state-of-the-art.

Title: Phase-based Information for Voice Pathology Detection
Authors: Thomas Drugman, Thomas Dubuisson, Thierry Dutoit
Categories: cs.SD cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  In most current approaches of speech processing, information is extracted
from the magnitude spectrum. However recent perceptual studies have underlined
the importance of the phase component. The goal of this paper is to investigate
the potential of using phase-based features for automatically detecting voice
disorders. It is shown that group delay functions are appropriate for
characterizing irregularities in the phonation. Besides the respect of the
mixed-phase model of speech is discussed. The proposed phase-based features are
evaluated and compared to other parameters derived from the magnitude spectrum.
Both streams are shown to be interestingly complementary. Furthermore
phase-based features turn out to convey a great amount of relevant information,
leading to high discrimination performance.

Title: Deep Representation Learning in Speech Processing: Challenges, Recent
  Advances, and Future Trends
Authors: Siddique Latif, Rajib Rana, Sara Khalifa, Raja Jurdak, Junaid Qadir,
  and Bj\"orn W. Schuller
Categories: cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS
\\
  Research on speech processing has traditionally considered the task of
designing hand-engineered acoustic features (feature engineering) as a separate
distinct problem from the task of designing efficient machine learning (ML)
models to make prediction and classification decisions. There are two main
drawbacks to this approach: firstly, the feature engineering being manual is
cumbersome and requires human knowledge; and secondly, the designed features
might not be best for the objective at hand. This has motivated the adoption of
a recent trend in speech community towards utilisation of representation
learning techniques, which can learn an intermediate representation of the
input signal automatically that better suits the task at hand and hence lead to
improved performance. The significance of representation learning has increased
with advances in deep learning (DL), where the representations are more useful
and less dependent on human knowledge, making it very conducive for tasks like
classification, prediction, etc. The main contribution of this paper is to
present an up-to-date and comprehensive survey on different techniques of
speech representation learning by bringing together the scattered research
across three distinct research areas including Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), Speaker Recognition (SR), and Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER). Recent
reviews in speech have been conducted for ASR, SR, and SER, however, none of
these has focused on the representation learning from speech---a gap that our
survey aims to bridge.

Title: Temporal-Spatial Neural Filter: Direction Informed End-to-End
  Multi-channel Target Speech Separation
Authors: Rongzhi Gu and Yuexian Zou
Categories: cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS
\\
  Target speech separation refers to extracting the target speaker's speech
from mixed signals. Despite the recent advances in deep learning based
close-talk speech separation, the applications to real-world are still an open
issue. Two main challenges are the complex acoustic environment and the
real-time processing requirement. To address these challenges, we propose a
temporal-spatial neural filter, which directly estimates the target speech
waveform from multi-speaker mixture in reverberant environments, assisted with
directional information of the speaker(s). Firstly, against variations brought
by complex environment, the key idea is to increase the acoustic representation
completeness through the jointly modeling of temporal, spectral and spatial
discriminability between the target and interference source. Specifically,
temporal, spectral, spatial along with the designed directional features are
integrated to create a joint acoustic representation. Secondly, to reduce the
latency, we design a fully-convolutional autoencoder framework, which is purely
end-to-end and single-pass. All the feature computation is implemented by the
network layers and operations to speed up the separation procedure. Evaluation
is conducted on simulated reverberant dataset WSJ0-2mix and WSJ0-3mix under
speaker-independent scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning based multi-channel
approaches with fewer parameters and faster processing speed. Furthermore, the
proposed temporal-spatial neural filter can handle mixtures with varying and
unknown number of speakers and exhibits persistent performance even when
existing a direction estimation error. Codes and models will be released soon.

Title: Detection of Glottal Closure Instants from Speech Signals: a
  Quantitative Review
Authors: Thomas Drugman, Mark Thomas, Jon Gudnason, Patrick Naylor, Thierry
  Dutoit
Categories: cs.SD cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  The pseudo-periodicity of voiced speech can be exploited in several speech
processing applications. This requires however that the precise locations of
the Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs) are available. The focus of this paper is
the evaluation of automatic methods for the detection of GCIs directly from the
speech waveform. Five state-of-the-art GCI detection algorithms are compared
using six different databases with contemporaneous electroglottographic
recordings as ground truth, and containing many hours of speech by multiple
speakers. The five techniques compared are the Hilbert Envelope-based detection
(HE), the Zero Frequency Resonator-based method (ZFR), the Dynamic Programming
Phase Slope Algorithm (DYPSA), the Speech Event Detection using the Residual
Excitation And a Mean-based Signal (SEDREAMS) and the Yet Another GCI Algorithm
(YAGA). The efficacy of these methods is first evaluated on clean speech, both
in terms of reliabililty and accuracy. Their robustness to additive noise and
to reverberation is also assessed. A further contribution of the paper is the
evaluation of their performance on a concrete application of speech processing:
the causal-anticausal decomposition of speech. It is shown that for clean
speech, SEDREAMS and YAGA are the best performing techniques, both in terms of
identification rate and accuracy. ZFR and SEDREAMS also show a superior
robustness to additive noise and reverberation.

Title: Pre-trained Contextual Embedding of Source Code
Authors: Aditya Kanade, Petros Maniatis, Gogul Balakrishnan, Kensen Shi
Categories: cs.SE cs.CL cs.LG cs.PL
\\
  The source code of a program not only serves as a formal description of an
executable task, but it also serves to communicate developer intent in a
human-readable form. To facilitate this, developers use meaningful identifier
names and natural-language documentation. This makes it possible to
successfully apply sequence-modeling approaches, shown to be effective in
natural-language processing, to source code. A major advancement in
natural-language understanding has been the use of pre-trained token
embeddings; BERT and other works have further shown that pre-trained contextual
embeddings can be extremely powerful and can be fine-tuned effectively for a
variety of downstream supervised tasks. Inspired by these developments, we
present the first attempt to replicate this success on source code. We curate a
massive corpus of Python programs from GitHub to pre-train a BERT model, which
we call Code Understanding BERT (CuBERT). We also pre-train Word2Vec embeddings
on the same dataset. We create a benchmark of five classification tasks and
compare fine-tuned CuBERT against sequence models trained with and without the
Word2Vec embeddings. Our results show that CuBERT outperforms the baseline
methods by a margin of 2.9-22%. We also show its superiority when fine-tuned
with smaller datasets, and over fewer epochs. We further evaluate CuBERT's
effectiveness on a joint classification, localization and repair task involving
prediction of two pointers.

Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Different from traditional software development, there is little information
about the software-engineering process and techniques in video-game
development. One popular way to share knowledge among the video-game
developers' community is the publishing of postmortems, which are documents
summarizing what happened during the video-game development project. However,
these documents are written without formal structure and often providing
disparate information. Through this paper, we provide developers and
researchers with grounded dataset describing software-engineering problems in
video-game development extracted from postmortems. We created the dataset using
an iterative method through which we manually coded more than 200 postmortems
spanning 20 years (1998 to 2018) and extracted 1,035 problems related to
software engineering while maintaining traceability links to the postmortems.
We grouped the problems in 20 different types. This dataset is useful to
understand the problems faced by developers during video-game development,
providing researchers and practitioners a starting point to study video-game
development in the context of software engineering.

Title: Monte Carlo Techniques for Approximating the Myerson Value --
  Theoretical and Empirical Analysis
Authors: Mateusz K. Tarkowski, Szymon Matejczyk, Tomasz P. Michalak, and
  Michael Wooldridge
Categories: cs.SI cs.GT
\\
  Myerson first introduced graph-restricted games in order to model the
interaction of cooperative players with an underlying communication network. A
dedicated solution concept -- the Myerson value -- is perhaps the most
important normative solution concept for cooperative games on graphs.
Unfortunately, its computation is computationally challenging. In particular,
although exact algorithms have been proposed, they must traverse all connected
coalitions of the graph of which there may be exponentially many. In this
paper, we consider the issue of approximating the Myerson value for arbitrary
graphs and characteristic functions. While Monte Carlo approximations have been
proposed for the related concept of the Shapley value, their suitability for
the Myerson value has not been studied. Given this, we evaluate and compare
(both theoretically and empiraclly) three Monte Carlo sampling methods for the
Myerson value: conventional method of sampling permutations; a new, hybrid
algorithm that combines exact computations and sampling; and sampling of
connected coalitions. We find that our hybrid algorithm performs very well and
also significantly improves on the conventional methods.

Title: Inf-VAE: A Variational Autoencoder Framework to Integrate Homophily and
  Influence in Diffusion Prediction
Authors: Aravind Sankar, Xinyang Zhang, Adit Krishnan, Jiawei Han
Categories: cs.SI cs.LG
Comments: International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2020)
\\
  Recent years have witnessed tremendous interest in understanding and
predicting information spread on social media platforms such as Twitter,
Facebook, etc. Existing diffusion prediction methods primarily exploit the
sequential order of influenced users by projecting diffusion cascades onto
their local social neighborhoods. However, this fails to capture global social
structures that do not explicitly manifest in any of the cascades, resulting in
poor performance for inactive users with limited historical activities.
  In this paper, we present a novel variational autoencoder framework (Inf-VAE)
to jointly embed homophily and influence through proximity-preserving social
and position-encoded temporal latent variables. To model social homophily,
Inf-VAE utilizes powerful graph neural network architectures to learn social
variables that selectively exploit the social connections of users. Given a
sequence of seed user activations, Inf-VAE uses a novel expressive co-attentive
fusion network that jointly attends over their social and temporal variables to
predict the set of all influenced users. Our experimental results on multiple
real-world social network datasets, including Digg, Weibo, and Stack-Exchanges
demonstrate significant gains (22% MAP@10) for Inf-VAE over state-of-the-art
diffusion prediction models; we achieve massive gains for users with sparse
activities, and users who lack direct social neighbors in seed sets.

Title: Towards Improving the Performance of the RNN-based Inversion Model in
  Output Tracking Control
Authors: Shengwen Xie and Juan Ren
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 7 pages, submitted to ACC2020
\\
  With the advantages of high modeling accuracy and large bandwidth, recurrent
neural network (RNN) based inversion model control has been proposed for output
tracking. However, some issues still need to be addressed when using the
RNN-based inversion model. First, with limited number of parameters in RNN, it
cannot model the low-frequency dynamics accurately, thus an extra linear model
has been used, which can become an interference for tracking control at high
frequencies. Moreover, the control speed and the RNN modeling accuracy cannot
be improved simultaneously as the control sampling speed is restricted by the
length of the RNN training set. Therefore, this article focuses on addressing
these limitations of RNN-based inversion model control. Specifically, a novel
modeling method is proposed to incorporate the linear model in a way that it
does not affect the existing high-frequency control performance achieved by
RNN. Additionally, an interpolation method is proposed to double the sampling
frequency (compared to the RNN training sampling frequency). Analysis on the
stability issues which may arise when the proposed new model is used for
predictive control is presented along with the instructions on determining the
parameters for ensuring the closed-loop stability. Finally, the proposed
approach is demonstrated on a commercial piezo actuator, and the experiment
results show that the tracking performances can be significantly improved.

  Increasing penetration of renewable energy introduces significant uncertainty
into power systems. Traditional simulation-based verification methods may not
be applicable due to the unknown-but-bounded feature of the uncertainty sets.
Emerging set-theoretic methods have been intensively investigated to tackle
this challenge. The paper comprehensively reviews these methods categorized by
underlying mathematical principles, that is, set operation-based methods and
passivity-based methods. Set operation-based methods are more computationally
efficient, while passivity-based methods provide semi-analytical expression of
reachable sets, which can be readily employed for control. Other features
between different methods are also discussed and illustrated by numerical
examples. A benchmark example is presented and solved by different methods to
verify consistency.

  It is envisioned that, in the future, most vehicles on our roadway will be
controlled autonomously and will be connected via vehicle to everything (V2X)
wireless communication networks. Developing a connected and automated vehicle
(CAV) longitudinal controller, which will consider safety, comfort and
operational efficiency simultaneously, is a challenge. A CAV longitudinal
controller is a complex system where a vehicle senses immediate upstream
vehicles using its sensors and receives information about its surroundings via
wireless connectivity, and move forward accordingly. In this study, we develop
an information-aware driver model (IADM) that utilizes information regarding an
immediate upstream vehicle of a subject CAV through CAV sensors and V2X
connectivity while considering passenger comfort and operational efficiency
along with maintaining safety gap for longitudinal vehicle motion of the
autonomous vehicle. Unlike existing driver models for longitudinal control, the
IADM intelligently fuses data received from in vehicle sensors, and immediate
upstream vehicles of the subject CAV through wireless connectivity, and IADM
parameters do not need to be calibrated for different traffic states, such as
congested and non congested traffic conditions. It only requires defining the
subject CAVs maximum acceleration and deceleration limit, and computation time
that is needed to update the subject CAVs trajectory from its previous state.
Our analyses suggest that the IADM (i) is able to maintain safety using a newly
defined safe gap function depending on the speed and reaction time of a CAV;
(ii) shows local stability and string stability and (iii) provides riding
comfort for a range of autonomous driving aggressiveness depending on the
passenger preferences.

Title: Single-Bit Consensus with Finite-Time Convergence: Theory and
  Applications
Authors: Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian
Categories: eess.SY cs.MA cs.SY
Journal-ref: IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems 2020
\\
  In this brief paper, a new consensus protocol based on the sign of
innovations is proposed. Based on this protocol each agent only requires
single-bit of information about its relative state to its neighboring agents.
This is significant in real-time applications, since it requires less
computation and/or communication load on agents. Using Lyapunov stability
theorem the convergence is proved for networks having a spanning tree. Further,
the convergence is shown to be in finite-time, which is significant as compared
to most asymptotic protocols in the literature. Time-variant network topologies
are also considered in this paper, and final consensus value is derived for
undirected networks. Applications of the proposed consensus protocol in (i)
2D/3D rendezvous task, (ii) distributed estimation, (iii) distributed
optimization, and (iv) formation control are considered and significance of
applying this protocol is discussed. Numerical simulations are provided to
compare the protocol with the existing protocols in the literature.

Title: Stability of Multi-Dimensional Switched Systems with an Application to
  Open Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Mengqi Xue, Yang Tang, Wei Ren, and Feng Qian
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 12 pages, 9 figures
\\
  A multi-dimensional switched system (MDSS) contains subsystems of different
state dimensions. By modeling the state transition at certain switching instant
as the combination of dimension variations and state impulses, the stability of
the MDSS is investigated. %The impulses are further divided into two types,
i.e., the pre-switching-state (PSS) dependent and the PSS-independent impulses.
Sufficient conditions featuring the new transition-dependent average dwell time
(TDADT) and the piecewise TDADT methods are provided to guarantee the
corresponding stability performance under two different impulse types and
different stability conditions for subsystems. %The existence of such
conditions is also proved with the aid of the proposed dynamical multiple
Lyapunov functions for the linear MDSS. By virtue of the proposed MDSS
framework, the consensus problems for the open multi-agent system (MAS)
featuring agent circulation are studied. It shows that the agent circulation
that results in a switching and size-varying communication topology can be well
captured by the state transition mechanism for the MDSS. Therefore, the
consensus problems of an open MAS can be readily converted to the corresponding
stability problems of the MDSS. The simulation example illustrates the
effectiveness of the proposed methods as well as the feasibility of the
application.

Title: Vehicle Platooning Impact on Drag Coefficients and Energy/Fuel Saving
  Implications
Authors: Ahmed A. Hussein and Hesham A. Rakha
Categories: eess.SY cs.MA cs.SY
Comments: In review in the Journal of Applied Energy
\\
  In this paper, empirical data from the literature are used to develop general
power models that capture the impact of a vehicle position, in a platoon of
homogeneous vehicles, and the distance gap to its lead (and following) vehicle
on its drag coefficient. These models are developed for light duty vehicles,
buses, and heavy duty trucks. The models were fit using a constrained
optimization framework to fit a general power function using either direct drag
force or fuel measurements. The model is then used to extrapolate the empirical
measurements to a wide range of vehicle distance gaps within a platoon. Using
these models we estimate the potential fuel reduction associated with
homogeneous platoons of light duty vehicles, buses, and heavy duty trucks. The
results show a significant reduction in the vehicle fuel consumption when
compared with those based on a constant drag coefficient assumption.
Specifically, considering a minimum time gap between vehicles of $0.5 \; secs$
(which is typical considering state-of-practice communication and mechanical
system latencies) running at a speed of $100 \; km/hr$, the optimum fuel
reduction that is achieved is $4.5 \%$, $15.5 \%$, and $7.0 \%$ for light duty
vehicle, bus, and heavy duty truck platoons, respectively. For longer time
gaps, the bus and heavy duty truck platoons still produce fuel reductions in
the order of $9.0 \%$ and $4.5 \%$, whereas light duty vehicles produce
negligible fuel savings.

Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2020
\\
  We analyze the Gambler's problem, a simple reinforcement learning problem
where the gambler has the chance to double or lose their bets until the target
is reached. This is an early example introduced in the reinforcement learning
textbook by Sutton and Barto (2018), where they mention an interesting pattern
of the optimal value function with high-frequency components and repeating
non-smooth points. It is however without further investigation. We provide the
exact formula for the optimal value function for both the discrete and the
continuous cases. Though simple as it might seem, the value function is
pathological: fractal, self-similar, derivative taking either zero or infinity,
not smooth on any interval, and not written as elementary functions. It is in
fact one of the generalized Cantor functions, where it holds a complexity that
has been uncharted thus far. Our analyses could lead insights into improving
value function approximation, gradient-based algorithms, and Q-learning, in
real applications and implementations.

Title: Reinforcement Quantum Annealing: A Quantum-Assisted Learning Automata
  Approach
Authors: Ramin Ayanzadeh, Milton Halem and Tim Finin
Categories: quant-ph cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  We introduce the reinforcement quantum annealing (RQA) scheme in which an
intelligent agent interacts with a quantum annealer that plays the stochastic
environment role of learning automata and tries to iteratively find better
Ising Hamiltonians for the given problem of interest. As a proof-of-concept, we
propose a novel approach for reducing the NP-complete problem of Boolean
satisfiability (SAT) to minimizing Ising Hamiltonians and show how to apply the
RQA for increasing the probability of finding the global optimum. Our
experimental results on two different benchmark SAT problems (namely factoring
pseudo-prime numbers and random SAT with phase transitions), using a D-Wave
2000Q quantum processor, demonstrated that RQA finds notably better solutions
with fewer samples, compared to state-of-the-art techniques in the realm of
quantum annealing.

\\
  Random quantum circuits are commonly viewed as hard to simulate classically.
In some regimes this has been formally conjectured, and there had been no
evidence against the more general possibility that for circuits with uniformly
random gates, approximate simulation of typical instances is almost as hard as
exact simulation. We prove that this is not the case by exhibiting a shallow
circuit family with uniformly random gates that cannot be efficiently
classically simulated near-exactly under standard hardness assumptions, but can
be simulated approximately for all but a superpolynomially small fraction of
circuit instances in time linear in the number of qubits and gates. We
furthermore conjecture that sufficiently shallow random circuits are
efficiently simulable more generally. To this end, we propose and analyze two
simulation algorithms. Implementing one of our algorithms numerically, we give
strong evidence that it is efficient both asymptotically and, in some cases, in
practice. To argue analytically for efficiency, we reduce the simulation of 2D
shallow random circuits to the simulation of a form of 1D dynamics consisting
of alternating rounds of random local unitaries and weak measurements -- a type
of process that has generally been observed to undergo a phase transition from
an efficient-to-simulate regime to an inefficient-to-simulate regime as
measurement strength is varied. Using a mapping from quantum circuits to
statistical mechanical models, we give evidence that a similar computational
phase transition occurs for our algorithms as parameters of the circuit
architecture like the local Hilbert space dimension and circuit depth are
varied.

Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Smart Grid, an intelligent connected grid consisting of millions of smart
devices, used to collect data from the grid to improve the efficiency of its
operation. These smart devices communicating wirelessly are susceptible to
attacks and hence the security and privacy of the smart devices along with the
smart grid is a major challenge. Blockchain-based systems provide improved
security and privacy and hence gained a lot of attention in the recent past.
This paper proposes a blockchain-based architecture for Neighborhood Area
Networks (NANs) and Home Area networks (HANs) in Smart Grid. The paper presents
a security analysis in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability to
show that the proposed blockchain-based Smart Grid architecture is secure.
Also, the impact of the improved security on packet delays, energy and
computational overhead is discussed.

Title: Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning

\\
  Adversarial machine learning is an emerging field that focuses on studying
vulnerabilities of machine learning approaches in adversarial settings and
developing techniques accordingly to make learning robust to adversarial
manipulations. It plays a vital role in various machine learning applications
and has attracted tremendous attention across different communities recently.
In this paper, we explore different adversarial scenarios in the context of
quantum machine learning. We find that, similar to traditional classifiers
based on classical neural networks, quantum learning systems are likewise
vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, independent of whether the input
data is classical or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier
that achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively deceived
by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible perturbations to the
original legitimate samples. This is explicitly demonstrated with quantum
adversarial learning in different scenarios, including classifying real-life
images (e.g., handwritten digit images in the dataset MNIST), learning phases
of matter (such as, ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected
topological phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that
based on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical defense
strategies can be designed to fight against a number of different attacks. Our
results uncover the notable vulnerability of quantum machine learning systems
to adversarial perturbations, which not only reveals a novel perspective in
bridging machine learning and quantum physics in theory but also provides
valuable guidance for practical applications of quantum classifiers based on
both near-term and future quantum technologies.

Title: Non-rigid Registration Method between 3D CT Liver Data and 2D Ultrasonic

Authors: Shuo Huang, Ke wu, Xiaolin Meng and Cheng Li
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  The non-rigid registration between CT data and ultrasonic images of liver can
facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, which has been widely studied in recent
years. To improve the registration accuracy of the Demons model on the
non-rigid registration between 3D CT liver data and 2D ultrasonic images, a
novel boundary extraction and enhancement method based on radial directional
local intuitionistic fuzzy entropy in the polar coordinates has been put
forward, and a new registration workflow has been provided. Experiments show
that our method can acquire high-accuracy registration results. Experiments
also show that the accuracy of the results of our method is higher than that of
the original Demons method and the Demons method using simulated ultrasonic
image by Field II. The operation time of our registration workflow is about 30
seconds, and it can be used in the surgery.

Title: Simulation of Skin Stretching around the Forehead Wrinkles in
  Rhytidectomy
Authors: Ping Zhou, Shuo Huang, Qiang Chen, Siyuan He, Guochao Cai
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV physics.med-ph
\\
  Objective: Skin stretching around the forehead wrinkles is an important
method in rhytidectomy. Proper parameters are required to evaluate the surgical
effect. In this paper, a simulation method was proposed to obtain the
parameters. Methods: Three-dimensional point cloud data with a resolution of 50
{\mu}m were employed. First, a smooth supporting contour under the wrinkled
forehead was generated via b-spline interpolation and extrapolation to
constrain the deformation of the wrinkled zone. Then, based on the vector
formed intrinsic finite element (VFIFE) algorithm, the simulation was
implemented in Matlab for the deformation of wrinkled forehead skin in the
stretching process. Finally, the stress distribution and the residual wrinkles
of forehead skin were employed to evaluate the surgical effect. Results:
Although the residual wrinkles are similar when forehead wrinkles are finitely
stretched, their stress distribution changes greatly. This indicates that the
stress distribution in the skin is effective to evaluate the surgical effect,
and the forehead wrinkles are easily to be overstretched, which may lead to
potential skin injuries. Conclusion: The simulation method can predict stress
distribution and residual wrinkles after forehead wrinkle stretching surgery,
which can be potentially used to control the surgical process and further
reduce risks of skin injury.

  The total variation method is widely used in image noise suppression.
However, this method is easy to cause the loss of image details, and it is also
sensitive to parameters such as iteration time. In this work, the total
variation method has been modified using a diffusion rate adjuster based on the
phase congruency and a fusion filter of median filter and phase consistency
boundary, which is called the MPC-TV method. Experimental results indicate that
MPC-TV method is effective in noise suppression, especially for the removing of
speckle noise, and it can also improve the robustness of iteration time of TV
method on noise with different variance.

\\
  Accurate identification and localization of the vertebrae in CT scans is a
critical and standard preprocessing step for clinical spinal diagnosis and
treatment. Existing methods are mainly based on the integration of multiple
neural networks, and most of them use the Gaussian heat map to locate the
vertebrae's centroid. However, the process of obtaining the vertebrae's
centroid coordinates using heat maps is non-differentiable, so it is impossible
to train the network to label the vertebrae directly. Therefore, for end-to-end
differential training of vertebra coordinates on CT scans, a robust and
accurate automatic vertebral labeling algorithm is proposed in this study.
Firstly, a novel residual-based multi-label classification and localization
network is developed, which can capture multi-scale features, but also utilize
the residual module and skip connection to fuse the multi-level features.
Secondly, to solve the problem that the process of finding coordinates is
non-differentiable and the spatial structure is not destructible, integral
regression module is used in the localization network. It combines the
advantages of heat map representation and direct regression coordinates to
achieve end-to-end training, and can be compatible with any key point detection
methods of medical image based on heat map. Finally, multi-label classification
of vertebrae is carried out, which use bidirectional long short term memory
(Bi-LSTM) to enhance the learning of long contextual information to improve the
classification performance. The proposed method is evaluated on a challenging
dataset and the results are significantly better than the state-of-the-art
methods (mean localization error <3mm).

\\
  Histopathology tissue analysis is considered the gold standard in cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. Given the large size of these images and the increase
in the number of potential cancer cases, an automated solution as an aid to
histopathologists is highly desirable. In the recent past, deep learning-based
techniques have provided state of the art results in a wide variety of image
analysis tasks, including analysis of digitized slides. However, the size of
images and variability in histopathology tasks makes it a challenge to develop
an integrated framework for histopathology image analysis. We propose a deep
learning-based framework for histopathology tissue analysis. We demonstrate the
generalizability of our framework, including training and inference, on several
open-source datasets, which include CAMELYON (breast cancer metastases),
DigestPath (colon cancer), and PAIP (liver cancer) datasets. We discuss
multiple types of uncertainties pertaining to data and model, namely aleatoric
and epistemic, respectively. Simultaneously, we demonstrate our model
generalization across different data distribution by evaluating some samples on
TCGA data. On CAMELYON16 test data (n=139) for the task of lesion detection,
the FROC score achieved was 0.86 and in the CAMELYON17 test-data (n=500) for
the task of pN-staging the Cohen's kappa score achieved was 0.9090 (third in
the open leaderboard). On DigestPath test data (n=212) for the task of tumor
segmentation, a Dice score of 0.782 was achieved (fourth in the challenge). On
PAIP test data (n=40) for the task of viable tumor segmentation, a Jaccard
Index of 0.75 (third in the challenge) was achieved, and for viable tumor
burden, a score of 0.633 was achieved (second in the challenge). Our entire
framework and related documentation are freely available at GitHub and PyPi.

Title: Joint Unsupervised Learning for the Vertebra Segmentation, Artifact

Authors: Yuanyuan Lyu, Haofu Liao, Heqin Zhu, S. Kevin Zhou

Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to CVPR 2020, under review
\\
  We investigate the unsupervised learning of the vertebra segmentation,
artifact reduction and modality translation of CBCT images. To this end, we
formulate this problem under a unified framework that jointly addresses these
three tasks and intensively leverages the knowledge sharing. The unsupervised
learning of this framework is enabled by 1) a novel shape-aware artifact
disentanglement network that supports different forms of image synthesis and
vertebra segmentation and 2) a deliberate fusion of knowledge from an
independent CT dataset. Specifically, the proposed framework takes a random
pair of CBCT and CT images as the input, and manipulates the synthesis and
segmentation via different combinations of the decodings of the disentangled
latent codes. Then, by discovering various forms of consistencies between the
synthesized images and segmented , the learning is achieved via self-learning
from the given CBCT and CT images obviating the need for the paired (i.e.,
anatomically identical) groundtruth data. Extensive experiments on clinical
CBCT and CT datasets show that the proposed approach performs significantly
better than other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods trained independently
for each task and, remarkably, the proposed approach achieves a dice
coefficient of 0.879 for unsupervised CBCT vertebra segmentation.

Title: DuDoNet++: Encoding mask projection to reduce CT metal artifacts
Authors: Yuanyuan Lyu, Wei-An Lin, Jingjing Lu, S. Kevin Zhou
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: Submitted to CVPR 2020, under review
\\
  CT metal artifact reduction (MAR) is a notoriously challenging task because
the artifacts are structured and non-local in the image domain. However, they
are inherently local in the sinogram domain. DuDoNet is the state-of-the-art
MAR algorithm which exploits the latter characteristic by learning to reduce
artifacts in the sinogram and image domain jointly. By design, DuDoNet treats
the metal-affected regions in sinogram as missing and replaces them with the
surrogate data generated by a neural network. Since fine-grained details within
the metal-affected regions are completely ignored, the artifact-reduced CT
images by DuDoNet tend to be over-smoothed and distorted. In this work, we
investigate the issue by theoretical derivation. We propose to address the
problem by (1) retaining the metal-affected regions in sinogram and (2)
replacing the binarized metal trace with the metal mask projection such that
the geometry information of metal implants is encoded. Extensive experiments on
simulated datasets and expert evaluations on clinical images demonstrate that
our network called DuDoNet++ yields anatomically more precise artifact-reduced
images than DuDoNet, especially when the metallic objects are large.

Title: Restricting the Flow: Information Bottlenecks for Attribution
Authors: Karl Schulz, Leon Sixt, Federico Tombari, Tim Landgraf
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  Attribution methods provide insights into the decision-making of machine
learning models like artificial neural networks. For a given input sample, they
assign a relevance score to each individual input variable, such as the pixels
of an image. In this work we adapt the information bottleneck concept for
attribution. By adding noise to intermediate feature maps we restrict the flow
of information and can quantify (in bits) how much information image regions
provide. We compare our method against ten baselines using three different
metrics on VGG-16 and ResNet-50, and find that our methods outperform all
baselines in five out of six settings. The method's information-theoretic
foundation provides an absolute frame of reference for attribution values
(bits) and a guarantee that regions scored close to zero are not necessary for
the network's decision.

Title: Kalman Filtering and Expectation Maximization for Multitemporal Spectral
  Unmixing
Authors: Ricardo Augusto Borsoi, Tales Imbiriba, Pau Closas, Jos\'e Carlos
  Moreira Bermudez, C\'edric Richard
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  The recent evolution of hyperspectral imaging technology and the
proliferation of new emerging applications presses for the processing of
multiple temporal hyperspectral images. In this work, we propose a novel
spectral unmixing (SU) strategy using physically motivated parametric endmember
representations to account for temporal spectral variability. By representing
the multitemporal mixing process using a state-space formulation, we are able
to exploit the Bayesian filtering machinery to estimate the endmember
variability coefficients. Moreover, by assuming that the temporal variability
of the abundances is small over short intervals, an efficient implementation of
the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the
abundances and the other model parameters. Simulation results indicate that the
proposed strategy outperforms state-of-the-art multitemporal SU algorithms.

Title: Physically Plausible Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images
Authors: Yi-Tun Lin, Graham D. Finlayson
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Recently Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been used to reconstruct
hyperspectral information from RGB images. Moreover, this spectral
reconstruction problem (SR) can often be solved with good (low) error. However,
these methods are not physically plausible: that is when the recovered spectra
are reintegrated with the underlying camera sensitivities, the resulting
predicted RGB is not the same as the actual RGB, and sometimes this discrepancy
can be large. The problem is further compounded by exposure change. Indeed,
most learning-based SR models train for a fixed exposure setting and we show
that this can result in poor performance when exposure varies.
  In this paper we show how CNN learning can be extended so that physical
plausibility is enforced and the problem resulting from changing exposures is
mitigated. Our SR solution improves the state-of-the-art spectral recovery
performance under varying exposure conditions while simultaneously ensuring
physical plausibility (the recovered spectra reintegrate to the input RGBs
exactly).

Title: Talent, Luck, Context and Perspective on Success: a disaggregating
  simulation using Risk
Authors: Bernardo Alves Furtado
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.CY cs.MA
Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures
ACM-class: I.6
\\
  We propose a controlled simulation within a competitive sum-zero environment
as a proxy for disaggregating components of success. Given a simulation of the
Risk board game, we consider (a) talent to be one of three rule-based
strategies; (b) context as the setting of each run with opponents' strategies,
goals and luck; and (c) perspective as the objective of each player. Success is
attained when a first player conquers its goal. We simulate 100,000 runs of an
agent-based model and analyze the results. The simulation results strongly
suggest that luck, talent and context are all relevant to determine success.
Perspective -- as the description of the goal that defines success -- is not.
As such, we present a quantitative, reproducible environment in which we are
able to significantly separate the concepts, reproducing previous results and
adding arguments for context and perspective. Finally, we also find that
resilience and opportunity might be examined within the simulation provided.

Title: On finite width questionable representations of orders
Authors: Laurent Lyaudet
Categories: math.CO cs.DM cs.LO
Comments: 50 pages
\\
  In this article, we study "questionable representations" of (partial or
total) orders, introduced in our previous article "A class of orders with
linear? time sorting algorithm". (Later, we consider arbitrary binary
functional/relational structures instead of orders.) A "question" is the first
difference between two sequences (with ordinal index) of elements of
orders/sets. In finite width "questionable representations" of an order O,
comparison can be solved by looking at the "question" that compares elements of
a finite order O'. A corollary of a theorem by Cantor (1895)is that all
countable total orders have a binary (width 2) questionable representation. We
find new classes of orders on which testing isomorphism or counting the number
of linear extensions can be done in polynomial time. We also present a
generalization of questionable-width, called balanced tree-questionable-width,
and show that if a class of binary structures has bounded tree-width or
clique-width, then it has bounded balanced tree-questionable-width. But there
are classes of graphs of bounded balanced tree-questionable-width and unbounded
tree-width or clique-width.

Title: Constructive Characterization for Bidirected Analogue of Critical Graphs
  I: Principal Classes of Radials and Semiradials
Authors: Nanao Kita
Categories: math.CO cs.DM
\\
  This paper is the first from serial papers that provide constructive
characterizations for classes of bidirected graphs known as radials and
semiradials. In this paper, we provide constructive characterizations for five
principle classes of radials and semiradials to be used for characterizing
general radials and semiradials. A bidirected graph is a graph in which each
end of each edge has a sign $+$ or $-$. Bidirected graphs are a common
generalization of digraphs and signed graphs. We define a new concept of
radials as a generalization of a classical concept in matching theory, critical
graphs. Radials are also a generalization of a class of digraphs known as
flowgraphs. We also define semiradials, which are a relaxed concept of radials.
We further define special classes of radials and semiradials, that is, absolute
semiradials, strong and almost strong radials, linear semiradials, and
sublinear radials. We provide constructive characterizations for these five
classes of bidirected graphs. Our serial papers are a part of a series of works
that establish the strong component decomposition for bidirected graphs.

Title: Cop number of graphs without long holes
Authors: Vaidy Sivaraman

Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1903.01338
\\
  A hole in a graph is an induced cycle of length at least 4. We give a simple
winning strategy for t-3 cops to capture a robber in the game of cops and
robbers played in a graph that does not contain a hole of length at least t.
This strengthens a theorem of Joret-Kaminski-Theis, who proved that t-2 cops
have a winning strategy in such graphs. As a consequence of our bound, we also
give an inequality relating the cop number and the Dilworth number of a graph.

Title: Piecewise Polyhedral Formulations for a Multilinear Term

Categories: math.OC cs.DM
\\
  In this paper, we present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation of a
piecewise, polyhedral relaxation (PPR) of a multilinear term using it's convex
hull representation. Based on the solution of the PPR, we also present a
MIP-based piecewise formulation which restricts the solutions to be feasible
for the multilinear term. We then present computational results showing the
effectiveness of proposed formulations on instances from the standard
Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Library (MINLPLib) and compare the proposed
formulation with a formulation that is built by recursively relaxing bilinear
groupings of the multilinear term, typically applied in the literature.

Title: Optimal Entropy Compression and Purification in Quantum Bits
Authors: Varad R. Pande
Categories: quant-ph cs.DS cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 13 pages, 13 figures; Comments welcome
\\
  Global unitary transformations (optswaps) that optimally increase the bias of
any mixed computation qubit in a quantum system - represented by a diagonal
density matrix - towards a particular state of the computational basis which,
in effect, increases its purity are presented. Quantum circuits that achieve
this by implementing the above data compression technique - a generalization of
the 3B-Comp [Fernandez, Lloyd, Mor, Roychowdhury (2004); arXiv:
quant-ph/0401135] used before are described. These circuits enable purity
increment in the computation qubit by maximally transferring part of its von
Neumann or Shannon entropy to any number of surrounding qubits and are valid
for the complete range of initial biases. Using the optswaps, a practicable new
method that algorithmically achieves hierarchy-dependent cooling of qubits to
their respective limits in an engineered quantum register opened to the
heat-bath in delineated. In addition to multi-qubit purification and satisfying
two of DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computation in some architectures, the
implications of this work for quantum data compression are discussed.

\\
  During the last few years, intensive research efforts are being done in the
field of brain interfaces to extract neuro-information from the signals
representing neuronal activities in the human brain. A recent development of
these interfaces is capable of direct communication between animals' brains,
enabling direct brain-to-brain communication. Although these results are new
and the experimental scenario simple, the fast development in neuroscience, and
information and communication technologies indicate the potential of new
scenarios for wireless communications between brains. Depending of the specific
kind of neuro-activity to be communicated, the brain-to-brain link shall follow
strict requirements of high data rates, low-latency, and reliable
communication. In this paper we highlight key beyond 5G technologies that
potentially will support this promising approach.

Comments: This paper aims to investigate the feasibility of using RIS for MIMO
  wireless transmission for higher-order modulation by presenting an analytical
  modeling of the RIS-based system and providing experimental results from a
  prototype which has been built
\\
  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a new paradigm that has great
potential to achieve cost-effective, energy-efficient information modulation
for wireless transmission, by the ability to change the reflection coefficients
of the unit cells of a programmable metasurface. Nevertheless, the
electromagnetic responses of the RISs are usually only phase-adjustable, which
considerably limits the achievable rate of RIS-based transmitters. In this
paper, we propose an RIS architecture to achieve amplitude-and-phase-varying
modulation, which facilitates the design of multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) transmission. The hardware
constraints of the RIS and their impacts on the system design are discussed and
analyzed. Furthermore, the proposed approach is evaluated using our prototype
which implements the RIS-based MIMO-QAM transmission over the air in real time.

Authors: Esteve del Acebo, Yousef Alizadeh-Q, Sayyed Ali Hossayni
Categories: stat.OT cs.LG
\\
  Possibility and probability theories are alternative and complementary ways
to deal with uncertainty, which has motivated over the last years an interest
for the study of ways to transform probability distributions into possibility
distributions and conversely. This paper studies the advantages and
shortcomings of two well-known discrete probability to possibility
transformations: the optimal transformation and the symmetrical transformation,
and presents a novel parametric family of probability to possibility
transformations which generalizes them and alleviate their shortcomings,
showing a big potential for practical application. The paper also introduces a
novel fuzzy measure of specificity for probability distributions based on the
concept of fuzzy subsethood and presents a empirical validation of the
generalized transformation usefulness applying it to the text authorship

Comments: 25 pages, 7 figures
\\
  As deep neural networks (DNN) have the ability to model the distribution of
datasets as a low-dimensional manifold, we propose a method to extract the
coordinate transformation that makes a dataset distribution invariant by
sampling DNNs using the replica exchange Monte-Carlo method. In addition, we
derive the relation between the canonical transformation that makes the
Hamiltonian invariant (a necessary condition for Noether's theorem) and the
symmetry of the manifold structure of the time series data of the dynamical
system. By integrating this knowledge with the method described above, we
propose a method to estimate the interpretable conservation laws from the
time-series data. Furthermore, we verified the efficiency of the proposed
methods in primitive cases and large scale collective motion in metastable
state.

  Metasurfaces have shown promising potentials in shaping optical wavefronts
while remaining compact compared to bulky geometric optics devices. Design of
meta-atoms, the fundamental building blocks of metasurfaces, relies on
trial-and-error method to achieve target electromagnetic responses. This
process includes the characterization of an enormous amount of different
meta-atom designs with different physical and geometric parameters, which
normally demands huge computational resources. In this paper, a deep
learning-based metasurface/meta-atom modeling approach is introduced to
significantly reduce the characterization time while maintaining accuracy.
Based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, the proposed deep
learning network is able to model meta-atoms with free-form 2D patterns and
different lattice sizes, material refractive indexes and thicknesses. Moreover,
the presented approach features the capability to predict meta-atoms' wide
spectrum responses in the timescale of milliseconds, which makes it attractive
for applications such as fast meta-atom/metasurface on-demand designs and
optimizations.

Title: DeepBeat: A multi-task deep learning approach to assess signal quality
  and arrhythmia detection in wearable devices
Authors: Jessica Torres Soto, Euan Ashley
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Wearable devices enable theoretically continuous, longitudinal monitoring of
physiological measurements like step count, energy expenditure, and heart rate.
Although the classification of abnormal cardiac rhythms such as atrial
fibrillation from wearable devices has great potential, commercial algorithms
remain proprietary and tend to focus on heart rate variability derived from
green spectrum LED sensors placed on the wrist where noise remains an unsolved
problem. Here, we develop a multi-task deep learning method to assess signal
quality and arrhythmia event detection in wearable photoplethysmography devices
for real-time detection of atrial fibrillation (AF). We train our algorithm on
over one million simulated unlabeled physiological signals and fine-tune on a
curated dataset of over 500K labeled signals from over 100 individuals from 3
different wearable devices. We demonstrate that in comparison with a
traditional random forest-based approach (precision:0.24, recall:0.58, f1:0.34,
auPRC:0.44) and a single task CNN (precision:0.59, recall:0.69, f1:0.64,
auPRC:0.68) our architecture using unsupervised transfer learning through
convolutional denoising autoencoders dramatically improves the performance of
AF detection in participants at rest (pr:0.94, rc:0.98, f1:0.96, auPRC:0.96).
In addition, we validate algorithm performance on a prospectively derived
replication cohort of ambulatory subjects using data derived from an
independently engineered device. We show that two-stage training can help
address the unbalanced data problem common to biomedical applications where
large well-annotated datasets are scarce. In conclusion, though a combination
of simulation and transfer learning and we develop and apply a multitask
architecture to the problem of AF detection from wearable wrist sensors
demonstrating high levels of accuracy and a solution for the vexing challenge
of mechanical noise.

  Classification

Comments: 19 pages, 8 figures
\\
  We describe a search and classification procedure for gravitational waves
emitted by core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions, using a convolutional
neural network (CNN) combined with an event trigger generator known as Wavelet
Detection Filter (WDF). We employ both a 1-D CNN search using time series
gravitational-wave data as input, and a 2-D CNN search with time-frequency
representation of the data as input. To test the accuracies of our 1-D and 2-D
CNN classification, we add CCSN waveforms from the most recent hydrodynamical
simulations of neutrino-driven core-collapse to simulated Gaussian colored
noise with the Virgo interferometer and the planned Einstein Telescope
sensitivity curve. We find classification accuracies, for a single detector, of
over 95% for both 1-D and 2-D CNN pipelines. For the first time in machine
learning CCSN studies, we add short duration detector noise transients to our
data to test the robustness of our method against false alarms created by
detector noise artifacts. Further to this, we show that the CNN can distinguish
between different types of CCSN waveform models.

  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) optimize the parameters
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$ of a quantum neural network $V(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ to
minimize a cost function $C$. While VQAs may enable practical applications of
noisy quantum computers, they are nevertheless heuristic methods with unproven
scaling. Here, we rigorously prove two results. Our first result states that
defining $C$ in terms of global observables leads to an exponentially vanishing
gradient (i.e., a barren plateau) even when $V(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is
shallow. This implies that several VQAs in the literature must revise their
proposed cost functions. On the other hand, our second result states that
defining $C$ with local observables leads to a polynomially vanishing gradient,
so long as the depth of $V(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$.
Taken together, our results establish a precise connection between locality and
trainability. Finally, we illustrate these ideas with large-scale simulations,
up to 100 qubits, of a particular VQA known as quantum autoencoders.

Title: A Deep Structural Model for Analyzing Correlated Multivariate Time
  Series
Authors: Changwei Hu, Yifan Hu, Sungyong Seo
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Journal-ref: IEEE ICMLA 2019
\\
  Multivariate time series are routinely encountered in real-world
applications, and in many cases, these time series are strongly correlated. In
this paper, we present a deep learning structural time series model which can
(i) handle correlated multivariate time series input, and (ii) forecast the
targeted temporal sequence by explicitly learning/extracting the trend,
seasonality, and event components. The trend is learned via a 1D and 2D
temporal CNN and LSTM hierarchical neural net. The CNN-LSTM architecture can
(i) seamlessly leverage the dependency among multiple correlated time series in
a natural way, (ii) extract the weighted differencing feature for better trend
learning, and (iii) memorize the long-term sequential pattern. The seasonality
component is approximated via a non-liner function of a set of Fourier terms,
and the event components are learned by a simple linear function of regressor
encoding the event dates. We compare our model with several state-of-the-art
methods through a comprehensive set of experiments on a variety of time series
data sets, such as forecasts of Amazon AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) billings, and the closing prices for corporate
stocks in the same category.

  Mathematics can help analyze the arts and inspire new artwork. Mathematics
can also help make transformations from one artistic medium to another,
considering exceptions and choices, as well as artists' individual and unique
contributions. We propose a method based on diagrammatic thinking and quantum
formalism. We exploit decompositions of complex forms into a set of simple
shapes, discretization of complex images, and Dirac notation, imagining a world
of "prototypes" that can be connected to obtain a fine or coarse-graining
approximation of a given visual image. Visual prototypes are exchanged with
auditory ones, and the information (position, size) characterizing visual
prototypes is connected with the information (onset, duration, loudness, pitch
range) characterizing auditory prototypes. The topic is contextualized within a
philosophical debate (discreteness and comparison of apparently unrelated
objects), it develops through mathematical formalism, and it leads to
programming, to spark interdisciplinary thinking and ignite creativity within
STEAM.

Title: Gradient polyconvex material models and their numerical treatment
Authors: Martin Hor\'ak and Martin Kru\v{z}\'ik
Categories: math.AP cs.NA math.NA
\\
  Gradient polyconvex materials are nonsimple materials where we do not assume
smoothness of the elastic strain but instead regularity of minors of the strain
is required. This allows for a larger class of admissible deformations than in
the case of second-grade materials. We describe a possible implementation of
gradient polyconvex elastic energies. Besides, a new geometric interpretation
of gradient-polyconvexity is given and it is compared with standard
second-grade materials. Finally, we demonstrate application of the proposed
approach using two different models, namely, a St.-Venant Kirchhoff material
and a double well stored energy density.

Title: A derivation of Griffith functionals from discrete finite-difference
  models
Authors: Vito Crismale, Giovanni Scilla, Francesco Solombrino
Categories: math.AP cs.NA math.NA
MSC-class: 49M25, 49J45, 74R10, 65M06
\\
  We analyze a finite-difference approximation of a functional of
Ambrosio-Tortorelli type in brittle fracture, in the discrete-to-continuum
limit. In a suitable regime between the competing scales, namely if the
discretization step $\delta$ is smaller than the ellipticity parameter
$\varepsilon$, we show the $\Gamma$-convergence of the model to the Griffith
functional, containing only a term enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions and
no $L^p$ fidelity term. Restricting to two dimensions, we also address the case
in which a (linearized) constraint of non-interpenetration of matter is added
in the limit functional, in the spirit of a recent work by Chambolle, Conti and
Francfort.

Title: Practical Issues of Energy Harvesting and Data Transmissions in
  Sustainable IoT
Authors: Yu Luo, Lina Pu
Categories: eess.SP cs.NI
\\
  The sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a promising solution for
the green living and smart industries. In this article, we investigate the
practical issues in the radio energy harvesting and data communication systems
through extensive field experiments. A number of important characteristics of
energy harvesting circuits and communication modules have been studied,
including the non-linear energy consumption of the communication system
relative to the transmission power, the wake-up time associated with the
payload, and the varying system power during consecutive packet transmissions.
In order to improve the efficiency of energy harvest and energy utilization, we
propose a new model to accurately describe the energy harvesting process and
the power consumption for sustainable IoT devices. Experiments are performed
using commercial IoT devices and RF energy harvesters to verify the accuracy of
the proposed model. The experiment results show that the new model matches the
performance of sustainable IoT devices very well in the real scenario.

  This document contains the computer generated part of the proof of the main
result in [12], giving a complete and general list of tree representations
corresponding to exceptional modules over the path algebra of the canonically
oriented Euclidean quiver $\widetilde{\mathbb{E}}_6$. The proofs (involving
induction and symbolic computation with block matrices) were partially
generated by a purposefully developed computer software, outputting in a
detailed step-by-step fashion as if written "by hand". Tree representations are
exhibited using matrices involving only the elements 0 and 1, and all
representations enlisted in this document remain valid over any base field
(since the symbolic block matrix computations present inhere hold in any
field).

Title: Stieltjes moment sequences for pattern-avoiding permutations
Authors: Alin Bostan, Andrew Elvey Price, Anthony John Guttmann, Jean-Marie
  Maillard
Categories: math.CO cs.SC
Comments: 44 pages, 8 figures
\\
  A small subset of combinatorial sequences have coefficients that can be
represented as moments of a nonnegative measure on $[0, \infty)$. Such
sequences are known as Stieltjes moment sequences. This article focuses on some
classical sequences in enumerative combinatorics, denoted $Av(\mathcal{P})$,
and counting permutations of $\{1, 2, \ldots, n \}$ that avoid some given
pattern $\mathcal{P}$. For increasing patterns $\mathcal{P}=(12\ldots k)$, we
recall that the corresponding sequences, $Av(123\ldots k)$, are Stieltjes
moment sequences, and we explicitly find the underlying density function,
either exactly or numerically, by using the Stieltjes inversion formula as a
fundamental tool. We show that the generating functions of the sequences $\,
Av(1234)$ and $\, Av(12345)$ correspond, up to simple rational functions, to an
order-one linear differential operator acting on a classical modular form given
as a pullback of a Gaussian $\, _2F_1$ hypergeometric function, respectively to
an order-two linear differential operator acting on the square of a classical
modular form given as a pullback of a $\, _2F_1$ hypergeometric function. We
demonstrate that the density function for the Stieltjes moment sequence
$Av(123\ldots k)$ is closely, but non-trivially, related to the density
attached to the distance traveled by a walk in the plane with $k-1$ unit steps
in random directions. Finally, we study the challenging case of the $Av(1324)$
sequence and give compelling numerical evidence that this too is a Stieltjes
moment sequence. Accepting this, we show how rigorous lower bounds on the
growth constant of this sequence can be constructed, which are stronger than
existing bounds. A further unproven assumption leads to even better bounds,
which can be extrapolated to give an estimate of the (unknown) growth constant.

Title: Attentive batch normalization for lstm-based acoustic modeling of speech
  recognition
Authors: Fenglin Ding, Wu Guo, Lirong Dai, Jun Du
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: 5 pages,1 figure, submitted to ICASSP 2020
\\
  Batch normalization (BN) is an effective method to accelerate model training
and improve the generalization performance of neural networks. In this paper,
we propose an improved batch normalization technique called attentive batch
normalization (ABN) in Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based acoustic modeling
for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In the proposed method, an auxiliary
network is used to dynamically generate the scaling and shifting parameters in
batch normalization, and attention mechanisms are introduced to improve their
regularized performance. Furthermore, two schemes, frame-level and
utterance-level ABN, are investigated. We evaluate our proposed methods on
Mandarin and Uyghur ASR tasks, respectively. The experimental results show that
the proposed ABN greatly improves the performance of batch normalization in
terms of transcription accuracy for both languages.

Title: Objective Study of Sensor Relevance for Automatic Cough Detection
Authors: Thomas Drugman, Jerome Urbain, Nathalie Bauwens, Ricardo Chessini,
  Carlos Valderrama, Patrick Lebecque and Thierry Dutoit
Categories: physics.med-ph cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  The development of a system for the automatic, objective and reliable
detection of cough events is a need underlined by the medical literature for
years. The benefit of such a tool is clear as it would allow the assessment of
pathology severity in chronic cough diseases. Even though some approaches have
recently reported solutions achieving this task with a relative success, there
is still no standardization about the method to adopt or the sensors to use.
The goal of this paper is to study objectively the performance of several
sensors for cough detection: ECG, thermistor, chest belt, accelerometer,
contact and audio microphones. Experiments are carried out on a database of 32
healthy subjects producing, in a confined room and in three situations,
voluntary cough at various volumes as well as other event categories which can
possibly lead to some detection errors: background noise, forced expiration,
throat clearing, speech and laugh. The relevance of each sensor is evaluated at
three stages: mutual information conveyed by the features, ability to
discriminate at the frame level cough from these latter other sources of
ambiguity, and ability to detect cough events. In this latter experiment, with
both an averaged sensitivity and specificity of about 94.5%, the proposed
approach is shown to clearly outperform the commercial Karmelsonix system which
achieved a specificity of 95.3% and a sensitivity of 64.9%.

Title: Recursive Formula for Labeled Graph Enumeration
Authors: Ravi Goyal and Victor De Gruttola
Categories: stat.CO cs.SI physics.soc-ph
Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures
\\
  This manuscript presents a general recursive formula to estimate the size of
fibers associated with algebraic maps from graphs to summary statistics of
importance for social network analysis, such as number of edges (graph
density), degree sequence, degree distribution, mixing by nodal covariates, and
degree mixing. That is, the formula estimates the number of labeled graphs that
have given values for network properties. The proposed approach can be extended
to additional network properties (e.g., clustering) as well as properties of
bipartite networks. For special settings in which alternative formulas exist,
simulation studies demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. We
illustrate the approach for estimating the size of fibers associated with the
Barab\'{a}si--Albert model for the properties of degree distribution and degree
mixing. In addition, we demonstrate how the approach can be used to assess the
diversity of graphs within a fiber.

Title: A data-driven robust optimization approach to scenario-based stochastic
  model predictive control
Authors: Chao Shang and Fengqi You
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Journal-ref: Journal of Process Control, Volume 75, March 2019, Pages 24-39
DOI: 10.1016/j.jprocont.2018.12.013
\\
  Stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) has been a promising solution to
complex control problems under uncertain disturbances. However, traditional
SMPC approaches either require exact knowledge of probabilistic distributions,
or rely on massive scenarios that are generated to represent uncertainties. In
this paper, a novel scenario-based SMPC approach is proposed by actively
learning a data-driven uncertainty set from available data with machine
learning techniques. A systematical procedure is then proposed to further
calibrate the uncertainty set, which gives appropriate probabilistic guarantee.
The resulting data-driven uncertainty set is more compact than traditional
norm-based sets, and can help reducing conservatism of control actions.
Meanwhile, the proposed method requires less data samples than traditional
scenario-based SMPC approaches, thereby enhancing the practicability of SMPC.
Finally the optimal control problem is cast as a single-stage robust
optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently by deriving the robust
counterpart problem. The feasibility and stability issue is also discussed in
detail. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a
two-mass-spring system and a building energy control problem under uncertain
disturbances.

Title: Optimal Decentralized Control for Uncertain Systems by Symmetric

Authors: Jun Ma, Zilong Cheng, Xiaoxue Zhang, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Tong Heng Lee
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures
\\
  The H2 guaranteed cost decentralized control problem is investigated in this
work. More specifically, on the basis of an appropriate H2 re-formulation that
we put in place, the optimal control problem in the presence of parameter
uncertainties is solved in parameter space. It is shown that all the
stabilizing decentralized controller gains for the uncertain system are
parameterized in a convex set, and then the formulated problem is converted to
a conic optimization problem. It facilitates the use of the symmetric
Gauss-Seidel (sGS) semi-proximal augmented Lagrangian method (ALM), which
attains high computational efficiency. A comprehensive analysis is given on the
application of the approach in solving the optimal decentralized control
problem; and subsequently, the preserved decentralized structure, robust
stability, and robust performance are all suitably guaranteed with the proposed
methodology. Furthermore, illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed optimization approach.

  An ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) remote-powered positioning system for potential
use in tracking floating objects inside space stations is presented. It makes
use of battery-less tags that are powered-up and addressed through wireless
power transfer in the UHF band and embed an energy efficient pulse generator in
the 3-5 GHz UWB band. The system has been mounted on the ESA Mars Rover
prototype to demonstrate its functionality and performance. Experimental
results show the feasibility of centimeter-level localization accuracy at
distances larger than 10 meters, with the capability of determining the
position of multiple tags using a 2W-ERP power source in the UHF RFID frequency
band.

Title: Beamforming Optimization for Wireless Network Aided by Intelligent

Authors: Qingqing Wu and Rui Zhang
Categories: cs.IT cs.ET eess.SP math.IT
Comments: Published in IEEE Transactions on Communications. We show the
  performance of IRS with discrete phase shifts. The most inspiring result is
  that using IRS with even 1-bit elements still achieves the same squared
  power/SNR gain as in the ideal continuous case, i.e., $O(N^2)$. More works at
