Title: Simulation Pipeline for Traffic Evacuation in Urban Areas and Emergency
  Traffic Management Policy Improvements
Authors: Yu Chen, S. Yusef Shafi, Yi-fan Chen
Categories: cs.AI physics.soc-ph
Comments: 37 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Traffic evacuation plays a critical role in saving lives in devastating
disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, earthquakes, etc. An ability
to evaluate evacuation plans in advance for these rare events, including
identifying traffic flow bottlenecks, improving traffic management policies,
and understanding the robustness of the traffic management policy are critical
for emergency management. Given the rareness of such events and the
corresponding lack of real data, traffic simulation provides a flexible and
versatile approach for such scenarios, and furthermore allows dynamic
interaction with the simulated evacuation. In this paper, we build a traffic
simulation pipeline to explore the above problems, covering many aspects of
evacuation, including map creation, demand generation, vehicle behavior,
bottleneck identification, traffic management policy improvement, and results
analysis. We apply the pipeline to two case studies in California. The first is
Paradise, which was destroyed by a large wildfire in 2018 and experienced
catastrophic traffic jams during the evacuation. The second is Mill Valley,
which has high risk of wildfire and potential traffic issues since the city is
situated in a narrow valley.

Title: Semantic Relatedness and Taxonomic Word Embeddings
Authors: Magdalena Kacmajor and John D. Kelleher and Filip Klubicka and Alfredo
  Maldonado
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 7 pages 0 figures
\\
  This paper connects a series of papers dealing with taxonomic word
embeddings. It begins by noting that there are different types of semantic
relatedness and that different lexical representations encode different forms
of relatedness. A particularly important distinction within semantic
relatedness is that of thematic versus taxonomic relatedness. Next, we present
a number of experiments that analyse taxonomic embeddings that have been
trained on a synthetic corpus that has been generated via a random walk over a
taxonomy. These experiments demonstrate how the properties of the synthetic
corpus, such as the percentage of rare words, are affected by the shape of the
knowledge graph the corpus is generated from. Finally, we explore the
interactions between the relative sizes of natural and synthetic corpora on the
performance of embeddings when taxonomic and thematic embeddings are combined.

Title: Stress Test Evaluation of Transformer-based Models in Natural Language
  Understanding Tasks
Authors: Carlos Aspillaga, Andr\'es Carvallo, Vladimir Araujo
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Accepted paper LREC2020
\\
  There has been significant progress in recent years in the field of Natural
Language Processing thanks to the introduction of the Transformer architecture.
Current state-of-the-art models, via a large number of parameters and
pre-training on massive text corpus, have shown impressive results on several
downstream tasks. Many researchers have studied previous (non-transformer)
models to understand their actual behavior under different scenarios, showing
that these models are taking advantage of clues or failures of datasets and
that slight perturbations on the input data can severely reduce their
performance. In contrast, recent models have not been systematically tested
with adversarial-examples in order to show their robustness under severe stress
conditions. For that reason, this work evaluates three transformer-based models
(RoBERTa, XLNet, and BERT) in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question
Answering (QA) tasks to know if they are more robust or if they have the same
flaws as their predecessors. As a result, our experiments reveal that RoBERTa,
XLNet and BERT are more robust than recurrent neural network models to stress
tests for both NLI and QA tasks. Nevertheless, they are still very fragile and
demonstrate various unexpected behaviors, thus revealing that there is still
room for future improvement in this field.

\\
  The promise of AI is huge. AI systems have already achieved good enough
performance to be in our streets and in our homes. However, they can be brittle
and unfair. For society to reap the benefits of AI systems, society needs to be
able to trust them. Inspired by decades of progress in trustworthy computing,
we suggest what trustworthy properties would be desired of AI systems. By
enumerating a set of new research questions, we explore one approach--formal
verification--for ensuring trust in AI. Trustworthy AI ups the ante on both
trustworthy computing and formal methods.

Title: Deep RL Agent for a Real-Time Action Strategy Game
Authors: Michal Warchalski, Dimitrije Radojevic, Milos Milosevic
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We introduce a reinforcement learning environment based on Heroic - Magic
Duel, a 1 v 1 action strategy game. This domain is non-trivial for several
reasons: it is a real-time game, the state space is large, the information
given to the player before and at each step of a match is imperfect, and
distribution of actions is dynamic. Our main contribution is a deep
reinforcement learning agent playing the game at a competitive level that we
trained using PPO and self-play with multiple competing agents, employing only
a simple reward of $\pm 1$ depending on the outcome of a single match. Our best
self-play agent, obtains around $65\%$ win rate against the existing AI and
over $50\%$ win rate against a top human player.

Title: PDDLGym: Gym Environments from PDDL Problems
Authors: Tom Silver and Rohan Chitnis
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We present PDDLGym, a framework that automatically constructs OpenAI Gym
environments from PDDL domains and problems. Observations and actions in
PDDLGym are relational, making the framework particularly well-suited for
research in relational reinforcement learning and relational sequential
decision-making. PDDLGym is also useful as a generic framework for rapidly
building numerous, diverse benchmarks from a concise and familiar specification
language. We discuss design decisions and implementation details, and also
illustrate empirical variations between the 15 built-in environments in terms
of planning and model-learning difficulty. We hope that PDDLGym will facilitate
bridge-building between the reinforcement learning community (from which Gym
emerged) and the AI planning community (which produced PDDL). We look forward
to gathering feedback from all those interested and expanding the set of
available environments and features accordingly. Code:

Title: Supervised Phrase-boundary Embeddings

Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables
\\
  We propose a new word embedding model, called SPhrase, that incorporates
supervised phrase information. Our method modifies traditional word embeddings
by ensuring that all target words in a phrase have exactly the same context. We
demonstrate that including this information within a context window produces
superior embeddings for both intrinsic evaluation tasks and downstream
extrinsic tasks.

Title: Maxmin Q-learning: Controlling the Estimation Bias of Q-learning
Authors: Qingfeng Lan, Yangchen Pan, Alona Fyshe, Martha White
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Q-learning suffers from overestimation bias, because it approximates the
maximum action value using the maximum estimated action value. Algorithms have
been proposed to reduce overestimation bias, but we lack an understanding of
how bias interacts with performance, and the extent to which existing
algorithms mitigate bias. In this paper, we 1) highlight that the effect of
overestimation bias on learning efficiency is environment-dependent; 2) propose
a generalization of Q-learning, called \emph{Maxmin Q-learning}, which provides
a parameter to flexibly control bias; 3) show theoretically that there exists a
parameter choice for Maxmin Q-learning that leads to unbiased estimation with a
lower approximation variance than Q-learning; and 4) prove the convergence of
our algorithm in the tabular case, as well as convergence of several previous
Q-learning variants, using a novel Generalized Q-learning framework. We
empirically verify that our algorithm better controls estimation bias in toy
environments, and that it achieves superior performance on several benchmark
problems.

Title: Untrue.News: A New Search Engine For Fake Stories
Authors: Vinicius Woloszyn, Felipe Schaeffer, Beliza Boniatti, Eduardo Cortes,
  Salar Mohtaj, Sebastian M\"oller
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In this paper, we demonstrate Untrue News, a new search engine for fake
stories. Untrue News is easy to use and offers useful features such as: a) a
multi-language option combining fake stories from different countries and
languages around the same subject or person; b) an user privacy protector,
avoiding the filter bubble by employing a bias-free ranking scheme; and c) a
collaborative platform that fosters the development of new tools for fighting
disinformation. Untrue News relies on Elasticsearch, a new scalable analytic
search engine based on the Lucene library that provides near real-time results.
We demonstrate two key scenarios: the first related to a politician - looking
how the categories are shown for different types of fake stories - and a second
related to a refugee - showing the multilingual tool. A prototype of Untrue
News is accessible via http://untrue.news

Title: On the Approximability of Weighted Model Integration on DNF Structures
Authors: Ralph Abboud, Ismail Ilkan Ceylan, Radoslav Dimitrov
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Weighted model counting admits an FPRAS on DNF structures. We study weighted
model integration, which is a generalization of weighted model counting, and
pose the following question: Does weighted model integration on DNF structures
admit an FPRAS? Building on classical results, we show that this problem can
indeed be approximated for a class of weight functions. Our approximation
algorithm is based on three subroutines, each of which can be a weak (i.e.,
approximate), or a strong (i.e., exact) oracle, and in all cases, comes along
with accuracy guarantees. We experimentally verify our approach, and show that
our algorithm scales to large problem instances, which are currently out of
reach for existing, general-purpose weighted model integration solvers.

  The counterfeit goods trade represents nowadays more than 3.3% of the whole
world trade and thus it's a problem that needs now more than ever a lot of
attention and a reliable solution that would reduce the negative impact it has
over the modern society. This paper presents the design and early stage
development of a novel counterfeit goods detection platform that makes use of
the outstsanding learning capabilities of the classical VGG16 convolutional
model trained through the process of "transfer learning" and a multi-stage fake
detection procedure that proved to be not only reliable but also very robust in
the experiments we have conducted so far using an image dataset of various
goods which we gathered ourselves.

Title: An ASP semantics for Constraints involving Conditional Aggregates
Authors: Pedro Cabalar and Jorge Fandinno and Torsten Schaub and Philipp Wanko
Categories: cs.AI cs.LO
ACM-class: I.2.4
\\
  We elaborate upon the formal foundations of hybrid Answer Set Programming
(ASP) and extend its underlying logical framework with aggregate functions over
constraint values and variables. This is achieved by introducing the construct
of conditional expressions, which allow for considering two alternatives while
evaluating constraints. Which alternative is considered is
interpretation-dependent and chosen according to an associated condition. We
put some emphasis on logic programs with linear constraints and show how common
ASP aggregates can be regarded as particular cases of so-called conditional
linear constraints. Finally, we introduce a polynomial-size, modular and
faithful translation from our framework into regular (condition-free)
Constraint ASP, outlining an implementation of conditional aggregates on top of
existing hybrid ASP solvers.

\\
  We introduce an implementation of an extension of Answer Set Programming
(ASP) with language constructs from dynamic (and temporal) logic that provides
an expressive computational framework for modeling dynamic applications.
Starting from logical foundations, provided by dynamic and temporal equilibrium
logics over finite linear traces, we develop a translation of dynamic formulas
into temporal logic programs. This provides us with a normal form result
establishing the strong equivalence of formulas in different logics. Our
translation relies on the introduction of auxiliary atoms to guarantee
polynomial space complexity and to provide an embedding that is doomed to be
impossible over the same language. Finally, the reduction of dynamic formulas
to temporal logic programs allows us to extend ASP with both approaches in a
uniform way and to implement both extensions via temporal ASP solvers such as
telingo

Title: Semantics of negative sequential patterns
Authors: Philippe Besnard (IRIT), Thomas Guyet (LACODAM)
Categories: cs.AI cs.DB
Comments: proceedings of European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI),
  Jun 2020, Santiago de Compostela, Spain
\\
  In the field of pattern mining, a negative sequential pattern is specified by
means of a sequence consisting of events to occur and of other events, called
negative events, to be absent. For instance, containment of the pattern
$\langle a\ \neg b\ c\rangle$ arises with an occurrence of a and a subsequent
occurrence of c but no occurrence of b in between. This article is to shed
light on the ambiguity of such a seemingly intuitive notation and we identify
eight possible semantics for the containment relation between a pattern and a
sequence. These semantics are illustrated and formally studied, in particular
we propose dominance and equivalence relations between them. Also we prove that
support is anti-monotonic for some of these semantics. Some of the results are
discussed with the aim of developing algorithms to extract efficiently frequent
negative patterns.

Title: Targeted Forgetting and False Memory Formation in Continual Learners
  through Adversarial Backdoor Attacks
Authors: Muhammad Umer, Glenn Dawson, Robi Polikar
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Artificial neural networks are well-known to be susceptible to catastrophic
forgetting when continually learning from sequences of tasks. Various continual
(or "incremental") learning approaches have been proposed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting, but they are typically adversary agnostic, i.e., they do not
consider the possibility of a malicious attack. In this effort, we explore the
vulnerability of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a popular continual
learning algorithm for avoiding catastrophic forgetting. We show that an
intelligent adversary can bypass the EWC's defenses, and instead cause gradual
and deliberate forgetting by introducing small amounts of misinformation to the
model during training. We demonstrate such an adversary's ability to assume
control of the model via injection of "backdoor" attack samples on both
permuted and split benchmark variants of the MNIST dataset. Importantly, once
the model has learned the adversarial misinformation, the adversary can then
control the amount of forgetting of any task. Equivalently, the malicious actor
can create a "false memory" about any task by inserting carefully-designed
backdoor samples to any fraction of the test instances of that task. Perhaps
most damaging, we show this vulnerability to be very acute; neural network
memory can be easily compromised with the addition of backdoor samples into as
little as 1% of the training data of even a single task.

Title: RapidLayout: Fast Hard Block Placement of FPGA-optimized Systolic Arrays
  using Evolutionary Algorithms
Authors: Niansong Zhang, Xiang Chen, Nachiket Kapre
Categories: cs.AR
Comments: 9 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Evolutionary algorithms can outperform conventional simulated annealing
placement on metrics such as runtime, wirelength, pipelining cost, and clock
frequency when mapping FPGA hard block intensive designs such as systolic
arrays on Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGAs. Such designs can take advantage of
repeatable design organization of the arrays, the columnar arrangement of hard
blocks such as DSPs and RAMs, coupled with cascade nearest-neighbor
interconnect for systolic-friendly data movement. However, the commercial-grade
Xilinx Vivado CAD tool is unable to provide a legal routing solution for such
hard block intensive designs without tedious manual placement constraints.
Instead, we formulate an automatic FPGA placement algorithm for these hard
blocks as a multi-objective optimization problem that targets wirelength
squared and maximum bounding box size metrics. We build an end-to-end placement
and routing flow called RapidLayout using the Xilinx RapidWright framework.
RapidLayout runs 5--6$\times$ faster than Vivado with manual constraints, and
eliminates the weeks long effort to manually generate placement constraints for
the hard blocks. We also perform automated post-placement pipelining of the
long wires inside each convolution block to target 650 MHz URAM-limited
operation. SLR replication in RapidWright allows us to clone the placement and
routing image for one SLR to the multi-SLR FPGA chip in a couple of minutes.
When compared to a conventional simulated annealing placer, RapidLayout's
evolutionary engine delivers up to 27% improvement in wirelength, 11% lower
bounding box size, 4.2$\times$ reduction in runtime, and $\approx$7% reduction
in pipeline registers for 650 MHz operation.

  We introduce symmetric arithmetic circuits, i.e. arithmetic circuits with a
natural symmetry restriction. In the context of circuits computing polynomials
defined on a matrix of variables, such as the determinant or the permanent, the
restriction amounts to requiring that the shape of the circuit is invariant
under row and column permutations of the matrix. We establish unconditional,
nearly exponential, lower bounds on the size of any symmetric circuit for
computing the permanent over any field of characteristic other than 2. In
contrast, we show that there are polynomial-size symmetric circuits for
computing the determinant over fields of characterisitic zero.

Title: Topology-free immersed boundary method for incompressible turbulence
  flows: An aerodynamic simulation for 'dirty' CAD geometry
Authors: Keiji Onishi and Makoto Tsubokura
Categories: cs.CE physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn
Comments: 33 pages, 23 figures
\\
  To design a method to solve the issues of handling 'dirty' and highly complex
geometries, the topology-free method combined with the immersed boundary method
is presented for viscous and incompressible flows at a high Reynolds number.
The method simultaneously employs a ghost-cell technique and distributed
forcing technique to impose the boundary conditions. An axis-projected
interpolation scheme is used to avoid searching failures during fluid and solid
identification. This method yields a topology-free immersed boundary, which
particularly suits flow simulations of highly complex geometries. Difficulties
generally arise when generating the calculation grid for these scenarios. This
method allows dirty data to be handled without any preparatory treatment work
to simplify or clean-up the geometry. This method is also applicable to the
coherent structural turbulence model employed in this study. The verification
cases, used in conjunction with the second-order central-difference scheme,
resulted in first-order accuracy at finer resolution, although the coarser
resolution retained second-order accuracy. This method is fully parallelized
for distributed memory platforms. In this study, the accuracy and fidelity of
this method were examined by simulating the flow around the bluff body, past a
flat plate, and past dirty spheres. These simulations were compared with
experimental data and other established results. Finally, results from the
simulation of practical applications demonstrate the ability of the method to
model highly complex, non-canonical three-dimensional flows. The countermeasure
based on the accurate classification of geometric features has provided a
robust and reasonable solution.

nearest-neighbor of p in R has the same label as p. This is motivated by
applications in classification, where the nearest-neighbor rule assigns to an
unlabeled query point the label of its nearest-neighbor in the point set. In
this context, condensation aims to reduce the size of the set needed to
classify new points. However, finding such subsets of minimum cardinality is
NP-hard, and most research has focused on practical heuristics without
performance guarantees. Additionally, the use of exact nearest-neighbors is
always assumed, ignoring the effect of condensation in the classification
accuracy when nearest-neighbors are computed approximately.
  In this paper, we address these shortcomings by proposing new
approximation-sensitive criteria for the nearest-neighbor condensation problem,
along with practical algorithms with provable performance guarantees. We
characterize sufficient conditions to guarantee correct classification of
unlabeled points using approximate nearest-neighbor queries on these subsets,
which introduces the notion of coresets for classification with the
nearest-neighbor rule. Moreover, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute subsets
with these characteristics, whose cardinality approximates that of the minimum
cardinality subset. Additionally, we propose new algorithms for computing such
subsets, with tight approximation factors in general metrics, and improved
factors for doubling metrics and l_p metrics with p >= 2. Finally, we show an
alternative implementation scheme that reduces the worst-case time complexity
of one of these algorithms, becoming the first truly subquadratic approximation
algorithm for the nearest-neighbor condensation problem.

Title: Computing Boundary Cycle of a Pseudo-Triangle Polygon from its
  Visibility Graph
Authors: Hossein Boomari Soheila Farokhi
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  Visibility graph of a simple polygon is a graph with the same vertex set in
which there is an edge between a pair of vertices if and only if the segment
through them lies completely inside the polygon. Each pair of adjacent vertices
on the boundary of the polygon are assumed to be visible. Therefore, the
visibility graph of each polygon always contains its boundary edges. This
implies that we have always a Hamiltonian cycle in a visibility graph which
determines the order of vertices on the boundary of the corresponding polygon.
In this paper, we propose a polynomial time algorithm for determining such a
Hamiltonian cycle for a pseudo-triangle polygon from its visibility graph.

Title: Overlaid oriented Voronoi diagrams and the 1-Steiner tree problem
Authors: Michael S. Payne, Charl Ras and Marcus Volz
Categories: cs.CG
Comments: 16 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Overlaid oriented Voronoi diagrams (OOVDs) are known to provide useful data
for the construction of optimal Euclidean $1$-Steiner trees. The theoretical
time complexity of construction methods exploiting the OOVD is $O(n^2)$, but a
computational study has never been performed, and robust constructions for
OOVDs have not previously been implemented.
  In this paper, we outline a numerically stable implementation for
constructing OOVDs using tools from the Computational Geometry Algorithms
Library (CGAL), and test its performance on random point sets. We then study
the effect that the OOVD data has in reducing the complexity of $1$-Steiner
tree construction when compared to a naive approach. The number of iterations
of the main loop of the 1-Steiner algorithm is directly determined by the
number of faces in the OOVD, and this appears to be linear for the random
inputs we tested. We also discuss methods for processing the OOVD data that
lead to a reduction in construction time by roughly a factor of 12.

Title: Efficiently stabbing convex polygons and variants of the
  Hadwiger-Debrunner $(p, q)$-theorem
Authors: Justin Dallant and Patrick Schnider
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  Hadwiger and Debrunner showed that for families of convex sets in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ with the property that among any $p$ of them some $q$ have a
common point, the whole family can be stabbed with $p-q+1$ points if $p \geq q
\geq d+1$ and $(d-1)p < d(q-1)$. This generalizes a classical result by Helly.
We show how such a stabbing set can be computed for $n$ convex polygons of
constant size in the plane in $O((p-q+1)n^{4/3}\log^{2+\epsilon}(n) +
p^2\log(p))$ expected time. For convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the method
yields an algorithm running in $O((p-q+1)n^{13/5+\epsilon} + p^4)$ expected
time. We also show that analogous results of the Hadwiger and Debrunner
$(p,q)$-theorem hold in other settings, such as convex sets in
$\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{Z}^k$ or abstract convex geometries.

Title: Fine-Tuning Pretrained Language Models: Weight Initializations, Data
  Orders, and Early Stopping
Authors: Jesse Dodge, Gabriel Ilharco, Roy Schwartz, Ali Farhadi, Hannaneh

Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Fine-tuning pretrained contextual word embedding models to supervised
downstream tasks has become commonplace in natural language processing. This
process, however, is often brittle: even with the same hyperparameter values,
distinct random seeds can lead to substantially different results. To better
understand this phenomenon, we experiment with four datasets from the GLUE
benchmark, fine-tuning BERT hundreds of times on each while varying only the
random seeds. We find substantial performance increases compared to previously
reported results, and we quantify how the performance of the best-found model
varies as a function of the number of fine-tuning trials. Further, we examine
two factors influenced by the choice of random seed: weight initialization and
training data order. We find that both contribute comparably to the variance of
out-of-sample performance, and that some weight initializations perform well
across all tasks explored. On small datasets, we observe that many fine-tuning
trials diverge part of the way through training, and we offer best practices
for practitioners to stop training less promising runs early. We publicly
release all of our experimental data, including training and validation scores
for 2,100 trials, to encourage further analysis of training dynamics during
fine-tuning.

Title: Deeper Task-Specificity Improves Joint Entity and Relation Extraction
Authors: Phil Crone
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Multi-task learning (MTL) is an effective method for learning related tasks,
but designing MTL models necessitates deciding which and how many parameters
should be task-specific, as opposed to shared between tasks. We investigate
this issue for the problem of jointly learning named entity recognition (NER)
and relation extraction (RE) and propose a novel neural architecture that
allows for deeper task-specificity than does prior work. In particular, we
introduce additional task-specific bidirectional RNN layers for both the NER
and RE tasks and tune the number of shared and task-specific layers separately
for different datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for both
tasks on the ADE dataset; on the CoNLL04 dataset, we achieve SOTA results on
the NER task and competitive results on the RE task while using an order of
magnitude fewer trainable parameters than the current SOTA architecture. An
ablation study confirms the importance of the additional task-specific layers
for achieving these results. Our work suggests that previous solutions to joint
NER and RE undervalue task-specificity and demonstrates the importance of
correctly balancing the number of shared and task-specific parameters for MTL
approaches in general.

Title: Learning to Generate Multiple Style Transfer Outputs for an Input
  Sentence
Authors: Kevin Lin, Ming-Yu Liu, Ming-Ting Sun, Jan Kautz
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Text style transfer refers to the task of rephrasing a given text in a
different style. While various methods have been proposed to advance the state
of the art, they often assume the transfer output follows a delta distribution,
and thus their models cannot generate different style transfer results for a
given input text. To address the limitation, we propose a one-to-many text
style transfer framework. In contrast to prior works that learn a one-to-one
mapping that converts an input sentence to one output sentence, our approach
learns a one-to-many mapping that can convert an input sentence to multiple
different output sentences, while preserving the input content. This is
achieved by applying adversarial training with a latent decomposition scheme.
Specifically, we decompose the latent representation of the input sentence to a
style code that captures the language style variation and a content code that
encodes the language style-independent content. We then combine the content
code with the style code for generating a style transfer output. By combining
the same content code with a different style code, we generate a different
style transfer output. Extensive experimental results with comparisons to
several text style transfer approaches on multiple public datasets using a
diverse set of performance metrics validate effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

Title: Exploring Neural Models for Parsing Natural Language into First-Order
  Logic
Authors: Hrituraj Singh, Milan Aggrawal, Balaji Krishnamurthy
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 11 Pages, 2 Figures
\\
  Semantic parsing is the task of obtaining machine-interpretable
representations from natural language text. We consider one such formal
representation - First-Order Logic (FOL) and explore the capability of neural
models in parsing English sentences to FOL. We model FOL parsing as a sequence
to sequence mapping task where given a natural language sentence, it is encoded
into an intermediate representation using an LSTM followed by a decoder which
sequentially generates the predicates in the corresponding FOL formula. We
improve the standard encoder-decoder model by introducing a variable alignment
mechanism that enables it to align variables across predicates in the predicted
FOL. We further show the effectiveness of predicting the category of FOL entity
- Unary, Binary, Variables and Scoped Entities, at each decoder step as an
auxiliary task on improving the consistency of generated FOL. We perform
rigorous evaluations and extensive ablations. We also aim to release our code
as well as large scale FOL dataset along with models to aid further research in
logic-based parsing and inference in NLP.

Title: Neural Machine Translation with Joint Representation

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  Though early successes of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems are
attributed in part to the explicit modelling of the interaction between any two
source and target units, e.g., alignment, the recent Neural Machine Translation
(NMT) systems resort to the attention which partially encodes the interaction
for efficiency. In this paper, we employ Joint Representation that fully
accounts for each possible interaction. We sidestep the inefficiency issue by
refining representations with the proposed efficient attention operation. The
resulting Reformer models offer a new Sequence-to- Sequence modelling paradigm
besides the Encoder-Decoder framework and outperform the Transformer baseline
in either the small scale IWSLT14 German-English, English-German and IWSLT15
Vietnamese-English or the large scale NIST12 Chinese-English translation tasks
by about 1 BLEU point.We also propose a systematic model scaling approach,
allowing the Reformer model to beat the state-of-the-art Transformer in IWSLT14
German-English and NIST12 Chinese-English with about 50% fewer parameters. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/lyy1994/reformer.

  Subjective bias detection is critical for applications like propaganda
detection, content recommendation, sentiment analysis, and bias neutralization.
This bias is introduced in natural language via inflammatory words and phrases,
casting doubt over facts, and presupposing the truth. In this work, we perform
comprehensive experiments for detecting subjective bias using BERT-based models
on the Wiki Neutrality Corpus(WNC). The dataset consists of $360k$ labeled
instances, from Wikipedia edits that remove various instances of the bias. We
further propose BERT-based ensembles that outperform state-of-the-art methods
like $BERT_{large}$ by a margin of $5.6$ F1 score.

Title: SBERT-WK: A Sentence Embedding Method by Dissecting BERT-based Word
  Models
Authors: Bin Wang, C.-C. Jay Kuo
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG cs.MM
Comments: 13 pages, 3 figure, 8 tables
\\
  Sentence embedding is an important research topic in natural language
processing (NLP) since it can transfer knowledge to downstream tasks.
Meanwhile, a contextualized word representation, called BERT, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in quite a few NLP tasks. Yet, it is an open
problem to generate a high quality sentence representation from BERT-based word
models. It was shown in previous study that different layers of BERT capture
different linguistic properties. This allows us to fusion information across
layers to find better sentence representation. In this work, we study the
layer-wise pattern of the word representation of deep contextualized models.
Then, we propose a new sentence embedding method by dissecting BERT-based word
models through geometric analysis of the space spanned by the word
representation. It is called the SBERT-WK method. No further training is
required in SBERT-WK. We evaluate SBERT-WK on semantic textual similarity and
downstream supervised tasks. Furthermore, ten sentence-level probing tasks are
presented for detailed linguistic analysis. Experiments show that SBERT-WK
achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Our codes are publicly available.

  The purpose of this study is to analyze the efficacy of transfer learning
techniques and transformer-based models as applied to medical natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, specifically radiological text classification. We used
1,977 labeled head CT reports, from a corpus of 96,303 total reports, to
evaluate the efficacy of pretraining using general domain corpora and a
combined general and medical domain corpus with a bidirectional representations
from transformers (BERT) model for the purpose of radiological text
classification. Model performance was benchmarked to a logistic regression
using bag-of-words vectorization and a long short-term memory (LSTM)
multi-label multi-class classification model, and compared to the published
literature in medical text classification. The BERT models using either set of
pretrained checkpoints outperformed the logistic regression model, achieving
sample-weighted average F1-scores of 0.87 and 0.87 for the general domain model
and the combined general and biomedical-domain model. General text transfer
learning may be a viable technique to generate state-of-the-art results within
medical NLP tasks on radiological corpora, outperforming other deep models such
as LSTMs. The efficacy of pretraining and transformer-based models could serve
to facilitate the creation of groundbreaking NLP models in the uniquely
challenging data environment of medical text.

\\
  Ainu is an unwritten language that has been spoken by Ainu people who are one
of the ethnic groups in Japan. It is recognized as critically endangered by
UNESCO and archiving and documentation of its language heritage is of paramount
importance. Although a considerable amount of voice recordings of Ainu folklore
has been produced and accumulated to save their culture, only a quite limited
parts of them are transcribed so far. Thus, we started a project of automatic
speech recognition (ASR) for the Ainu language in order to contribute to the
development of annotated language archives. In this paper, we report speech
corpus development and the structure and performance of end-to-end ASR for
Ainu. We investigated four modeling units (phone, syllable, word piece, and
word) and found that the syllable-based model performed best in terms of both
word and phone recognition accuracy, which were about 60% and over 85%
respectively in speaker-open condition. Furthermore, word and phone accuracy of
80% and 90% has been achieved in a speaker-closed setting. We also found out
that a multilingual ASR training with additional speech corpora of English and
Japanese further improves the speaker-open test accuracy.

\\
  In this work, we have introduced Gaussian Smoothen Semantic Features (GSSF)
for Better Semantic Selection for Indian regional language-based image
captioning and introduced a procedure where we used the existing translation
and English crowd-sourced sentences for training. We have shown that this
architecture is a promising alternative source, where there is a crunch in
resources. Our main contribution of this work is the development of deep
learning architectures for the Bengali language (is the fifth widely spoken
language in the world) with a completely different grammar and language
attributes. We have shown that these are working well for complex applications
like language generation from image contexts and can diversify the
representation through introducing constraints, more extensive features, and
unique feature spaces. We also established that we could achieve absolute
precision and diversity when we use smoothened semantic tensor with the
traditional LSTM and feature decomposition networks. With better learning
architecture, we succeeded in establishing an automated algorithm and
assessment procedure that can help in the evaluation of competent applications
without the requirement for expertise and human intervention.

Title: Multi-layer Representation Fusion for Neural Machine Translation
Authors: Qiang Wang, Fuxue Li, Tong Xiao, Yanyang Li, Yinqiao Li, Jingbo Zhu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: COLING 2018
\\
  Neural machine translation systems require a number of stacked layers for
deep models. But the prediction depends on the sentence representation of the
top-most layer with no access to low-level representations. This makes it more
difficult to train the model and poses a risk of information loss to
prediction. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer representation fusion
(MLRF) approach to fusing stacked layers. In particular, we design three fusion
functions to learn a better representation from the stack. Experimental results
show that our approach yields improvements of 0.92 and 0.56 BLEU points over
the strong Transformer baseline on IWSLT German-English and NIST
Chinese-English MT tasks respectively. The result is new state-of-the-art in
German-English translation.

\\
  The recently proposed BERT has shown great power on a variety of natural
language understanding tasks, such as text classification, reading
comprehension, etc. However, how to effectively apply BERT to neural machine
translation (NMT) lacks enough exploration. While BERT is more commonly used as
fine-tuning instead of contextual embedding for downstream language
understanding tasks, in NMT, our preliminary exploration of using BERT as
contextual embedding is better than using for fine-tuning. This motivates us to
think how to better leverage BERT for NMT along this direction. We propose a
new algorithm named BERT-fused model, in which we first use BERT to extract
representations for an input sequence, and then the representations are fused
with each layer of the encoder and decoder of the NMT model through attention
mechanisms. We conduct experiments on supervised (including sentence-level and
document-level translations), semi-supervised and unsupervised machine
translation, and achieve state-of-the-art results on seven benchmark datasets.

Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables. Accepted at LREC 2020
\\
  Today's research progress in the field of multi-document summarization is
obstructed by the small number of available datasets. Since the acquisition of
reference summaries is costly, existing datasets contain only hundreds of
samples at most, resulting in heavy reliance on hand-crafted features or
necessitating additional, manually annotated data. The lack of large corpora
therefore hinders the development of sophisticated models. Additionally, most
publicly available multi-document summarization corpora are in the news domain,
and no analogous dataset exists in the video game domain. In this paper, we
propose GameWikiSum, a new domain-specific dataset for multi-document
summarization, which is one hundred times larger than commonly used datasets,
and in another domain than news. Input documents consist of long professional
video game reviews as well as references of their gameplay sections in
Wikipedia pages. We analyze the proposed dataset and show that both abstractive
and extractive models can be trained on it. We release GameWikiSum for further
research: https://github.com/Diego999/GameWikiSum.

\\
  Today, recommender systems are an inevitable part of everyone's daily digital
routine and are present on most internet platforms. State-of-the-art deep
learning-based models require a large number of data to achieve their best
performance. Many datasets fulfilling this criterion have been proposed for
multiple domains, such as Amazon products, restaurants, or beers. However,
works and datasets in the hotel domain are limited: the largest hotel review
dataset is below the million samples. Additionally, the hotel domain suffers
from a higher data sparsity than traditional recommendation datasets and
therefore, traditional collaborative-filtering approaches cannot be applied to
such data. In this paper, we propose HotelRec, a very large-scale hotel
recommendation dataset, based on TripAdvisor, containing 50 million reviews. To
the best of our knowledge, HotelRec is the largest publicly available dataset
in the hotel domain (50M versus 0.9M) and additionally, the largest
recommendation dataset in a single domain and with textual reviews (50M versus
22M). We release HotelRec for further research:

  Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is vulnerable to malware due to its
exposure to external adversaries, making it a lucrative attack vector for
malicious actors. A datacenter infected with malware can cause data loss and/or
major disruptions to service for its users. This paper analyzes and compares

level performance metrics including cpu usage, memory usage, disk usage etc. We
have used the state of the art DenseNets and ResNets in effectively detecting
malware in online cloud system. CNN are designed to extract features from data
gathered from a live malware running on a real cloud environment. Experiments
are performed on OpenStack (a cloud IaaS software) testbed designed to
replicate a typical 3-tier web architecture. Comparative analysis is performed
for different metrics for different CNN models used in this research.

Title: Bitcoin's Blockchain Data Analytics: A Graph Theoretic Perspective
Authors: Aman Sharma, Ashutosh Bhatia
Categories: cs.CR cs.DC cs.NI
\\
  Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency used worldwide. It provides
pseudonymity to its users by establishing identity using public keys as
transaction end-points. These transactions are recorded on an immutable public
ledger called Blockchain which is an append-only data structure. The popularity
of Bitcoin has increased unreasonably. The general trend shows a positive
response from the common masses indicating an increase in trust and privacy
concerns which makes an interesting use case from the analysis point of view.
Moreover, since the blockchain is publicly available and up-to-date, any
analysis would provide a live insight into the usage patterns which ultimately
would be useful for making a number of inferences by law-enforcement agencies,
economists, tech-enthusiasts, etc. In this paper, we study various applications
and techniques of performing data analytics over Bitcoin blockchain from a
graph theoretic perspective. We also propose a framework for performing such
data analytics and explored a couple of use cases using the proposed framework.

  The rapid growth of online advertising has fueled the growth of ad-blocking
software, such as new ad-blocking and privacy-oriented browsers or browser
extensions. In response, both ad publishers and ad networks are constantly
trying to pursue new strategies to keep up their revenues. To this end, ad
networks have started to leverage the Web Push technology enabled by modern web
browsers.
  As web push notifications (WPNs) are relatively new, their role in ad
delivery has not been yet studied in depth. Furthermore, it is unclear to what
extent WPN ads are being abused for malvertising (i.e., to deliver malicious
ads). In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we propose a system
called PushAdMiner that is dedicated to (1) automatically registering for and
collecting a large number of web-based push notifications from publisher
websites, (2) finding WPN-based ads among these notifications, and (3)
discovering malicious WPN-based ad campaigns.
  Using PushAdMiner, we collected and analyzed 21,541 WPN messages by visiting
thousands of different websites. Among these, our system identified 572 WPN ad
campaigns, for a total of 5,143 WPN-based ads that were pushed by a variety of
ad networks. Furthermore, we found that 51% of all WPN ads we collected are
malicious, and that traditional ad-blockers and malicious URL filters are
remarkably ineffective against WPN-based malicious ads, leaving a significant
abuse vector unchecked.

Title: Security of HyperLogLog (HLL) Cardinality Estimation: Vulnerabilities
  and Protection
Authors: Pedro Reviriego and Daniel Ting
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Count distinct or cardinality estimates are widely used in network monitoring
for security. They can be used, for example, to detect the malware spread,
network scans, or a denial of service attack. There are many algorithms to
estimate cardinality. Among those, HyperLogLog (HLL) has been one of the most
widely adopted. HLL is simple, provides good cardinality estimates over a wide
range of values, requires a small amount of memory, and allows merging of
estimates from different sources. However, as HLL is increasingly used to
detect attacks, it can itself become the target of attackers that want to avoid
being detected. To the best of our knowledge, the security of HLL has not been
studied before. In this letter, we take an initial step in its study by first
exposing a vulnerability of HLL that allows an attacker to manipulate its
estimate. This shows the importance of designing secure HLL implementations. In
the second part of the letter, we propose an efficient protection technique to
detect and avoid the HLL manipulation. The results presented strongly suggest
that the security of HLL should be further studied given that it is widely
adopted in many networking and computing applications.

Title: Blind Adversarial Network Perturbations
Authors: Milad Nasr, Alireza Bahramali, Amir Houmansadr
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are commonly used for various traffic analysis
problems, such as website fingerprinting and flow correlation, as they
outperform traditional (e.g., statistical) techniques by large margins.
However, deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples: adversarial inputs to the model that get labeled incorrectly by the
model due to small adversarial perturbations. In this paper, for the first
time, we show that an adversary can defeat DNN-based traffic analysis
techniques by applying \emph{adversarial perturbations} on the patterns of
\emph{live} network traffic.

Title: Privaros: A Framework for Privacy-Compliant Drones
Authors: Rakesh Rajan Beck and Abhishek Vijeev and Vinod Ganapathy
Categories: cs.CR cs.OS
\\
  We present Privaros, a framework to enforce privacy policies on drones.
Privaros is designed for commercial delivery drones, such as the ones that will
likely be used by Amazon Prime Air. Such drones visit a number of host
airspaces, each of which may have different privacy requirements. Privaros
provides an information flow control framework to enforce the policies of these
hosts on the guest delivery drones. The mechanisms in Privaros are built on top
of ROS, a middleware popular in many drone platforms. This paper presents the
design and implementation of these mechanisms, describes how policies are
specified, and shows that Privaros's policy specification can be integrated
with India's Digital Sky portal. Our evaluation shows that a drone running
Privaros can robustly enforce various privacy policies specified by hosts, and
that its core mechanisms only marginally increase communication latency and
power consumption.

Title: On the Feasibility of Sybil Attacks in Shard-Based Permissionless
  Blockchains
Authors: Tayebeh Rajab, Mohammad Hossein Manshaei, Mohammad Dakhilalian,
  Murtuza Jadliwala, Mohammad Ashiqur Rahman
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Bitcoin's single leader consensus protocol (Nakamoto consensus) suffers from
significant transaction throughput and network scalability issues due to the
computational requirements of it Proof-of-Work (PoW) based leader selection
strategy. To overcome this, committee-based approaches (e.g., Elastico) that
partition the outstanding transaction set into shards and (randomly) select
multiple committees to process these transactions in parallel have been
proposed and have become very popular. However, by design these committee or
shard-based blockchain solutions are easily vulnerable to the Sybil attacks,
where an adversary can easily compromise/manipulate the consensus protocol if
it has enough computational power to generate multiple Sybil committee members
(by generating multiple valid node identifiers). Despite the straightforward
nature of these attacks, they have not been systematically analyzed. In this
paper, we fill this research gap by modelling and analyzing Sybil attacks in a
representative and popular shard-based protocol called Elastico. We show that
the PoW technique used for identifier or ID generation in the initial phase of
the protocol is vulnerable to Sybil attacks, and a node with high hash-power
can generate enough Sybil IDs to successfully compromise Elastico. We
analytically derive conditions for two different categories of Sybil attacks
and perform numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results under
different network and protocol parameters.

Title: Congestion Attacks in Payment Channel Networks
Authors: Ayelet Mizrahi and Aviv Zohar
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Payment channel networks provide a fast and scalable solution to relay funds,
acting as a second layer to slower and less scalable blockchain protocols. In
this paper, we present an accessible, low-cost attack, in which the attacker
paralyzes multiple payment network channels for several days. The attack is
based on overloading channels with requests that are kept unresolved until
their expiration time. Reaching the maximum allowed unresolved requests (HTLCs)
locks the channel for new payments. The attack is in fact inherent to the way
off-chain networks are constructed, since limits on the number of unresolved
payments are derived from limits on the blockchain. We consider two main
versions of the attack: one in which the attacker attempts to block as many
high liquidity channels as possible, and one in which it tries to isolate
individual nodes from the network. We evaluate the costs of both attacks on
Bitcoin's Lightning Network, and compare how changes in the network have
affected the cost of attack. Specifically, we consider how recent changes to
default parameters in each of the main Lightning implementations contribute to
the attack. As we evaluate the attacks, we also look at statistics on
parameters in the Lightning Network which are of independent interest and
compare the various implementations of Lightning nodes. Finally, we suggest
mitigation techniques that make the attack much harder to carry out.

Title: AMOUN: Asymmetric lightweight cryptographic scheme for wireless group
  communication
Authors: Ahmad Mansour, Khalid M. Malik and Niko Kaso
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Multi-recipient cryptographic schemes provide secure communication, between
one sender and multiple recipients, in a multi-party group. Providing secure
multi-party communication is very challenging, especially in dynamic networks.
Existing multi-recipient cryptographic schemes pose a variety of limitations.
These include high computational overhead for both encryption and decryption,
additional communication overhead and high setup cost due to change in
membership, and collusion among recipients. In order to overcome these
limitations, this paper introduces a novel asymmetric multi-recipient
cryptographic scheme, AMOUN. In the proposed scheme, to better utilize network
resources, the sender transmits a ciphertext containing different messages to
multiple recipients, where each recipient only allowed to retrieve its own
designated message. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is
indistinguishable under adaptive chosen plaintext attack. Quantitative analysis
reveals that lightweight AMOUN shows lower average computational cost than both
RSA and Multi-RSA, for both encryption and decryption, even when the key sizes
are four times larger. For a given prime size, in case of encryption, AMOUN
shows 98% and 99% lower average computational cost than RSA and Multi-RSA,
respectively. For decryption, AMOUN shows a performance improvement of 99%
compared to RSA and Multi-RSA.

  New data processing pipelines and novel network architectures increasingly
drive the success of deep learning. In consequence, the industry considers
top-performing architectures as intellectual property and devotes considerable
computational resources to discovering such architectures through neural
architecture search (NAS). This provides an incentive for adversaries to steal
these novel architectures; when used in the cloud, to provide Machine Learning
as a Service, the adversaries also have an opportunity to reconstruct the
architectures by exploiting a range of hardware side channels. However, it is
challenging to reconstruct novel architectures and pipelines without knowing
the computational graph (e.g., the layers, branches or skip connections), the
architectural parameters (e.g., the number of filters in a convolutional layer)
or the specific pre-processing steps (e.g. embeddings). In this paper, we
design an algorithm that reconstructs the key components of a novel deep
learning system by exploiting a small amount of information leakage from a
cache side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. We use Flush+Reload to infer the trace
of computations and the timing for each computation. Our algorithm then
generates candidate computational graphs from the trace and eliminates
incompatible candidates through a parameter estimation process. We implement
our algorithm in PyTorch and Tensorflow. We demonstrate experimentally that we
can reconstruct MalConv, a novel data pre-processing pipeline for malware
detection, and ProxylessNAS- CPU, a novel network architecture for the ImageNet
classification optimized to run on CPUs, without knowing the architecture
family. In both cases, we achieve 0% error. These results suggest hardware side
channels are a practical attack vector against MLaaS, and more efforts should
be devoted to understanding their impact on the security of deep learning
systems.

Title: Computing in Covert Domain Using Data Hiding
Authors: Zhenxing Qian, Zichi Wang, Xinpeng Zhang
Categories: cs.CR cs.MM
Comments: 5 pages, 7 figures
\\
  This paper proposes an idea of data computing in the covert domain (DCCD). We
show that with information hiding some data computing tasks can be executed
beneath the covers like images, audios, random data, etc. In the proposed
framework, a sender hides his source data into two covers and uploads them onto
a server. The server executes computation within the stego and returns the
covert computing result to a receiver. With the covert result, the receiver can
extract the computing result of the source data. During the process, it is
imperceptible for the server and the adversaries to obtain the source data as
they are hidden in the cover. The transmission can be done over public
channels. Meanwhile, since the computation is realized in the covert domain,
the cloud cannot obtain the knowledge of the computing result. Therefore, the
proposed idea is useful for cloud computing.

Title: Tools and Techniques for Malware Detection and Analysis

\\
  One of the major and serious threats that the Internet faces today is the
vast amounts of data and files which need to be evaluated for potential
malicious intent. Malicious software, often referred to as a malware that are
designed by attackers are polymorphic and metamorphic in nature which have the
capability to change their code as they spread. Moreover, the diversity and
volume of their variants severely undermine the effectiveness of traditional
defenses which typically use signature based techniques and are unable to
detect the previously unknown malicious executables. The variants of malware
families share typical behavioral patterns reflecting their origin and purpose.
The behavioral patterns obtained either statically or dynamically can be
exploited to detect and classify unknown malware into their known families
using machine learning techniques. This survey paper provides an overview of
techniques and tools for detecting and analyzing the malware.

Title: An Efficient Permissioned Blockchain Model with Provable Reputation
  Mechanism
Authors: Hongyin Chen, Zhaohua Chen, Yukun Cheng, Xiaotie Deng, Wenhan Huang,

Categories: cs.CR cs.CY
\\
  Permissioned blockchain, in which only known nodes are allowed to
participate, has been widely used by governments, companies, institutes and so
on. We study the case where permissioned blockchain is applied to the field of
horizontal strategic alliances to ensure that any participant of the alliance
who does not follow the regulation will be detected and punished for his
behavior afterward. We propose a general hierarchical model of permissioned
blockchain which includes three tiers: providers, collectors, and governors. To
utilize the overlap of collectors in gathering transactions from providers, we
introduce the reputation as a measure of the reliability of the collectors.
With the help of reputation system, governors will not need to check all
transactions uploaded by collectors. As a result, our protocol will have a
significant improvement in efficiency. Meanwhile, let us denote $T$ to be the
number of total transactions. Then the number of mistakes that governors suffer
is only asymptotically $O(\sqrt{T})$ when guided by our reputation mechanism,
as long as there exists a collector who behaves well. This result implies that
our protocol remains high performance. The reputation mechanism also provides
incentives for collectors to work honestly. To our knowledge, Our work is the
first one to give an analytical result on reputation mechanism in permissioned
blockchains. Furthermore, we demonstrate two typical cases where our model can
be well applied to.

Title: A New Methodology for Information Security Risk Assessment for Medical
  Devices and Its Evaluation
Authors: Tom Mahler, Yuval Elovici, Yuval Shahar
Categories: cs.CR cs.CY
Comments: 24 pages, 6 figures
\\
  As technology advances towards more connected and digital environments,
medical devices are becoming increasingly connected to hospital networks and to
the Internet, which exposes them, and thus the patients using them, to new
cybersecurity threats. Currently, there is a lack of a methodology dedicated to
information security risk assessment for medical devices.
  In this study, we present the Threat identification, ontology-based
Likelihood, severity Decomposition, and Risk integration (TLDR) methodology for
information security risk assessment for medical devices. The TLDR methodology
uses the following steps: (1) identifying the potentially vulnerable components
of medical devices, in this case, four different medical imaging devices
(MIDs); (2) identifying the potential attacks, in this case, 23 potential
attacks on MIDs; (3) mapping the discovered attacks into a known attack
ontology - in this case, the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and
Classifications (CAPECs); (4) estimating the likelihood of the mapped CAPECs in
the medical domain with the assistance of a panel of senior healthcare
Information Security Experts (ISEs); (5) computing the CAPEC-based likelihood
estimates of each attack; (6) decomposing each attack into several severity
aspects and assigning them weights; (7) assessing the magnitude of the impact
of each of the severity aspects for each attack with the assistance of a panel
of senior Medical Experts (MEs); (8) computing the composite severity
assessments for each attack; and finally, (9) integrating the likelihood and
severity of each attack into its risk, and thus prioritizing it. The details of
steps six to eight are beyond the scope of the current study; in the current
study, we had replaced them by a single step that included asking the panel of
MEs [in this case, radiologists], to assess the overall severity for each
attack and use it as its severity...

Title: A Lightweight ISA Extension for AES and SM4
Authors: Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 4 pages
\\
  We describe a lightweight RISC-V ISA extension for AES and SM4 block ciphers.
Sixteen instructions (and a subkey load) is required to implement an AES round
with the extension, instead of 80 without. An SM4 step (quarter-round) has 6.5
arithmetic instructions, a similar reduction. Perhaps even more importantly the
ISA extension helps to eliminate slow, secret-dependent table lookups and to
protect against cache timing side-channel attacks. Having only one S-box, the
extension has a minimal hardware size and is well suited for ultra-low power
applications. AES and SM4 implementations using the ISA extension also have a
much-reduced software footprint. The AES and SM4 instances can share the same
data paths but are independent in the sense that a chip designer can implement
SM4 without AES and vice versa. Full AES and SM4 assembler listings, HDL source
code for instruction's combinatorial logic, and C code for emulation is
provided to the community under a permissive open source license. The
implementation contains depth- and size-optimized joint AES and SM4 S-Box logic
based on the Boyar-Peralta construction with a shared non-linear middle layer,
demonstrating additional avenues for logic optimization. The instruction logic
has been experimentally integrated into the single-cycle execution path of the
``Pluto'' RV32 core and has been tested on an FPGA.

  Classification

  Jha, Atul Prakash
Categories: cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We present Survival-OPT, a physical adversarial example algorithm in the
black-box hard-label setting where the attacker only has access to the model
prediction class label. Assuming such limited access to the model is more
relevant for settings such as proprietary cyber-physical and cloud systems than
the whitebox setting assumed by prior work. By leveraging the properties of
physical attacks, we create a novel approach based on the survivability of
perturbations corresponding to physical transformations. Through simply
querying the model for hard-label predictions, we optimize perturbations to
survive in many different physical conditions and show that adversarial
examples remain a security risk to cyber-physical systems (CPSs) even in the
hard-label threat model. We show that Survival-OPT is query-efficient and
robust: using fewer than 200K queries, we successfully attack a stop sign to be
misclassified as a speed limit 30 km/hr sign in 98.5% of video frames in a
drive-by setting. Survival-OPT also outperforms our baseline combination of
existing hard-label and physical approaches, which required over 10x more
queries for less robust results.

Title: Spectrum Translation for Cross-Spectral Ocular Matching
Authors: Kevin Hernandez Diaz, Fernando Alonso-Fernandez, Josef Bigun
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Cross-spectral verification remains a big issue in biometrics, especially for
the ocular area due to differences in the reflected features in the images
depending on the region and spectrum used.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of Conditional Adversarial Networks for
spectrum translation between near infra-red and visual light images for ocular
biometrics. We analyze the transformation based on the overall visual quality
of the transformed images and the accuracy drop of the identification system
when trained with opposing data.
  We use the PolyU database and propose two different systems for biometric
verification, the first one based on Siamese Networks trained with Softmax and
Cross-Entropy loss, and the second one a Triplet Loss network. We achieved an
EER of 1\% when using a Triplet Loss network trained for NIR and finding the
Euclidean distance between the real NIR images and the fake ones translated
from the visible spectrum. We also outperform previous results using baseline
algorithms.

Title: Social-WaGDAT: Interaction-aware Trajectory Prediction via Wasserstein
  Graph Double-Attention Network
Authors: Jiachen Li, Hengbo Ma, Zhihao Zhang, Masayoshi Tomizuka
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA cs.RO
\\
  Effective understanding of the environment and accurate trajectory prediction
of surrounding dynamic obstacles are indispensable for intelligent mobile
systems (like autonomous vehicles and social robots) to achieve safe and
high-quality planning when they navigate in highly interactive and crowded
scenarios. Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the
scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational
reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future
trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative
neural system (called Social-WaGDAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction,
which makes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating
relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages
both trajectory and scene context information. We also employ an efficient
kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction which not
only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. The
proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory
prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles.
The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance
than various baseline approaches in terms of prediction accuracy.

Title: Single Unit Status in Deep Convolutional Neural Network Codes for Face
  Identification: Sparseness Redefined
Authors: Connor J. Parde, Y. Ivette Col\'on, Matthew Q. Hill, Carlos D.

\\
  Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained for face identification
develop representations that generalize over variable images, while retaining
subject (e.g., gender) and image (e.g., viewpoint) information. Identity,
gender, and viewpoint codes were studied at the "neural unit" and ensemble
levels of a face-identification network. At the unit level, identification,
gender classification, and viewpoint estimation were measured by deleting units
to create variably-sized, randomly-sampled subspaces at the top network layer.
Identification of 3,531 identities remained high (area under the ROC
approximately 1.0) as dimensionality decreased from 512 units to 16 (0.95), 4
(0.80), and 2 (0.72) units. Individual identities separated statistically on
every top-layer unit. Cross-unit responses were minimally correlated,
indicating that units code non-redundant identity cues. This "distributed" code
requires only a sparse, random sample of units to identify faces accurately.
Gender classification declined gradually and viewpoint estimation fell steeply
as dimensionality decreased. Individual units were weakly predictive of gender
and viewpoint, but ensembles proved effective predictors. Therefore,
distributed and sparse codes co-exist in the network units to represent
different face attributes. At the ensemble level, principal component analysis
of face representations showed that identity, gender, and viewpoint information
separated into high-dimensional subspaces, ordered by explained variance.
Identity, gender, and viewpoint information contributed to all individual unit
responses, undercutting a neural tuning analogy for face attributes.
Interpretation of neural-like codes from DCNNs, and by analogy, high-level
visual codes, cannot be inferred from single unit responses. Instead, "meaning"
is encoded by directions in the high-dimensional space.

Title: Historical Document Processing: Historical Document Processing: A Survey
  of Techniques, Tools, and Trends
Authors: James P. Philips and Nasseh Tabrizi
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 30 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Historical Document Processing is the process of digitizing written material
from the past for future use by historians and other scholars. It incorporates
algorithms and software tools from various subfields of computer science,
including computer vision, document analysis and recognition, natural language
processing, and machine learning, to convert images of ancient manuscripts,
letters, diaries, and early printed texts automatically into a digital format
usable in data mining and information retrieval systems. Within the past twenty
years, as libraries, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions have
scanned an increasing volume of their historical document archives, the need to
transcribe the full text from these collections has become acute. Since
Historical Document Processing encompasses multiple sub-domains of computer
science, knowledge relevant to its purpose is scattered across numerous
journals and conference proceedings. This paper surveys the major phases of,
standard algorithms, tools, and datasets in the field of Historical Document
Processing, discusses the results of a literature review, and finally suggests
directions for further research.

Title: Cell R-CNN V3: A Novel Panoptic Paradigm for Instance Segmentation in
  Biomedical Images
Authors: Dongnan Liu, Donghao Zhang, Yang Song, Heng Huang, Weidong Cai
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 13 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Instance segmentation is an important task for biomedical image analysis. Due
to the complicated background components, the high variability of object
appearances, numerous overlapping objects, and ambiguous object boundaries,
this task still remains challenging. Recently, deep learning based methods have
been widely employed to solve these problems and can be categorized into
proposal-free and proposal-based methods. However, both proposal-free and
proposal-based methods suffer from information loss, as they focus on either
global-level semantic or local-level instance features. To tackle this issue,
we present a panoptic architecture that unifies the semantic and instance
features in this work. Specifically, our proposed method contains a residual
attention feature fusion mechanism to incorporate the instance prediction with
the semantic features, in order to facilitate the semantic contextual
information learning in the instance branch. Then, a mask quality branch is
designed to align the confidence score of each object with the quality of the
mask prediction. Furthermore, a consistency regularization mechanism is
designed between the semantic segmentation tasks in the semantic and instance
branches, for the robust learning of both tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods on various biomedical datasets.

\\
  We propose UniViLM: a Unified Video and Language pre-training Model for
multimodal understanding and generation. Motivated by the recent success of
BERT based pre-training technique for NLP and image-language tasks, VideoBERT
and CBT are proposed to exploit BERT model for video and language pre-training
using narrated instructional videos. Different from their works which only
pre-train understanding task, we propose a unified video-language pre-training
model for both understanding and generation tasks. Our model comprises of 4
components including two single-modal encoders, a cross encoder and a decoder
with the Transformer backbone. We first pre-train our model to learn the
universal representation for both video and language on a large instructional
video dataset. Then we fine-tune the model on two multimodal tasks including
understanding task (text-based video retrieval) and generation task (multimodal
video captioning). Our extensive experiments show that our method can improve
the performance of both understanding and generation tasks and achieves the
state-of-the art results.

Title: Video Face Super-Resolution with Motion-Adaptive Feedback Cell
Authors: Jingwei Xin, Nannan Wang, Jie Li, Xinbo Gao, Zhifeng Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To appear in AAAI 2020
\\
  Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have recently achieved a remarkable
success due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN).
Current state-of-the-art CNN methods usually treat the VSR problem as a large
number of separate multi-frame super-resolution tasks, at which a batch of low
resolution (LR) frames is utilized to generate a single high resolution (HR)
frame, and running a slide window to select LR frames over the entire video
would obtain a series of HR frames. However, duo to the complex temporal
dependency between frames, with the number of LR input frames increase, the
performance of the reconstructed HR frames become worse. The reason is in that
these methods lack the ability to model complex temporal dependencies and hard
to give an accurate motion estimation and compensation for VSR process. Which
makes the performance degrade drastically when the motion in frames is complex.
In this paper, we propose a Motion-Adaptive Feedback Cell (MAFC), a simple but
effective block, which can efficiently capture the motion compensation and feed
it back to the network in an adaptive way. Our approach efficiently utilizes
the information of the inter-frame motion, the dependence of the network on
motion estimation and compensation method can be avoid. In addition, benefiting
from the excellent nature of MAFC, the network can achieve better performance
in the case of extremely complex motion scenarios. Extensive evaluations and
comparisons validate the strengths of our approach, and the experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed framework is outperform the
state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Scale-Invariant Multi-Oriented Text Detection in Wild Scene Images
Authors: Kinjal Dasgupta, Sudip Das, Ujjwal Bhattacharya
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Automatic detection of scene texts in the wild is a challenging problem,
particularly due to the difficulties in handling (i) occlusions of varying
percentages, (ii) widely different scales and orientations, (iii) severe
degradations in the image quality etc. In this article, we propose a fully
convolutional neural network architecture consisting of a novel Feature
Representation Block (FRB) capable of efficient abstraction of information. The
proposed network has been trained using curriculum learning with respect to
difficulties in image samples and gradual pixel-wise blurring. It is capable of
detecting texts of different scales and orientations suffered by blurring from
multiple possible sources, non-uniform illumination as well as partial
occlusions of varying percentages. Text detection performance of the proposed
framework on various benchmark sample databases including ICDAR 2015, ICDAR
2017 MLT, COCO-Text and MSRA-TD500 improves respective state-of-the-art results
significantly. Source code of the proposed architecture will be made available
at github.

Title: An End-to-End Framework for Unsupervised Pose Estimation of Occluded
  Pedestrians
Authors: Sudip Das, Perla Sai Raj Kishore, Ujjwal Bhattacharya
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Pose estimation in the wild is a challenging problem, particularly in
situations of (i) occlusions of varying degrees and (ii) crowded outdoor
scenes. Most of the existing studies of pose estimation did not report the
performance in similar situations. Moreover, pose annotations for occluded
parts of human figures have not been provided in any of the relevant standard
datasets which in turn creates further difficulties to the required studies for
pose estimation of the entire figure of occluded humans. Well known pedestrian
detection datasets such as CityPersons contains samples of outdoor scenes but
it does not include pose annotations. Here, we propose a novel multi-task
framework for end-to-end training towards the entire pose estimation of
pedestrians including in situations of any kind of occlusion. To tackle this
problem for training the network, we make use of a pose estimation dataset,
MS-COCO, and employ unsupervised adversarial instance-level domain adaptation
for estimating the entire pose of occluded pedestrians. The experimental
studies show that the proposed framework outperforms the SOTA results for pose
estimation, instance segmentation and pedestrian detection in cases of heavy
occlusions (HO) and reasonable + heavy occlusions (R + HO) on the two benchmark
datasets.

  Generative deep learning has sparked a new wave of Super-Resolution (SR)
algorithms that enhance single images with impressive aesthetic results, albeit
with imaginary details. Multi-frame Super-Resolution (MFSR) offers a more
grounded approach to the ill-posed problem, by conditioning on multiple
low-resolution views. This is important for satellite monitoring of human
impact on the planet -- from deforestation, to human rights violations -- that
depend on reliable imagery. To this end, we present HighRes-net, the first deep
learning approach to MFSR that learns its sub-tasks in an end-to-end fashion:
(i) co-registration, (ii) fusion, (iii) up-sampling, and (iv)
registration-at-the-loss. Co-registration of low-resolution views is learned
implicitly through a reference-frame channel, with no explicit registration
mechanism. We learn a global fusion operator that is applied recursively on an
arbitrary number of low-resolution pairs. We introduce a registered loss, by
learning to align the SR output to a ground-truth through ShiftNet. We show
that by learning deep representations of multiple views, we can super-resolve
low-resolution signals and enhance Earth Observation data at scale. Our
approach recently topped the European Space Agency's MFSR competition on
real-world satellite imagery.

Title: A Multiple Decoder CNN for Inverse Consistent 3D Image Registration
Authors: Abdullah Nazib, Clinton Fookes, Olivier Salvado, Dimitri Perrin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The recent application of deep learning technologies in medical image
registration has exponentially decreased the registration time and gradually
increased registration accuracy when compared to their traditional
counterparts. Most of the learning-based registration approaches considers this
task as a one directional problem. As a result, only correspondence from the
moving image to the target image is considered. However, in some medical
procedures bidirectional registration is required to be performed. Unlike other
learning-based registration, we propose a registration framework with inverse
consistency. The proposed method simultaneously learns forward transformation
and backward transformation in an unsupervised manner. We perform training and
testing of the method on the publicly available LPBA40 MRI dataset and
demonstrate strong performance than baseline registration methods.

  We address the problem of discovering 3D parts for objects in unseen
categories. Being able to learn the geometry prior of parts and transfer this
prior to unseen categories pose fundamental challenges on data-driven shape
segmentation approaches. Formulated as a contextual bandit problem, we propose
a learning-based agglomerative clustering framework which learns a grouping
policy to progressively group small part proposals into bigger ones in a
bottom-up fashion. At the core of our approach is to restrict the local context
for extracting part-level features, which encourages the generalizability to
unseen categories. On the large-scale fine-grained 3D part dataset, PartNet, we
demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge of parts learned from 3
training categories to 21 unseen testing categories without seeing any
annotated samples. Quantitative comparisons against four shape segmentation
baselines shows that our approach achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

conventional approach of learning a global threshold for all pairs resulting in
performance gaps among subgroups. By learning subgroup-specific thresholds, we
not only mitigate problems in performance gaps but also show a notable boost in
the overall performance. Furthermore, we do a human evaluation to measure the
bias in humans, which supports the hypothesis that such a bias exists in human
perception. For the BFW database, source code, and more, visit

Title: A Real-Time Deep Network for Crowd Counting
Authors: Xiaowen Shi, Xin Li, Caili Wu, Shuchen Kong, Jing Yang, Liang He
Categories: cs.CV
Journal-ref: IEEE ICASSP 2020
\\
  Automatic analysis of highly crowded people has attracted extensive attention
from computer vision research. Previous approaches for crowd counting have
already achieved promising performance across various benchmarks. However, to
deal with the real situation, we hope the model run as fast as possible while
keeping accuracy. In this paper, we propose a compact convolutional neural
network for crowd counting which learns a more efficient model with a small
number of parameters. With three parallel filters executing the convolutional
operation on the input image simultaneously at the front of the network, our
model could achieve nearly real-time speed and save more computing resources.
Experiments on two benchmarks show that our proposed method not only takes a
balance between performance and efficiency which is more suitable for actual
scenes but also is superior to existing light-weight models in speed.

Title: Facial Attribute Capsules for Noise Face Super Resolution
Authors: Jingwei Xin, Nannan Wang, Xinrui Jiang, Jie Li, Xinbo Gao, Zhifeng Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To appear in AAAI 2020
\\
  Existing face super-resolution (SR) methods mainly assume the input image to
be noise-free. Their performance degrades drastically when applied to
real-world scenarios where the input image is always contaminated by noise. In
this paper, we propose a Facial Attribute Capsules Network (FACN) to deal with
the problem of high-scale super-resolution of noisy face image. Capsule is a
group of neurons whose activity vector models different properties of the same
entity. Inspired by the concept of capsule, we propose an integrated
representation model of facial information, which named Facial Attribute
Capsule (FAC). In the SR processing, we first generated a group of FACs from
the input LR face, and then reconstructed the HR face from this group of FACs.
Aiming to effectively improve the robustness of FAC to noise, we generate FAC
in semantic, probabilistic and facial attributes manners by means of integrated
learning strategy. Each FAC can be divided into two sub-capsules: Semantic
Capsule (SC) and Probabilistic Capsule (PC). Them describe an explicit facial
attribute in detail from two aspects of semantic representation and probability
distribution. The group of FACs model an image as a combination of facial
attribute information in the semantic space and probabilistic space by an
attribute-disentangling way. The diverse FACs could better combine the face
prior information to generate the face images with fine-grained semantic
attributes. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves
superior hallucination results and outperforms state-of-the-art for very low
resolution (LR) noise face image super resolution.

  We showcase a topological mapping framework for a challenging indoor
warehouse setting. At the most abstract level, the warehouse is represented as
a Topological Graph where the nodes of the graph represent a particular
warehouse topological construct (e.g. rackspace, corridor) and the edges denote
the existence of a path between two neighbouring nodes or topologies. At the
intermediate level, the map is represented as a Manhattan Graph where the nodes
and edges are characterized by Manhattan properties and as a Pose Graph at the
lower-most level of detail. The topological constructs are learned via a Deep
Convolutional Network while the relational properties between topological
instances are learnt via a Siamese-style Neural Network. In the paper, we show
that maintaining abstractions such as Topological Graph and Manhattan Graph
help in recovering an accurate Pose Graph starting from a highly erroneous and
unoptimized Pose Graph. We show how this is achieved by embedding topological
and Manhattan relations as well as Manhattan Graph aided loop closure relations
as constraints in the backend Pose Graph optimization framework. The recovery
of near ground-truth Pose Graph on real-world indoor warehouse scenes vindicate
the efficacy of the proposed framework.

Comments: Accepted to ICLR2020
\\
  Learning-based approaches for semantic segmentation have two inherent
challenges. First, acquiring pixel-wise labels is expensive and time-consuming.
Second, realistic segmentation datasets are highly unbalanced: some categories
are much more abundant than others, biasing the performance to the most
represented ones. In this paper, we are interested in focusing human labelling
effort on a small subset of a larger pool of data, minimizing this effort while
maximizing performance of a segmentation model on a hold-out set. We present a
new active learning strategy for semantic segmentation based on deep
reinforcement learning (RL). An agent learns a policy to select a subset of
small informative image regions -- opposed to entire images -- to be labeled,
from a pool of unlabeled data. The region selection decision is made based on
predictions and uncertainties of the segmentation model being trained. Our
method proposes a new modification of the deep Q-network (DQN) formulation for
active learning, adapting it to the large-scale nature of semantic segmentation
problems. We test the proof of concept in CamVid and provide results in the
large-scale dataset Cityscapes. On Cityscapes, our deep RL region-based DQN
approach requires roughly 30% less additional labeled data than our most
competitive baseline to reach the same performance. Moreover, we find that our
method asks for more labels of under-represented categories compared to the
baselines, improving their performance and helping to mitigate class imbalance.

Title: Analytic Marching: An Analytic Meshing Solution from Deep Implicit
  Surface Networks
Authors: Jiabao Lei and Kui Jia
Categories: cs.CV cs.GR
\\
  This paper studies a problem of learning surface mesh via implicit functions
in an emerging field of deep learning surface reconstruction, where implicit
functions are popularly implemented as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with
rectified linear units (ReLU). To achieve meshing from learned implicit
functions, existing methods adopt the de-facto standard algorithm of marching
cubes; while promising, they suffer from loss of precision learned in the MLPs,
due to the discretization nature of marching cubes. Motivated by the knowledge
that a ReLU based MLP partitions its input space into a number of linear
regions, we identify from these regions analytic cells and analytic faces that
are associated with zero-level isosurface of the implicit function, and
characterize the theoretical conditions under which the identified analytic
faces are guaranteed to connect and form a closed, piecewise planar surface.
Based on our theorem, we propose a naturally parallelizable algorithm of
analytic marching, which marches among analytic cells to exactly recover the
mesh captured by a learned MLP. Experiments on deep learning mesh
reconstruction verify the advantages of our algorithm over existing ones.

Title: Key Points Estimation and Point Instance Segmentation Approach for Lane
  Detection
Authors: Yeongmin Ko, Jiwon Jun, Donghwuy Ko, Moongu Jeon
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  State-of-the-art lane detection methods achieve successful performance.
Despite their advantages, these methods have critical deficiencies such as the
limited number of detectable lanes and high false positive. In especial, high
false positive can cause wrong and dangerous control. In this paper, we propose
a novel lane detection method for the arbitrary number of lanes using the deep
learning method, which has the lower number of false positives than other
recent lane detection methods. The architecture of the proposed method has the
shared feature extraction layers and several branches for detection and
embedding to cluster lanes. The proposed method can generate exact points on
the lanes, and we cast a clustering problem for the generated points as a point
cloud instance segmentation problem. The proposed method is more compact
because it generates fewer points than the original image pixel size. Our
proposed post processing method eliminates outliers successfully and increases
the performance notably. Whole proposed framework achieves competitive results
on the tuSimple dataset.

Title: CRL: Class Representative Learning for Image Classification
Authors: Mayanka Chandrashekar and Yugyung Lee
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 15 pages, Table 8, Figure 6
\\
  Building robust and real-time classifiers with diverse datasets are one of
the most significant challenges to deep learning researchers. It is because
there is a considerable gap between a model built with training (seen) data and
real (unseen) data in applications. Recent works including Zero-Shot Learning
(ZSL), have attempted to deal with this problem of overcoming the apparent gap
through transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called
Class Representative Learning Model (CRL), that can be especially effective in
image classification influenced by ZSL. In the CRL model, first, the learning
step is to build class representatives to represent classes in datasets by
aggregating prominent features extracted from a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Second, the inferencing step in CRL is to match between the class
representatives and new data. The proposed CRL model demonstrated superior
performance compared to the current state-of-the-art research in ZSL and mobile
deep learning. The proposed CRL model has been implemented and evaluated in a
parallel environment, using Apache Spark, for both distributed learning and
recognition. An extensive experimental study on the benchmark datasets,
ImageNet-1K, CalTech-101, CalTech-256, CIFAR-100, shows that CRL can build a
class distribution model with drastic improvement in learning and recognition
performance without sacrificing accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
performances in image classification.

Title: Block Annotation: Better Image Annotation for Semantic Segmentation with
  Sub-Image Decomposition
Authors: Hubert Lin, Paul Upchurch, Kavita Bala
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: ICCV 2019; http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~hubert/block_annotation/
\\
  Image datasets with high-quality pixel-level annotations are valuable for
semantic segmentation: labelling every pixel in an image ensures that rare
classes and small objects are annotated. However, full-image annotations are
expensive, with experts spending up to 90 minutes per image. We propose block
sub-image annotation as a replacement for full-image annotation. Despite the
attention cost of frequent task switching, we find that block annotations can
be crowdsourced at higher quality compared to full-image annotation with equal
monetary cost using existing annotation tools developed for full-image
annotation. Surprisingly, we find that 50% pixels annotated with blocks allows
semantic segmentation to achieve equivalent performance to 100% pixels
annotated. Furthermore, as little as 12% of pixels annotated allows performance
as high as 98% of the performance with dense annotation. In weakly-supervised
settings, block annotation outperforms existing methods by 3-4% (absolute)
given equivalent annotation time. To recover the necessary global structure for
applications such as characterizing spatial context and affordance
relationships, we propose an effective method to inpaint block-annotated images
with high-quality labels without additional human effort. As such, fewer
annotations can also be used for these applications compared to full-image
annotation.

Title: Latent Normalizing Flows for Many-to-Many Cross-Domain Mappings
Authors: Shweta Mahajan, Iryna Gurevych, Stefan Roth
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020
\\
  Learned joint representations of images and text form the backbone of several
important cross-domain tasks such as image captioning. Prior work mostly maps
both domains into a common latent representation in a purely supervised
fashion. This is rather restrictive, however, as the two domains follow
distinct generative processes. Therefore, we propose a novel semi-supervised
framework, which models shared information between domains and domain-specific
information separately. The information shared between the domains is aligned
with an invertible neural network. Our model integrates normalizing flow-based
priors for the domain-specific information, which allows us to learn diverse
many-to-many mappings between the two domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model on diverse tasks, including image captioning and text-to-image
synthesis.

Title: PeelNet: Textured 3D reconstruction of human body using single view RGB
  image
Authors: Sai Sagar Jinka, Rohan Chacko, Avinash Sharma and P. J. Narayanan
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Reconstructing human shape and pose from a single image is a challenging
problem due to issues like severe self-occlusions, clothing variations, and
changes in lighting to name a few. Many applications in the entertainment
industry, e-commerce, health-care (physiotherapy), and mobile-based AR/VR
platforms can benefit from recovering the 3D human shape, pose, and texture. In
this paper, we present PeelNet, an end-to-end generative adversarial framework
to tackle the problem of textured 3D reconstruction of the human body from a
single RGB image. Motivated by ray tracing for generating realistic images of a
3D scene, we tackle this problem by representing the human body as a set of
peeled depth and RGB maps which are obtained by extending rays beyond the first
intersection with the 3D object. This formulation allows us to handle
self-occlusions efficiently. Current parametric model-based approaches fail to
model loose clothing and surface-level details and are proposed for the
underlying naked human body. Majority of non-parametric approaches are either
computationally expensive or provide unsatisfactory results. We present a
simple non-parametric solution where the peeled maps are generated from a
single RGB image as input. Our proposed peeled depth maps are back-projected to
3D volume to obtain a complete 3D shape. The corresponding RGB maps provide
vertex-level texture details. We compare our method against current
state-of-the-art methods in 3D reconstruction and demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method on BUFF and MonoPerfCap datasets.

Title: AOL: Adaptive Online Learning for Human Trajectory Prediction in Dynamic
  Video Scenes
Authors: Manh Huynh, Gita Alaghband
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  We present a novel adaptive online learning (AOL) framework to predict human
movement trajectories in dynamic video scenes. Our framework learns and adapts
to changes in the scene environment and generates best network weights for
different scenarios. The framework can be applied to prediction models and
improve their performance as it dynamically adjusts when it encounters changes
in the scene and can apply the best training weights for predicting the next
locations. We demonstrate this by integrating our framework with two existing
prediction models: LSTM [3] and Future Person Location (FPL) [1]. Furthermore,
we analyze the number of network weights for optimal performance and show that
we can achieve real-time with a fixed number of networks using the least
recently used (LRU) strategy for maintaining the most recently trained network
weights. With extensive experiments, we show that our framework increases
prediction accuracies of LSTM and FPL by ~17% and 28% on average, and up to
~50% for FPL on the worst case while achieving real-time (20fps).

Title: Generator From Edges: Reconstruction of Facial Images
Authors: Nao Takano and Gita Alaghband
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Applications that involve supervised training require paired images.
Researchers of single image super-resolution (SISR) create such images by
artificially generating blurry input images from the corresponding ground
truth. Similarly we can create paired images with the canny edge. We propose
Generator From Edges (GFE) [Figure 2]. Our aim is to determine the best
architecture for GFE, along with reviews of perceptual loss [1, 2]. To this
end, we conducted three experiments. First, we explored the effects of the
adversarial loss often used in SISR. In particular, we uncovered that it is not
an essential component to form a perceptual loss. Eliminating adversarial loss
will lead to a more effective architecture from the perspective of hardware
resource. It also means that considerations for the problems pertaining to
generative adversarial network (GAN) [3], such as mode collapse, are not
necessary. Second, we reexamined VGG loss and found that the mid-layers yield
the best results. By extracting the full potential of VGG loss, the overall
performance of perceptual loss improves significantly. Third, based on the
findings of the first two experiments, we reevaluated the dense network to
construct GFE. Using GFE as an intermediate process, reconstructing a facial
image from a pencil sketch can become an easy task.

Title: Directional Deep Embedding and Appearance Learning for Fast Video Object
  Segmentation
Authors: Yingjie Yin, De Xu, Xingang Wang and Lei Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Most recent semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) methods rely on
fine-tuning deep convolutional neural networks online using the given mask of
the first frame or predicted masks of subsequent frames. However, the online
fine-tuning process is usually time-consuming, limiting the practical use of
such methods. We propose a directional deep embedding and appearance learning
(DDEAL) method, which is free of the online fine-tuning process, for fast VOS.
First, a global directional matching module, which can be efficiently
implemented by parallel convolutional operations, is proposed to learn a
semantic pixel-wise embedding as an internal guidance. Second, an effective
directional appearance model based statistics is proposed to represent the
target and background on a spherical embedding space for VOS. Equipped with the
global directional matching module and the directional appearance model
learning module, DDEAL learns static cues from the labeled first frame and
dynamically updates cues of the subsequent frames for object segmentation. Our
method exhibits state-of-the-art VOS performance without using online
fine-tuning. Specifically, it achieves a J & F mean score of 74.8% on DAVIS
2017 dataset and an overall score G of 71.3% on the large-scale YouTube-VOS
dataset, while retaining a speed of 25 fps with a single NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPU.
Furthermore, our faster version runs 31 fps with only a little accuracy loss.

Title: Superpixel Segmentation via Convolutional Neural Networks with
  Regularized Information Maximization
Authors: Teppei Suzuki
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: To appear in ICASSP 2020
\\
  We propose an unsupervised superpixel segmentation method by optimizing a
randomly-initialized convolutional neural network (CNN) in inference time. Our
method generates superpixels via CNN from a single image without any labels by
minimizing a proposed objective function for superpixel segmentation in
inference time. There are three advantages to our method compared with many of
existing methods: (i) leverages an image prior of CNN for superpixel
segmentation, (ii) adaptively changes the number of superpixels according to
the given images, and (iii) controls the property of superpixels by adding an
auxiliary cost to the objective function. We verify the advantages of our
method quantitatively and qualitatively on BSDS500 and SBD datasets.

Title: Unsupervised Image-generation Enhanced Adaptation for Object Detection
  in Thermal images
Authors: Wanyi Li, Fuyu Li, Yongkang Luo, Peng Wang

Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, submit to ICIP 2020
\\
  Object detection in thermal images is an important computer vision task and
has many applications such as unmanned vehicles, robotics, surveillance and
night vision. Deep learning based detectors have achieved major progress, which
usually need large amount of labelled training data. However, labelled data for
object detection in thermal images is scarce and expensive to collect. How to
take advantage of the large number labelled visible images and adapt them into
thermal image domain, is expected to solve. This paper proposes an unsupervised
image-generation enhanced adaptation method for object detection in thermal
images. To reduce the gap between visible domain and thermal domain, the
proposed method manages to generate simulated fake thermal images that are
similar to the target images, and preserves the annotation information of the
visible source domain. The image generation includes a CycleGAN based
image-to-image translation and an intensity inversion transformation. Generated
fake thermal images are used as renewed source domain. And then the
off-the-shelf Domain Adaptive Faster RCNN is utilized to reduce the gap between
generated intermediate domain and the thermal target domain. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

  Deep learning (DL) based object detection has achieved great progress. These
methods typically assume that large amount of labeled training data is
available, and training and test data are drawn from an identical distribution.
However, the two assumptions are not always hold in practice. Deep domain
adaptive object detection (DDAOD) has emerged as a new learning paradigm to
address the above mentioned challenges. This paper aims to review the
state-of-the-art progress on deep domain adaptive object detection approaches.
Firstly, we introduce briefly the basic concepts of deep domain adaptation.
Secondly, the deep domain adaptive detectors are classified into four
categories and detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category
are provided. Finally, insights for future research trend are presented.

Title: CQ-VQA: Visual Question Answering on Categorized Questions
Authors: Aakansha Mishra, Ashish Anand and Prithwijit Guha
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  This paper proposes CQ-VQA, a novel 2-level hierarchical but end-to-end model
to solve the task of visual question answering (VQA). The first level of
CQ-VQA, referred to as question categorizer (QC), classifies questions to
reduce the potential answer search space. The QC uses attended and fused
features of the input question and image. The second level, referred to as
answer predictor (AP), comprises of a set of distinct classifiers corresponding
to each question category. Depending on the question category predicted by QC,
only one of the classifiers of AP remains active. The loss functions of QC and
AP are aggregated together to make it an end-to-end model. The proposed model
(CQ-VQA) is evaluated on the TDIUC dataset and is benchmarked against
state-of-the-art approaches. Results indicate competitive or better performance
of CQ-VQA.

Title: Discernible Compressed Images via Deep Perception Consistency
Authors: Zhaohui Yang, Yunhe Wang, Chao Xu, Chang Xu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Image compression, as one of the fundamental low-level image processing
tasks, is very essential for computer vision. Conventional image compression
methods tend to obtain compressed images by minimizing their appearance
discrepancy with the corresponding original images, but pay little attention to
their efficacy in downstream perception tasks, e.g., image recognition and
object detection. In contrast, this paper aims to produce compressed images by
pursuing both appearance and perception consistency. Based on the
encoder-decoder framework, we propose using a pre-trained CNN to extract
features of original and compressed images. In addition, the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) is employed to minimize the difference between feature
distributions. The resulting compression network can generate images with high
image quality and preserve the consistent perception in the feature domain, so
that these images can be well recognized by pre-trained machine learning
models. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
algorithm over comparison methods.

\\
  The increasing use of deep neural networks (DNNs) has motivated a parallel
endeavor: the design of adversaries that profit from successful
misclassifications. However, not all adversarial examples are crafted for
malicious purposes. For example, real world systems often contain physical,
temporal, and sampling variability across instrumentation. Adversarial examples
in the wild may inadvertently prove deleterious for accurate predictive
modeling. Conversely, naturally occurring covariance of image features may
serve didactic purposes. Here, we studied the stability of deep learning
representations for neuroimaging classification across didactic and adversarial
conditions characteristic of MRI acquisition variability. We show that
representational similarity and performance vary according to the frequency of
adversarial examples in the input space.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by AAAI2020
\\
  Many approaches have recently been proposed to detect irregular scene text
and achieved promising results. However, their localization results may not
well satisfy the following text recognition part mainly because of two reasons:
1) recognizing arbitrary shaped text is still a challenging task, and 2)
prevalent non-trainable pipeline strategies between text detection and text
recognition will lead to suboptimal performances. To handle this
incompatibility problem, in this paper we propose an end-to-end trainable text
spotting approach named Text Perceptron. Concretely, Text Perceptron first
employs an efficient segmentation-based text detector that learns the latent
text reading order and boundary information. Then a novel Shape Transform
Module (abbr. STM) is designed to transform the detected feature regions into
regular morphologies without extra parameters. It unites text detection and the
following recognition part into a whole framework, and helps the whole network
achieve global optimization. Experiments show that our method achieves
competitive performance on two standard text benchmarks, i.e., ICDAR 2013 and
ICDAR 2015, and also obviously outperforms existing methods on irregular text
benchmarks SCUT-CTW1500 and Total-Text.

Comments: 7 pages, AAAI 2020 accepted paper
\\
  Automatic map extraction is of great importance to urban computing and
location-based services. Aerial image and GPS trajectory data refer to two
different data sources that could be leveraged to generate the map, although
they carry different types of information. Most previous works on data fusion
between aerial images and data from auxiliary sensors do not fully utilize the
information of both modalities and hence suffer from the issue of information
loss. We propose a deep convolutional neural network called DeepDualMapper
which fuses the aerial image and trajectory data in a more seamless manner to
extract the digital map. We design a gated fusion module to explicitly control
the information flows from both modalities in a complementary-aware manner.
Moreover, we propose a novel densely supervised refinement decoder to generate
the prediction in a coarse-to-fine way. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that DeepDualMapper can fuse the information of images and
trajectories much more effectively than existing approaches, and is able to
generate maps with higher accuracy.

Title: Hierarchical Rule Induction Network for Abstract Visual Reasoning

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Abstract reasoning refers to the ability to analyze information, discover
rules at an intangible level, and solve problems in innovative ways. Raven's
Progressive Matrices (RPM) test is typically used to examine the capability of
abstract reasoning. In the test, the subject is asked to identify the correct
choice from the answer set to fill the missing panel at the bottom right of RPM
(e.g., a 3$\times$3 matrix), following the underlying rules inside the matrix.
Recent studies, taking advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have
achieved encouraging progress to accomplish the RPM test problems.
Unfortunately, simply relying on the relation extraction at the matrix level,
they fail to recognize the complex attribute patterns inside or across
rows/columns of RPM. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a
Hierarchical Rule Induction Network (HriNet), by intimating human induction
strategies. HriNet extracts multiple granularity rule embeddings at different
levels and integrates them through a gated embedding fusion module. We further
introduce a rule similarity metric based on the embeddings, so that HriNet can
not only be trained using a tuplet loss but also infer the best answer
according to the similarity score. To comprehensively evaluate HriNet, we first
fix the defects contained in the very recent RAVEN dataset and generate a new
one named Balanced-RAVEN. Then extensive experiments are conducted on the
large-scale dataset PGM and our Balanced-RAVEN, the results of which show that
HriNet outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a large margin.

\\
  Contouring of the target volume and Organs-At-Risk (OARs) is a crucial step
in radiotherapy treatment planning. In an adaptive radiotherapy setting,
updated contours need to be generated based on daily imaging. In this work, we
leverage personalized anatomical knowledge accumulated over the treatment
sessions, to improve the segmentation accuracy of a pre-trained Convolution
Neural Network (CNN), for a specific patient. We investigate a transfer
learning approach, fine-tuning the baseline CNN model to a specific patient,
based on imaging acquired in earlier treatment fractions. The baseline CNN
model is trained on a prostate CT dataset from one hospital of 379 patients.
This model is then fine-tuned and tested on an independent dataset of another
hospital of 18 patients, each having 7 to 10 daily CT scans. For the prostate,
seminal vesicles, bladder and rectum, the model fine-tuned on each specific
patient achieved a Mean Surface Distance (MSD) of $1.64 \pm 0.43$ mm, $2.38 \pm
2.76$ mm, $2.30 \pm 0.96$ mm, and $1.24 \pm 0.89$ mm, respectively, which was
significantly better than the baseline model. The proposed personalized model
adaptation is therefore very promising for clinical implementation in the
context of adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.

design a new cell template, and rediscover the utility of and propose to use
the Zeroise layer to learn well-performing binary networks. In addition, we
propose to diversify early search to learn better performing binary
architectures. We show that our searched binary networks outperform
state-of-the-art binary networks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets.

Title: Lake Ice Detection from Sentinel-1 SAR with Deep Learning
Authors: Manu Tom, Roberto Aguilar, Pascal Imhof, Silvan Leinss, Emmanuel
  Baltsavias and Konrad Schindler
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Lake ice, as part of the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) lakes, is an
important indicator to monitor climate change and global warming. The
spatio-temporal extent of lake ice cover, along with the timings of key
phenological events such as freeze-up and break-up, provides important cues
about the local and global climate. We present a lake ice monitoring system
based on the automatic analysis of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
data with a deep neural network. In previous studies that used optical
satellite imagery for lake ice monitoring, frequent cloud cover was a main
limiting factor, which we overcome thanks to the ability of microwave sensors
to penetrate clouds and observe the lakes regardless of the weather and
illumination conditions. We cast ice detection as a two class (frozen,
non-frozen) semantic segmentation problem and solve it using a state-of-the-art
deep convolutional network (CNN). We report results on two winters ($2016-17$
and $2017-18$) and three alpine lakes in Switzerland, including
cross-validation tests to assess the generalisation to unseen lakes and
winters. The proposed model reaches mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores
>90% on average, and >84% even for the most difficult lake.

Title: Precision Gating: Improving Neural Network Efficiency with Dynamic
  Dual-Precision Activations

\\
  We propose precision gating (PG), an end-to-end trainable dynamic
dual-precision quantization technique for deep neural networks. PG computes
most features in a low precision and only a small proportion of important
features in a higher precision to preserve accuracy. The proposed approach is
applicable to a variety of DNN architectures and significantly reduces the
computational cost of DNN execution with almost no accuracy loss. Our
experiments indicate that PG achieves excellent results on CNNs, including
statically compressed mobile-friendly networks such as ShuffleNet. Compared to
the state-of-the-art prediction-based quantization schemes, PG achieves the
same or higher accuracy with 2.4$\times$ less compute on ImageNet. PG
furthermore applies to RNNs. Compared to 8-bit uniform quantization, PG obtains
a 1.2% improvement in perplexity per word with 2.7$\times$ computational cost
reduction on LSTM on the Penn Tree Bank dataset.

Title: The Minimum Hybrid Contract (MHC): Combining legal and blockchain smart
  contracts
Authors: J{\o}rgen Svennevik Notland, Jakob Svennevik Notland, Donn Morrison
Categories: cs.CY
\\
  Corruption is a major global financial problem with billions of dollars
rendered lost or unaccountable annually. Corruption through contract fraud is
often conducted by withholding and/or altering financial information. When such
scandals are investigated by authorities, financial and legal documents are
usually altered to conceal the paper trail.
  Smart contracts have emerged in recent years and appear promising for
applications such as legal contracts where transparency is critical and of
public interest. Transparency and auditability are inherent because smart
contracts execute operations on the blockchain, a distributed public ledger.
  In this paper, we propose the Minimum Hybrid Contract (MHC), with the aim of
introducing 1) auditability, 2) transparency, and 3) immutability to the
contract's financial transactions. The MHC comprises an online smart contract
and an offline traditional legal contract. where the two are immutably linked.
  Secure peer-to-peer financial transactions, transparency, and cost accounting
are automated by the smart contract, and legal issues or disputes are carried
out by civil courts. The reliance on established legal processes facilitates an
appropriate adoption of smart contracts in traditional contracts.

Categories: cs.DB cs.AI cs.LG

\\
  Due to the outstanding capability of capturing underlying data distributions,
deep learning techniques have been recently utilized for a series of
traditional database problems. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities
of utilizing deep learning for cardinality estimation of similarity selection.
Answering this problem accurately and efficiently is essential to many data
management applications, especially for query optimization. Moreover, in some
applications the estimated cardinality is supposed to be consistent and
interpretable. Hence a monotonic estimation w.r.t. the query threshold is
preferred. We propose a novel and generic method that can be applied to any
data type and distance function. Our method consists of a feature extraction
model and a regression model. The feature extraction model transforms original
data and threshold to a Hamming space, in which a deep learning-based
regression model is utilized to exploit the incremental property of cardinality
w.r.t. the threshold for both accuracy and monotonicity. We develop a training
strategy tailored to our model as well as techniques for fast estimation. We
also discuss how to handle updates. We demonstrate the accuracy and the
efficiency of our method through experiments, and show how it improves the
performance of a query optimizer.

Title: Multidimensional Enrichment of Spatial RDF Data for SOLAP -- Full
  Version
Authors: Nurefsan G\"ur, Torben Bach Pedersen, Katja Hose, and Mikael Midtgaard

Comments: 33 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, 10 listings, 7 algorithms, under
  review in Semantic Web Journal, available on

\\
  Large volumes of spatial data and multidimensional data are being published
on the Semantic Web, which has led to new opportunities for advanced analysis,
such as Spatial Online Analytical Processing (SOLAP). The RDF Data Cube (QB)
and QB4OLAP vocabularies have been widely used for annotating and publishing
statistical and multidimensional RDF data. Although such statistical data sets
might have spatial information, such as coordinates, the lack of spatial
semantics and spatial multidimensional concepts in QB4OLAP and QB prevents
users from employing SOLAP queries over spatial data using SPARQL. The QB4SOLAP
vocabulary, on the other hand, fully supports annotating spatial and
multidimensional data on the Semantic Web and enables users to query endpoints
with SOLAP operators in SPARQL. To bridge the gap between QB/QB4OLAP and
QB4SOLAP, we propose an RDF2SOLAP enrichment model that automatically annotates
spatial multidimensional concepts with QB4SOLAP and in doing so enables SOLAP
on existing QB and QB4OLAP data on the Semantic Web. Furthermore, we present
and evaluate a wide range of enrichment algorithms and apply them on a
non-trivial real-world use case involving governmental open data with complex
geometry types.

Title: Big Data Staging with MPI-IO for Interactive X-ray Science
Authors: Justin M. Wozniak and Hemant Sharma and Timothy G. Armstrong and

Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 10 pages, submitted to International Symposium on Big Data Computing
  (BDC 2014)
\\
  New techniques in X-ray scattering science experiments produce large data
sets that can require millions of high-performance processing hours per week of
computation for analysis. In such applications, data is typically moved from
X-ray detectors to a large parallel file system shared by all nodes of a
petascale supercomputer and then is read repeatedly as different science
application tasks proceed. However, this straightforward implementation causes
significant contention in the file system. We propose an alternative approach
in which data is instead staged into and cached in compute node memory for
extended periods, during which time various processing tasks may efficiently
access it. We describe here such a big data staging framework, based on MPI-IO
and the Swift parallel scripting language. We discuss a range of large-scale
data management issues involved in X-ray scattering science and measure the
performance benefits of the new staging framework for high-energy diffraction
microscopy, an important emerging application in data-intensive X-ray
scattering. We show that our framework accelerates scientific processing
turnaround from three months to under 10 minutes, and that our I/O technique
reduces input overheads by a factor of 5 on 8K Blue Gene/Q nodes.

Title: Demystifying the Performance of HPC Scientific Applications on NVM-based
  Memory Systems
Authors: Ivy Peng and Kai Wu and Jie Ren and Dong Li and Maya Gokhale
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 34th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium
  (IPDPS2020)
\\
  The emergence of high-density byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM) is
promising to accelerate data- and compute-intensive applications. Current NVM
technologies have lower performance than DRAM and, thus, are often paired with
DRAM in a heterogeneous main memory. Recently, byte-addressable NVM hardware
becomes available. This work provides a timely evaluation of representative HPC
applications from the "Seven Dwarfs" on NVM-based main memory. Our results
quantify the effectiveness of DRAM-cached-NVM for accelerating HPC applications
and enabling large problems beyond the DRAM capacity. On uncached-NVM, HPC
applications exhibit three tiers of performance sensitivity, i.e., insensitive,
scaled, and bottlenecked. We identify write throttling and concurrency control
as the priorities in optimizing applications. We highlight that concurrency
change may have a diverging effect on read and write accesses in applications.
Based on these findings, we explore two optimization approaches. First, we
provide a prediction model that uses datasets from a small set of
configurations to estimate performance at various concurrency and data sizes to
avoid exhaustive search in the configuration space. Second, we demonstrate that
write-aware data placement on uncached-NVM could achieve $2$x performance
improvement with a 60% reduction in DRAM usage.

Categories: cs.DC cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  In this work, we study distributed sketching methods for large scale
regression problems. We leverage multiple randomized sketches for reducing the
problem dimensions as well as preserving privacy and improving straggler
resilience in asynchronous distributed systems. We derive novel approximation
guarantees for classical sketching methods and analyze the accuracy of
parameter averaging for distributed sketches. We consider random matrices
including Gaussian, randomized Hadamard, uniform sampling and leverage score
sampling in the distributed setting. Moreover, we propose a hybrid approach
combining sampling and fast random projections for better computational
efficiency. We illustrate the performance of distributed sketches in a
serverless computing platform with large scale experiments.

Title: Not a COINcidence: Sub-Quadratic Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement WHP
Authors: Shir Cohen, Idit Keidar, Alexander Spiegelman
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 15 pages
\\
  King and Saia were the first to break the quadratic word complexity bound for
Byzantine Agreement in synchronous systems against an adaptive adversary, and
Algorand broke this bound with near-optimal resilience in the
eventual-synchrony model. Yet the question of asynchronous sub-quadratic
Byzantine Agreement remained open. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to answer this question in the affirmative. A key component of our
solution is a novel shared coin algorithm based on a VRF, without any further
trusted setup. A second essential ingredient is VRF-based committee sampling,
which we formalize and utilize in the asynchronous model for the first time.
Our algorithms work against a delayed-adaptive adversary, which cannot perform
after-the-fact removals but has full control of Byzantine processes and full
information about communication in earlier rounds. Using committee sampling and
our shared coin, we solve Byzantine Agreement with high probability, with a
word complexity of $\widetilde{O}(n)$ and $O(1)$ expected time, breaking the
$O(n^2)$ bit barrier for asynchronous Byzantine Agreement.

\\
  As we approach the Exascale era, it is important to verify that the existing
frameworks and tools will still work at that scale. Moreover, public Cloud
computing has been emerging as a viable solution for both prototyping and
urgent computing. Using the elasticity of the Cloud, we have thus put in place
a pre-exascale HTCondor setup for running a scientific simulation in the Cloud,
with the chosen application being IceCube's photon propagation simulation. I.e.
this was not a purely demonstration run, but it was also used to produce
valuable and much needed scientific results for the IceCube collaboration. In
order to reach the desired scale, we aggregated GPU resources across 8 GPU
models from many geographic regions across Amazon Web Services, Microsoft
Azure, and the Google Cloud Platform. Using this setup, we reached a peak of
over 51k GPUs corresponding to almost 380 PFLOP32s, for a total integrated
compute of about 100k GPU hours. In this paper we provide the description of
the setup, the problems that were discovered and overcome, as well as a short
description of the actual science output of the exercise.

Title: How fast can you update your MST? (Dynamic algorithms for cluster
  computing)
Authors: Seth Gilbert, Lawrence Li
Categories: cs.DC cs.DS
\\
  Imagine a large graph that is being processed by a cluster of computers,
e.g., described by the $k$-machine model or the Massively Parallel Computation
Model. The graph, however, is not static; instead it is receiving a constant
stream of updates. How fast can the cluster process the stream of updates? The
fundamental question we want to ask in this paper is whether we can update the
graph fast enough to keep up with the stream. We focus specifically on the
problem of maintaining a minimum spanning tree (MST), and we give an algorithm
for the $k$-machine model that can process $O(k)$ graph updates per $O(1)$
rounds with high probability. (And these results carry over to the Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC) model.) We also show a lower bound, i.e., it is
impossible to process $k^{1+\epsilon}$ updates in $O(1)$ rounds. Thus we
provide a nearly tight answer to the question of how fast a cluster can respond
to a stream of graph modifications while maintaining an MST.

Title: Byzantine Lattice Agreement in Asynchronous Systems
Authors: Xiong Zheng and Vijay Garg
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  We study the Byzantine lattice agreement (BLA) problem in asynchronous
distributed message passing systems. In the BLA problem, each process proposes
a value from a join semi-lattice and needs to output a value also in the
lattice such that all output values of correct processes lie on a chain despite
the presence of Byzantine processes. We present an algorithm for this problem
with round complexity of $O(\log f)$ which tolerates $f < \frac{n}{5}$
Byzantine failures in the asynchronous setting without digital signatures,
where $n$ is the number of processes. We also show how this algorithm can be
modified to work in the authenticated setting (i.e., with digital signatures)
to tolerate $f < \frac{n}{3}$ Byzantine failures.

Title: In Search for a Linear Byzantine Agreement
Authors: Alexander Spiegelman
Categories: cs.DC cs.CR
\\
  The long-standing byzantine agreement problem gets more attention in recent
years due to the increasing demand for scalable geo-replicated Byzantine state
machine replication (SMR) systems (e.g., Blockchains). To date, the key
bottleneck of such systems is the communication cost of the byzantine agreement
they employ as a building block, which motivates many researchers to search for
low-communication byzantine agreement protocols. The conventional approach is
to design deterministic protocols in the eventually synchronous communication
model that are optimized to reduce the communication cost after the global
stabilization time (GST).
  In this paper, we challenge the conventional approach and argue it is not the
best fit for scalable SMR systems since it might induce an unbounded
communication cost during asynchronous periods before GST, which we prove to be
inherent. Instead, we forgo eventual synchrony and propose a different approach
that hopes for the best (synchrony) but prepares for the worst (asynchrony).
Accordingly, we design an optimistic protocol that first tries to reach an
agreement via an efficient deterministic algorithm that relies on synchrony for
termination, and then, only if an agreement was not reached due to asynchrony,
the protocol uses a randomized asynchronous algorithm for fallback that
guarantees termination with probability $1$. Although randomized asynchronous
algorithms are considered to be costly, we design our solution to pay this cost
only when an equivalent cost has already been paid while unsuccessfully trying
the synchronous protocol. Moreover, we formally prove that our protocol
achieves optimal communication complexity under all network conditions and
failure scenarios.

Title: Concurrent Reference Counting and Resource Management in Wait-free
  Constant Time
Authors: Guy E. Blelloch, Yuanhao Wei
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  A common problem when implementing concurrent programs is efficiently
protecting against unsafe races between processes reading and then using a
resource (e.g., memory blocks, file descriptors, or network connections) and
other processes that are concurrently overwriting and then destructing the same
resource. Such read-destruct races can be protected with locks, or with
lock-free solutions such as hazard-pointers or read-copy-update (RCU).
  In this paper we describe a method for protecting read-destruct races with
expected constant time overhead, $O(P^2)$ space and $O(P^2)$ delayed destructs,
and with just single word atomic memory operations (reads, writes, and CAS). It
is based on an interface with four primitives, an acquire-release pair to
protect accesses, and a retire-eject pair to delay the destruct until it is
safe. We refer to this as the acquire-retire interface. Using the
acquire-retire interface, we develop simple implementations for three common
use cases: (1) memory reclamation with applications to stacks and queues, (2)
reference counted objects, and (3) objects manage by ownership with moves,
copies, and destructs. The first two results significantly improve on previous
results, and the third application is original. Importantly, all operations
have expected constant time overhead.

Title: The h index for research assessment: Simple and popular, but shown by
  mathematical analysis to be inconsistent and misleading
Authors: Ricardo Brito, Alonso Rodr\'iguez Navarro
Categories: cs.DL
Comments: 28 pages, 1 table and 6 figures in one PDF file
\\
  Citation distributions are lognormal. We use 30 lognormally distributed
synthetic series of numbers that simulate real series of citations to
investigate the consistency of the h index. Using the lognormal cumulative
distribution function, the equation that defines the h index can be formulated;
this equation shows that h has a complex dependence on the number of papers
(N). Specifically, after a certain limit, an increase of N has a very small
effect on h, which contradicts a rational expectation. We also investigate the
correlation between h and the number of papers exceeding various citation
thresholds, from 5 to 500 citations. The best correlation, for 100 citations,
is not linear, and numerous data points deviate from the general trend. The
size-independent indicator h/N shows no correlation with the probability of
publishing a paper exceeding any of the citation thresholds. In contrast with
the h index, the total number of citations in the series shows a high linear
correlation with the number of papers exceeding the thresholds of 10 and 50
citations. Dividing by N, the mean number of citations correlates with the
probability of publishing a paper that exceeds any level of citations. The
dependence is never linear, but for the thresholds of 20 and 30 citations, the
deviation from linearity is low. Thus, in synthetic series, the number of
citations and the mean number of citations are much better indicators of
research performance than h and h/N. We discuss that this conclusion can be
extended to real citation series.

Title: Identifying the Development and Application of Artificial Intelligence

Categories: cs.DL cs.IR
\\
  We describe a strategy for identifying the universe of research publications
relating to the application and development of artificial intelligence. The
approach leverages arXiv's corpus of scientific preprints, in which authors
choose subject tags for their papers from a set defined by editors. We compose
from these subjects a functional definition of AI-relevance with intuitive
components, by learning the subject definitions from paper metadata, and then
inferring the arXiv-subject labels of papers in Web of Science. We find
predictive classification $F_1$ scores between .59 and .86 for AI-relevant
subject models. For an all-subjects model, we see precision of .83 and recall
of .85. We evaluate the out-of-domain performance of our classifiers against
other sources of subject information and results from other methods. We find
that for the high-level fields of study represented on arXiv, a supervised
solution can generalize for inference in other corpora. This offers a method
for identifying AI-relevant publications that updates at the pace of research
output, without reliance on subject-matter experts for query development or
labeling.

  Given a CNF formula $\Phi$ with clauses $C_1,\ldots,C_m$ and variables
$V=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$, a truth assignment $a:V\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ of $\Phi$
leads to a clause sequence $\sigma_\Phi(a)=(C_1(a),\ldots,C_m(a))\in\{0,1\}^m$
where $C_i(a) = 1$ if clause $C_i$ evaluates to $1$ under assignment $a$,
otherwise $C_i(a) = 0$. The set of all possible clause sequences carries a lot
of information on the formula, e.g. SAT, MAX-SAT and MIN-SAT can be encoded in
terms of finding a clause sequence with extremal properties.
  We consider a problem posed at Dagstuhl Seminar 19211 "Enumeration in Data
Management" (2019) about the generation of all possible clause sequences of a
given CNF with bounded dimension. We prove that the problem can be solved in
incremental polynomial time. We further give an algorithm with polynomial delay

sequences is NP-hard, while minimal clause sequences can be generated with
polynomial delay.

Title: Unique key Horn functions
Authors: Krist\'of B\'erczi, Endre Boros, Ond\v{r}ej \v{C}epek, Petr

\\
  Given a relational database, a key is a set of attributes such that a value
assignment to this set uniquely determines the values of all other attributes.
The database uniquely defines a pure Horn function $h$, representing the
functional dependencies. If the knowledge of the attribute values in set $A$
determines the value for attribute $v$, then $A\rightarrow v$ is an implicate
of $h$. If $K$ is a key of the database, then $K\rightarrow v$ is an implicate
of $h$ for all attributes $v$.
  Keys of small sizes play a crucial role in various problems. We present
structural and complexity results on the set of minimal keys of pure Horn
functions. We characterize Sperner hypergraphs for which there is a unique pure
Horn function with the given hypergraph as the set of minimal keys.
Furthermore, we show that recognizing such hypergraphs is co-NP-complete
already when every hyperedge has size two. On the positive side, we identify
several classes of graphs for which the recognition problem can be decided in
polynomial time.
  We also present an algorithm that generates the minimal keys of a pure Horn
function with polynomial delay. By establishing a connection between keys and
target sets, our approach can be used to generate all minimal target sets with
polynomial delay when the thresholds are bounded by a constant. As a byproduct,
our proof shows that the Minimum Key problem is at least as hard as the Minimum
Target Set Selection problem with bounded thresholds.

Title: On Extensions of Maximal Repeats in Compressed Strings
Authors: Julian Pape-Lange
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  This paper provides an upper bound for several subsets of maximal repeats and
maximal pairs in compressed strings and also presents a formerly unknown
relationship between maximal pairs and the run-length Burrows-Wheeler
transform.
  This relationship is used to obtain a different proof for the Burrows-Wheeler
conjecture which has recently been proven by Kempa and Kociumaka in "Resolution
of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform Conjecture".
  More formally, this paper proves that a string $S$ with $z$ LZ77-factors and
without $q$-th powers has at most $73(\log_2 |S|)(z+2)^2$ runs in the
run-length Burrows-Wheeler transform and the number of arcs in the compacted
directed acyclic word graph of $S$ is bounded from above by $18q(1+\log_q
|S|)(z+2)^2$.

Title: Sparse Coresets for SVD on Infinite Streams
Authors: Vladimir Braverman, Dan Feldman, Harry Lang, Daniela Rus, Adiel
  Statman
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  In streaming Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), $d$-dimensional rows of a
possibly infinite matrix arrive sequentially as points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. An
$\epsilon$-coreset is a (much smaller) matrix whose sum of square distances of
the rows to any hyperplane approximates that of the original matrix to a $1 \pm
\epsilon$ factor. Our main result is that we can maintain a $\epsilon$-coreset
while storing only $O(d \log^2 d / \epsilon^2)$ rows. Known lower bounds of
$\Omega(d / \epsilon^2)$ rows show that this is nearly optimal. Moreover, each
row of our coreset is a weighted subset of the input rows. This is highly
desirable since it: (1) preserves sparsity; (2) is easily interpretable; (3)
avoids precision errors; (4) applies to problems with constraints on the input.
Previous streaming results for SVD that return a subset of the input required
storing $\Omega(d \log^3 n / \epsilon^2)$ rows where $n$ is the number of rows
seen so far. Our algorithm, with storage independent of $n$, is the first
result that uses finite memory on infinite streams. We support our findings
with experiments on the Wikipedia dataset benchmarked against state-of-the-art
algorithms.

Title: Kruskal-based approximation algorithm for the multi-level Steiner tree
  problem
Authors: Reyan Ahmed, Faryad Darabi Sahneh, Stephen Kobourov, Richard Spence
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We study the multi-level Steiner tree problem: a generalization of the
Steiner tree problem in graphs, in which the terminals $T$ require different
levels, or equivalently, have different priorities. The problem requires that
terminals be connected with edges satisfying their priority requirements and
has applications in network design and multi-level graph visualization. The
case where edge costs are proportional to their priority is approximable to
within a constant factor from the optimal solution. For the more general case
of non-proportional costs, the problem is hard to approximate to within a ratio
of $\log \log n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. A simple
greedy algorithm by Charikar et al., however, provides a $\min\{2(\ln |T|+1),
\ell \rho\}$-approximation in this setting.
  In this paper, we describe a natural generalization to the multi-level case
of the classical (single-level) Steiner tree approximation algorithm based on
Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. We prove that this algorithm
achieves an approximation ratio at least as good as Charikar et al., and
experimentally performs better with respect to the optimum solution. We develop
an integer linear programming formulation to compute an exact solution for the
multi-level Steiner tree problem with non-proportional edge costs and use it to
evaluate the performance of our algorithm.

Title: (Individual) Fairness for $k$-Clustering
Authors: Sepideh Mahabadi and Ali Vakilian
Categories: cs.DS cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We give a local search based algorithm for $k$-median ($k$-means) clustering
from the perspective of individual fairness. More precisely, for a point $x$ in
a point set $P$ of size $n$, let $r(x)$ be the minimum radius such that the
ball of radius $r(x)$ centered at $x$ has at least $n/k$ points from $P$.
Intuitively, if a set of $k$ random points are chosen from $P$ as centers,
every point $x\in P$ expects to have a center within radius $r(x)$. An
individually fair clustering provides such a guarantee for every point $x\in
P$. This notion of fairness was introduced in [Jung et al., 2019] where they
showed how to get an approximately feasible $k$-clustering with respect to this
fairness condition.
  In this work, we show how to get an approximately optimal such fair
$k$-clustering. The $k$-median ($k$-means) cost of our solution is within a
constant factor of the cost of an optimal fair $k$-clustering, and our solution
approximately satisfies the fairness condition (also within a constant factor).
Further, we complement our theoretical bounds with empirical evaluation.

Title: Computing Covers under Substring Consistent Equivalence Relations
Authors: Natsumi Kikuchi, Diptarama Hendrian, Ryo Yoshinaka, and Ayumi
  Shinohara
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 14 pages
\\
  Covers are a kind of quasiperiodicity in strings. A string $C$ is a cover of
another string $T$ if any position of $T$ is inside some occurrence of $C$ in
$T$. The literature has proposed linear-time algorithms computing longest and
shortest cover arrays taking border arrays as input. An equivalence relation
$\approx$ over strings is called a substring consistent equivalence relation
(SCER) iff $X \approx Y$ implies (1) $|X| = |Y|$ and (2) $X[i:j] \approx
Y[i:j]$ for all $1 \le i \le j \le |X|$. In this paper, we generalize the
notion of covers for SCERs and prove that existing algorithms to compute the
shortest cover array and the longest cover array of a string $T$ under the
identity relation will work for any SCERs taking the accordingly generalized
border arrays.

\\
  Two strings $x$ and $y$ over $\Sigma \cup \Pi$ of equal length are said to
parameterized match (p-match) if there is a renaming bijection $f:\Sigma \cup
\Pi \rightarrow \Sigma \cup \Pi$ that is identity on $\Sigma$ and transforms
$x$ to $y$ (or vice versa). The p-matching problem is to look for substrings in
a text that p-match a given pattern. In this paper, we propose parameterized
suffix automata (p-suffix automata) and parameterized directed acyclic word
graphs (PDAWGs) which are the p-matching versions of suffix automata and DAWGs.
While suffix automata and DAWGs are equivalent for standard strings, we show
that p-suffix automata can have $\Theta(n^2)$ nodes and edges but PDAWGs have
only $O(n)$ nodes and edges, where $n$ is the length of an input string. We
also give $O(n |\Pi| \log (|\Pi| + |\Sigma|))$-time $O(n)$-space algorithm that
builds the PDAWG in a left-to-right online manner. We then show that an
implicit representation for the PDAWG can be built in $O(n \log (|\Pi| +
|\Sigma|))$ time and $O(n)$ space from left to right. As a byproduct, it is
shown that the parameterized suffix tree for the reversed string can also be
built in the same time and space, in a right-to-left online manner. We also
discuss parameterized compact DAWGs.

Authors: Mitsuru Funakoshi, Yuto Nakashima, Shunsuke Inenaga, Hideo Bannai,
  Masayuki Takeda, and Ayumi Shinohara
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  The equidistant subsequence pattern matching problem is considered. Given a
pattern string $P$ and a text string $T$, we say that $P$ is an
\emph{equidistant subsequence} of $T$ if $P$ is a subsequence of the text such
that consecutive symbols of $P$ in the occurrence are equally spaced. We can
consider the problem of equidistant subsequences as generalizations of
(sub-)cadences. We give bit-parallel algorithms that yield $o(n^2)$ time
algorithms for finding $k$-(sub-)cadences and equidistant subsequences.
Furthermore, $O(n\log^2 n)$ and $O(n\log n)$ time algorithms, respectively for
equidistant and Abelian equidistant matching for the case $|P| = 3$, are shown.
The algorithms make use of a technique that was recently introduced which can
efficiently compute convolutions with linear constraints.

Title: Approximate Distance Oracles Subject to Multiple Vertex Failures
Authors: Ran Duan, Yong Gu and Hanlin Ren
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges with
weights in $[1,W]$, we construct vertex sensitive distance oracles (VSDO),
which are data structures that preprocess the graph, and answer the following
kind of queries: Given a source vertex $u$, a target vertex $v$, and a batch of
$d$ failed vertices $D$, output (an approximation of) the distance between $u$
and $v$ in $G-D$ (that is, the graph $G$ with vertices in $D$ removed). An
oracle has stretch $\alpha$ if it always holds that
$\delta_{G-D}(u,v)\le\tilde{\delta}(u,v)\le\alpha\cdot\delta_{G-D}(u,v)$, where
$\delta_{G-D}(u,v)$ is the actual distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G-D$, and
$\tilde{\delta}(u,v)$ is the distance reported by the oracle.
  In this paper we construct efficient VSDOs for any number $d$ of failures.
For any constant $c\geq 1$, we propose two oracles:
  * The first oracle has size $n^{2+1/c}(\log n/\epsilon)^{O(d)}\cdot \log W$,
answers a query in ${\rm poly}(\log n,d^c,\log\log W,\epsilon^{-1})$ time, and
has stretch $1+\epsilon$, for any constant $\epsilon>0$.
  * The second oracle has size $n^{2+1/c}{\rm poly}(\log (nW),d)$, answers a
query in ${\rm poly}(\log n,d^c,\log\log W)$ time, and has stretch ${\rm
poly}(\log n,d)$.
  Both of these oracles can be preprocessed in time polynomial in their space
complexity. These results are the first approximate distance oracles of
poly-logarithmic query time for any constant number of vertex failures in
general undirected graphs. Previously there are $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
$d$-edge sensitive distance oracles [Chechik et al. 2017] answering distance
queries when $d$ edges fail, which have size $O(n^2(\log n/\epsilon)^d\cdot
d\log W)$ and query time ${\rm poly}(\log n, d, \log\log W)$.

Title: Hypergraph Isomorphism for Groups with Restricted Composition Factors
Authors: Daniel Neuen

Comments: 51 pages
\\
  We consider the isomorphism problem for hypergraphs taking as input two
hypergraphs over the same set of vertices $V$ and a permutation group $\Gamma$
over domain $V$, and asking whether there is a permutation $\gamma \in \Gamma$
that proves the two hypergraphs to be isomorphic. We show that for input
groups, all of whose composition factors are isomorphic to a subgroup of the
symmetric group on $d$ points, this problem can be solved in time
$(n+m)^{O((\log d)^{c})}$ for some absolute constant $c$ where $n$ denotes the
number of vertices and $m$ the number of hyperedges. In particular, this gives
the currently fastest isomorphism test for hypergraphs in general. The previous
best algorithm for this problem due to Schweitzer and Wiebking (STOC 2019) runs
in time $n^{O(d)}m^{O(1)}$.
  As an application of this result, we obtain, for example, an algorithm
testing isomorphism of graphs excluding $K_{3,h}$ ($h \geq 3$) as a minor in
time $n^{O((\log h)^{c})}$. In particular, this gives an isomorphism test for
graphs of Euler genus at most $g$ running in time $n^{O((\log g)^{c})}$.

  Memristor networks are capable of low-power and massive parallel processing
and information storage. Moreover, they have presented the ability to apply for
a vast number of intelligent data analysis applications targeting mobile edge
devices and low power computing. Beyond the memory and conventional computing
architectures, memristors are widely studied in circuits aiming for increased
intelligence that are suitable to tackle complex problems in a power and area
efficient manner, offering viable solutions oftenly arriving also from the
biological principles of living organisms. In this paper, a memristive circuit
exploiting the dynamics of oscillating networks is utilized for the resolution
of very popular and NP-complete logic puzzles, like the well-known "Sudoku".
More specifically, the proposed circuit design methodology allows for
appropriate usage of interconnections' advantages in a oscillation network and
of memristor's switching dynamics resulting to logic-solvable puzzle-instances.
The reduced complexity of the proposed circuit and its increased scalability
constitute its main advantage against previous approaches and the broadly
presented SPICE based simulations provide a clear proof of concept of the
aforementioned appealing characteristics.

\\
  Contract-based design is a promising methodology for taming the complexity of
developing sophisticated systems. A formal contract distinguishes between
assumptions, which are constraints that the designer of a component puts on the
environments in which the component can be used safely, and guarantees, which
are promises that the designer asks from the team that implements the
component. A theory of formal contracts can be formalized as an interface
theory, which supports the composition and refinement of both assumptions and
guarantees. Although there is a rich landscape of contract-based design methods
that address functional and extra-functional properties, we present the first
interface theory that is designed for ensuring system-wide security properties,
thus paving the way for a science of safety and security co-engineering. Our
framework provides a refinement relation and a composition operation that
support both incremental design and independent implementability. We develop
our theory for both stateless and stateful interfaces. We illustrate the
applicability of our framework with an example inspired from the automotive
domain. Finally, we provide three plausible trace semantics to stateful
information-flow interfaces and we show that only two correspond to temporal
logics for specifying hyperproperties, while the third defines a new class of
hyperproperties that lies between the other two classes.

Title: Four-valued monitorability of $\omega$-regular languages
Authors: Zhe Chen, Yunyun Chen, Robert M. Hierons and Yifan Wu
Categories: cs.FL cs.LO cs.SE
Comments: 17 pages
\\
  Runtime Verification (RV) is a lightweight formal technique in which program
or system execution is monitored and analyzed, to check whether certain
properties are satisfied or violated after a finite number of steps. The use of
RV has led to interest in deciding whether a property is monitorable: whether
it is always possible for the satisfaction or violation of the property to be
determined after a finite future continuation. However, classical two-valued
monitorability suffers from two inherent limitations. First, a property can
only be evaluated as monitorable or non-monitorable; no information is
available regarding whether only one verdict (satisfaction or violation) can be
detected. Second, monitorability is defined at the language-level and does not
tell us whether satisfaction or violation can be detected starting from the
current monitor state during system execution.
  To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new notion of four-valued
monitorability for $\omega$-languages and applies it at the state-level.
Four-valued monitorability is more informative than two-valued monitorability
as a property can be evaluated as a four-valued result, denoting that only
satisfaction, only violation, or both are active for a monitorable property. We
can also compute state-level weak monitorability, i.e., whether satisfaction or
violation can be detected starting from a given state in a monitor, which
enables state-level optimizations of monitoring algorithms. Based on a new
six-valued semantics, we propose procedures for computing four-valued
monitorability of $\omega$-regular languages, both at the language-level and at
the state-level. We have developed a new tool that implements the proposed
procedure for computing monitorability of LTL formulas.

Title: The monitoring problem for timed automata

Categories: cs.FL
\\
  We study a variant of the classical membership problem in automata theory,
which consists of deciding whether a given input word is accepted by a given
automaton. We do so under a different perspective, that is, we consider a
dynamic version of the problem, called monitoring problem, where the automaton
is fixed and the input is revealed as in a stream, one symbol at a time
following the natural order on positions. The goal here is to design a dynamic
data structure that can be queried about whether the word consisting of symbols
revealed so far is accepted by the automaton, and that can be efficiently
updated when the next symbol is revealed. We provide complexity bounds for this
monitoring problem, by considering timed automata that process symbols
interleaved with timestamps. The main contribution is that monitoring of a
one-clock timed automaton, with all its components but the clock constants
fixed, can be done in amortised constant time per input symbol.

  Point sets arise naturally in many 3D acquisition processes and have diverse
applications in several areas of geometry processing. Besides their
advantages---for instance low storage cost---they do not provide connectivity
information. Thus, for each point, the notion of its neighborhood has to be
defined and computed. Common approaches include combinatorial or geometric
neighborhoods. However, neither of these incorporates curvature information of
the point set. In this paper, we present an approach to take the shape of the
geometry into account when weighting its neighborhoods. This makes the obtained
neighborhoods more reliable in the sense that connectivity also depends on the
orientation of the point set. For example, these neighborhoods grow on a
comparably flat part of the geometry and do not include points on a nearby
surface patch with differently oriented normals. We utilize a sigmoid to define
a neighborhood weighting scheme based on the normal variation. For its
evaluation, we turn to a Shannon entropy model for feature separation. Based on
this model, we apply our weight terms to a large scale of clean and to several
real world models. This evaluation provides results regarding the choice of a
weighting scheme and the neighborhood size.

Title: Jittering Samples using a kd-Tree Stratification
Authors: Alexandros D. Keros, Divakaran Divakaran and Kartic Subr

  Monte Carlo sampling techniques are used to estimate high-dimensional
integrals that model the physics of light transport in virtual scenes for
computer graphics applications. These methods rely on the law of large numbers
to estimate expectations via simulation, typically resulting in slow
convergence. Their errors usually manifest as undesirable grain in the pictures
generated by image synthesis algorithms. It is well known that these errors
diminish when the samples are chosen appropriately. A well known technique for
reducing error operates by subdividing the integration domain, estimating
integrals in each \emph{stratum} and aggregating these values into a stratified
sampling estimate. Na\"{i}ve methods for stratification, based on a lattice
(grid) are known to improve the convergence rate of Monte Carlo, but require
samples that grow exponentially with the dimensionality of the domain.
  We propose a simple stratification scheme for $d$ dimensional hypercubes
using the kd-tree data structure. Our scheme enables the generation of an
arbitrary number of equal volume partitions of the rectangular domain, and $n$
samples can be generated in $O(n)$ time. Since we do not always need to
explicitly build a kd-tree, we provide a simple procedure that allows the
sample set to be drawn fully in parallel without any precomputation or storage,
speeding up sampling to $O(\log n)$ time per sample when executed on $n$ cores.
If the tree is implicitly precomputed ($O(n)$ storage) the parallelised run
time reduces to $O(1)$ on $n$ cores. In addition to these benefits, we provide
an upper bound on the worst case star-discrepancy for $n$ samples matching that
of lattice-based sampling strategies, which occur as a special case of our
proposed method. We use a number of quantitative and qualitative tests to
compare our method against state of the art samplers for image synthesis.

Title: When to Limit Market Entry under Mandatory Purchase
Authors: Meryem Essaidi, Kira Goldner, S. Matthew Weinberg
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  We study a problem inspired by regulated health insurance markets, such as
those created by the government in the Affordable Care Act Exchanges or by
employers when they contract with private insurers to provide plans for their
employees. The market regulator can choose to do nothing, running a Free
Market, or can exercise her regulatory power by limiting the entry of providers
(decreasing consumer welfare by limiting options, but also decreasing revenue
via enhanced competition). We investigate whether limiting entry increases or
decreases the utility (welfare minus revenue) of the consumers who purchase
from the providers, specifically in settings where the outside option of
"purchasing nothing" is prohibitively undesirable.
  We focus primarily on the case where providers are symmetric. We propose a
sufficient condition on the distribution of consumer values for (a) a unique
symmetric equilibrium to exist in both markets and (b) utility to be higher
with limited entry. (We also establish that these conclusions do not
necessarily hold for all distributions, and therefore some condition is
necessary.) Our techniques are primarily based on tools from revenue
maximization, and in particular Myerson's virtual value theory. We also
consider extensions to settings where providers have identical costs for
providing plans, and to two providers with an asymmetric distribution.

Title: Optimal Mechanism Design for Single-Minded Agents
Authors: Nikhil Devanur, Kira Goldner, Raghuvansh Saxena, Ariel Schvartzman, S.
  Matthew Weinberg
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  We consider revenue-optimal mechanism design in the interdimensional setting,
where one dimension is the 'value' of the buyer, and one is a 'type' that
captures some auxiliary information. One setting is the FedEx Problem, for
which FGKK [2016] characterize the optimal mechanism for a single agent. We
ask: how far can such characterizations go? In particular, we consider
single-minded agents. A seller has heterogenous items. A buyer has a value v
for a specific subset of items S, and obtains value v iff he gets (at least)
all the items in S. We show:
  1. Deterministic mechanisms are optimal for distributions that satisfy the
"declining marginal revenue" (DMR) property; we give an explicit construction
of the optimal mechanism.
  2. Without DMR, the result depends on the structure of the directed acyclic
graph (DAG) representing the partial order among types. When the DAG has
out-degree at most 1, we characterize the optimal mechanism a la FedEx.
  3. Without DMR, when the DAG has some node with out-degree at least 2, we
show that in this case the menu complexity is unbounded: for any M, there exist
distributions over (v,S) pairs such that the menu complexity of the optimal
mechanism is at least M.
  4. For the case of 3 types, we show that for all distributions there exists
an optimal mechanism of finite menu complexity. This is in contrast to 2
additive heterogenous items or which the menu complexity could be uncountable
[MV07; DDT15].
  In addition, we prove that optimal mechanisms for Multi-Unit Pricing (without
DMR) can have unbounded menu complexity. We also propose an extension where the
menu complexity of optimal mechanisms can be countable but not uncountable.
  Together these results establish that optimal mechanisms in interdimensional
settings are both much richer than single-dimensional settings, yet also vastly
more structured than multi-dimensional settings.

Title: Pipeline Interventions
Authors: Eshwar Ram Arunachaleswaran, Sampath Kannan, Aaron Roth, Juba Ziani
Categories: cs.GT cs.CY cs.LG
\\
  We introduce the \emph{pipeline intervention} problem, defined by a layered
directed acyclic graph and a set of stochastic matrices governing transitions
between successive layers. The graph is a stylized model for how people from
different populations are presented opportunities, eventually leading to some
reward. In our model, individuals are born into an initial position (i.e. some
node in the first layer of the graph) according to a fixed probability
distribution, and then stochastically progress through the graph according to
the transition matrices, until they reach a node in the final layer of the
graph; each node in the final layer has a \emph{reward} associated with it. The
pipeline intervention problem asks how to best make costly changes to the
transition matrices governing people's stochastic transitions through the
graph, subject to a budget constraint. We consider two objectives: social
welfare maximization, and a fairness-motivated maximin objective that seeks to
maximize the value to the population (starting node) with the \emph{least}
expected value. We consider two variants of the maximin objective that turn out
to be distinct, depending on whether we demand a deterministic solution or
allow randomization. For each objective, we give an efficient approximation
algorithm (an additive FPTAS) for constant width networks. We also tightly
characterize the "price of fairness" in our setting: the ratio between the
highest achievable social welfare and the highest social welfare consistent
with a maximin optimal solution. Finally we show that for polynomial width
networks, even approximating the maximin objective to any constant factor is NP
hard, even for networks with constant depth. This shows that the restriction on
the width in our positive results is essential.

Title: Simple, Credible, and Approximately-Optimal Auctions
Authors: Constantinos Daskalakis, Maxwell Fishelson, Brendan Lucier, Vasilis
  Syrgkanis, Santhoshini Velusamy
Categories: cs.GT econ.TH
\\
  We identify the first static credible mechanism for multi-item additive
auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal revenue. This is one
instance of a more general framework for designing two-part tariff auctions,
adapting the duality framework of Cai et al [CDW16]. Given a (not necessarily
incentive compatible) auction format $A$ satisfying certain technical
conditions, our framework augments the auction with a personalized entry fee
for each bidder, which must be paid before the auction can be accessed. These
entry fees depend only on the prior distribution of bidder types, and in
particular are independent of realized bids. Our framework can be used with
many common auction formats, such as simultaneous first-price, simultaneous
second-price, and simultaneous all-pay auctions. If all-pay auctions are used,
we prove that the resulting mechanism is credible in the sense that the
auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after
observing agent bids. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful
$O(1)$-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning
via online learning techniques. Our results for first price and all-pay are the
first revenue guarantees of non-truthful mechanisms in multi-dimensional
environments; an open question in the literature [RST17].

Title: From Matching with Diversity Constraints to Matching with Regional
  Quotas
Authors: Haris Aziz, Serge Gaspers, Zhaohong Sun, Toby Walsh
Categories: cs.GT cs.AI econ.TH
Comments: Conference version had some missing details
MSC-class: 91B68
ACM-class: F.2; I.2
\\
  In the past few years, several new matching models have been proposed and
studied that take into account complex distributional constraints. Relevant
lines of work include (1) school choice with diversity constraints where
students have (possibly overlapping) types and (2) hospital-doctor matching
where various regional quotas are imposed. In this paper, we present a
polynomial-time reduction to transform an instance of (1) to an instance of (2)
and we show how the feasibility and stability of corresponding matchings are
preserved under the reduction. Our reduction provides a formal connection
between two important strands of work on matching with distributional
constraints. We then apply the reduction in two ways. Firstly, we show that it
is NP-complete to check whether a feasible and stable outcome for (1) exists.
Due to our reduction, these NP-completeness results carry over to setting (2).
In view of this, we help unify some of the results that have been presented in
the literature. Secondly, if we have positive results for (2), then we have
corresponding results for (1). One key conclusion of our results is that
further developments on axiomatic and algorithmic aspects of hospital-doctor
matching with regional quotas will result in corresponding results for school
choice with diversity constraints.

Title: On the Power and Limits of Dynamic Pricing in Combinatorial Markets
Authors: Ben Berger, Alon Eden and Michal Feldman
Categories: cs.GT cs.DS
\\
  We study the power and limits of optimal dynamic pricing in combinatorial
markets; i.e., dynamic pricing that leads to optimal social welfare. Previous
work by Cohen-Addad et al. [EC'16] demonstrated the existence of optimal
dynamic prices for unit-demand buyers, and showed a market with coverage
valuations that admits no such prices. However, finding the frontier of markets
(i.e., valuation functions) that admit optimal dynamic prices remains an open
problem. In this work we establish positive and negative results that narrow
the existing gap.
  On the positive side, we provide tools for handling markets beyond
unit-demand valuations. In particular, we characterize all optimal allocations
in multi-demand markets. This characterization allows us to partition the items
into equivalence classes according to the role they play in achieving
optimality. Using these tools, we provide a poly-time optimal dynamic pricing
algorithm for up to $3$ multi-demand buyers.
  On the negative side, we establish a maximal domain theorem, showing that for
every non-gross substitutes valuation, there exist unit-demand valuations such
that adding them yields a market that does not admit an optimal dynamic
pricing. This result is reminiscent of the seminal maximal domain theorem by
Gul and Stacchetti [JET'99] for Walrasian equilibrium. Yang [JET'17] discovered
an error in their original proof, and established a different, incomparable
version of their maximal domain theorem. En route to our maximal domain theorem
for optimal dynamic pricing, we provide the first complete proof of the
original theorem by Gul and Stacchetti.

Title: Pandora's Box Problem with Order Constraints
Authors: Shant Boodaghians, Federico Fusco, Philip Lazos, Stefano Leonardi
Categories: cs.GT cs.DS
ACM-class: G.3
\\
  The Pandora's Box Problem, originally formalized by Weitzman in 1979, models
selection from set of random, alternative options, when evaluation is costly.
This includes, for example, the problem of hiring a skilled worker, where only
one hire can be made, but the evaluation of each candidate is an expensive
procedure. Weitzman showed that the Pandora's Box Problem admits an elegant,
simple solution, where the options are considered in decreasing order of
reservation value,i.e., the value that reduces to zero the expected marginal
gain for opening the box. We study for the first time this problem when order -
or precedence - constraints are imposed between the boxes. We show that,
despite the difficulty of defining reservation values for the boxes which take
into account both in-depth and in-breath exploration of the various options,
greedy optimal strategies exist and can be efficiently computed for tree-like
order constraints. We also prove that finding approximately optimal adaptive
search strategies is NP-hard when certain matroid constraints are used to
further restrict the set of boxes which may be opened, or when the order
constraints are given as reachability constraints on a DAG. We complement the
above result by giving approximate adaptive search strategies based on a
connection between optimal adaptive strategies and non-adaptive strategies with
bounded adaptivity gap for a carefully relaxed version of the problem.

Title: Secure-by-synthesis network with active deception and temporal logic

\\
  This paper is concerned with the synthesis of strategies in network systems
with active cyber deception. Active deception in a network employs decoy
systems and other defenses to conduct defensive planning against the intrusion
of malicious attackers who have been confirmed by sensing systems. In this
setting, the defender's objective is to ensure the satisfaction of security
properties specified in temporal logic formulas. We formulate the problem of
deceptive planning with decoy systems and other defenses as a two-player games
with asymmetrical information and Boolean payoffs in temporal logic. We use
level-2 hypergame with temporal logic objectives to capture the
incomplete/incorrect knowledge of the attacker about the network system as a
payoff misperception. The true payoff function is private information of the
defender. Then, we extend the solution concepts of $omega$-regular games to
analyze the attacker's rational strategy given her incomplete information. By
generalizing the solution of level-2 hypergame in the normal form to extensive
form, we extend the solutions of games with safe temporal logic objectives to
decide whether the defender can ensure security properties to be satisfied with
probability one, given any possible strategy that is perceived to be rational
by the attacker. Further, we use the solution of games with co-safe
(reachability) temporal logic objectives to determine whether the defender can
engage the attacker, by directing the attacker to a high-fidelity honeypot. The
effectiveness of the proposed synthesis methods is illustrated with synthetic
network systems with honeypots.

Title: Synthesis of Deceptive Strategies in Reachability Games with Action
  Misperception
Authors: Abhishek N. Kulkarni and Jie Fu
Categories: cs.GT cs.FL
Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IJCAI 2020
\\
  We consider a class of two-player turn-based zero-sum games on graphs with
reachability objectives, known as reachability games, where the objective of
Player 1 (P1) is to reach a set of goal states, and that of Player 2 (P2) is to
prevent this. In particular, we consider the case where the players have
asymmetric information about each other's action capabilities: P2 starts with
an incomplete information (misperception) about P1's action set, and updates
the misperception when P1 uses an action previously unknown to P2. When P1 is
made aware of P2's misperception, the key question is whether P1 can control
P2's perception so as to deceive P2 into selecting actions to P1's advantage?
We show that there might exist a deceptive winning strategy for P1 that ensures
P1's objective is achieved with probability one from a state otherwise losing
for P1, had the information being symmetric and complete. We present three key
results: First, we introduce a dynamic hypergame model to capture the
reachability game with evolving misperception of P2. Second, we present a
fixed-point algorithm to compute the Deceptive Almost-Sure Winning (DASW)
region and DASW strategy. Finally, we show that DASW strategy is at least as
powerful as Almost-Sure Winning (ASW) strategy in the game in which P1 does not
account for P2's misperception. We illustrate our algorithm using a robot
motion planning in an adversarial environment.

Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures
\\
  The global introduction of affordable Internet of Things (IoT) devices offers
an opportunity to empower a large variety of users with different needs.
However, many off-the-shelf digital products are still not widely adopted by
people who are hesitant technology users or by older adults, notwithstanding
that the design and user-interaction of these devices is recognized to be
user-friendly. In view of the potential of IoT-based devices, how can we reduce
the obstacles of a cohort with low digital literacy and technology anxiety and
enable them to be equal participants in the digitalized world? This article
shows the method and results achieved in a community-stakeholder workshop,
developed through the participatory design methodology, aiming at brainstorming
problems and scenarios through a focus group and a structured survey. The
research activity focused on understanding factors to increase the usability of
off-the-shelf IoT devices for hesitant users and identifying strategies for
improving digital literacy and reducing technology anxiety. A notable result
was a series of feedback items pointing to the importance of facilitating
educational experiences through learning resources to support individuals with
different abilities, age, gender expression, to better adopt off-the-shelf
IoT-based solutions.

sensory data from entities and then receives users' command, then optimizes
plans to utilize the capability of different entities to serve people. Using
multi-model interaction methods, e.g. graphical interfaces, speech interaction,

through different entities, keep users aware of the progress and accomplish the

\\
  The fast growing ad-blocker usage results in large revenue decrease for
ad-supported online websites. Facing this problem, many online publishers
choose either to cooperate with ad-blocker software companies to show
acceptable ads or to build a wall that requires users to whitelist the site for
content access. However, there is lack of studies on the impact of these two
counter-ad-blocking strategies on user behaviors. To address this issue, we
conduct a randomized field experiment on the website of Forbes Media, a major
US media publisher. The ad-blocker users are divided into a treatment group,
which receives the wall strategy, and a control group, which receives the
acceptable ads strategy. We utilize the difference-in-differences method to
estimate the causal effects. Our study shows that the wall strategy has an
overall negative impact on user engagements. However, it has no statistically
significant effect on high-engaged users as they would view the pages no matter
what strategy is used. It has a big impact on low-engaged users, who have no
loyalty to the site. Our study also shows that revisiting behavior decreases
over time, but the ratio of session whitelisting increases over time as the
remaining users have relatively high loyalty and high engagement. The paper
concludes with discussions of managerial insights for publishers when
determining counter-ad-blocking strategies.

Title: Can rhythm be touched? An evaluation of rhythmic sketch performance with

Authors: Feng Feng, Shang Kai, Tony Stockman
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Although it has been shown that augmented multimodal feedback has a
facilitatory effect on motor performance for motor learning and music training,
the functionality of haptic feedback combined with other modalities in rhythmic
movement tasks has rarely been explored and analysed. In this paper, we
evaluate the functionality of visual-haptic feedback in a rhythmic sketch task
by comparing it with other multimodal conditions. Further, we examine the
possibility of accessing the quality of task execution through kinematic
analysis. Based on participants' speed profiles, we investigate the quality of
motor control and movement smoothness under different feedback conditions.
Results revealed better motor control ability with auditory feedback and
improved movement smoothness with haptic feedback. Finally, we propose that
haptic feedback can be integrated with other modal stimuli for different
interaction purposes, and that kinematic analysis can be a complementary
approach to gesture analysis as well as providing subjective evaluation of
interaction performance.

  There are high technological and software demands associated with conducting
brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In order to accelerate the development
and accessibility of BCI, it is worthwhile to focus on open-source and desired
tooling. Python, a prominent computer language, has emerged as a language of
choice for many research and engineering purposes. In this manuscript, we
present BciPy, an open-source, Python-based software for conducting BCI
research. It was developed with a focus on restoring communication using
event-related potential (ERP) spelling interfaces, however, it may be used for
other non-spelling and non-ERP BCI paradigms. Major modules in this system
include support for data acquisition, data queries, stimuli presentation,

Title: Concurrent Crossmodal Feedback Assists Target-searching: Displaying
  Distance Information Through Visual, Auditory and Haptic Modalities
Authors: Feng Feng, Tony Stockman
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Humans sense of distance depends on the integration of multi sensory cues.
The incoming visual luminance, auditory pitch and tactile vibration could all
contribute to the ability of distance judgement. This ability can be enhanced
if the multimodal cues are associated in a congruent manner, a phenomenon has
been referred to as Crossmodal correspondences. In the context of multi-sensory
interaction, whether and how such correspondences influence information
processing with continuous motor engagement, particularly for target searching
activities, has rarely been investigated. This paper presents an experimental
user study to address this question. We built a target-searching application
based on a Table-top, displayed the unimodal and Crossmodal distance cues
concurrently responding to peoples searching movement, measured task
performance through kinematic evaluation. We find that the Crossmodal display
an audio display lead to improved searching efficiency and accuracy. More
interestingly, this improvement is confirmed by kinematic analysis, which also
unveiled the underlying movement features that could account for this
improvement. We discussed how these findings could shed lights on the design of
assistive technology and of other multi sensory interaction.

Title: Exploring crossmodal perceptual enhancement and integration in a
  sequence-reproducing task with cognitive priming
Authors: Feng Feng, Puhong Li, Tony Stockman
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Leveraging the perceptual phenomenon of crossmoal correspondence has been
shown to facilitate peoples information processing and improves sensorimotor
performance. However for goal-oriented interactive tasks, the question of how
to enhance the perception of specific Crossmodal information, and how
Crossmodal information integration takes place during interaction is still
unclear. The present paper reports two experiments investigating these
questions. In the first experiment, a cognitive priming technique was
introduced as a way to enhance the perception of two Crossmodal stimuli, in two
conditions respectively, and their effect on sensory-motor performance was
observed. Based on the results, the second experiment combined the two
Crossmodal stimuli in the same interfaces in a way that their correspondence
congruency was mutually exclusive. The same priming techniques was applied as a
manipulating factor to observe the Crossmodal integration process. Results
showed that first, the Crossmodal integration during interaction can be
enhanced by the priming technique, but the effect varies according to the
combination of Crossmodal stimuli and the types of priming material. Moreover,
peoples subjective evaluations towards priming types were in contradiction with
their objective behavioural data. Second, when two Crossmodal sequences can be
perceived simultaneously, results suggested different perceptual weights are
possessed by different participants, and the perceptual enhancement effect was
observed only on the dominant one, the pitch-elevation. Furthermore, the
Crossmodal integration tended to be integrated in a selective manner without
priming. These results contribute design implications for multisensory feedback
and mindless computing.

  Factorization methods for recommender systems tend to represent users as a
single latent vector. However, user behavior and interests may change in the
context of the recommendations that are presented to the user. For example, in
the case of movie recommendations, it is usually true that earlier user data is
less informative than more recent data. However, it is possible that a certain
early movie may become suddenly more relevant in the presence of a popular
sequel movie. This is just a single example of a variety of possible
dynamically altering user interests in the presence of a potential new
recommendation. In this work, we present Attentive Item2vec (AI2V) - a novel
attentive version of Item2vec (I2V). AI2V employs a context-target attention
mechanism in order to learn and capture different characteristics of user
historical behavior (context) with respect to a potential recommended item
(target). The attentive context-target mechanism enables a final neural
attentive user representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AI2V on
several datasets, where it is shown to outperform other baselines.

Title: TwinBERT: Distilling Knowledge to Twin-Structured BERT Models for
  Efficient Retrieval
Authors: Wenhao Lu, Jian Jiao, Ruofei Zhang
Categories: cs.IR cs.LG
MSC-class: Natural language processing
\\
  Pre-trained language models like BERT have achieved great success in a wide
variety of NLP tasks, while the superior performance comes with high demand in
computational resources, which hinders the application in low-latency IR
systems. We present TwinBERT model for effective and efficient retrieval, which
has twin-structured BERT-like encoders to represent query and document
respectively and a crossing layer to combine the embeddings and produce a
similarity score. Different from BERT, where the two input sentences are
concatenated and encoded together, TwinBERT decouples them during encoding and
produces the embeddings for query and document independently, which allows
document embeddings to be pre-computed offline and cached in memory. Thereupon,
the computation left for run-time is from the query encoding and query-document
crossing only. This single change can save large amount of computation time and
resources, and therefore significantly improve serving efficiency. Moreover, a
few well-designed network layers and training strategies are proposed to
further reduce computational cost while at the same time keep the performance
as remarkable as BERT model. Lastly, we develop two versions of TwinBERT for
retrieval and relevance tasks correspondingly, and both of them achieve close
or on-par performance to BERT-Base model.
  The model was trained following the teacher-student framework and evaluated
with data from one of the major search engines. Experimental results showed
that the inference time was significantly reduced and was firstly controlled
around 20ms on CPUs while at the same time the performance gain from fine-tuned
BERT-Base model was mostly retained. Integration of the models into production
systems also demonstrated remarkable improvements on relevance metrics with
negligible influence on latency.

Title: Open Knowledge Enrichment for Long-tail Entities
Authors: Ermei Cao and Difeng Wang and Jiacheng Huang and Wei Hu

Comments: Accepted by the 29th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW
  2020)
\\
  Knowledge bases (KBs) have gradually become a valuable asset for many AI
applications. While many current KBs are quite large, they are widely
acknowledged as incomplete, especially lacking facts of long-tail entities,
e.g., less famous persons. Existing approaches enrich KBs mainly on completing
missing links or filling missing values. However, they only tackle a part of
the enrichment problem and lack specific considerations regarding long-tail
entities. In this paper, we propose a full-fledged approach to knowledge
enrichment, which predicts missing properties and infers true facts of
long-tail entities from the open Web. Prior knowledge from popular entities is
leveraged to improve every enrichment step. Our experiments on the synthetic
and real-world datasets and comparison with related work demonstrate the
feasibility and superiority of the approach.

Title: HybridCite: A Hybrid Model for Context-Aware Citation Recommendation
Authors: Michael F\"arber, Ashwath Sampath
Categories: cs.IR cs.DL cs.LG
\\
  Citation recommendation systems aim to recommend citations for either a
complete paper or a small portion of text called a citation context. The
process of recommending citations for citation contexts is called local
citation recommendation and is the focus of this paper. In this paper, firstly,
we develop citation recommendation approaches based on embeddings, topic
modeling, and information retrieval techniques. We combine, for the first time
to the best of our knowledge, the best-performing algorithms into a
semi-genetic hybrid recommender system for citation recommendation. We evaluate
the single approaches and the hybrid approach offline based on several data
sets, such as the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and the MAG in combination
with arXiv and ACL. We further conduct a user study for evaluating our
approaches online. Our evaluation results show that a hybrid model containing
embedding and information retrieval-based components outperforms its individual
components and further algorithms by a large margin.

Title: Text-based Question Answering from Information Retrieval and Deep Neural
  Network Perspectives: A Survey
Authors: Zahra Abbasiyantaeb and Saeedeh Momtazi
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  Text-based Question Answering (QA) is a challenging task which aims at
finding short concrete answers for users' questions. This line of research has
been widely studied with information retrieval techniques and has received
increasing attention in recent years by considering deep neural network
approaches. Deep learning approaches, which are the main focus of this paper,
provide a powerful technique to learn multiple layers of representations and
interaction between questions and texts. In this paper, we provide a
comprehensive overview of different models proposed for the QA task, including
both traditional information retrieval perspective, and more recent deep neural
network perspective. We also introduce well-known datasets for the task and
present available results from the literature to have a comparison between
different techniques.

  For over a decade, TV series have been drawing increasing interest, both from
the audience and from various academic fields. But while most viewers are
hooked on the continuous plots of TV serials, the few annotated datasets
available to researchers focus on standalone episodes of classical TV series.
We aim at filling this gap by providing the multimedia/speech processing
communities with Serial Speakers, an annotated dataset of 161 episodes from
three popular American TV serials: Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones and House of
Cards. Serial Speakers is suitable both for investigating multimedia retrieval
in realistic use case scenarios, and for addressing lower level speech related
tasks in especially challenging conditions. We publicly release annotations for
every speech turn (boundaries, speaker) and scene boundary, along with
annotations for shot boundaries, recurring shots, and interacting speakers in a
subset of episodes. Because of copyright restrictions, the textual content of
the speech turns is encrypted in the public version of the dataset, but we
provide the users with a simple online tool to recover the plain text from
their own subtitle files.

Title: Citation Recommendation: Approaches and Datasets
Authors: Michael F\"arber, Adam Jatowt
Categories: cs.IR cs.DL cs.LG
\\
  Citation recommendation describes the task of recommending citations for a
given text. Due to the overload of published scientific works in recent years
on the one hand, and the need to cite the most appropriate publications when
writing scientific texts on the other hand, citation recommendation has emerged
as an important research topic. In recent years, several approaches and
evaluation data sets have been presented. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no literature survey has been conducted explicitly on citation
recommendation. In this article, we give a thorough introduction into automatic
citation recommendation research. We then present an overview of the approaches
and data sets for citation recommendation and identify differences and
commonalities using various dimensions. Last but not least, we shed light on
the evaluation methods, and outline general challenges in the evaluation and
how to meet them. We restrict ourselves to citation recommendation for
scientific publications, as this document type has been studied the most in
this area. However, many of the observations and discussions included in this
survey are also applicable to other types of text, such as news articles and
encyclopedic articles.

Title: Simultaneous Energy Harvesting and Information Transmission in a MIMO
  Full-Duplex System: A Machine Learning-Based Design
Authors: Yasser Al-Eryani, Mohamed Akrout, and Ekram Hossain
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2002.02801
\\
  We propose a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-based full-duplex (FD)
scheme that enables wireless devices to simultaneously transmit information and
harvest energy using the same time-frequency resources. In this scheme, for a
MIMO point-to-point set up, the energy transmitting device simultaneously
receives information from the energy harvesting device. Furthermore, the
self-interference (SI) at the energy harvesting device caused by the FD mode of
operation is utilized as a desired power signal to be harvested by the device.
For implementation-friendly antenna selection and MIMO precoding at both the
devices, we propose two methods: (i) a sub-optimal method based on relaxation,
and (ii) a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method, specifically,
a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-deep double Q-network (DDQN)
method. Finally, we study the performance of the proposed system under the two
implementation methods and compare it with that of the conventional time
switching-based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)
method.
  Findings show that the proposed system gives a significant improvement in
spectral efficiency compared to the time switching-based SWIPT. In particular,
the DRL-based method provides the highest spectral efficiency. Furthermore,
numerical results show that, for the considered system set up, the number of
antennas in each device should exceed three to mitigate self-interference to an
acceptable level.

Title: Analysis on Computation-Intensive Status Update in Mobile Edge Computing
Authors: Qiaobin Kuang, Jie Gong, Xiang Chen, and Xiao Ma
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 13 pages
MSC-class: Primary
ACM-class: F.2.2
\\
  In status update scenarios, the freshness of information is measured in terms
of age-of-information (AoI), which essentially reflects the timeliness for
real-time applications to transmit status update messages to a remote
controller. For some applications, computational expensive and time consuming
data processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be
displayed. Mobile edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources
and they are placed close to users. Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a
promising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive messages. In this
paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and
consider three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC
server, and partial computing, i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed
locally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server. Zero-wait policy is
adopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message
is generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing. While
in remote computing and partial computing, a new message is generated once the
previous one is received by the remote MEC server. With infinite queue size and
exponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form average AoI for
exponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing
schemes. For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed
numerically. Simulation results show that by carefully partitioning the
computing tasks, the average AoI in partial computing is the smallest compared
to local computing and remote computing. The results also indicate numerically
the conditions on which remote computing attains smaller average AoI compared
with local computing.

Title: Handover Probability in Drone Cellular Networks
Authors: Morteza Banagar, Vishnu Vardhan Chetlur, Harpreet S. Dhillon
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: To appear in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters
\\
  This letter analyzes the handover probability in a drone cellular network
where the initial positions of drone base stations (DBSs) serving a set of user
equipment (UE) on the ground are modeled by a homogeneous Poisson point process
(PPP). Inspired by the mobility model considered in the third generation
partnership project (3GPP) studies, we assume that all the DBSs move along
straight lines in random directions. We further consider two different
scenarios for the DBS speeds: (i) same speed model (SSM), and (ii) different
speed model (DSM). Assuming nearest-neighbor association policy for the UEs on
the ground, we characterize the handover probability of this network for both
mobility scenarios. For the SSM, we compute the exact handover probability by
establishing equivalence with a single-tier terrestrial cellular network, in
which the base stations (BSs) are static while the UEs are mobile. We then
derive a lower bound for the handover probability in the DSM by characterizing
the evolution of the spatial distribution of the DBSs over time.

Title: New Constructions of Cross Z-Complementary Pairs
Authors: Avik Ranjan Adhikary, Zhengchun Zhou, Yang Yang, Pingzhi Fan
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Spatial modulation (SM) is a new paradigm of multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems, in which only one antenna at the transmitter is activated
during each symbol period. Recently, it is observed that SM training sequences
derived from corss Z-complementary pairs (CZCPs) lead to optimal channel
estimation performance over frequency-selective channels. CZCPs are special
form of sequence pairs which have zero aperiodic autocorrelation zones and
cross-correlation zone at certain time-shifts. Recent paper by Liu \textit{et
al.} discussed only perfect CZCPs. In this paper, we focus on non-perfect
CZCPs. We introduce the term cross Z-complementary ratio and re-categorise the
CZCPs, both perfect and non-perfect, based on that. We propose a systematic
construction of CZCPs based on generalised Boolean functions (GBFs). We further
extend the lengths of the CZCPs by using the insertion method. The proposed
CZCPs are all of new lengths of the form
$2^\alpha10^\beta26^\gamma+2~(\alpha\geq1)$, $10^\beta+2$, $26^\gamma+2$ and
$10^\beta 26^\gamma+2$. Finally we propose a construction of optimal binary
CZCPs having parameters $(12,5)$ and $(24,11)$ from binary Barker sequences.
These CZCPs are also extended to $(12N,5N)$- CZCPs and $(24N,11N)$- CZCPs,
where $N$ is the length of a binary Golay complementary pair (GCP). During the
proof, we also found a new structural property of binary CZCPs and concluded
all binary GCPs are CZCPs too. Finally, we give some numerical simulations to
confirm that depending on the number of multi-paths, the proposed CZCPs can be
used to design SM training matrix which attains the minimum mean square error.

Title: Collaborative RF and Lightwave Power Transfer for Next-Generation
  Wireless Networks
Authors: Ha-Vu Tran, Georges Kaddoum, and Chadi Abou-Rjeily
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Breakthroughs in information and power transfer for wireless networks are
imperative in order to satisfy the requirement of wireless nodes for energy
sustainability. To this end, significant research efforts in academia and
industry have been devoted to the design of optimal resource allocation schemes
for RF simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) networks.
The transmit power constraints imposed by safety regulations introduce
significant challenges to the improvement of the power transfer performance.
Therefore, solely relying on RF resources to cope with the expectations of
next-generation wireless networks, such as longer device lifetimes and higher
data rates, may no longer be possible. Thus, the investigation of technologies
complementary to conventional RF SWIPT is of critical importance. In this
article, we propose a novel collaborative RF and lightwave power transfer
technology for future networks, where both the RF and lightwave bands can be
entirely exploited. In this context, we introduce the basic transceiver
architecture and four corresponding collaborative communication and power
transfer protocols. Finally, key potential future research directions are
highlighted.

Title: The normalized algorithmic information distance can not be approximated
Authors: Bruno Bauwens, Ilya Blinnikov
Categories: cs.IT cs.CC math.IT
Comments: 14 pages, 2 figures
\\
  It is known that the normalized algorithmic information distance $N$ is not
computable and not semicomputable. We show that for all $\epsilon < 1/2$, there
exist no semicomputable functions that differ from $N$ by at most~$\epsilon$.
Moreover, for any computable function $f$ such that $|\lim_t f(x,y,t) - N(x,y)|
\le \epsilon$ and for all $n$, there exist strings $x,y$ of length $n$ such
that $\sum_t |f(x,y,t+1) - f(x,y,t)| \ge \Omega(\log n)$. This is optimal up to
constant factors. We also show that the maximal number of oscillations of a
limit approximation of $N$ is $\Omega(n/\log n)$. This strengthens the
$\omega(1)$ lower bound from [K. Ambos-Spies, W. Merkle, and S.A. Terwijn,

  Logical depth and sophistication are two quantitative measures of the

measures have been proven equivalent, when the logical depth is renormalized by
the busy beaver function. In this article, the measures are relativized to
auxiliary information and re-compared to one another. The ability of auxiliary
information to solve the halting problem introduces a distortion between the
measures. Finally, similar to algorithmic complexity, sophistication and
logical depth (renormalized) each offer a relation between their expression of
$(x, y)$, $(x)$ and $(y | x)$.

  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) with Dynamic spectrum
allocation (DSA) is able to provide a wide range of data rate requirements.
This paper is focused on the design of preamble sequences in OFDMA systems with
low peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) property in the context of DSA.
We propose a systematic preamble sequence design which gives rise to low PMEPR
for possibly non-contiguous spectrum allocations. With the aid of
Golay-Davis-Jedwab (GDJ) sequences, two classes of preamble sequences are
presented. We prove that their PMEPRs are upper bounded by 4 for any DSA over a
chunk of four contiguous resource blocks.

Title: Polarization-adjusted Convolutional (PAC) Codes: Fano Decoding vs List
  Decoding
Authors: Mohammad Rowshan, Andreas Burg and Emanuele Viterbo
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In the Shannon lecture at the 2019 International Symposium on Information
Theory (ISIT), Ar{\i}kan proposed to employ a one-to-one convolutional
transform as a pre-coding step before polar transform. The resulting codes of
this concatenation are called {\em polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC)
codes}. In this scheme, a pair of polar mapper and demapper as pre- and
post-processing devices are deployed around a memoryless channel, which
provides polarized information to an outer decoder leading to improved error
correction performance of outer code. In this paper, the implementations of
list decoding and Fano decoding for PAC codes are first investigated. Then, in
order to reduce the complexity of sequential decoding of PAC/polar codes, we
propose (i) an adaptive heuristic metric, (ii) tree search constraints for
backtracking to avoid exploration of unlikely sub-paths, and (iii) tree search
strategies consistent with the pattern of error occurrence in polar codes.
These contribute to reducing the average decoding time complexity up to 85\%,
with only a relatively small degradation in error correction performance.
Additionally, as an important ingredient in Fano decoding of PAC/polar codes,
an efficient computation method for the intermediate LLRs and partial sums is
provided. This method is necessary for backtracking and avoids storing the
intermediate information or restarting the decoding process.

Title: Deep Learning for Massive MIMO Channel State Acquisition and Feedback
Authors: Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi, and Deniz G\"und\"uz
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: This paper was submitted for publication
\\
  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are a main enabler of
the excessive throughput requirements in 5G and future generation wireless
networks as they can serve many users simultaneously with high spectral and
energy efficiency. To achieve this, massive MIMO systems require accurate and
timely channel state information (CSI), which is acquired by a training process
that involves pilot transmission, CSI estimation and feedback. This training
process incurs a training overhead, which scales with the number of antennas,
users and subcarriers. Reducing this training overhead in massive MIMO systems
has been a major topic of research since the emergence of the concept.
Recently, deep learning (DL)-based approaches for massive MIMO training have
been proposed and showed significant improvements compared to traditional
techniques. This paper provides an overview of how neural networks (NNs) can be
used in the training process of massive MIMO systems to improve the performance
by reducing the CSI acquisition overhead and to reduce complexity.

Title: Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Multiple Access: Capacity Region
  and Deployment Strategy
Authors: Shuowen Zhang, Rui Zhang
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: submitted for possible conference publication
\\
  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new promising technology that is
able to manipulate the wireless propagation channel via smart and controllable
signal reflection. In this paper, we investigate the capacity region of a
multiple access channel (MAC) with two users sending independent messages to an
access point (AP), aided by $M$ IRS reflecting elements. We consider two
practical IRS deployment strategies that lead to different user-AP effective
channels, namely, the distributed deployment where the $M$ reflecting elements
form two IRSs, each deployed in the vicinity of one user, versus the
centralized deployment where all the $M$ reflecting elements are deployed in
the vicinity of the AP. For the distributed deployment, we derive the capacity
region in closed-form; while for the centralized deployment, we derive a
capacity region outer bound and propose an efficient rate-profile based method
to characterize an achievable rate region (or capacity region inner bound).
Furthermore, we compare the capacity regions of the two cases and draw useful
insights into the optimal deployment of IRS in practical systems.

Title: Fast Fair Regression via Efficient Approximations of Mutual Information
Authors: Daniel Steinberg, Alistair Reid, Simon O'Callaghan, Finnian Lattimore,

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2001.06089
\\
  Most work in algorithmic fairness to date has focused on discrete outcomes,
such as deciding whether to grant someone a loan or not. In these
classification settings, group fairness criteria such as independence,
separation and sufficiency can be measured directly by comparing rates of
outcomes between subpopulations. Many important problems however require the
prediction of a real-valued outcome, such as a risk score or insurance premium.
In such regression settings, measuring group fairness criteria is
computationally challenging, as it requires estimating information-theoretic
divergences between conditional probability density functions. This paper
introduces fast approximations of the independence, separation and sufficiency
group fairness criteria for regression models from their (conditional) mutual
information definitions, and uses such approximations as regularisers to
enforce fairness within a regularised risk minimisation framework. Experiments
in real-world datasets indicate that in spite of its superior computational
efficiency our algorithm still displays state-of-the-art accuracy/fairness
tradeoffs.

Title: Resource Management in Wireless Networks via Multi-Agent Deep
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Navid Naderializadeh, Jaroslaw Sydir, Meryem Simsek, Hosein Nikopour
Categories: cs.LG cs.IT cs.MA eess.SP math.IT stat.ML
\\
  We propose a mechanism for distributed radio resource management using
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) for interference mitigation in
wireless networks. We equip each transmitter in the network with a deep RL
agent, which receives partial delayed observations from its associated users,
while also exchanging observations with its neighboring agents, and decides on
which user to serve and what transmit power to use at each scheduling interval.
Our proposed framework enables the agents to make decisions simultaneously and
in a distributed manner, without any knowledge about the concurrent decisions
of other agents. Moreover, our design of the agents' observation and action
spaces is scalable, in the sense that an agent trained on a scenario with a
specific number of transmitters and receivers can be readily applied to
scenarios with different numbers of transmitters and/or receivers. Simulation
results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to
decentralized baselines in terms of the tradeoff between average and $5^{th}$
percentile user rates, while achieving performance close to, and even in
certain cases outperforming, that of a centralized information-theoretic
scheduling algorithm. We also show that our trained agents are robust and
maintain their performance gains when experiencing mismatches between training
and testing deployments.

Title: Electricity Theft Detection with self-attention
Authors: Paulo Finardi, Israel Campiotti, Gustavo Plensack, Rafael Derradi de
  Souza, Rodrigo Nogueira, Gustavo Pinheiro, Roberto Lotufo
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  In this work we propose a novel self-attention mechanism model to address
electricity theft detection on an imbalanced realistic dataset that presents a
daily electricity consumption provided by State Grid Corporation of China. Our
key contribution is the introduction of a multi-head self-attention mechanism
concatenated with dilated convolutions and unified by a convolution of kernel
size $1$. Moreover, we introduce a binary input channel (Binary Mask) to
identify the position of the missing values, allowing the network to learn how
to deal with these values. Our model achieves an AUC of $0.926$ which is an
improvement in more than $17\%$ with respect to previous baseline work. The
code is available on GitHub at

\\
  Wind power as a renewable source of energy, has numerous economic,
environmental and social benefits. In order to enhance and control renewable
wind power, it is vital to utilize models that predict wind speed with high
accuracy. Due to neglecting of requirement and significance of data
preprocessing and disregarding the inadequacy of using a single predicting
model, many traditional models have poor performance in wind speed prediction.
In the current study, for predicting wind speed at target stations in the north
of Iran, the combination of a multi-layer perceptron model (MLP) with the Whale
Optimization Algorithm (WOA) used to build new method (MLP-WOA) with a limited
set of data (2004-2014). Then, the MLP-WOA model was utilized at each of the
ten target stations, with the nine stations for training and tenth station for
testing (namely: Astara, Bandar-E-Anzali, Rasht, Manjil, Jirandeh, Talesh,
Kiyashahr, Lahijan, Masuleh, and Deylaman) to increase the accuracy of the
subsequent hybrid model. The capability of the hybrid model in wind speed
forecasting at each target station was compared with the MLP model without the
WOA optimizer. To determine definite results, numerous statistical performances
were utilized. For all ten target stations, the MLP-WOA model had precise
outcomes than the standalone MLP model. The hybrid model had acceptable
performances with lower amounts of the RMSE, SI and RE parameters and higher
values of NSE, WI, and KGE parameters. It was concluded that the WOA
optimization algorithm can improve the prediction accuracy of MLP model and may
be recommended for accurate wind speed prediction.

Title: On State Variables, Bandit Problems and POMDPs
Authors: Warren B Powell
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  State variables are easily the most subtle dimension of sequential decision
problems. This is especially true in the context of active learning problems
(bandit problems") where decisions affect what we observe and learn. We
describe our canonical framework that models {\it any} sequential decision
problem, and present our definition of state variables that allows us to claim:
Any properly modeled sequential decision problem is Markovian. We then present
a novel two-agent perspective of partially observable Markov decision problems
(POMDPs) that allows us to then claim: Any model of a real decision problem is
(possibly) non-Markovian. We illustrate these perspectives using the context of
observing and treating flu in a population, and provide examples of all four
classes of policies in this setting. We close with an indication of how to
extend this thinking to multiagent problems.

Title: Robust Policies For Proactive ICU Transfers
Authors: Julien Grand-Clement, Carri W. Chan, Vineet Goyal, Gabriel Escobar
Categories: cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
\\
  Patients whose transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is unplanned are
prone to higher mortality rates than those who were admitted directly to the
ICU. Recent advances in machine learning to predict patient deterioration have
introduced the possibility of \emph{proactive transfer} from the ward to the
ICU. In this work, we study the problem of finding \emph{robust} patient
transfer policies which account for uncertainty in statistical estimates due to
data limitations when optimizing to improve overall patient care. We propose a
Markov Decision Process model to capture the evolution of patient health, where
the states represent a measure of patient severity. Under fairly general
assumptions, we show that an optimal transfer policy has a threshold structure,
i.e., that it transfers all patients above a certain severity level to the ICU
(subject to available capacity). As model parameters are typically determined
based on statistical estimations from real-world data, they are inherently
subject to misspecification and estimation errors. We account for this
parameter uncertainty by deriving a robust policy that optimizes the worst-case
reward across all plausible values of the model parameters. We show that the
robust policy also has a threshold structure under fairly general assumptions.
Moreover, it is more aggressive in transferring patients than the optimal
nominal policy, which does not take into account parameter uncertainty. We
present computational experiments using a dataset of hospitalizations at 21
KNPC hospitals, and present empirical evidence of the sensitivity of various
hospital metrics (mortality, length-of-stay, average ICU occupancy) to small
changes in the parameters. Our work provides useful insights into the impact of
parameter uncertainty on deriving simple policies for proactive ICU transfer
that have strong empirical performance and theoretical guarantees.

\\
  A deep neural network (DNN) that can reliably model muscle responses from
corresponding brain stimulation has the potential to increase knowledge of
coordinated motor control for numerous basic science and applied use cases.
Such cases include the understanding of abnormal movement patterns due to
neurological injury from stroke, and stimulation based interventions for
neurological recovery such as paired associative stimulation. In this work,
potential DNN models are explored and the one with the minimum squared errors
is recommended for the optimal performance of the M2M-Net, a network that maps
transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex to corresponding muscle
responses, using: a finite element simulation, an empirical neural response
profile, a convolutional autoencoder, a separate deep network mapper, and
recordings of multi-muscle activation. We discuss the rationale behind the
different modeling approaches and architectures, and contrast their results.
Additionally, to obtain a comparative insight of the trade-off between
complexity and performance analysis, we explore different techniques, including
the extension of two classical information criteria for M2M-Net. Finally, we
find that the model analogous to mapping the motor cortex stimulation to a
combination of direct and synergistic connection to the muscles performs the
best, when the neural response profile is used at the input.

Title: Why Do Deep Residual Networks Generalize Better than Deep Feedforward
  Networks? -- A Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective
Authors: Kaixuan Huang, Yuqing Wang, Molei Tao, Tuo Zhao
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep residual networks (ResNets) have demonstrated better generalization
performance than deep feedforward networks (FFNets). However, the theory behind
such a phenomenon is still largely unknown. This paper studies this fundamental
problem in deep learning from a so-called "neural tangent kernel" perspective.
Specifically, we first show that under proper conditions, as the width goes to
infinity, training deep ResNets can be viewed as learning reproducing kernel
functions with some kernel function. We then compare the kernel of deep ResNets
with that of deep FFNets and discover that the class of functions induced by
the kernel of FFNets is asymptotically not learnable, as the depth goes to
infinity. In contrast, the class of functions induced by the kernel of ResNets
does not exhibit such degeneracy. Our discovery partially justifies the
advantages of deep ResNets over deep FFNets in generalization abilities.
Numerical results are provided to support our claim.

Title: A mean-field analysis of two-player zero-sum games
Authors: Carles Domingo-Enrich, Samy Jelassi, Arthur Mensch, Grant Rotskoff,
  Joan Bruna
Categories: cs.LG math.OC math.PR stat.ML
\\
  Finding Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum continuous games is a central
problem in machine learning, e.g. for training both GANs and robust models. The
existence of pure Nash equilibria requires strong conditions which are not
typically met in practice. Mixed Nash equilibria exist in greater generality
and may be found using mirror descent. Yet this approach does not scale to high
dimensions. To address this limitation, we parametrize mixed strategies as
mixtures of particles, whose positions and weights are updated using gradient
descent-ascent. We study this dynamics as an interacting gradient flow over
measure spaces endowed with the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric. We establish
global convergence to an approximate equilibrium for the related Langevin
gradient-ascent dynamic. We prove a law of large numbers that relates particle
dynamics to mean-field dynamics. Our method identifies mixed equilibria in high
dimensions and is demonstrably effective for training mixtures of GANs.

Title: Algorithmic Recourse: from Counterfactual Explanations to Interventions
Authors: Amir-Hossein Karimi, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Isabel Valera
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  As machine learning is increasingly used to inform consequential
decision-making (e.g., pre-trial bail and loan approval), it becomes important
to explain how the system arrived at its decision, and also suggest actions to
achieve a favorable decision. Counterfactual explanations -- "how the world
would have (had) to be different for a desirable outcome to occur" -- aim to
satisfy these criteria. Existing works have primarily focused on designing
algorithms to obtain counterfactual explanations for a wide range of settings.
However, one of the main objectives of "explanations as a means to help a
data-subject act rather than merely understand" has been overlooked. In
layman's terms, counterfactual explanations inform an individual where they
need to get to, but not how to get there. In this work, we rely on causal
reasoning to caution against the use of counterfactual explanations as a
recommendable set of actions for recourse. Instead, we propose a shift of
paradigm from recourse via nearest counterfactual explanations to recourse
through minimal interventions, moving the focus from explanations to
recommendations. Finally, we provide the reader with an extensive discussion on
how to realistically achieve recourse beyond structural interventions.

Title: Non-asymptotic Convergence of Adam-type Reinforcement Learning
  Algorithms under Markovian Sampling
Authors: Huaqing Xiong, Tengyu Xu, Yingbin Liang, Wei Zhang
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Despite the wide applications of Adam in reinforcement learning (RL), the
theoretical convergence of Adam-type RL algorithms has not been established.
This paper provides the first such convergence analysis for two fundamental RL
algorithms of policy gradient (PG) and temporal difference (TD) learning that
incorporate AMSGrad updates (a standard alternative of Adam in theoretical
analysis), referred to as PG-AMSGrad and TD-AMSGrad, respectively. Moreover,
our analysis focuses on Markovian sampling for both algorithms. We show that
under general nonlinear function approximation, PG-AMSGrad with a constant
stepsize converges to a neighborhood of a stationary point at the rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ (where $T$ denotes the number of iterations), and with a
diminishing stepsize converges exactly to a stationary point at the rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T/\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, under linear function
approximation, TD-AMSGrad with a constant stepsize converges to a neighborhood
of the global optimum at the rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$, and with a diminishing
stepsize converges exactly to the global optimum at the rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\log T/\sqrt{T})$. Our study develops new techniques for analyzing
the Adam-type RL algorithms under Markovian sampling.

\\
  Learning the preferences of a human improves the quality of the interaction
with the human. The number of queries available to learn preferences maybe
limited especially when interacting with a human, and so active learning is a
must. One approach to active learning is to use uncertainty sampling to decide
the informativeness of a query. In this paper, we propose a modification to
uncertainty sampling which uses the expected output value to help speed up
learning of preferences. We compare our approach with the uncertainty sampling
baseline, as well as conduct an ablation study to test the validity of each

Title: Loop estimator for discounted values in Markov reward processes
Authors: Falcon Z. Dai, Matthew R. Walter
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  At the working heart of policy iteration algorithms commonly used and studied
in the discounted setting of reinforcement learning, the policy evaluation step
estimates the value of state with samples from a Markov reward process induced
by following a Markov policy in a Markov decision process. We propose a simple
and efficient estimator called \emph{loop estimator} that exploits the
regenerative structure of Markov reward processes without explicitly estimating
a full model. Our method enjoys a space complexity of $O(1)$ when estimating
the value of a single positive recurrent state $s$ unlike TD (with $O(S)$) or
model-based methods (with $O(S^2)$). Moreover, the regenerative structure
enables us to show, without relying on the generative model approach, that the
estimator has an instance-dependent convergence rate of
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\tau_s/T})$ over steps $T$ on a single sample path, where
$\tau_s$ is the maximal expected hitting time to state $s$. In preliminary
numerical experiments, the loop estimator outperforms model-free methods, such
as TD(k), and is competitive with the model-based estimator.

\\
  Machine learning has shown growing success in recent years. However, current
machine learning systems are highly specialized, trained for particular
problems or domains, and typically on a single narrow dataset. Human learning,
on the other hand, is highly general and adaptable. Never-ending learning is a
machine learning paradigm that aims to bridge this gap, with the goal of
encouraging researchers to design machine learning systems that can learn to
perform a wider variety of inter-related tasks in more complex environments. To
date, there is no environment or testbed to facilitate the development and
evaluation of never-ending learning systems. To this end, we propose the Jelly
Bean World testbed. The Jelly Bean World allows experimentation over
two-dimensional grid worlds which are filled with items and in which agents can
navigate. This testbed provides environments that are sufficiently complex and
where more generally intelligent algorithms ought to perform better than
current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches. It does so by
producing non-stationary environments and facilitating experimentation with
multi-task, multi-agent, multi-modal, and curriculum learning settings. We hope
that this new freely-available software will prompt new research and interest
in the development and evaluation of never-ending learning systems and more
broadly, general intelligence systems.

  and William L. Hamilton
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Preprint, work under review
\\
  The choice of approximate posterior distributions plays a central role in
stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of
normalizing flows \cut{defined on Euclidean spaces} to construct flexible
posterior distributions. However, one key limitation of existing normalizing
flows is that they are restricted to the Euclidean space and are ill-equipped
to model data with an underlying hierarchical structure. To address this
fundamental limitation, we present the first extension of normalizing flows to
hyperbolic spaces. We first elevate normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces
using coupling transforms defined on the tangent bundle, termed Tangent
Coupling ($\mathcal{TC}$). We further introduce Wrapped Hyperboloid Coupling
($\mathcal{W}\mathbb{H}C$), a fully invertible and learnable transformation
that explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces, allowing
for expressive posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our novel normalizing flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean
normalizing flows. Our approach achieves improved performance on density
estimation, as well as reconstruction of real-world graph data, which exhibit a
hierarchical structure. Finally, we show that our approach can be used to power
a generative model over hierarchical data using hyperbolic latent variables.

Title: Manifold-based Test Generation for Image Classifiers
Authors: Taejoon Byun, Abhishek Vijayakumar, Sanjai Rayadurgam, Darren Cofer
Categories: cs.LG cs.SE stat.ML
\\
  Neural networks used for image classification tasks in critical applications
must be tested with sufficient realistic data to assure their correctness. To
effectively test an image classification neural network, one must obtain
realistic test data adequate enough to inspire confidence that differences
between the implicit requirements and the learned model would be exposed. This
raises two challenges: first, an adequate subset of the data points must be
carefully chosen to inspire confidence, and second, the implicit requirements
must be meaningfully extrapolated to data points beyond those in the explicit
training set. This paper proposes a novel framework to address these
challenges. Our approach is based on the premise that patterns in a large input
data space can be effectively captured in a smaller manifold space, from which
similar yet novel test cases---both the input and the label---can be sampled
and generated. A variant of Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is used

realistic yet fault-revealing test cases efficiently even for well-trained
models.

Title: Hold me tight! Influence of discriminative features on deep network
  boundaries

Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Important insights towards the explainability of neural networks and their
properties reside in the formation of their decision boundaries. In this work,
we borrow tools from the field of adversarial robustness and propose a new
framework that permits to relate the features of the dataset with the distance
of data samples to the decision boundary along specific directions. We
demonstrate that the inductive bias of deep learning has the tendency to
generate classification functions that are invariant along non-discriminative
directions of the dataset. More surprisingly, we further show that training on
small perturbations of the data samples are sufficient to completely change the
decision boundary. This is actually the characteristic exploited by the
so-called adversarial training to produce robust classifiers. Our general
framework can be used to reveal the effect of specific dataset features on the
macroscopic properties of deep models and to develop a better understanding of
the successes and limitations of deep learning.

Title: Neural Architecture Search over Decentralized Data

\\
  To preserve user privacy while enabling mobile intelligence, techniques have
been proposed to train deep neural networks on decentralized data. However,
training over decentralized data makes the design of neural architecture quite
difficult as it already was. Such difficulty is further amplified when
designing and deploying different neural architectures for heterogeneous mobile
platforms. In this work, we propose an automatic neural architecture search
into the decentralized training, as a new DNN training paradigm called
Federated Neural Architecture Search, namely federated NAS. To deal with the
primary challenge of limited on-client computational and communication
resources, we present FedNAS, a highly optimized framework for efficient
federated NAS. FedNAS fully exploits the key opportunity of insufficient model
candidate re-training during the architecture search process, and incorporates
three key optimizations: parallel candidates training on partial clients, early
dropping candidates with inferior performance, and dynamic round numbers.
Tested on large-scale datasets and typical CNN architectures, FedNAS achieves
comparable model accuracy as state-of-the-art NAS algorithm that trains models
with centralized data, and also reduces the client cost by up to two orders of
magnitude compared to a straightforward design of federated NAS.

  We consider the quantum version of the bandit problem known as {\em best arm

which assumes that both the learning agent and the environment are quantum; we
then propose an algorithm based on quantum amplitude amplification to solve
BAI. We formally analyze the behavior of the algorithm on all instances of the
problem and we show, in particular, that it is able to get the optimal solution
quadratically faster than what is known to hold in the classical case.

Title: MRRC: Multiple Role Representation Crossover Interpretation for Image
  Captioning With R-CNN Feature Distribution Composition (FDC)
Authors: Chiranjib Sur
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 18 pages
\\
  While image captioning through machines requires structured learning and
basis for interpretation, improvement requires multiple context understanding
and processing in a meaningful way. This research will provide a novel concept
for context combination and will impact many applications to deal visual
features as an equivalence of descriptions of objects, activities and events.
There are three components of our architecture: Feature Distribution
Composition (FDC) Layer Attention, Multiple Role Representation Crossover
(MRRC) Attention Layer and the Language Decoder. FDC Layer Attention helps in
generating the weighted attention from RCNN features, MRRC Attention Layer acts
as intermediate representation processing and helps in generating the next word
attention, while Language Decoder helps in estimation of the likelihood for the
next probable word in the sentence. We demonstrated effectiveness of FDC, MRRC,
regional object feature attention and reinforcement learning for effective
learning to generate better captions from images. The performance of our model
enhanced previous performances by 35.3\% and created a new standard and theory
for representation generation based on logic, better interpretability and
contexts.

Comments: Accepted by ICLR 2020
\\
  Federated learning allows edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared
model while keeping the training data on device, decoupling the ability to do
model training from the need to store the data in the cloud. We propose
Federated matched averaging (FedMA) algorithm designed for federated learning
of modern neural network architectures e.g. convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and LSTMs. FedMA constructs the shared global model in a layer-wise
manner by matching and averaging hidden elements (i.e. channels for convolution
layers; hidden states for LSTM; neurons for fully connected layers) with
similar feature extraction signatures. Our experiments indicate that FedMA not
only outperforms popular state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on deep
CNN and LSTM architectures trained on real world datasets, but also reduces the
overall communication burden.

Title: On Coresets for Support Vector Machines
Authors: Murad Tukan, Cenk Baykal, Dan Feldman, Daniela Rus
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We present an efficient coreset construction algorithm for large-scale
Support Vector Machine (SVM) training in Big Data and streaming applications. A
coreset is a small, representative subset of the original data points such that
a models trained on the coreset are provably competitive with those trained on
the original data set. Since the size of the coreset is generally much smaller
than the original set, our preprocess-then-train scheme has potential to lead
to significant speedups when training SVM models. We prove lower and upper
bounds on the size of the coreset required to obtain small data summaries for
the SVM problem. As a corollary, we show that our algorithm can be used to
extend the applicability of any off-the-shelf SVM solver to streaming,
distributed, and dynamic data settings. We evaluate the performance of our
algorithm on real-world and synthetic data sets. Our experimental results
reaffirm the favorable theoretical properties of our algorithm and demonstrate
its practical effectiveness in accelerating SVM training.

Title: Universal Value Density Estimation for Imitation Learning and
  Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yannick Schroecker, Charles Isbell
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This work considers two distinct settings: imitation learning and
goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. In either case, effective solutions
require the agent to reliably reach a specified state (a goal), or set of
states (a demonstration). Drawing a connection between probabilistic long-term
dynamics and the desired value function, this work introduces an approach which
utilizes recent advances in density estimation to effectively learn to reach a
given state. As our first contribution, we use this approach for
goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and show that it is both efficient and
does not suffer from hindsight bias in stochastic domains. As our second
contribution, we extend the approach to imitation learning and show that it
achieves state-of-the art demonstration sample-efficiency on standard benchmark
tasks.

Title: Correlated Adversarial Imitation Learning
Authors: Ari Azarafrooz
Categories: cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML
\\
  A novel imitation learning algorithm is introduced by applying a
game-theoretic notion of correlated equilibrium to the generative adversarial
imitation learning. This imitation learning algorithm is equipped with queues
of discriminators and agents, in contrast with the classical approach, where
there are single discriminator and single agent.
  The achievement of a correlated equilibrium is due to a mediating neural
architecture, which augments the observations that are being seen by queues of
discriminators and agents. At every step of the training, the mediator network
computes feedback using the rewards of discriminators and agents, to augment
the next observations accordingly. By interacting in the game, it steers the
training dynamic towards more suitable regions.
  The resulting imitation learning provides three important benefits. First, it
makes adaptability and transferability of the learned model to new environments
straightforward. Second, it is suitable for imitating a mixture of state-action
trajectories.
  Third, it avoids the difficulties of non-convex optimization faced by the
discriminator in the generative adversarial type architectures.

Title: Learning Adaptive Loss for Robust Learning with Noisy Labels
Authors: Jun Shu, Qian Zhao, Keyu Chen, Zongben Xu, Deyu Meng
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 10pages
\\
  Robust loss minimization is an important strategy for handling robust
learning issue on noisy labels. Current robust loss functions, however,
inevitably involve hyperparameter(s) to be tuned, manually or heuristically
through cross validation, which makes them fairly hard to be generally applied
in practice. Besides, the non-convexity brought by the loss as well as the
complicated network architecture makes it easily trapped into an unexpected
solution with poor generalization capability. To address above issues, we
propose a meta-learning method capable of adaptively learning hyperparameter in
robust loss functions. Specifically, through mutual amelioration between robust
loss hyperparameter and network parameters in our method, both of them can be
simultaneously finely learned and coordinated to attain solutions with good
generalization capability. Four kinds of SOTA robust loss functions are
attempted to be integrated into our algorithm, and comprehensive experiments
substantiate the general availability and effectiveness of the proposed method
in both its accuracy and generalization performance, as compared with
conventional hyperparameter tuning strategy, even with carefully tuned
hyperparameters.

Title: Differentiable Top-k Operator with Optimal Transport
Authors: Yujia Xie, Hanjun Dai, Minshuo Chen, Bo Dai, Tuo Zhao, Hongyuan Zha,
  Wei Wei, Tomas Pfister
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The top-k operation, i.e., finding the k largest or smallest elements from a
collection of scores, is an important model component, which is widely used in
information retrieval, machine learning, and data mining. However, if the top-k
operation is implemented in an algorithmic way, e.g., using bubble algorithm,
the resulting model cannot be trained in an end-to-end way using prevalent
gradient descent algorithms. This is because these implementations typically
involve swapping indices, whose gradient cannot be computed. Moreover, the
corresponding mapping from the input scores to the indicator vector of whether
this element belongs to the top-k set is essentially discontinuous. To address
the issue, we propose a smoothed approximation, namely the SOFT (Scalable
Optimal transport-based diFferenTiable) top-k operator. Specifically, our SOFT
top-k operator approximates the output of the top-k operation as the solution
of an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem. The gradient of the SOFT
operator can then be efficiently approximated based on the optimality
conditions of EOT problem. We apply the proposed operator to the k-nearest
neighbors and beam search algorithms, and demonstrate improved performance.

Title: A closer look at the approximation capabilities of neural networks
Authors: Kai Fong Ernest Chong
Categories: cs.LG math.FA stat.ML
Comments: Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020
\\
  The universal approximation theorem, in one of its most general versions,
says that if we consider only continuous activation functions $\sigma$, then a
standard feedforward neural network with one hidden layer is able to
approximate any continuous multivariate function $f$ to any given approximation
threshold $\varepsilon$, if and only if $\sigma$ is non-polynomial. In this
paper, we give a direct algebraic proof of the theorem. Furthermore we shall
explicitly quantify the number of hidden units required for approximation.
Specifically, if $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is compact, then a neural network
with $n$ input units, $m$ output units, and a single hidden layer with
$\binom{n+d}{d}$ hidden units (independent of $m$ and $\varepsilon$), can
uniformly approximate any polynomial function $f:X \to \mathbb{R}^m$ whose
total degree is at most $d$ for each of its $m$ coordinate functions. In the
general case that $f$ is any continuous function, we show there exists some
$N\in \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-n})$ (independent of $m$), such that $N$ hidden
units would suffice to approximate $f$. We also show that this uniform
approximation property (UAP) still holds even under seemingly strong conditions
imposed on the weights. We highlight several consequences: (i) For any $\delta
> 0$, the UAP still holds if we restrict all non-bias weights $w$ in the last
layer to satisfy $|w| < \delta$. (ii) There exists some $\lambda>0$ (depending
only on $f$ and $\sigma$), such that the UAP still holds if we restrict all
non-bias weights $w$ in the first layer to satisfy $|w|>\lambda$. (iii) If the
non-bias weights in the first layer are \emph{fixed} and randomly chosen from a
suitable range, then the UAP holds with probability $1$.

Title: First Order Optimization in Policy Space for Constrained Deep
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yiming Zhang, Quan Vuong, Keith W. Ross
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  In reinforcement learning, an agent attempts to learn high-performing
behaviors through interacting with the environment, such behaviors are often
quantified in the form of a reward function. However some aspects of behavior,
such as ones which are deemed unsafe and are to be avoided, are best captured
through constraints. We propose a novel approach called First Order Constrained
Optimization in Policy Space (FOCOPS) which maximizes an agent's overall reward
while ensuring the agent satisfies a set of cost constraints. Using data
generated from the current policy, FOCOPS first finds the optimal update policy
by solving a constrained optimization problem in the nonparameterized policy
space. FOCOPS then projects the update policy back into the parametric policy
space. Our approach provides a guarantee for constraint satisfaction throughout
training and is first-order in nature therefore extremely simple to implement.
We provide empirical evidence that our algorithm achieves better performance on
a set of constrained robotics locomotive tasks compared to current state of the
art approaches.

Title: Multi-Class Classification from Noisy-Similarity-Labeled Data
Authors: Songhua Wu, Xiaobo Xia, Tongliang Liu, Bo Han, Mingming Gong, Nannan
  Wang, Haifeng Liu, Gang Niu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A similarity label indicates whether two instances belong to the same class
while a class label shows the class of the instance. Without class labels, a
multi-class classifier could be learned from similarity-labeled pairwise data
by meta classification learning. However, since the similarity label is less
informative than the class label, it is more likely to be noisy. Deep neural
networks can easily remember noisy data, leading to overfitting in
classification. In this paper, we propose a method for learning from only
noisy-similarity-labeled data. Specifically, to model the noise, we employ a
noise transition matrix to bridge the class-posterior probability between clean
and noisy data. We further estimate the transition matrix from only noisy data
and build a novel learning system to learn a classifier which can assign
noise-free class labels for instances. Moreover, we theoretically justify how
our proposed method generalizes for learning classifiers. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art
method on benchmark-simulated and real-world noisy-label datasets.

Title: BinaryDuo: Reducing Gradient Mismatch in Binary Activation Network by
  Coupling Binary Activations
Authors: Hyungjun Kim, Kyungsu Kim, Jinseok Kim, Jae-Joon Kim
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have been garnering interest thanks to their
compute cost reduction and memory savings. However, BNNs suffer from
performance degradation mainly due to the gradient mismatch caused by
binarizing activations. Previous works tried to address the gradient mismatch
problem by reducing the discrepancy between activation functions used at
forward pass and its differentiable approximation used at backward pass, which
is an indirect measure. In this work, we use the gradient of smoothed loss
function to better estimate the gradient mismatch in quantized neural network.
Analysis using the gradient mismatch estimator indicates that using higher
precision for activation is more effective than modifying the differentiable
approximation of activation function. Based on the observation, we propose a
new training scheme for binary activation networks called BinaryDuo in which
two binary activations are coupled into a ternary activation during training.
Experimental results show that BinaryDuo outperforms state-of-the-art BNNs on
various benchmarks with the same amount of parameters and computing cost.

\\
  Learning in the presence of label noise is a challenging yet important task:
it is crucial to design models that are robust in the presence of mislabeled
datasets. In this paper, we discover that a new class of loss functions called
the gambler's loss provides strong robustness to label noise across various
levels of corruption. We show that training with this loss function encourages
the model to "abstain" from learning on the data points with noisy labels,
resulting in a simple and effective method to improve robustness and
generalization. In addition, we propose two practical extensions of the method:
1) an analytical early stopping criterion to approximately stop training before
the memorization of noisy labels, as well as 2) a heuristic for setting
hyperparameters which do not require knowledge of the noise corruption rate. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by achieving strong results across
three image and text classification tasks as compared to existing baselines.

Title: Fair Principal Component Analysis and Filter Design
Authors: Gad Zalcberg and Ami Wiesel
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We consider Fair Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) and search for a low
dimensional subspace that spans multiple target vectors in a fair manner. FPCA
is defined as a non-concave maximization of the worst projected target norm
within a given set. The problem arises in filter design in signal processing,
and when incorporating fairness into dimensionality reduction schemes. The
state of the art approach to FPCA is via semidefinite relaxation and involves a
polynomial yet computationally expensive optimization. To allow scalability, we
propose to address FPCA using naive sub-gradient descent. We analyze the
landscape of the underlying optimization in the case of orthogonal targets. We
prove that the landscape is benign and that all local minima are globally
optimal. Interestingly, the SDR approach leads to sub-optimal solutions in this
simple case. Finally, we discuss the equivalence between orthogonal FPCA and
the design of normalized tight frames.

Title: Generalized Embedding Machines for Recommender Systems

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.IR stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Factorization machine (FM) is an effective model for feature-based
recommendation which utilizes inner product to capture second-order feature
interactions. However, one of the major drawbacks of FM is that it couldn't
capture complex high-order interaction signals. A common solution is to change
the interaction function, such as stacking deep neural networks on the top of
FM. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to model high-order
interaction signals in the embedding level, namely Generalized Embedding
Machine (GEM). The embedding used in GEM encodes not only the information from
the feature itself but also the information from other correlated features.
Under such situation, the embedding becomes high-order. Then we can incorporate
GEM with FM and even its advanced variants to perform feature interactions.
More specifically, in this paper we utilize graph convolution networks (GCN) to
generate high-order embeddings. We integrate GEM with several FM-based models
and conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The results
demonstrate significant improvement of GEM over corresponding baselines.

Title: REST: Performance Improvement of a Black Box Model via RL-based Spatial
  Transformation
Authors: Jae Myung Kim, Hyungjin Kim, Chanwoo Park, and Jungwoo Lee
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In recent years, deep neural networks (DNN) have become a highly active area
of research, and shown remarkable achievements on a variety of computer vision
tasks. DNNs, however, are known to often make overconfident yet incorrect
predictions on out-of-distribution samples, which can be a major obstacle to
real-world deployments because the training dataset is always limited compared
to diverse real-world samples. Thus, it is fundamental to provide guarantees of
robustness to the distribution shift between training and test time when we
construct DNN models in practice. Moreover, in many cases, the deep learning
models are deployed as black boxes and the performance has been already
optimized for a training dataset, thus changing the black box itself can lead
to performance degradation. We here study the robustness to the geometric
transformations in a specific condition where the black-box image classifier is
given. We propose an additional learner, \emph{REinforcement Spatial Transform
learner (REST)}, that transforms the warped input data into samples regarded as
in-distribution by the black-box models. Our work aims to improve the
robustness by adding a REST module in front of any black boxes and training
only the REST module without retraining the original black box model in an
end-to-end manner, i.e. we try to convert the real-world data into training
distribution which the performance of the black-box model is best suited for.
We use a confidence score that is obtained from the black-box model to
determine whether the transformed input is drawn from in-distribution. We
empirically show that our method has an advantage in generalization to
geometric transformations and sample efficiency.

\\
  Testing automotive mechatronic systems partly uses the software-in-the-loop
approach, where systematically covering inputs of the system-under-test remains
a major challenge. In current practice, there are two major techniques of input
stimulation. One approach is to craft input sequences which eases control and
feedback of the test process but falls short of exposing the system to
realistic scenarios. The other is to replay sequences recorded from field
operations which accounts for reality but requires collecting a well-labeled
dataset of sufficient capacity for widespread use, which is expensive. This
work applies the well-known unsupervised learning framework of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) to learn an unlabeled dataset of recorded in-vehicle
signals and uses it for generation of synthetic input stimuli. Additionally, a
metric-based linear interpolation algorithm is demonstrated, which guarantees
that generated stimuli follow a customizable similarity relationship with
specified references. This combination of techniques enables controlled
generation of a rich range of meaningful and realistic input patterns,
improving virtual test coverage and reducing the need for expensive field
tests.

Title: Robustness Verification for Transformers
Authors: Zhouxing Shi, Huan Zhang, Kai-Wei Chang, Minlie Huang, Cho-Jui Hsieh
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  Robustness verification that aims to formally certify the prediction behavior
of neural networks has become an important tool for understanding model
behavior and obtaining safety guarantees. However, previous methods can usually
only handle neural networks with relatively simple architectures. In this
paper, we consider the robustness verification problem for Transformers.
Transformers have complex self-attention layers that pose many challenges for
verification, including cross-nonlinearity and cross-position dependency, which
have not been discussed in previous works. We resolve these challenges and
develop the first robustness verification algorithm for Transformers. The
certified robustness bounds computed by our method are significantly tighter
than those by naive Interval Bound Propagation. These bounds also shed light on
interpreting Transformers as they consistently reflect the importance of
different words in sentiment analysis.

Title: TempLe: Learning Template of Transitions for Sample Efficient Multi-task
  RL
Authors: Yanchao Sun, Xiangyu Yin, Furong Huang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Transferring knowledge among various environments is important to efficiently
learn multiple tasks online. Most existing methods directly use the previously
learned models or previously learned optimal policies to learn new tasks.
However, these methods may be inefficient when the underlying models or optimal
policies are substantially different across tasks. In this paper, we propose
Template Learning (TempLe), the first PAC-MDP method for multi-task
reinforcement learning that could be applied to tasks with varying state/action
space. TempLe generates transition dynamics templates, abstractions of the
transition dynamics across tasks, to gain sample efficiency by extracting
similarities between tasks even when their underlying models or optimal
policies have limited commonalities. We present two algorithms for an "online"
and a "finite-model" setting respectively. We prove that our proposed TempLe
algorithms achieve much lower sample complexity than single-task learners or
state-of-the-art multi-task methods. We show via systematically designed
experiments that our TempLe method universally outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-task methods (PAC-MDP or not) in various settings and regimes.

Title: Over-parameterized Adversarial Training: An Analysis Overcoming the
  Curse of Dimensionality
Authors: Yi Zhang, Orestis Plevrakis, Simon S. Du, Xingguo Li, Zhao Song,

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Adversarial training is a popular method to give neural nets robustness
against adversarial perturbations. In practice adversarial training leads to
low robust training loss. However, a rigorous explanation for why this happens
under natural conditions is still missing. Recently a convergence theory for
standard (non-adversarial) supervised training was developed by various groups
for {\em very overparametrized} nets. It is unclear how to extend these results
to adversarial training because of the min-max objective. Recently, a first
step towards this direction was made by Gao et al. using tools from online
learning, but they require the width of the net to be \emph{exponential} in
input dimension $d$, and with an unnatural activation function. Our work proves
convergence to low robust training loss for \emph{polynomial} width instead of
exponential, under natural assumptions and with the ReLU activation. Key
element of our proof is showing that ReLU networks near initialization can
approximate the step function, which may be of independent interest.

Comments: 31 pages, 4 figures
\\
  When predictions support decisions they may influence the outcome they aim to
predict. We call such predictions performative; the prediction influences the
target. Performativity is a well-studied phenomenon in policy-making that has
so far been neglected in supervised learning. When ignored, performativity
surfaces as undesirable distribution shift, routinely addressed with
retraining.
  We develop a risk minimization framework for performative prediction bringing
together concepts from statistics, game theory, and causality. A conceptual
novelty is an equilibrium notion we call performative stability. Performative
stability implies that the predictions are calibrated not against past
outcomes, but against the future outcomes that manifest from acting on the
prediction. Our main results are necessary and sufficient conditions for the
convergence of retraining to a performatively stable point of nearly minimal
loss.
  In full generality, performative prediction strictly subsumes the setting
known as strategic classification. We thus also give the first sufficient
conditions for retraining to overcome strategic feedback effects.

Title: Investigating Simple Object Representations in Model-Free Deep
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Guy Davidson, Brenden M. Lake
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  We explore the benefits of augmenting state-of-the-art model-free deep
reinforcement algorithms with simple object representations. Following the
Frostbite challenge posited by Lake et al. (2017), we identify object
representations as a critical cognitive capacity lacking from current
reinforcement learning agents. We discover that providing the Rainbow model
(Hessel et al.,2018) with simple, feature-engineered object representations
substantially boosts its performance on the Frostbite game from Atari 2600. We
then analyze the relative contributions of the representations of different
types of objects, identify environment states where these representations are
most impactful, and examine how these representations aid in generalizing to
novel situations.

Title: BatchEnsemble: an Alternative Approach to Efficient Ensemble and
  Lifelong Learning
Authors: Yeming Wen, Dustin Tran, Jimmy Ba
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Journal-ref: In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020
\\
  Ensembles, where multiple neural networks are trained individually and their
predictions are averaged, have been shown to be widely successful for improving
both the accuracy and predictive uncertainty of single neural networks.
However, an ensemble's cost for both training and testing increases linearly
with the number of networks, which quickly becomes untenable. In this paper, we
propose BatchEnsemble, an ensemble method whose computational and memory costs
are significantly lower than typical ensembles. BatchEnsemble achieves this by
defining each weight matrix to be the Hadamard product of a shared weight among
all ensemble members and a rank-one matrix per member. Unlike ensembles,
BatchEnsemble is not only parallelizable across devices, where one device
trains one member, but also parallelizable within a device, where multiple
ensemble members are updated simultaneously for a given mini-batch. Across
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, WMT14 EN-DE/EN-FR translation, and out-of-distribution
tasks, BatchEnsemble yields competitive accuracy and uncertainties as typical
ensembles; the speedup at test time is 3X and memory reduction is 3X at an
ensemble of size 4. We also apply BatchEnsemble to lifelong learning, where on
Split-CIFAR-100, BatchEnsemble yields comparable performance to progressive
neural networks while having a much lower computational and memory costs. We
further show that BatchEnsemble can easily scale up to lifelong learning on
Split-ImageNet which involves 100 sequential learning tasks.

Title: Predicting trends in the quality of state-of-the-art neural networks
  without access to training or testing data
Authors: Charles H. Martin, Tongsu (Serena) Peng, and Michael W. Mahoney
Categories: cs.LG physics.data-an stat.ML
Comments: 22 pages, 8 tables, 8 figures
\\
  In many applications, one works with deep neural network (DNN) models trained
by someone else. For such pretrained models, one typically does not have access
to training/test data. Moreover, one does not know many details about the
model, such as the specifics of the training data, the loss function, the
hyperparameter values, etc. Given one or many pretrained models, can one say
anything about the expected performance or quality of the models? Here, we
present and evaluate empirical quality metrics for pretrained DNN models at
scale. Using the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we analyze hundreds of
publicly-available pretrained models, including older and current
state-of-the-art models in CV and NLP. We examine norm-based capacity control
metrics as well as newer Power Law (PL) based metrics (including fitted PL
exponents and a Weighted Alpha metric), from the recently-developed Theory of
Heavy-Tailed Self Regularization. Norm-based metrics correlate well with
reported test accuracies for well-trained models across nearly all CV
architecture series. On the other hand, norm-based metrics can not distinguish
"good-versus-bad" models---which, arguably is the point of needing quality
metrics. Indeed, they may give spurious results. PL-based metrics do much
better---quantitatively better at discriminating series of "good-better-best"
models, and qualitatively better at discriminating "good-versus-bad" models.
PL-based metrics can also be used to characterize fine-scale properties of
models, and we introduce the layer-wise Correlation Flow as new quality
assessment. We show how poorly-trained (and/or poorly fine-tuned) models may
exhibit both Scale Collapse and unusually large PL exponents, in particular for
recent NLP models. Our techniques can be used to identify when a pretrained DNN
has problems that can not be detected simply by examining training/test
accuracies.

Title: Reward Design for Driver Repositioning Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
Authors: Zhenyu Shou, Xuan Di
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A large portion of the passenger requests is reportedly unserviced, partially
due to vacant for-hire drivers' cruising behavior during the passenger seeking
process. This paper aims to model the multi-driver repositioning task through a
mean field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach. Noticing that
the direct application of MARL to the multi-driver system under a given reward
mechanism will very likely yield a suboptimal equilibrium due to the
selfishness of drivers, this study proposes a reward design scheme with which a
more desired equilibrium can be reached. To effectively solve the bilevel
optimization problem with upper level as the reward design and the lower level
as a multi-agent system (MAS), a Bayesian optimization algorithm is adopted to
speed up the learning process. We then use a synthetic dataset to test the
proposed model. The results show that the weighted average of order response
rate and overall service charge can be improved by 4% using a simple platform
service charge, compared with that of no reward design.

Title: Multiple Flat Projections for Cross-manifold Clustering
Authors: Lan Bai, Yuan-Hai Shao, Wei-Jie Chen, Zhen Wang, Nai-Yang Deng
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 58 figures
\\
  Cross-manifold clustering is a hard topic and many traditional clustering
methods fail because of the cross-manifold structures. In this paper, we
propose a Multiple Flat Projections Clustering (MFPC) to deal with
cross-manifold clustering problems. In our MFPC, the given samples are
projected into multiple subspaces to discover the global structures of the
implicit manifolds. Thus, the cross-manifold clusters are distinguished from
the various projections. Further, our MFPC is extended to nonlinear manifold
clustering via kernel tricks to deal with more complex cross-manifold
clustering. A series of non-convex matrix optimization problems in MFPC are
solved by a proposed recursive algorithm. The synthetic tests show that our
MFPC works on the cross-manifold structures well. Moreover, experimental
results on the benchmark datasets show the excellent performance of our MFPC
compared with some state-of-the-art clustering methods.

Title: Learning Individually Fair Classifier with Causal-Effect Constraint
Authors: Yoichi Chikahara, Shinsaku Sakaue, Akinori Fujino
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 23 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Machine learning is increasingly being used in various applications that make
decisions for individuals. For such applications, we need to strike a balance
between achieving good prediction accuracy and making fair decisions with
respect to a sensitive feature (e.g., race or gender), which is difficult in
complex real-world scenarios. Existing methods measure the unfairness in such
scenarios as {\it unfair causal effects} and constrain its mean to zero.
Unfortunately, with these methods, the decisions are not necessarily fair for
all individuals because even when the mean unfair effect is zero, unfair
effects might be positive for some individuals and negative for others, which
is discriminatory for them. To learn a classifier that is fair for all
individuals, we define unfairness as the {\it probability of individual
unfairness} (PIU) and propose to solve an optimization problem that constrains
an upper bound on PIU. We theoretically illustrate why our method achieves
individual fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our method learns an
individually fair classifier at a slight cost of prediction accuracy.

  Meta-learning algorithms produce feature extractors which achieve

is rich with meta-learning methods, little is known about why the resulting
feature extractors perform so well. We develop a better understanding of the
underlying mechanics of meta-learning and the difference between models trained
using meta-learning and models which are trained classically. In doing so, we
develop several hypotheses for why meta-learned models perform better. In
addition to visualizations, we design several regularizers inspired by our
hypotheses which improve performance on few-shot classification.

Title: Unifying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Label Propagation
Authors: Hongwei Wang, Jure Leskovec
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Label Propagation (LPA) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are
both message passing algorithms on graphs. Both solve the task of node
classification but LPA propagates node label information across the edges of
the graph, while GCN propagates and transforms node feature information.
However, while conceptually similar, theoretical relation between LPA and GCN
has not yet been investigated. Here we study the relationship between LPA and
GCN in terms of two aspects: (1) feature/label smoothing where we analyze how
the feature/label of one node is spread over its neighbors; And, (2)
feature/label influence of how much the initial feature/label of one node
influences the final feature/label of another node. Based on our theoretical
analysis, we propose an end-to-end model that unifies GCN and LPA for node
classification. In our unified model, edge weights are learnable, and the LPA
serves as regularization to assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that
lead to improved classification performance. Our model can also be seen as
learning attention weights based on node labels, which is more task-oriented
than existing feature-based attention models. In a number of experiments on
real-world graphs, our model shows superiority over state-of-the-art GCN-based
methods in terms of node classification accuracy.

Title: Entity Context and Relational Paths for Knowledge Graph Completion
Authors: Hongwei Wang, Hongyu Ren, Jure Leskovec
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Knowledge graph completion aims to predict missing relations between entities
in a knowledge graph. While many different methods have been proposed, there is
a lack of a unifying framework that would lead to state-of-the-art results.
Here we develop PathCon, a knowledge graph completion method that harnesses
four novel insights to outperform existing methods. PathCon predicts relations
between a pair of entities by: (1) Considering the Relational Context of each
entity by capturing the relation types adjacent to the entity and modeled
through a novel edge-based message passing scheme; (2) Considering the
Relational Paths capturing all paths between the two entities; And, (3)
adaptively integrating the Relational Context and Relational Path through a
learnable attention mechanism. Importantly, (4) in contrast to conventional
node-based representations, PathCon represents context and path only using the
relation types, which makes it applicable in an inductive setting. Experimental
results on knowledge graph benchmarks as well as our newly proposed dataset
show that PathCon outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge graph completion
methods by a large margin. Finally, PathCon is able to provide interpretable
explanations by identifying relations that provide the context and paths that
are important for a given predicted relation.

Title: Hybrid Embedded Deep Stacked Sparse Autoencoder with w_LPPD SVM Ensemble
Authors: Yongming Li, Yan Lei, Pin Wang, Yuchuan Liu
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Deep learning is a kind of feature learning method with strong nonliear
feature transformation and becomes more and more important in many fields of
artificial intelligence. Deep autoencoder is one representative method of the
deep learning methods, and can effectively extract abstract the information of
datasets. However, it does not consider the complementarity between the deep
features and original features during deep feature transformation. Besides, it
suffers from small sample problem. In order to solve these problems, a novel
deep autoencoder - hybrid feature embedded stacked sparse autoencoder(HESSAE)
has been proposed in this paper. HFESAE is capable to learn discriminant deep
features with the help of embedding original features to filter weak
hidden-layer outputs during training. For the issue that class representation
ability of abstract information is limited by small sample problem, a feature
fusion strategy has been designed aiming to combining abstract information
learned by HFESAE with original feature and obtain hybrid features for feature
reduction. The strategy is hybrid feature selection strategy based on L1
regularization followed by an support vector machine(SVM) ensemble model, in
which weighted local discriminant preservation projection (w_LPPD), is designed
and employed on each base classifier. At the end of this paper, several
representative public datasets are used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that, the proposed
feature learning method yields superior performance compared to other existing
and state of art feature learning algorithms including some representative deep
autoencoder methods.

Title: Last iterate convergence in no-regret learning: constrained min-max
  optimization for convex-concave landscapes
Authors: Qi Lei and Sai Ganesh Nagarajan and Ioannis Panageas and Xiao Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML
\\
  In a recent series of papers it has been established that variants of
Gradient Descent/Ascent and Mirror Descent exhibit last iterate convergence in
convex-concave zero-sum games. Specifically, \cite{DISZ17, LiangS18} show last
iterate convergence of the so called "Optimistic Gradient Descent/Ascent" for
the case of \textit{unconstrained} min-max optimization. Moreover, in
\cite{Metal} the authors show that Mirror Descent with an extra gradient step
displays last iterate convergence for convex-concave problems (both constrained
and unconstrained), though their algorithm does not follow the online learning
framework; it uses extra information rather than \textit{only} the history to
compute the next iteration. In this work, we show that "Optimistic
Multiplicative-Weights Update (OMWU)" which follows the no-regret online
learning framework, exhibits last iterate convergence locally for
convex-concave games, generalizing the results of \cite{DP19} where last
iterate convergence of OMWU was shown only for the \textit{bilinear case}. We
complement our results with experiments that indicate fast convergence of the
method.

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We learn bandit policies that maximize the average reward over bandit
instances drawn from an unknown distribution $\mathcal{P}$, from a sample from
$\mathcal{P}$. Our approach is an instance of meta-learning and its appeal is
that the properties of $\mathcal{P}$ can be exploited without restricting it.
We parameterize our policies in a differentiable way and optimize them by
policy gradients - an approach that is easy to implement and pleasantly
general. Then the challenge is to design effective gradient estimators and good
policy classes. To make policy gradients practical, we introduce novel variance
reduction techniques. We experiment with various bandit policy classes,
including neural networks and a novel soft-elimination policy. The latter has
regret guarantees and is a natural starting point for our optimization. Our
experiments highlight the versatility of our approach. We also observe that
neural network policies can learn implicit biases, which are only expressed
through sampled bandit instances during training.

Title: Residual Continual Learning

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  We propose a novel continual learning method called Residual Continual
Learning (ResCL). Our method can prevent the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon
in sequential learning of multiple tasks, without any source task information
except the original network. ResCL reparameterizes network parameters by
linearly combining each layer of the original network and a fine-tuned network;
therefore, the size of the network does not increase at all. To apply the
proposed method to general convolutional neural networks, the effects of batch
normalization layers are also considered. By utilizing residual-learning-like
reparameterization and a special weight decay loss, the trade-off between
source and target performance is effectively controlled. The proposed method
exhibits state-of-the-art performance in various continual learning scenarios.

\\
  In this work we target the problem of provably computing the equivalence
between two programs represented as dataflow graphs. To this end, we formalize
the problem of equivalence between two programs as finding a set of
semantics-preserving rewrite rules from one into the other, such that after the
rewrite the two programs are structurally identical, and therefore trivially
equivalent. We then develop the first graph-to-sequence neural network system
for program equivalence, trained to produce such rewrite sequences from a
carefully crafted automatic example generation algorithm. We extensively
evaluate our system on a rich multi-type linear algebra expression language,
using arbitrary combinations of 100+ graph-rewriting axioms of equivalence. Our
system outputs via inference a correct rewrite sequence for 96% of the 10,000
program pairs isolated for testing, using 30-term programs. And in all cases,
the validity of the sequence produced and therefore the provable assertion of
program equivalence is computable, in negligible time.

Title: Reinforcement learning for the manipulation of eye tracking data
Authors: Wolfgang Fuhl
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we present an approach based on reinforcement learning for eye
tracking data manipulation. It is based on two opposing agents, where one tries
to classify the data correctly and the second agent looks for patterns in the
data, which get manipulated to hide specific information. We show that our
approach is successfully applicable to preserve the privacy of a subject. In
addition, our approach allows to evaluate the importance of temporal, as well
as spatial, information of eye tracking data for specific classification goals.
In general, this approach can also be used for stimuli manipulation, making it
interesting for gaze guidance. For this purpose, this work provides the
theoretical basis, which is why we have also integrated a section on how to
apply this method for gaze guidance.

Title: Class-Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Learning
Authors: Minsung Hyun, Jisoo Jeong and Nojun Kwak
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: 16 pages
\\
  Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has achieved great success in overcoming the
difficulties of labeling and making full use of unlabeled data. However, SSL
has a limited assumption that the numbers of samples in different classes are
balanced, and many SSL algorithms show lower performance for the datasets with
the imbalanced class distribution. In this paper, we introduce a task of
class-imbalanced semi-supervised learning (CISSL), which refers to
semi-supervised learning with class-imbalanced data. In doing so, we consider
class imbalance in both labeled and unlabeled sets. First, we analyze existing
SSL methods in imbalanced environments and examine how the class imbalance
affects SSL methods. Then we propose Suppressed Consistency Loss (SCL), a
regularization method robust to class imbalance. Our method shows better
performance than the conventional methods in the CISSL environment. In
particular, the more severe the class imbalance and the smaller the size of the
labeled data, the better our method performs.

Title: Control Frequency Adaptation via Action Persistence in Batch
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Alberto Maria Metelli, Flavio Mazzolini, Lorenzo Bisi, Luca Sabbioni,
  Marcello Restelli
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The choice of the control frequency of a system has a relevant impact on the
ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn a highly performing
policy. In this paper, we introduce the notion of action persistence that
consists in the repetition of an action for a fixed number of decision steps,
having the effect of modifying the control frequency. We start analyzing how
action persistence affects the performance of the optimal policy, and then we
present a novel algorithm, Persistent Fitted Q-Iteration (PFQI), that extends
FQI, with the goal of learning the optimal value function at a given
persistence. After having provided a theoretical study of PFQI and a heuristic
approach to identify the optimal persistence, we present an experimental
campaign on benchmark domains to show the advantages of action persistence and
proving the effectiveness of our persistence selection method.

Title: Data and Model Dependencies of Membership Inference Attack
Authors: Shakila Mahjabin Tonni, Farhad Farokhi, Dinusha Vatsalan and Dali

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used by most data-driven organisations
to extract insights. Machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS), where models are
trained on potentially sensitive user data and then queried by external parties
are becoming a reality. However, recently, these systems have been shown to be
vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), where a target's data can be
inferred to belong or not to the training data. While the key factors for the
success of MIA have not been fully understood, existing defence mechanisms only
consider the model-specific properties. We investigate the impact of both the
data and ML model properties on the vulnerability of ML techniques to MIA. Our
analysis indicates a strong relationship between the MIA success and the
properties of the data in use, such as the data size and balance between the
classes as well as the model properties including the fairness in prediction
and the mutual information between the records and the model's parameters. We
then propose new approaches to protect ML models from MIA by using several
properties, e.g. the model's fairness and mutual information between the
records and the model's parameters as regularizers, which reduces the attack
accuracy by 25%, while yielding a fairer and a better performing ML model.

Title: Scalable Quantitative Verification For Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Teodora Baluta, Zheng Leong Chua, Kuldeep S. Meel and Prateek Saxena
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Verifying security properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) is becoming
increasingly important. This paper introduces a new quantitative verification
framework for DNNs that can decide, with user-specified confidence, whether a
given logical property {\psi} defined over the space of inputs of the given DNN
holds for less than a user-specified threshold, {\theta}. We present new
algorithms that are scalable to large real-world models as well as proven to be
sound. Our approach requires only black-box access to the models. Further, it
certifies properties of both deterministic and non-deterministic DNNs. We
implement our approach in a tool called PROVERO. We apply PROVERO to the
problem of certifying adversarial robustness. In this context, PROVERO provides
an attack-agnostic measure of robustness for a given DNN and a test input.
First, we find that this metric has a strong statistical correlation with
perturbation bounds reported by 2 of the most prominent white-box attack
strategies today. Second, we show that PROVERO can quantitatively certify
robustness with high confidence in cases where the state-of-the-art qualitative
verification tool (ERAN) fails to produce conclusive results. Thus,
quantitative verification scales easily to large DNNs.

Title: $\pi$VAE: Encoding stochastic process priors with variational
  autoencoders
Authors: Swapnil Mishra, Seth Flaxman, Samir Bhatt
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Stochastic processes provide a mathematically elegant way model complex data.
In theory, they provide flexible priors over function classes that can encode a
wide range of interesting assumptions. In practice, however, efficient
inference by optimisation or marginalisation is difficult, a problem further
exacerbated with big data and high dimensional input spaces. We propose a novel
variational autoencoder (VAE) called the prior encoding variational autoencoder
($\pi$VAE). The $\pi$VAE is finitely exchangeable and Kolmogorov consistent,
and thus is a continuous stochastic process. We use $\pi$VAE to learn low
dimensional embeddings of function classes. We show that our framework can
accurately learn expressive function classes such as Gaussian processes, but
also properties of functions to enable statistical inference (such as the
integral of a log Gaussian process). For popular tasks, such as spatial
interpolation, $\pi$VAE achieves state-of-the-art performance both in terms of
accuracy and computational efficiency. Perhaps most usefully, we demonstrate
that the low dimensional independently distributed latent space representation
learnt provides an elegant and scalable means of performing Bayesian inference
for stochastic processes within probabilistic programming languages such as
Stan.

Title: t-viSNE: Interactive Assessment and Interpretation of t-SNE Projections
Authors: Angelos Chatzimparmpas, Rafael Messias Martins, Andreas Kerren
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.HC stat.ML
Comments: This manuscript is currently under review
\\
  t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for the visualization of
multidimensional data has proven to be a popular approach, with successful
applications in a wide range of domains. Despite their usefulness, t-SNE
projections can be hard to interpret or even misleading, which hurts the
trustworthiness of the results. Understanding the details of t-SNE itself and
the reasons behind specific patterns in its output may be a daunting task,
especially for non-experts in dimensionality reduction. In this work, we
present t-viSNE, an interactive tool for the visual exploration of t-SNE
projections that enables analysts to inspect different aspects of their
accuracy and meaning, such as the effects of hyper-parameters, distance and
neighborhood preservation, densities and costs of specific neighborhoods, and
the correlations between dimensions and visual patterns. We propose a coherent,
accessible, and well-integrated collection of different views for the
visualization of t-SNE projections. The applicability and usability of t-viSNE
are demonstrated through hypothetical usage scenarios with real data sets.
Finally, we present the results of a user study where the tool's effectiveness
was evaluated. By bringing to light information that would normally be lost
after running t-SNE, we hope to support analysts in using t-SNE and making its
results better understandable.

Title: Interpretable and Fair Comparison of Link Prediction or Entity Alignment
  Methods with Adjusted Mean Rank
Authors: Max Berrendorf and Evgeniy Faerman and Laurent Vermue and Volker Tresp
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this work, we take a closer look at the evaluation of two families of
methods for enriching information from knowledge graphs: Link Prediction and
Entity Alignment. In the current experimental setting, multiple different
scores are employed to assess different aspects of model performance. We
analyze the informative value of these evaluation measures and identify several
shortcomings. In particular, we demonstrate that all existing scores can hardly
be used to compare results across different datasets. Moreover, this problem
may also arise when comparing different train/test splits for the same dataset.
We show that this leads to various problems in the interpretation of results,
which may support misleading conclusions. Therefore, we propose a different
evaluation and demonstrate empirically how this helps for fair, comparable and
interpretable assessment of model performance.

Title: Investigating the Compositional Structure Of Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Francesco Craighero, Fabrizio Angaroni, Alex Graudenzi, Fabio Stella,
  Marco Antoniotti
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The current understanding of deep neural networks can only partially explain
how input structure, network parameters and optimization algorithms jointly
contribute to achieve the strong generalization power that is typically
observed in many real-world applications. In order to improve the comprehension
and interpretability of deep neural networks, we here introduce a novel
theoretical framework based on the compositional structure of piecewise linear
activation functions. By defining a direct acyclic graph representing the
composition of activation patterns through the network layers, it is possible
to characterize the instances of the input data with respect to both the
predicted label and the specific (linear) transformation used to perform
predictions. Preliminary tests on the MNIST dataset show that our method can
group input instances with regard to their similarity in the internal
representation of the neural network, providing an intuitive measure of input
complexity.

Title: Convergence of End-to-End Training in Deep Unsupervised Contrasitive
  Learning
Authors: Zixin Wen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 36 pages
\\
  Unsupervised contrastive learning has gained increasing attention in the
latest research and has proven to be a powerful method for learning
representations from unlabeled data. However, little theoretical analysis was
known for this framework. In this paper, we study the optimization of deep
unsupervised contrastive learning. We prove that for over-parameterized neural
networks, by applying end-to-end training that simultaneously updates two deep
neural networks, one can find an approximate stationary solution for the
non-convex contrastive loss. This result is inherently different from the
existing over-parameterized analysis in the supervised setting because, in
contrast to learning a specific target function, unsupervised contrastive
learning tries to encode the unlabeled data distribution into the neural
networks, which generally has no optimal solution. Our analysis provides
theoretical insights into the practical success of these unsupervised
pretraining methods.

Title: A Sparse Deep Factorization Machine for Efficient CTR prediction
Authors: Wei Deng and Junwei Pan and Tian Zhou and Aaron Flores and Guang Lin
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online display
advertising and the key part is to learn important feature interactions. The
mainstream models are embedding-based neural networks that provide end-to-end
training by incorporating hybrid components to model both low-order and
high-order feature interactions. These models, however, slow down the
prediction inference by at least hundreds of times due to the deep neural
network (DNN) component. Considering the challenge of deploying embedding-based
neural networks for online advertising, we propose to prune the redundant
parameters for the first time to accelerate the inference and reduce the
run-time memory usage. Most notably, we can accelerate the inference by 46X on
Criteo dataset and 27X on Avazu dataset without loss on the prediction
accuracy. In addition, the deep model acceleration makes an efficient model
ensemble possible with low latency and significant gains on the performance.

Title: Learning Group Structure and Disentangled Representations of Dynamical
  Environments
Authors: Robin Quessard, Thomas D. Barrett, William R. Clements
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages + 2 pages of references
\\
  Discovering the underlying structure of a dynamical environment involves
learning representations that are interpretable and disentangled, which is a
challenging task. In physics, interpretable representations of our universe and
its underlying dynamics are formulated in terms of representations of groups of
symmetry transformations. We propose a physics-inspired method, built upon the
theory of group representation, that learns a representation of an environment
structured around the transformations that generate its evolution.
Experimentally, we learn the structure of explicitly symmetric environments
without supervision while ensuring the interpretability of the representations.
We show that the learned representations allow for accurate long-horizon
predictions and further demonstrate a correlation between the quality of
predictions and disentanglement in the latent space.

Title: Learning Robust Representations via Multi-View Information Bottleneck
Authors: Marco Federici, Anjan Dutta, Patrick Forr\'e, Nate Kushman, Zeynep
  Akata
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  The information bottleneck principle provides an information-theoretic method
for representation learning, by training an encoder to retain all information
which is relevant for predicting the label while minimizing the amount of
other, excess information in the representation. The original formulation,
however, requires labeled data to identify the superfluous information. In this
work, we extend this ability to the multi-view unsupervised setting, where two
views of the same underlying entity are provided but the label is unknown. This
enables us to identify superfluous information as that not shared by both
views. A theoretical analysis leads to the definition of a new multi-view model
that produces state-of-the-art results on the Sketchy dataset and label-limited
versions of the MIR-Flickr dataset. We also extend our theory to the
single-view setting by taking advantage of standard data augmentation
techniques, empirically showing better generalization capabilities when
compared to common unsupervised approaches for representation learning.

Title: Causal Feature Discovery through Strategic Modification
Authors: Yahav Bechavod, Katrina Ligett, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Juba Ziani
Categories: cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML
\\
  We consider an online regression setting in which individuals adapt to the
regression model: arriving individuals may access the model throughout the
process, and invest strategically in modifying their own features so as to
improve their assigned score. We find that this strategic manipulation may help
a learner recover the causal variables, in settings where an agent can invest
in improving impactful features that also improve his true label. We show that
even simple behavior on the learner's part (i.e., periodically updating her
model based on the observed data so far, via least-square regression) allows
her to simultaneously i) accurately recover which features have an impact on an
agent's true label, provided they have been invested in significantly, and ii)
incentivize agents to invest in these impactful features, rather than in
features that have no effect on their true label.

\\
  Attention based Transformer architecture has enabled significant advances in
the field of natural language processing. In addition to new pre-training
techniques, recent improvements crucially rely on working with a relatively
larger embedding dimension for tokens. Unfortunately, this leads to models that
are prohibitively large to be employed in the downstream tasks. In this paper
we identify one of the important factors contributing to the large embedding
size requirement. In particular, our analysis highlights that the scaling
between the number of heads and the size of each head in the current
architecture gives rise to a low-rank bottleneck in attention heads, causing
this limitation. We further validate this in our experiments. As a solution we
propose to set the head size of an attention unit to input sequence length, and
independent of the number of heads, resulting in multi-head attention layers
with provably more expressive power. We empirically show that this allows us to
train models with a relatively smaller embedding dimension and with better
performance scaling.

Title: Regularizing Semi-supervised Graph Convolutional Networks with a
  Manifold Smoothness Loss
Authors: Qilin Li, Wanquan Liu, Ling Li
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Existing graph convolutional networks focus on the neighborhood aggregation
scheme. When applied to semi-supervised learning, they often suffer from the
overfitting problem as the networks are trained with the cross-entropy loss on
a small potion of labeled data. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised
manifold smoothness loss defined with respect to the graph structure, which can
be added to the loss function as a regularization. We draw connections between
the proposed loss with an iterative diffusion process, and show that minimizing
the loss is equivalent to aggregate neighbor predictions with infinite layers.
We conduct experiments on multi-layer perceptron and existing graph networks,
and demonstrate that adding the proposed loss can improve the performance
consistently.

Title: Fully convolutional networks for structural health monitoring through
  multivariate time series classification
Authors: Luca Rosafalco, Andrea Manzoni, Stefano Mariani, Alberto Corigliano
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP
Comments: 27 pages
\\
  We propose a novel approach to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), aiming at
the automatic identification of damage-sensitive features from data acquired
through pervasive sensor systems. Damage detection and localization are
formulated as classification problems, and tackled through Fully Convolutional
Networks (FCNs). A supervised training of the proposed network architecture is
performed on data extracted from numerical simulations of a physics-based model
(playing the role of digital twin of the structure to be monitored) accounting
for different damage scenarios. By relying on this simplified model of the
structure, several load conditions are considered during the training phase of
the FCN, whose architecture has been designed to deal with time series of
different length. The training of the neural network is done before the
monitoring system starts operating, thus enabling a real time damage
classification. The numerical performances of the proposed strategy are
assessed on a numerical benchmark case consisting of an eight-story shear
building subjected to two load types, one of which modeling random vibrations
due to low-energy seismicity. Measurement noise has been added to the responses
of the structure to mimic the outputs of a real monitoring system. Extremely
good classification capacities are shown: among the nine possible alternatives
(represented by the healthy state and by a damage at any floor), damage is
correctly classified in up to 95% of cases, thus showing the strong potential
of the proposed approach in view of the application to real-life cases.

\\
  Knowledge tracing, the act of modeling a student's knowledge through learning
activities, is an extensively studied problem in the field of computer-aided
education. Although models with attention mechanism have outperformed
traditional approaches such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and collaborative
filtering, they share two limitations. Firstly, the models rely on shallow
attention layers and fail to capture complex relations among exercises and
responses over time. Secondly, different combinations of queries, keys and
values for the self-attention layer for knowledge tracing were not extensively
explored. Usual practice of using exercises and interactions (exercise-response
pairs) as queries and keys/values respectively lacks empirical support. In this
paper, we propose a novel Transformer based model for knowledge tracing, SAINT:
Separated Self-AttentIve Neural Knowledge Tracing. SAINT has an encoder-decoder
structure where exercise and response embedding sequence separately enter the
encoder and the decoder respectively, which allows to stack attention layers
multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to suggest
an encoder-decoder model for knowledge tracing that applies deep self-attentive
layers to exercises and responses separately. The empirical evaluations on a
large-scale knowledge tracing dataset show that SAINT achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with the improvement of AUC
by 1.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art models.

Title: Back-and-Forth prediction for deep tensor compression
Authors: Hyomin Choi and Robert A. Cohen and Ivan V. Bajic
Categories: cs.LG eess.IV eess.SP
Comments: Accepted for publication in IEEE ICASSP'20
\\
  Recent AI applications such as Collaborative Intelligence with neural
networks involve transferring deep feature tensors between various computing
devices. This necessitates tensor compression in order to optimize the usage of
bandwidth-constrained channels between devices. In this paper we present a
prediction scheme called Back-and-Forth (BaF) prediction, developed for deep
feature tensors, which allows us to dramatically reduce tensor size and improve
its compressibility. Our experiments with a state-of-the-art object detector
demonstrate that the proposed method allows us to significantly reduce the
number of bits needed for compressing feature tensors extracted from deep
within the model, with negligible degradation of the detection performance and
without requiring any retraining of the network weights. We achieve a 62% and
75% reduction in tensor size while keeping the loss in accuracy of the network
to less than 1% and 2%, respectively.

Title: Object-based Metamorphic Testing through Image Structuring
Authors: Adrian Wildandyawan, Yasuharu Nishi
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  Testing software is often costly due to the need of mass-producing test cases
and providing a test oracle for it. This is often referred to as the oracle
problem. One method that has been proposed in order to alleviate the oracle
problem is metamorphic testing. Metamorphic testing produces new test cases by
altering an existing test case, and uses the metamorphic relation between the
inputs and the outputs of the System Under Test (SUT) to predict the expected
outputs of the produced test cases. Metamorphic testing has often been used for
image processing software, where changes are applied to the image's attributes
to create new test cases with annotations that are the same as the original
image. We refer to this existing method as the image-based metamorphic testing.
In this research, we propose an object-based metamorphic testing and a
composite metamorphic testing which combines different metamorphic testing
approaches to relatively increase test coverage.

Title: Bit Allocation for Multi-Task Collaborative Intelligence
Authors: Saeed Ranjbar Alvar and Ivan V. Baji\'c
Categories: cs.LG cs.MM eess.IV
Comments: Accepted for publication ICASSP'20
\\
  Recent studies have shown that collaborative intelligence (CI) is a promising
framework for deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based services on
mobile devices. In CI, a deep neural network is split between the mobile device
and the cloud. Deep features obtained at the mobile are compressed and
transferred to the cloud to complete the inference. So far, the methods in the
literature focused on transferring a single deep feature tensor from the mobile
to the cloud. Such methods are not applicable to some recent, high-performance
networks with multiple branches and skip connections. In this paper, we propose
the first bit allocation method for multi-stream, multi-task CI. We first
establish a model for the joint distortion of the multiple tasks as a function
of the bit rates assigned to different deep feature tensors. Then, using the
proposed model, we solve the rate-distortion optimization problem under a total
rate constraint to obtain the best rate allocation among the tensors to be
transferred. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed
scheme compared to several alternative bit allocation methods.

Title: Retrain or not retrain? -- efficient pruning methods of deep CNN
  networks
Authors: Marcin Pietron and Maciej Wielgosz

  Convolutional neural networks (CNN) play a major role in image processing
tasks like image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation. Very
often CNN networks have from several to hundred stacked layers with several
megabytes of weights. One of the possible methods to reduce complexity and
memory footprint is pruning. Pruning is a process of removing weights which
connect neurons from two adjacent layers in the network. The process of finding
near optimal solution with specified drop in accuracy can be more sophisticated
when DL model has higher number of convolutional layers. In the paper few
approaches based on retraining and no retraining are described and compared
together.

Title: Learning Zero-Sum Simultaneous-Move Markov Games Using Function
  Approximation and Correlated Equilibrium
Authors: Qiaomin Xie, Yudong Chen, Zhaoran Wang, Zhuoran Yang
Categories: cs.LG cs.GT cs.MA math.OC stat.ML
\\
  We develop provably efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for
two-player zero-sum Markov games in which the two players simultaneously take
actions. To incorporate function approximation, we consider a family of Markov
games where the reward function and transition kernel possess a linear
structure. Both the offline and online settings of the problems are considered.
In the offline setting, we control both players and the goal is to find the
Nash Equilibrium efficiently by minimizing the worst-case duality gap. In the
online setting, we control a single player to play against an arbitrary
opponent and the goal is to minimize the regret. For both settings, we propose
an optimistic variant of the least-squares minimax value iteration algorithm.
We show that our algorithm is computationally efficient and provably achieves
an $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3 H^3 T})$ upper bound on the duality gap and regret,
without requiring additional assumptions on the sampling model.
  We highlight that our setting requires overcoming several new challenges that
are absent in Markov decision processes or turn-based Markov games. In
particular, to achieve optimism in simultaneous-move Marko games, we construct
both upper and lower confidence bounds of the value function, and then compute
the optimistic policy by solving a general-sum matrix game with these bounds as
the payoff matrices. As finding the Nash Equilibrium of such a general-sum game
is computationally hard, our algorithm instead solves for a Coarse Correlated
Equilibrium (CCE), which can be obtained efficiently via linear programming. To
our best knowledge, such a CCE-based scheme for implementing optimism has not
appeared in the literature and might be of interest in its own right.

Title: The Big Three: A Methodology to Increase Data Science ROI by Answering
  the Questions Companies Care About
Authors: Daniel K. Griffin
Categories: cs.LG stat.AP stat.ML
\\
  Companies may be achieving only a third of the value they could be getting
from data science in industry applications. In this paper, we propose a
methodology for categorizing and answering 'The Big Three' questions (what is
going on, what is causing it, and what actions can I take that will optimize
what I care about) using data science. The applications of data science seem to
be nearly endless in today's modern landscape, with each company jockeying for
position in the new data and insights economy. Yet, data scientists seem to be
solely focused on using classification, regression, and clustering methods to
answer the question 'what is going on'. Answering questions about why things
are happening or how to take optimal actions to improve metrics are relegated
to niche fields of research and generally neglected in industry data science
analysis. We survey technical methods to answer these other important
questions, describe areas in which some of these methods are being applied, and
provide a practical example of how to apply our methodology and selected
methods to a real business use case.

Title: Graph Deconvolutional Generation
Authors: Daniel Flam-Shepherd, Tony Wu and Alan Aspuru-Guzik
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Graph generation is an extremely important task, as graphs are found
throughout different areas of science and engineering. In this work, we focus
on the modern equivalent of the Erdos-Renyi random graph model: the graph
variational autoencoder (GVAE). This model assumes edges and nodes are
independent in order to generate entire graphs at a time using a multi-layer
perceptron decoder. As a result of these assumptions, GVAE has difficulty
matching the training distribution and relies on an expensive graph matching
procedure. We improve this class of models by building a message passing neural
network into GVAE's encoder and decoder. We demonstrate our model on the
specific task of generating small organic molecules

Title: Augmented Normalizing Flows: Bridging the Gap Between Generative Flows
  and Latent Variable Models
Authors: Chin-Wei Huang, Laurent Dinh, Aaron Courville
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 27 pages, 12 figures

  In this work, we propose a new family of generative flows on an augmented
data space, with an aim to improve expressivity without drastically increasing
the computational cost of sampling and evaluation of a lower bound on the
likelihood. Theoretically, we prove the proposed flow can approximate a
Hamiltonian ODE as a universal transport map. Empirically, we demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks of flow-based generative
modeling.

Title: Controlling Computation versus Quality for Neural Sequence Models
Authors: Ankur Bapna, Naveen Arivazhagan, Orhan Firat
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL stat.ML
\\
  Most neural networks utilize the same amount of compute for every example
independent of the inherent complexity of the input. Further, methods that
adapt the amount of computation to the example focus on finding a fixed
inference-time computational graph per example, ignoring any external
computational budgets or varying inference time limitations. In this work, we
utilize conditional computation to make neural sequence models (Transformer)
more efficient and computation-aware during inference. We first modify the
Transformer architecture, making each set of operations conditionally
executable depending on the output of a learned control network. We then train
this model in a multi-task setting, where each task corresponds to a particular
computation budget. This allows us to train a single model that can be
controlled to operate on different points of the computation-quality trade-off
curve, depending on the available computation budget at inference time. We
evaluate our approach on two tasks: (i) WMT English-French Translation and (ii)
Unsupervised representation learning (BERT). Our experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Conditional Computation Transformer (CCT) is competitive with
vanilla Transformers when allowed to utilize its full computational budget,
while improving significantly over computationally equivalent baselines when
operating on smaller computational budgets.

Title: Handling Missing Annotations in Supervised Learning Data

Comments: 14 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables
ACM-class: I.2.6
Journal-ref: Abdel Hakim, Alaa E., and Wael Deabes. "Can People Really Do
  Nothing? Handling Annotation Gaps in ADL Sensor Data." Algorithms 12, no. 10
  (2019): 217
DOI: 10.3390/a12100217
\\
  Data annotation is an essential stage in supervised learning. However, the
annotation process is exhaustive and time consuming, specially for large
datasets. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) recognition is an example of systems
that exploit very large raw sensor data readings. In such systems, sensor
readings are collected from activity-monitoring sensors in a 24/7 manner. The
size of the generated dataset is so huge that it is almost impossible for a
human annotator to give a certain label to every single instance in the
dataset. This results in annotation gaps in the input data to the adopting
supervised learning system. The performance of the recognition system is
negatively affected by these gaps. In this work, we propose and investigate
three different paradigms to handle these gaps. In the first paradigm, the gaps
are taken out by dropping all unlabeled readings. A single "Unknown" or
"Do-Nothing" label is given to the unlabeled readings within the operation of
the second paradigm. The last paradigm handles these gaps by giving every one
of them a unique label identifying the encapsulating deterministic labels.
Also, we propose a semantic preprocessing method of annotation gaps by
constructing a hybrid combination of some of these paradigms for further
performance improvement. The performance of the proposed three paradigms and
their hybrid combination is evaluated using an ADL benchmark dataset containing
more than $2.5\times 10^6$ sensor readings that had been collected over more
than nine months. The evaluation results emphasize the performance contrast
under the operation of each paradigm and support a specific gap handling
approach for better performance.

Title: Agnostic Q-learning with Function Approximation in Deterministic
  Systems: Tight Bounds on Approximation Error and Sample Complexity
Authors: Simon S. Du, Jason D. Lee, Gaurav Mahajan, Ruosong Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML
\\
  The current paper studies the problem of agnostic $Q$-learning with function
approximation in deterministic systems where the optimal $Q$-function is
approximable by a function in the class $\mathcal{F}$ with approximation error
$\delta \ge 0$. We propose a novel recursion-based algorithm and show that if
$\delta = O\left(\rho/\sqrt{\dim_E}\right)$, then one can find the optimal
policy using $O\left(\dim_E\right)$ trajectories, where $\rho$ is the gap
between the optimal $Q$-value of the best actions and that of the second-best
actions and $\dim_E$ is the Eluder dimension of $\mathcal{F}$. Our result has
two implications:
  1) In conjunction with the lower bound in [Du et al., ICLR 2020], our upper
bound suggests that the condition $\delta =
\widetilde{\Theta}\left(\rho/\sqrt{\mathrm{dim}_E}\right)$ is necessary and
sufficient for algorithms with polynomial sample complexity.
  2) In conjunction with the lower bound in [Wen and Van Roy, NIPS 2013], our
upper bound suggests that the sample complexity
$\widetilde{\Theta}\left(\mathrm{dim}_E\right)$ is tight even in the agnostic
setting.
  Therefore, we settle the open problem on agnostic $Q$-learning proposed in
[Wen and Van Roy, NIPS 2013]. We further extend our algorithm to the stochastic
reward setting and obtain similar results.

Title: Subset Sampling For Progressive Neural Network Learning
Authors: Dat Thanh Tran, Moncef Gabbouj, Alexandros Iosifidis
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 5 pages, 4 tables
\\
  Progressive Neural Network Learning is a class of algorithms that
incrementally construct the network's topology and optimize its parameters
based on the training data. While this approach exempts the users from the
manual task of designing and validating multiple network topologies, it often
requires an enormous number of computations. In this paper, we propose to speed
up this process by exploiting subsets of training data at each incremental
training step. Three different sampling strategies for selecting the training
samples according to different criteria are proposed and evaluated. We also
propose to perform online hyperparameter selection during the network
progression, which further reduces the overall training time. Experimental
results in object, scene and face recognition problems demonstrate that the
proposed approach speeds up the optimization procedure considerably while
operating on par with the baseline approach exploiting the entire training set
throughout the training process.

human-written theorems and proofs available for supervised learning. To address
this limitation, we propose to learn a neural generator that automatically
synthesizes theorems and proofs for the purpose of training a theorem prover.
Experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that synthetic data from our
approach improves the theorem prover and advances the state of the art of
automated theorem proving in Metamath.

  Satisfaction Problems
Authors: Pierre Gillibert, Julius Jonu\v{s}as, Michael Kompatscher, Antoine
  Mottet, Michael Pinsker
Categories: cs.LO cs.CC math.LO
Comments: 31 pages
\\
  We produce a class of $\omega$-categorical structures with finite signature
by applying a model-theoretic construction -- a refinement of the
Hrushosvki-encoding -- to $\omega$-categorical structures in a possibly
infinite signature. We show that the encoded structures retain desirable
algebraic properties of the original structures, but that the constraint
satisfaction problems (CSPs) associated with these structures can be badly
behaved in terms of computational complexity. This method allows us to
systematically generate $\omega$-categorical templates whose CSPs are complete
for a variety of complexity classes of arbitrarily high complexity, and
$\omega$-categorical templates that show that membership in any given
complexity class cannot be expressed by a set of identities on the
polymorphisms. It moreover enables us to prove that recent results about the
relevance of topology on polymorphism clones of $\omega$-categorical structures
also apply for CSP templates, i.e., structures in a finite language. Finally,
we obtain a concrete algebraic criterion which could constitute a description
of the delineation between tractability and NP-hardness in the dichotomy
conjecture for first-order reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures.

Title: Computing rank-revealing factorizations of matrices stored out-of-core
Authors: Nathan Heavner, Per-Gunnar Martinsson, Gregorio Quintana-Ort\'i
Categories: cs.MS cs.CL cs.DC cs.DS cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 23 pages, 11 figures, 1 table
\\
  This paper describes efficient algorithms for computing rank-revealing
factorizations of matrices that are too large to fit in RAM, and must instead
be stored on slow external memory devices such as solid-state or spinning disk
hard drives (out-of-core or out-of-memory). Traditional algorithms for
computing rank revealing factorizations, such as the column pivoted QR
factorization, or techniques for computing a full singular value decomposition
of a matrix, are very communication intensive. They are naturally expressed as
a sequence of matrix-vector operations, which become prohibitively expensive
when data is not available in main memory. Randomization allows these methods
to be reformulated so that large contiguous blocks of the matrix can be
processed in bulk. The paper describes two distinct methods. The first is a
blocked version of column pivoted Householder QR, organized as a
``left-looking'' method to minimize the number of write operations (which are
more expensive than read operations on a spinning disk drive). The second
method results in a so called UTV factorization which expresses a matrix $A$ as
$A = U T V^*$ where $U$ and $V$ are unitary, and $T$ is triangular. This method
is organized as an algorithm-by-blocks, in which floating point operations
overlap read and write operations. The second method incorporates power
iterations, and is exceptionally good at revealing the numerical rank; it can
often be used as a substitute for a full singular value decomposition.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new algorithms are almost as fast
when processing data stored on a hard drive as traditional algorithms are for
data stored in main memory. To be precise, the computational time for fully
factorizing an $n\times n$ matrix scales as $cn^{3}$, with a scaling constant
$c$ that is only marginally larger when the matrix is stored out of core.

Title: Tensor train construction from tensor actions, with application to
  compression of large high order derivative tensors
Authors: Nick Alger, Peng Chen, Omar Ghattas
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 22 pages. Submitted
\\
  We present a method for converting tensors into tensor train format based on
actions of the tensor as a vector-valued multilinear function. Existing methods
for constructing tensor trains require access to "array entries" of the tensor
and are therefore inefficient or computationally prohibitive if the tensor is
accessible only through its action, especially for high order tensors. Our
method permits efficient tensor train compression of large high order
derivative tensors for nonlinear mappings that are implicitly defined through
the solution of a system of equations. Array entries of these derivative
tensors are not easily computable, but their actions can be computed
efficiently via a procedure that we discuss. Such tensors are often amenable to
tensor train compression in theory, but until now no practical algorithm
existed to convert them into tensor train format. We demonstrate our method by
compressing a Hilbert tensor of size $41 \times 42 \times 43 \times 44 \times
45$, and by forming high order (up to $5^\text{th}$ order
derivatives/$6^\text{th}$ order tensors) Taylor series surrogates of the
noise-whitened parameter-to-output map for a stochastic partial differential
equation with boundary output.

Title: Optimally weighted loss functions for solving PDEs with Neural Networks
Authors: Remco van der Meer, Cornelis Oosterlee, Anastasia Borovykh
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Recent works have shown that deep neural networks can be employed to solve
partial differential equations, giving rise to the framework of physics
informed neural networks. We introduce a generalization for these methods that
manifests as a scaling parameter which balances the relative importance of the
different constraints imposed by partial differential equations. A mathematical
motivation of these generalized methods is provided, which shows that for
linear and well-posed partial differential equations, the functional form is
convex. We then derive a choice for the scaling parameter that is optimal with
respect to a measure of relative error. Because this optimal choice relies on
having full knowledge of analytical solutions, we also propose a heuristic
method to approximate this optimal choice. The proposed methods are compared
numerically to the original methods on a variety of model partial differential
equations, with the number of data points being updated adaptively. For several
problems, including high-dimensional PDEs the proposed methods are shown to
significantly enhance accuracy.

Title: Polytopic Discontinuous Galerkin methods for the numerical modelling of
  flow in porous media with networks of intersecting fractures
Authors: Paola Francesca Antonietti and Chiara Facciol\`a and Marco Verani
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We present a numerical approximation of Darcy's flow through a porous medium
that incorporates networks of fractures with non empty intersection. Our scheme
employs PolyDG methods, i.e. discontinuous Galerkin methods on general
polygonal and polyhedral (polytopic, for short) grids, featuring elements with
edges/faces that may be in arbitrary number (potentially unlimited) and whose
measure may be arbitrarily small. Our approach is then very well suited to tame
the geometrical complexity featured by most of applications in the
computational geoscience field. From the modelling point of view, we adopt a
reduction strategy that treats fractures as manifolds of codimension one and we
employ the primal version of Darcy's law to describe the flow in both the bulk
and in the fracture network. In addition, some physically consistent conditions
couple the two problems, allowing for jump of pressure at their interface, and
they as well prescribe the behaviour of the fluid along the intersections,
imposing pressure continuity and flux conservation. Both the bulk and fracture
discretizations are obtained employing the Symmetric Interior Penalty DG method
extended to the polytopic setting. The key instrument to obtain a polyDG
approximation of the problem in the fracture network is the generalization of
the concepts of jump and average at the intersection, so that the contribution
from all the fractures is taken into account. We prove the well-posedness of
the discrete formulation and perform an error analysis obtaining a priori
hp-error estimates. All our theoretical results are validated performing
preliminary numerical tests with known analytical solution.

Title: Data-Driven Variational Multiscale Reduced Order Models
Authors: Changhong Mou, Birgul Koc, Omer San and Traian Iliescu
Categories: math.NA cs.NA physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn
\\
  We propose a new data-driven reduced order model (ROM) framework that centers
around the hierarchical structure of the variational multiscale (VMS)
methodology and utilizes data to increase the ROM accuracy at a modest
computational cost. The VMS methodology is a natural fit for the hierarchical
structure of the ROM basis: In the first step, we use the ROM projection to
separate the scales into three categories: (i) resolved large scales, (ii)
resolved small scales, and (iii) unresolved scales. In the second step, we
explicitly identify the VMS-ROM closure terms, i.e., the terms representing the
interactions among the three types of scales. In the third step, we use
available data to model the VMS-ROM closure terms. Thus, instead of
phenomenological models used in VMS for standard numerical discretizations
(e.g., eddy viscosity models), we utilize available data to construct new
structural VMS-ROM closure models. Specifically, we build ROM operators
(vectors, matrices, and tensors) that are closest to the true ROM closure terms
evaluated with the available data. We test the new data-driven VMS-ROM in the
numerical simulation of the 1D Burgers equation and the 2D flow past a circular
cylinder at Reynolds numbers $Re=100$, $Re=500$, and $Re=1000$. The numerical
results show that the data-driven VMS-ROM is significantly more accurate than
standard ROMs.

Title: A gradient system approach for Hankel structured low-rank approximation
Authors: Antonio Fazzi, Nicola Guglielmi, Ivan Markovsky
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  Rank deficient Hankel matrices are at the core of several applications.
However, in practice, the coefficients of these matrices are noisy due to e.g.
measurements errors and computational errors, so generically the involved
matrices are full rank. This motivates the problem of Hankel structured
low-rank approximation. Structured low-rank approximation problems, in general,
do not have a global and efficient solution technique. In this paper we propose
a local optimization approach based on a two-levels iteration. Experimental
results show that the proposed algorithm usually achieves good accuracy and
shows a higher robustness with respect to the initial approximation, compared

  We present a framework that relates preconditioning with a posteriori error
estimates in finite element methods. In particular, we use standard tools in
subspace correction methods to obtain reliable and efficient error estimators.
As a simple example, we recover the classical residual error estimators for the
second order elliptic equations.

  Quadratic forms of Hermitian matrix resolvents involve the solutions of
shifted linear systems. Efficient solutions use the shift-invariance property
of Krylov subspaces. The Hermitian Lanczos method reduces a given vector and
matrix to a Jacobi matrix (a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix with positive
super and sub-diagonal entries) and approximates the quadratic form with the
Jacobi matrix. This study develops a shifted Lanczos method that deals directly
with the Hermitian matrix resolvent to extend the scope of problems that the
Lanczos method can solve. We derive a matrix representation of a linear
operator that approximates the resolvent by solving a Vorobyev moment problem
associated with the shifted Lanczos method. We show that an entry of the Jacobi
matrix resolvent can approximate the quadratic form. We show the
moment-matching property of the shifted Lanczos method and give a sufficient
condition such that the method does not break down. Numerical experiments on
matrices drawn from real-world applications compare the proposed method with
previous methods and show that the proposed method outperforms a
well-established method in solving some problems.

Title: Strong convergence and asymptotic stability of explicit numerical
  schemes for nonlinear stochastic differential equations
Authors: Xiaoyue Li and Xuerong Mao and Hongfu Yang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  In this article we introduce several kinds of easily implementable explicit
schemes, which are amenable to Khasminski's techniques and are particularly
suitable for highly nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We show
that without additional restriction conditions except those which guarantee the
exact solutions possess their boundedness in expectation with respect to
certain Lyapunov functions, the numerical solutions converge strongly to the
exact solutions in finite-time. Moreover, based on the nonnegative
semimartingale convergence theorem, positive results about the ability of
explicit numerical approximation to reproduce the well-known LaSalle-type
theorem of SDEs are proved here, from which we deduce the asymptotic stability
of numerical solutions. Some examples and simulations are provided to support
the theoretical results and to demonstrate the validity of the approach.

Title: Flexible goal-oriented space-time adaptivity for coupled Stokes flow and
  convection-dominated transport
Authors: Markus Bause, Marius Paul Bruchh\"auser, Uwe K\"ocher
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 11-30, 01-25
\\
  In this work, a flexible, fully space-time adaptive finite element
approximation of a prototype multi-physics system coupling fluid flow and
convection-dominated transport is developed and studied. By some minor
generalization, the model becomes feasible for the simulation of a
poroelasticity system. Automatic mesh adaptation is based on the Dual Weighted
Residual method for goal-oriented a posteriori error estimation. In
multi-physics, the reliable and economical computation of a specific
functional, the so-called quantity of interest, is typically desirable. Here,
adaptive algorithms become more involved since they need not only to control
the time and space meshes, but also need to balance the contributions of the
coupled subproblems to the error in the goal quantity. Key ingredients of the
presented approach are the discontinuous Galerkin time discretization for the
primal and dual problem of the DWR approach, permitting miscellaneous
evaluations of the DWR error estimator, its implementation in an advanced
software architecture and the separation of effects of temporal and spatial
discretization which facilitates the simultaneous adjustment of the time and
space mesh.

\\
  In many applications of practical interest, solutions of partial differential
equation models arise as critical points of an underlying (energy) functional.
If such solutions are saddle points, rather than being maxima or minima, then
the theoretical framework is non-standard, and the development of suitable
numerical approximation procedures turns out to be highly challenging. In this
paper, our aim is to present an iterative discretization methodology for the
numerical solution of nonlinear variational problems with multiple (saddle
point) solutions. In contrast to traditional numerical approximation schemes,
which typically fail in such situations, the key idea of the current work is to
employ a simultaneous interplay of a previously developed local minimax
approach and adaptive Galerkin discretizations. We thereby derive an adaptive
local minimax Galerkin (LMMG) method, which combines the search for saddle
point solutions and their approximation in finite-dimensional spaces in a
highly effective way. Under certain assumptions, we will prove that the
generated sequence of approximate solutions converges to the solution set of
the variational problem. This general framework will be applied to the specific
context of finite element discretizations of (singularly perturbed) semilinear
elliptic boundary value problems, and a series of numerical experiments will be
presented.

  Flow in fractured porous media occurs in the earth's subsurface, in
biological tissues, and in man-made materials. Fractures have a dominating
influence on flow processes, and the last decade has seen an extensive
development of models and numerical methods that explicitly account for their
presence. To support these developments, we present a portfolio of four
benchmark cases for single-phase flow in three-dimensional fractured porous
media. The cases are specifically designed to test the methods' capabilities in
handling various complexities common to the geometrical structures of fracture
networks. Based on an open call for participation, results obtained with 17
numerical methods were collected. This paper presents the underlying
mathematical model, an overview of the features of the participating numerical
methods, and their performance in solving the benchmark cases.

Title: Nearest $\Omega$-stable matrix via Riemannian optimization
Authors: Vanni Noferini, Federico Poloni
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.OC
\\
  We study the problem of finding the nearest $\Omega$-stable matrix to a
certain matrix $A$, i.e., the nearest matrix with all its eigenvalues in a
prescribed closed set $\Omega$. Distances are measured in the Frobenius norm.
An important special case is finding the nearest Hurwitz or Schur stable
matrix, which has applications in systems theory. We describe a reformulation
of the task as an optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold of orthogonal
(or unitary) matrices. The problem can then be solved using standard methods
from the theory of Riemannian optimization. The resulting algorithm is
remarkably fast on small-scale and medium-scale matrices, and returns directly
a Schur factorization of the minimizer, sidestepping the numerical difficulties
associated with eigenvalues with high multiplicity.

Title: Pass-Efficient Randomized LU Algorithms for Computing Low-Rank Matrix
  Approximation

Comments: 28 pages, 9 figures
MSC-class: 65F99, 65C99
\\
  Low-rank matrix approximation is extremely useful in the analysis of data
that arises in scientific computing, engineering applications, and data
science. However, as data sizes grow, traditional low-rank matrix approximation
methods, such as SVD and CPQR, are either prohibitively expensive or cannot
provide sufficiently accurate results. A solution is to use randomized low-rank
matrix approximation methods such as randomized SVD , and randomized LU
decomposition on extremely large data sets.In this paper, we focus on the
randomized LU decomposition method. First, we employ a reorthogonalization
procedure to perform the power iteration of the existing randomized LU
algorithm to compensate for the rounding errors caused by the power method.
Then we propose a novel randomized LU algorithm, called PowerLU, for the fixed
low-rank approximation problem. PowerLU allows for an arbitrary number of
passes of the input matrix, $v \geq 2$. Recall that the existing randomized LU
decomposition only allows an even number of passes. We prove the theoretical
relationship between PowerLU and the existing randomized LU. Numerical
experiments show that our proposed PowerLU is generally faster than the
existing randomized LU decomposition, while remaining accurate. We also propose
a version of PowerLU, called PowerLU_FP, for the fixed precision low-rank
matrix approximation problem. PowerLU_FP is based on an efficient blocked
adaptive rank determination Algorithm 4.1 proposed in this paper. We present
numerical experiments that show that PowerLU_FP can achieve almost the same
accuracy and is faster than the randomized blocked QB algorithm by Martinsson
and Voronin. We finally propose a single-pass algorithm based on LU
factorization. Tests show that the accuracy of our single-pass algorithm is
comparable with the existing single-pass algorithms.

Title: Effective AER Object Classification Using Segmented
  Probability-Maximization Learning in Spiking Neural Networks
Authors: Qianhui Liu, Haibo Ruan, Dong Xing, Huajin Tang, Gang Pan
Categories: cs.NE
Comments: AAAI 2020 (Oral)
\\
  Address event representation (AER) cameras have recently attracted more
attention due to the advantages of high temporal resolution and low power
consumption, compared with traditional frame-based cameras. Since AER cameras
record the visual input as asynchronous discrete events, they are inherently
suitable to coordinate with the spiking neural network (SNN), which is
biologically plausible and energy-efficient on neuromorphic hardware. However,
using SNN to perform the AER object classification is still challenging, due to
the lack of effective learning algorithms for this new representation. To
tackle this issue, we propose an AER object classification model using a novel
segmented probability-maximization (SPA) learning algorithm. Technically, 1)
the SPA learning algorithm iteratively maximizes the probability of the classes
that samples belong to, in order to improve the reliability of neuron responses
and effectiveness of learning; 2) a peak detection (PD) mechanism is introduced
in SPA to locate informative time points segment by segment, based on which
information within the whole event stream can be fully utilized by the
learning. Extensive experimental results show that, compared to
state-of-the-art methods, not only our model is more effective, but also it
requires less information to reach a certain level of accuracy.

Title: Memristive Properties of Mushrooms
Authors: Alexander E. Beasley and Anna L. Powell and Andrew Adamatzky
Categories: cs.NE
Comments: 12 pages, 17 figures
\\
  Memristors close the loop for I-V characteristics of the traditional,
passive, semi-conductor devices. Originally proposed in 1971, the hunt for the
memristor has been going ever since. The key feature of a memristor is that its
current resitance is a function of its previous resistance. As such, the
behaviour of the device is influenced by changing the way in which potential is
applied across it. Ultimately, information can be encoded on memristors.
Biological substrates have already been shown to exhibit some memristive
properties. However, many memristive devices are yet to be found. Here we show
that the fruit bodies of grey oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus exhibit
memristive behaviours. This paper presents the I-V characteristics of the
mushrooms. By examination of the conducted current for a given voltage applied
as a function of the previous voltage, it is shown that the mushroom is a
memristor. Our results demonstrate that nature continues to provide specimens
that hold these unique and valuable electrical characteristics and which have
the potential to advance the field of hybrid electronic systems.

Title: Evolutionary Bi-objective Optimization for the Dynamic
  Chance-Constrained Knapsack Problem Based on Tail Bound Objectives
Authors: Hirad Assimi, Oscar Harper, Yue Xie, Aneta Neumann, Frank Neumann
Categories: cs.NE
\\
  Real-world combinatorial optimization problems are often stochastic and
dynamic. Therefore, it is essential to make optimal and reliable decisions with
a holistic approach. In this paper, we consider the dynamic chance-constrained
knapsack problem where the weight of each item is stochastic, the capacity
constraint changes dynamically over time, and the objective is to maximize the
total profit subject to the probability that total weight exceeds the capacity.
We make use of prominent tail inequalities such as Chebyshev's inequality, and
Chernoff bound to approximate the probabilistic constraint. Our key
contribution is to introduce an additional objective which estimates the
minimal capacity bound for a given stochastic solution that still meets the
chance constraint. This objective helps to cater for dynamic changes to the
stochastic problem. We apply single- and multi-objective evolutionary
algorithms to the problem and show how bi-objective optimization can help to
deal with dynamic chance-constrained problems.

\\
  The large number of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) simulators available
nowadays, differ in their design, goals, and characteristics. Users who have to
decide which simulator is the most appropriate for their particular
requirements, are today lost, faced with a panoply of disparate and diverse
simulators. Hence, it is obvious the need for establishing guidelines that
support users in the tasks of selecting a simulator to suit their preferences
and needs. In previous works, we proposed a generic and novel approach to
evaluate networks simulators, considering a methodological process and a set of
qualitative and quantitative criteria. In particularly, for WSN simulators, the
criteria include relevant aspects for this kind of networks, such as energy
consumption modelling and scalability capacity. The aims of this work are: (i)
describe deeply the criteria related to WSN aspects; (ii) extend and update the
state of the art of WSN simulators elaborated in our previous works to identify
the most used and cited in scientific articles; and (iii) demonstrate the
suitability of our novel methodological approach by evaluating and comparing
the three most cited simulators, specially in terms of energy modelling and
scalability capacities. Results show that our proposed approach provides
researchers with an evaluation tool that can be used to describe and compare
WSN simulators in order to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario

\\
  We introduce and analyze models for the propagation of malware in pure D2D
networks given via stationary Cox-Gilbert graphs. Here, the devices form a
Poisson point process with random intensity measure $\lambda\Lambda$, where
$\Lambda$ is stationary and given, for example, by the edge-length measure of a
realization of a Poisson-Voronoi tessellation that represents an urban street
system. We assume that, at initial time, a typical device at the center of the
network carries a malware and starts to infect neighboring devices after random
waiting times. Here we focus on Markovian models, where the waiting times are
exponential random variables, and non-Markovian models, where the waiting times
feature strictly positive minimal and finite maximal waiting times. We present
numerical results for the speed of propagation depending on the system
parameters. In a second step, we introduce and analyze a counter measure for
the malware propagation given by special devices called white knights, which
have the ability, once attacked, to eliminate the malware from infected devices
and turn them into white knights. Based on simulations, we isolate parameter
regimes in which the malware survives or is eliminated, both in the Markovian
and non-Markovian setting.

Title: The Design of Dynamic Probabilistic Caching with Time-Varying Content
  Popularity
Authors: Jie Gao, Shan Zhang, Lian Zhao, Xuemin (Sherman) Shen
Categories: cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 13 pages; 10 figures
\\
  In this paper, we design dynamic probabilistic caching for the scenario when
the instantaneous content popularity may vary with time while it is possible to
predict the average content popularity over a time window. Based on the average
content popularity, optimal content caching probabilities can be found, e.g.,
from solving optimization problems, and existing results in the literature can
implement the optimal caching probabilities via static content placement. The
objective of this work is to design dynamic probabilistic caching that: i)
converge (in distribution) to the optimal content caching probabilities under
time-invariant content popularity, and ii) adapt to the time-varying
instantaneous content popularity under time-varying content popularity.
Achieving the above objective requires a novel design of dynamic content
replacement because static caching cannot adapt to varying content popularity
while classic dynamic replacement policies, such as LRU, cannot converge to
target caching probabilities (as they do not exploit any content popularity
information). We model the design of dynamic probabilistic replacement policy
as the problem of finding the state transition probability matrix of a Markov
chain and propose a method to generate and refine the transition probability
matrix. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed design.

\\
  In wireless caching networks, a user generally has a concrete purpose of
consuming contents in a certain preferred category, and requests multiple
contents in sequence. While most existing research on wireless caching and
delivery has focused only on one-shot requests, the popularity distribution of
contents requested consecutively is definitely different from the one-shot
request and has been not considered. Also, especially from the perspective of
the service provider, it is advantageous for users to consume as many contents
as possible. Thus, this paper proposes two cache allocation policies for
categorized contents and consecutive user demands, which maximize 1) the cache
hit rate and 2) the number of consecutive content consumption, respectively.
Numerical results show how categorized contents and consecutive content
requests have impacts on the cache allocation.

Authors: Pradnya Kiri Taksande, Prasanna Chaporkar, Pranav Jha, and Abhay
  Karandikar
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Proportional Fair (PF) is a scheduling technique to maintain a balance
between maximizing throughput and ensuring fairness to users. Dual Connectivity
(DC) technique was introduced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
to improve the mobility robustness and system capacity in heterogeneous
networks. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of DC in improving
proportional fairness in the system. We propose a low complexity centralized PF
scheduling scheme for DC and show that it outperforms the standard PF
scheduling scheme. Since the problem of dual association of users for
maximizing proportional fairness in the system is NP-hard, we propose three
heuristic user association schemes for DC. We demonstrate that DC, along with
the proposed PF scheme, gives remarkable gains on PF utility over single
connectivity and performs almost close to the optimal PF scheme in
heterogeneous networks.

Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Mobile Networks today comprise of multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs),
e.g., 4G LTE, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), and the upcoming 5G-New Radio
(5G-NR). The access networks of these RATs are controlled by RAT-specific
entities, e.g., the resource management function located inside an individual
LTE eNB is used for the eNB control, or access controllers are used for
controlling WLAN Access Points. Even in the 3GPP's 5G architecture, which has a
common Core supporting multiple RATs, radio access related decisions are taken
independently within individual RATs. Due to the fragmented nature of
control-plane in multi-RAT Radio Access Network (RAN), a unified global view of
network resources is unavailable, hindering optimized allocation of resources.
It also brings complexity to the features involving multiple RATs, e.g., dual
connectivity. To address these issues, we introduced an SDN-based Multi-RAT RAN
architecture (SMRAN) in our earlier work [arXiv:1812.11825], where the RAN
control-plane is segregated from the data-plane. As part of the SMRAN
architecture, we defined a logically centralized multi-RAT RAN Controller and
individual RAT-specific data-plane functions. In the current work, we define a
protocol, called Open5G, to be used for control and management of the SMRAN
data-plane. Open5G is based on OpenFlow (OF) and OF-Config, which are commonly
used protocols in the SDN-based wired networks and data centers.

\\
  Cyber-physical system (CPS) has operated, controlled and coordinated the
physical systems integrated by a computing and communication core applied in
industry 4.0. To accommodate CPS services, fog radio and optical networks
(F-RON) has become an important supporting physical cyber infrastructure taking
advantage of both the inherent ubiquity of wireless technology and the large
capacity of optical networks. However, cyber security is the biggest issue in
CPS scenario as there is a tradeoff between security control and privacy
exposure in F-RON. To deal with this issue, we propose a brain-like based
distributed control security (BLCS) architecture for F-RON in CPS, by
introducing a brain-like security (BLS) scheme. BLCS can accomplish the secure
cross-domain control among tripartite controllers verification in the scenario
of decentralized F-RON for distributed computing and communications, which has
no need to disclose the private information of each domain against
cyber-attacks. BLS utilizes parts of information to perform control
identification through relation network and deep learning of behavior library.
The functional modules of BLCS architecture are illustrated including various
controllers and brain-like knowledge base. The interworking procedures in
distributed control security modes based on BLS are described. The overall
feasibility and efficiency of architecture are experimentally verified on the
software defined network testbed in terms of average mistrust rate, path
provisioning latency, packet loss probability and blocking probability. The
emulation results are obtained and dissected based on the testbed.

  Quite a few algorithms have been proposed to optimize the transmission
performance of Multipath TCP (MPTCP). However, existing MPTCP protocols are
still far from satisfactory in lossy and ever-changing networks because of
their loss-based congestion control and the difficulty of managing multiple
subflows. Recently, a congestion-based congestion control, BBR, is proposed to
promote TCP transmission performance through better use of bandwidth. Due to
the superior performance of BBR, we try to boost MPTCP with it. For this
propose, coupled congestion control should be redesigned for MPTCP, and a
functional scheduler able to effectively make use of the characteristics of BBR
must also be developed for better performance. In this paper, we first propose
Coupled BBR as a coupled congestion control algorithm for MPTCP to achieve high
throughput and stable sending rate in lossy network scenarios with guaranteed
fairness with TCP BBR flows and balanced congestion. Then, to further improve
the performance, we propose an Adaptively Redundant and Packet-by-Packet
(AR\&P) scheduler, which includes two scheduling methods to improve
adaptability in highly dynamic network scenarios and keep in-order packet
delivery in asymmetric networks. Based on Linux kernel implementation and
experiments in both testbed and real network scenarios, we show that the
proposed scheme not only provides higher throughput, but also improves
robustness and reduces out-of-order packets in some harsh circumstances.

Title: Autonomous Unknown-Application Filtering and Labeling for DL-based
  Traffic Classifier Update
Authors: Jielun Zhang, Fuhao Li, Feng Ye, Hongyu Wu
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Network traffic classification has been widely studied to fundamentally
advance network measurement and management. Machine Learning is one of the
effective approaches for network traffic classification. Specifically, Deep
Learning (DL) has attracted much attention from the researchers due to its
effectiveness even in encrypted network traffic without compromising neither
user privacy nor network security. However, most of the existing models are
created from closed-world datasets, thus they can only classify those existing
classes previously sampled and labeled. In this case, unknown classes cannot be
correctly classified. To tackle this issue, an autonomous learning framework is
proposed to effectively update DL-based traffic classification models during
active operations. The core of the proposed framework consists of a DL-based
classifier, a self-learned discriminator, and an autonomous self-labeling
model. The discriminator and self-labeling process can generate new dataset
during active operations to support classifier update. Evaluation of the
proposed framework is performed on an open dataset, i.e., ISCX VPN-nonVPN, and
independently collected data packets. The results demonstrate that the proposed
autonomous learning framework can filter packets from unknown classes and
provide accurate labels. Thus, corresponding DL-based classification models can
be updated successfully with the autonomously generated dataset.

Title: Is Deadline Oblivious Scheduling Efficient for Controlling Real-Time
  Traffic in Cellular Downlink Systems?
Authors: Sherif ElAzzouni, Eylem Ekici, Ness Shroff
Categories: cs.NI math.OC
\\
  The emergence of bandwidth-intensive latency-critical traffic in 5G Networks,
such as Virtual Reality, has motivated interest in wireless resource allocation
problems for flows with hard-deadlines. Attempting to solve this problem brings
about two challenges: (i) The flow arrival and the channel state are not known
to the Base Station (BS) apriori, thus, the allocation decisions need to be
made online. (ii) Wireless resource allocation algorithms that attempt to
maximize a reward will likely be unfair, causing unacceptable service for some
users. We model the problem as an online convex optimization problem. We
propose a primal-dual Deadline-Oblivious (DO) algorithm, and show it is
approximately 3.6-competitive. Furthermore, we show via simulations that our
algorithm tracks the prescient offline solution very closely, significantly
outperforming several existing algorithms. In the second part, we impose a
stochastic constraint on the allocation, requiring a guarantee that each user
achieves a certain timely throughput (amount of traffic delivered within the
deadline over a period of time). We propose the Long-term Fair Deadline
Oblivious (LFDO) algorithm for that setup. We combine the Lyapunov framework
with analysis of online algorithms, to show that LFDO retains the
high-performance of DO, while satisfying the long-term stochastic constraints.

Title: The HPIM-DM Multicast Routing Protocol
Authors: Pedro Oliveira, Alexandre Silva, Rui Valadas
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  This paper proposes the HPIM-DM (Hard-state Protocol Independent Multicast -
Dense Mode) multicast routing protocol. HPIM-DM is a hard-state version of
PIM-DM that keeps its main characteristics but has faster convergence and
better resilience to replay attacks. Like PIM-DM, HPIM-DM is meant for dense
networks and supports its operation on a unicast routing protocol and reverse
path forwarding checks. However, routers maintain sense of the multicast trees
at all times, allowing fast reconfiguration in the presence of network failures
or unicast route changes. This is achieved by (i) keeping information on all
upstream neighbors from which multicast data can be received, (ii) ensuring the
reliable transmission and sequencing of control messages, and (iii)
synchronizing the routing information immediately when a new router joins the
network. The protocol was fully implemented in Python, and the implementation
is publicly available. Finally, the correctness of the protocol was extensively
validated using model checking, logical reasoning and tests performed over the
protocol implementation.

Title: Enhancing Video Streaming in Vehicular Networks via Resource Slicing
Authors: Hamza Khan, Sumudu Samarakoon, and Mehdi Bennis
Categories: cs.NI

  special section of the IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology)
\\
  Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a key enabler that connects
vehicles to neighboring vehicles, infrastructure and pedestrians. In the past
few years, multimedia services have seen an enormous growth and it is expected
to increase as more devices will utilize infotainment services in the future
i.e. vehicular devices. Therefore, it is important to focus on user centric
measures i.e. quality-of-experience (QoE) such as video quality (resolution)
and fluctuations therein. In this paper, a novel joint video quality selection
and resource allocation technique is proposed for increasing the QoE of
vehicular devices. The proposed approach exploits the queuing dynamics and
channel states of vehicular devices, to maximize the QoE while ensuring
seamless video playback at the end users with high probability. The network
wide QoE maximization problem is decoupled into two subparts. First, a network
slicing based clustering algorithm is applied to partition the vehicles into
multiple logical networks. Secondly, vehicle scheduling and quality selection
is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem which is solved using the
Lyapunov drift plus penalty method. Numerical results show that the proposed
algorithm ensures high video quality experience compared to the baseline.
Simulation results also show that the proposed technique achieves low latency
and high-reliability communication.

Title: CoBeam: Beamforming-based Spectrum Sharing With Zero Cross-Technology
  Signaling for 5G Wireless Networks
Authors: Lorenzo Bertizzolo, Emrecan Demirors, Zhangyu Guan, Tommaso Melodia
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  This article studies an essential yet challenging problem in 5G wireless
networks: \emph{Is it possible to enable spectrally-efficient spectrum sharing
for heterogeneous wireless networks with different, possibly incompatible,
spectrum access technologies on the same spectrum bands; without modifying the
protocol stacks of existing wireless networks?} To answer this question, this
article explores the system challenges that need to be addressed to enable a
new spectrum sharing paradigm based on beamforming, which we refer to as {\em
CoBeam}. In CoBeam, a secondary wireless network is allowed to access a
spectrum band based on {\em cognitive beamforming} without mutual temporal
exclusion, i.e., without interrupting the ongoing transmissions of coexisting
wireless networks on the same bands; and without cross-technology
communication. We first describe the main components of CoBeam, including
\emph{programmable physical layer driver}, \emph{cognitive sensing engine}, and
\emph{beamforming engine}, and then we showcase the potential of the CoBeam
framework by designing a practical coexistence scheme between Wi-Fi and LTE on
unlicensed bands. We present a prototype of the resulting coexisting
Wi-Fi/U-LTE network built on off-the-shelf software radios based on which we
evaluate the performance of CoBeam through an extensive experimental campaign.
Performance evaluation results indicate that CoBeam can achieve on average
$169\%$ throughput gain while requiring \emph{no} signaling exchange between
the coexisting wireless networks.

Title: A Case for Data Centre Traffic Management on Software Programmable
  Ethernet Switches
Authors: Kamil Tokmakov, Mitalee Sarker, J\"org Domaschka, Stefan Wesner
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: 8th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (IEEE CloudNet
  2019)
\\
  Virtualisation first and cloud computing later has led to a consolidation of
workload in data centres that also comprises latency-sensitive application
domains such as High Performance Computing and telecommunication. These types
of applications require strict latency guarantees to maintain their Quality of
Service. In virtualised environments with their churn, this demands for
adaptability and flexibility to satisfy. At the same time, the mere scale of
the infrastructures favours commodity (Ethernet) over specialised (Infiniband)
hardware. For that purpose, this paper introduces a novel traffic management
algorithm that combines Rate-limited Strict Priority and Deficit round-robin
for latency-aware and fair scheduling respectively. In addition, we present an
implementation of this algorithm on the bmv2 P4 software switch by evaluating
it against standard priority-based and best-effort scheduling.

Title: Effective Capacity of NOMA with Finite Blocklength for Low-Latency
  Communications
Authors: Muhammad Amjad, Leila Musavian, and Sonia A\"issa
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the link-layer rate of a two-users
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network in finite blocklength (short
packet communications) regime, where the two users are paired from a set of V
users. The overall reliability consists of the transmission error probability
and the queuing delay violation probability. The performance of the two-users
NOMA network in finite blocklength is verified for achieving latency and
reliability, using the effective capacity (EC) framework. Specifically, we
derive closed-form expressions for the EC of the two-users NOMA network in
finite blocklength regime, considering transmissions over Rayleigh fading
channels. We also study a multiuser NOMA network and derive the total EC of
two-users NOMA subsets, and show that the NOMA set with users having distinct
channel conditions achieve maximum total EC. Focusing on a two-users NOMA
network, we study the impact of the transmit signal-to-noise ratio, delay
exponent, and transmission error probability, on the achievable EC of each
user. The analysis shows that when the delay exponent is high, the delay
violation probability does not improve below a certain value due to the
dominant factor of the transmission error probability. The accuracy of the
proposed closed-form expressions for the individual EC of a two-users NOMA is
verified using the Monte-Carlo simulations.

Title: MDInference: Balancing Inference Accuracy andLatency for Mobile

\\
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are allowing mobile devices to incorporate a wide
range of features into user applications. However, the computational complexity
of these models makes it difficult to run them efficiently on
resource-constrained mobile devices. Prior work has begun to approach the
problem of supporting deep learning in mobile applications by either decreasing
execution latency or utilizing powerful cloud servers. These approaches only
focus on single aspects of mobile inference and thus they often sacrifice other
aspects. In this work we introduce a holistic approach to designing mobile deep
inference frameworks. We first identify the key goals of accuracy and latency
for mobile deep inference, and the conditions that must be met to achieve them.
We demonstrate our holistic approach through the design of a hypothetical
framework called MDInference. This framework leverages two complementary
techniques; a model selection algorithm that chooses from a set of cloud-based
deep learning models to improve accuracy and an on-device request duplication
mechanism to bound latency. Through empirically-driven simulations we show that
MDInference improves aggregate accuracy over static approaches by 40% without
incurring SLA violations. Additionally, we show that with SLA = 250ms,
MDInference can increase the aggregate accuracy in 99.74% of cases on faster
university networks and 96.84% of cases on residential networks.

Title: Performance Analysis of Load Balancing Policies with Memory
Authors: Tim Hellemans and Benny Van Houdt
Categories: cs.PF
Comments: 9 pages, 3 figurs
\\
  Joining the shortest or least loaded queue among $d$ randomly selected queues
are two fundamental load balancing policies. Under both policies the dispatcher
does not maintain any information on the queue length or load of the servers.
In this paper we analyze the performance of these policies when the dispatcher
has some memory available to store the ids of some of the idle servers. We
consider methods where the dispatcher discovers idle servers as well as methods
where idle servers inform the dispatcher about their state.
  We focus on large-scale systems and our analysis uses the cavity method. The
main insight provided is that the performance measures obtained via the cavity
method for a load balancing policy with memory reduce to the performance
measures for the same policy without memory provided that the arrival rate is
properly scaled. Thus, we can study the performance of load balancers with
memory in the same manner as load balancers without memory. In particular this
entails closed form solutions for joining the shortest or least loaded queue
among $d$ randomly selected queues with memory in case of exponential job
sizes.
  We present simulation results that support our belief that the approximation
obtained by the cavity method becomes exact as the number of servers tends to
infinity.

Title: An optimal scheduling architecture for accelerating batch algorithms on
  Neural Network processor architectures
Authors: Phani Kumar Nyshadham, Mohit Sinha, Biswajit Mishra, H S Vijay
Categories: cs.PF cs.LG
Comments: 9 pages, page 7 contains the proposed example
\\
  In neural network topologies, algorithms are running on batches of data
tensors. The batches of data are typically scheduled onto the computing cores
which execute in parallel. For the algorithms running on batches of data, an
optimal batch scheduling architecture is very much needed by suitably utilizing
hardware resources - thereby resulting in significant reduction training and
inference time. In this paper, we propose to accelerate the batch algorithms
for neural networks through a scheduling architecture enabling optimal compute
power utilization. The proposed optimal scheduling architecture can be built
into HW or can be implemented in SW alone which can be leveraged for
accelerating batch algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed
architecture speeds up the batch algorithms compared to the previous solutions.
The proposed idea applies to any HPC architecture meant for neural networks.

Title: Lightweight Lexical Test Prioritization for Immediate Feedback
Authors: Toni Mattis (Hasso Plattner Institute, Germany), Robert Hirschfeld
  (HPI, University of Potsdam, Germany)
Categories: cs.PL
Journal-ref: The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020, Vol. 4,
  Issue 3, Article 12
DOI: 10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/12
\\
  The practice of unit testing enables programmers to obtain automated feedback
on whether a currently edited program is consistent with the expectations
specified in test cases. Feedback is most valuable when it happens immediately,
as defects can be corrected instantly before they become harder to fix. With
growing and longer running test suites, however, feedback is obtained less
frequently and lags behind program changes.
  The objective of test prioritization is to rank tests so that defects, if
present, are found as early as possible or with the least costs. While there
are numerous static approaches that output a ranking of tests solely based on
the current version of a program, we focus on change-based test prioritization,
which recommends tests that likely fail in response to the most recent program
change. The canonical approach relies on coverage data and prioritizes tests
that cover the changed region, but obtaining and updating coverage data is
costly. More recently, information retrieval techniques that exploit
overlapping vocabulary between change and tests have proven to be powerful, yet
lightweight.
  In this work, we demonstrate the capabilities of information retrieval for
prioritizing tests in dynamic programming languages using Python as example. We
discuss and measure previously understudied variation points, including how
contextual information around a program change can be used, and design
alternatives to the widespread \emph{TF-IDF} retrieval model tailored to
retrieving failing tests.
  To obtain program changes with associated test failures, we designed a tool
that generates a large set of faulty changes from version history along with
their test results. Using this data set, we compared existing and new lexical
prioritization strategies using four open-source Python projects, showing large
improvements over untreated and random test orders and results consistent with
related work in statically typed languages.
  We conclude that lightweight IR-based prioritization strategies are effective
tools to predict failing tests in the absence of coverage data or when static
analysis is intractable like in dynamic languages. This knowledge can benefit
both individual programmers that rely on fast feedback, as well as operators of
continuous integration infrastructure, where resources can be freed sooner by
detecting defects earlier in the build cycle.

Title: Sthread: In-Vivo Model Checking of Multithreaded Programs
Authors: Gene Cooperman (Northeastern University, United States), Martin

Categories: cs.PL
Journal-ref: The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020, Vol. 4,

DOI: 10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/13
\\
  This work strives to make formal verification of POSIX multithreaded programs
easily accessible to general programmers. Sthread operates directly on
multithreaded C/C++ programs, without the need for an intermediate formal
model. Sthread is in-vivo in that it provides a drop-in replacement for the
pthread library, and operates directly on the compiled target executable and
application libraries. There is no compiler-generated intermediate
representation. The system calls in the application remain unaltered.
Optionally, the programmer can add a small amount of additional native C code
to include assertions based on the user's algorithm, declarations of shared
memory regions, and progress/liveness conditions. The work has two important
motivations: (i) It can be used to verify correctness of a concurrent algorithm
being implemented with multithreading; and (ii) it can also be used
pedagogically to provide immediate feedback to students learning either to
employ POSIX threads system calls or to implement multithreaded algorithms.
  This work represents the first example of in-vivo model checking operating
directly on the standard multithreaded executable and its libraries, without
the aid of a compiler-generated intermediate representation. Sthread leverages
the open-source SimGrid libraries, and will eventually be integrated into
SimGrid. Sthread employs a non-preemptive model in which thread context
switches occur only at multithreaded system calls (e.g., mutex, semaphore) or
before accesses to shared memory regions. The emphasis is on finding
"algorithmic bugs" (bugs in an original algorithm, implemented as POSIX threads
and shared memory regions. This work is in contrast to Context-Bounded Analysis
(CBA), which assumes a preemptive model for threads, and emphasizes
implementation bugs such as buffer overruns and write-after-free for memory
allocation. In particular, the Sthread in-vivo approach has strong future
potential for pedagogy, by providing immediate feedback to students who are
first learning the correct use of Pthreads system calls in implementation of
concurrent algorithms based on multithreading.

Title: Fractional Types: Expressive and Safe Space Management for Ancilla Bits

Categories: cs.PL cs.LO
Comments: For the agda formalization, see

ACM-class: F.1.1; F.3.2; D.3.2
\\
  In reversible computing, the management of space is subject to two broad
classes of constraints. First, as with general-purpose computation, every
allocation must be paired with a matching de-allocation. Second, space can only
be safely de-allocated if its contents are restored to their initial value from
allocation time. Generally speaking, the state of the art provides limited
partial solutions that address the first constraint by imposing a stack
discipline and by leaving the second constraint to programmers' assertions. We
propose a novel approach based on the idea of fractional types. As a simple
intuitive example, allocation of a new boolean value initialized to
$\texttt{false}$ also creates a value $1/{\texttt{false}}$ that can be thought
of as a garbage collection (GC) process specialized to reclaim, and only
reclaim, storage containing the value $\texttt{false}$. This GC process is a
first-class entity that can be manipulated, decomposed into smaller processes
and combined with other GC processes. We formalize this idea in the context of
a reversible language founded on type isomorphisms, prove its fundamental
correctness properties, and illustrate its expressiveness using a wide variety
of examples. The development is backed by a fully-formalized Agda
implementation.

Title: 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs: Actionable Spatial Perception with Places,
  Objects, and Humans
Authors: Antoni Rosinol, Arjun Gupta, Marcus Abate, Jingnan Shi, Luca Carlone
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV
Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We present a unified representation for actionable spatial perception: 3D
Dynamic Scene Graphs. Scene graphs are directed graphs where nodes represent
entities in the scene (e.g. objects, walls, rooms), and edges represent
relations (e.g. inclusion, adjacency) among nodes. Dynamic scene graphs (DSGs)
extend this notion to represent dynamic scenes with moving agents (e.g. humans,
robots), and to include actionable information that supports planning and
decision-making (e.g. spatio-temporal relations, topology at different levels
of abstraction). Our second contribution is to provide the first fully
automatic Spatial PerceptIon eNgine(SPIN) to build a DSG from visual-inertial
data. We integrate state-of-the-art techniques for object and human detection
and pose estimation, and we describe how to robustly infer object, robot, and
human nodes in crowded scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
paper that reconciles visual-inertial SLAM and dense human mesh tracking.
Moreover, we provide algorithms to obtain hierarchical representations of
indoor environments (e.g. places, structures, rooms) and their relations. Our
third contribution is to demonstrate the proposed spatial perception engine in
a photo-realistic Unity-based simulator, where we assess its robustness and
expressiveness. Finally, we discuss the implications of our proposal on modern
robotics applications. 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs can have a profound impact on
planning and decision-making, human-robot interaction, long-term autonomy, and
scene prediction. A video abstract is available at https://youtu.be/SWbofjhyPzI

\\
  Recent advances in depth-sensing have significantly increased accuracy,
resolution, and frame rate, as shown in the 1920x1200 resolution and 13 frames
per second Zivid RGBD camera. In this study, we explore the potential of depth
sensing for efficient and reliable automation of surgical subtasks. We consider
a monochrome (all red) version of the peg transfer task from the Fundamentals
of Laparoscopic Surgery training suite implemented with the da Vinci Research
Kit (dVRK). We use calibration techniques that allow the imprecise,
cable-driven da Vinci to reduce error from 4-5 mm to 1-2 mm in the task space.
We report experimental results for a handover-free version of the peg transfer
task, performing 20 and 5 physical episodes with single- and bilateral-arm
setups, respectively. Results over 236 and 49 total block transfer attempts for
the single- and bilateral-arm peg transfer cases suggest that reliability can

Title: Map-less Navigation: A Single DRL-based Controller for Robots with
  Varied Dimensions
Authors: Wei Zhang, Yunfeng Zhang, and Ning Liu
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages, 14 figures
MSC-class: 68T40
\\
  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential in training
control agents for map-less robot navigation. However, the trained agents are
generally dependent on the employed robot in training or dimension-specific,
which cannot be directly reused by robots with different dimensional
configurations. To address this issue, a novel DRL-based robot navigation
method is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach trains a meta-robot
with DRL and then transfers the meta-skill to a robot with a different
dimensional configuration (named dimension-scaled robot) using a method named
dimension-variable skill transfer (DVST), referred to as DRL-DVST. During the
training phase, the meta-agent learns to perform self-navigation with the
meta-robot in a simulation environment. In the skill-transfer phase, the
observations of the dimension-scaled robot are transferred to the meta-agent in
a scaled manner, and the control policy generated by the meta-agent is scaled
back to the dimension-scaled robot. Simulation and real-world experimental
results indicate that robots with different sizes and angular velocity bounds
can accomplish navigation tasks in unknown and dynamic environments without any
retraining. This work greatly extends the application range of DRL-based
navigation methods from the fixed dimensional configuration to varied
dimensional configurations.

Title: Learning Pregrasp Manipulation of Objects from Ungraspable Poses
Authors: Zhaole Sun, Kai Yuan, Wenbin Hu, Chuanyu Yang, and Zhibin Li
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 8 pages open access version for ICRA2020 6 pages acceptance paper
\\
  In robotic grasping, objects are often occluded in ungraspable configurations
such that no pregrasp pose can be found, eg large flat boxes on the table that
can only be grasped from the side. Inspired by humans' bimanual manipulation,
eg one hand to lift up things and the other to grasp, we address this type of
problems by introducing pregrasp manipulation - push and lift actions. We
propose a model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning framework to train control
policies that utilize visual information and proprioceptive states of the robot
to autonomously discover robust pregrasp manipulation. The robot arm learns to
first push the object towards a support surface and establishes a pivot to lift
up one side of the object, thus creating a clearance between the object and the
table for possible grasping solutions. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness
of our proposed learning framework in training robust pregrasp policies that
can directly transfer from simulation to real hardware through suitable design
of training procedures, state, and action space. Lastly, we evaluate the
effectiveness and the generalisation ability of the learned policies in
real-world experiments, and demonstrate pregrasp manipulation of objects with
various size, shape, weight, and surface friction.

\\
  Path planning is an active area of research essential for many applications
in robotics. Popular techniques include graph-based searches and sampling-based
planners. These approaches are powerful but have limitations. This paper
continues work to combine their strengths and mitigate their limitations using
a unified planning paradigm. It does this by viewing the path planning problem
as the two subproblems of search and approximation and using advanced
graph-search techniques on a sampling-based approximation. This perspective
leads to Advanced BIT*. ABIT* combines truncated anytime graph-based searches,
such as ATD*, with anytime almost-surely asymptotically optimal sampling-based
planners, such as RRT*. This allows it to quickly find initial solutions and
then converge towards the optimum in an anytime manner. ABIT* outperforms
existing single-query, sampling-based planners on the tested problems in
$\mathbb{R}^{4}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{8}$, and was demonstrated on real-world
problems with NASA/JPL-Caltech.

  Safe and precise reference tracking is a crucial characteristic of MAVs that
have to operate under the influence of external disturbances in cluttered
environments. In this paper, we present a NMPC that exploits the fully physics
based non-linear dynamics of the system. We furthermore show how the moment and
thrust control inputs can be transformed into feasible actuator commands. In
order to guarantee safe operation despite potential loss of a motor under which
we show our system keeps operating safely, we developed an EKF based motor
failure identification algorithm. We verify the effectiveness of the developed
pipeline in flight experiments with and without motor failures.

Title: Adaptively Informed Trees (AIT*): Fast Asymptotically Optimal Path
  Planning through Adaptive Heuristics
Authors: Marlin P. Strub and Jonathan D. Gammell

  6 + 2 pages, 5 figures, video available at https://youtu.be/twM723QM9TQ
\\
  Informed sampling-based planning algorithms exploit problem knowledge for
better search performance. This knowledge is often expressed as heuristic
estimates of solution cost and used to order the search. The practical
improvement of this informed search depends on the accuracy of the heuristic.
  Selecting an appropriate heuristic is difficult. Heuristics applicable to an
entire problem domain are often simple to define and inexpensive to evaluate
but may not be beneficial for a specific problem instance. Heuristics specific
to a problem instance are often difficult to define or expensive to evaluate
but can make the search itself trivial.
  This paper presents Adaptively Informed Trees (AIT*), an almost-surely
asymptotically optimal sampling-based planner based on BIT*. AIT* adapts its
search to each problem instance by using an asymmetric bidirectional search to
simultaneously estimate and exploit a problem-specific heuristic. This allows
it to quickly find initial solutions and converge towards the optimum. AIT*
solves the tested problems as fast as RRT-Connect while also converging towards
the optimum.

Comments: Video: https://youtu.be/LKFDB_BOhl0
\\
  Dynamic traversal of uneven terrain is a major objective in the field of
legged robotics. The most recent model predictive control approaches for these
systems can generate robust dynamic motion of short duration; however, planning
over a longer time horizon may be necessary when navigating complex terrain. A
recently-developed framework, Trajectory Optimization for Walking Robots
(TOWR), computes such plans but does not guarantee their reliability on real
platforms, under uncertainty and perturbations. We extend TOWR with analytical
costs to generate trajectories that a state-of-the-art whole-body tracking
controller can successfully execute. To reduce online computation time, we
implement a learning-based scheme for initialization of the nonlinear program
based on offline experience. The execution of trajectories as long as 16
footsteps and 5.5 s over different terrains by a real quadruped demonstrates
the effectiveness of the approach on hardware. This work builds toward an
online system which can efficiently and robustly replan dynamic trajectories.

Title: On sensing-aware model predictive path-following control for a reversing
  general 2-trailer with a car-like tractor
Authors: Oskar Ljungqvist, Daniel Axehill and Henrik Pettersson
Categories: cs.RO math.OC
Comments: IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2020
\\
  The design of reliable path-following controllers is a key ingredient for
successful deployment of self-driving vehicles. This controller-design problem
is especially challenging for a general 2-trailer with a car-like tractor due
to the vehicle's structurally unstable joint-angle kinematics in backward
motion and the car-like tractor's curvature limitations which can cause the
vehicle segments to fold and enter a jackknife state. Furthermore, optical
sensors with a limited field of view have been proposed to solve the
joint-angle estimation problem online, which introduce additional restrictions
on which vehicle states that can be reliably estimated. To incorporate these
restrictions at the level of control, a model predictive path-following
controller is proposed. By taking the vehicle's physical and sensing
limitations into account, it is shown in real-world experiments that the
performance of the proposed path-following controller in terms of suppressing
disturbances and recovering from non-trivial initial states is significantly
improved compared to a previously proposed solution where the constraints have
been neglected.

Title: A Robust Model-Based Biped Locomotion Framework Based on Three-Mass
  Model: From Planning to Control
Authors: Mohammadreza Kasaei, Ali Ahmadi, Nuno Lau, Artur Pereira
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Biped robots are inherently unstable because of their complex kinematics as
well as dynamics. Despite types of research in developing biped locomotion, the
performance of biped locomotion is still far from the expectations.
  This paper proposes a model-based framework to generate stable biped
locomotion. The core of this framework is an abstract dynamics model which is
composed of three masses to consider the dynamics of stance leg, torso and
swing leg for minimizing the tracking problems. According to this dynamics
model, we propose a modular walking reference trajectories planner which takes
into account obstacles to plan all the references. Moreover, this dynamics
model is used to formulate the low-level controller as a Model Predictive
Control~(MPC) scheme which can consider some constraints in the states of the
system, inputs, outputs and also mixed input-output.
  The performance and the robustness of the proposed framework are validated by
performing several simulations using~\mbox{MATLAB}. The simulation results show
that the proposed framework is capable of generating the biped locomotion
robustly.

Title: A divide-and-conquer algorithm for computing Gr\"obner bases of syzygies
  in finite dimension
Authors: Simone Naldi and Vincent Neiger
Categories: cs.SC
\\
  Let $f_1,\ldots,f_m$ be elements in a quotient $R^n / N$ which has finite
dimension as a $K$-vector space, where $R = K[X_1,\ldots,X_r]$ and $N$ is an
$R$-submodule of $R^n$. We address the problem of computing a Gr\"obner basis
of the module of syzygies of $(f_1,\ldots,f_m)$, that is, of vectors
$(p_1,\ldots,p_m) \in R^m$ such that $p_1 f_1 + \cdots + p_m f_m = 0$.
  An iterative algorithm for this problem was given by Marinari, M\"oller, and
Mora (1993) using a dual representation of $R^n / N$ as the kernel of a
collection of linear functionals. Following this viewpoint, we design a
divide-and-conquer algorithm, which can be interpreted as a generalization to
several variables of Beckermann and Labahn's recursive approach for matrix
Pad\'e and rational interpolation problems in univariate contexts. To highlight
the interest of this method, we focus on the specific case of bivariate Pad\'e
approximation and show that it improves upon the best known complexity bounds.

Title: Many-to-Many Voice Conversion using Conditional Cycle-Consistent
  Adversarial Networks
Authors: Shindong Lee, BongGu Ko, Keonnyeong Lee, In-Chul Yoo, and Dongsuk Yook
Categories: cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS
\\
  Voice conversion (VC) refers to transforming the speaker characteristics of
an utterance without altering its linguistic contents. Many works on voice
conversion require to have parallel training data that is highly expensive to
acquire. Recently, the cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN), which
does not require parallel training data, has been applied to voice conversion,
showing the state-of-the-art performance. The CycleGAN based voice conversion,
however, can be used only for a pair of speakers, i.e., one-to-one voice
conversion between two speakers. In this paper, we extend the CycleGAN by
conditioning the network on speakers. As a result, the proposed method can
perform many-to-many voice conversion among multiple speakers using a single
generative adversarial network (GAN). Compared to building multiple CycleGANs
for each pair of speakers, the proposed method reduces the computational and
spatial cost significantly without compromising the sound quality of the
converted voice. Experimental results using the VCC2018 corpus confirm the
efficiency of the proposed method.

Title: Interactive Text-to-Speech via Semi-supervised Style Transfer Learning

Comments: Version 0
\\
  With increasing interests in interactive speech systems, speech emotion
recognition and multi-style text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis are becoming
increasingly important research areas. In this paper, we combine both. We
present a method to extract speech style embed-dings from input speech queries
and apply this embedding as conditional input to a TTS voice so that the TTS
response matches the speaking style of the input query. Specifically, we first
train a multi-modal style classification model using acoustic and textual
features of speech utterances. Due to a limited amount of labeled data, we
combined the emotional recognition dataset: the interactive emotional dyadic
motion capture database (IEMOCAP) with a small labeled subset of our internal
TTS dataset for style model training. We take the softmax layer from the style
classifier as style embedding and then apply this style embedding extraction
model to generate soft style labels for our unlabelled internal TTS dataset.
With this semi-supervised approach, reliable style embeddings are extracted to
train a multi-style TTS system. As a result, we developed a controllable
multi-style TTS system whose response matches the given target styles
embedding, which could be extracted from the input query or manually assigned.

Title: Lifter Training and Sub-band Modeling for Computationally Efficient and
  High-Quality Voice Conversion Using Spectral Differentials
Authors: Takaaki Saeki, Yuki Saito, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Categories: cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: 5 pages, to appear in IEEE International Conference on Acoustics,
  Speech, and Signal Processing 2020 (ICASSP 2020)
\\
  In this paper, we propose computationally efficient and high-quality methods
for statistical voice conversion (VC) with direct waveform modification based
on spectral differentials. The conventional method with a minimum-phase filter
achieves high-quality conversion but requires heavy computation in filtering.
This is because the minimum phase using a fixed lifter of the Hilbert transform
often results in a long-tap filter. One of our methods is a data-driven method
for lifter training. Since this method takes filter truncation into account in
training, it can shorten the tap length of the filter while preserving
conversion accuracy. Our other method is sub-band processing for extending the
conventional method from narrow-band (16 kHz) to full-band (48 kHz) VC, which
can convert a full-band waveform with higher converted-speech quality.
Experimental results indicate that 1) the proposed lifter-training method for
narrow-band VC can shorten the tap length to 1/16 without degrading the
converted-speech quality and 2) the proposed sub-band-processing method for
full-band VC can improve the converted-speech quality than the conventional
method.

Title: Addressing the confounds of accompaniments in singer identification
Authors: Tsung-Han Hsieh, Kai-Hsiang Cheng, Zhe-Cheng Fan, Yu-Ching Yang,
  Yi-Hsuan Yang
Categories: cs.SD cs.LG cs.MM eess.AS
\\
  Identifying singers is an important task with many applications. However, the
task remains challenging due to many issues. One major issue is related to the
confounding factors from the background instrumental music that is mixed with
the vocals in music production. A singer identification model may learn to
extract non-vocal related features from the instrumental part of the songs, if
a singer only sings in certain musical contexts (e.g., genres). The model
cannot therefore generalize well when the singer sings in unseen contexts. In
this paper, we attempt to address this issue. Specifically, we employ
open-unmix, an open source tool with state-of-the-art performance in source
separation, to separate the vocal and instrumental tracks of music. We then
investigate two means to train a singer identification model: by learning from
the separated vocal only, or from an augmented set of data where we
"shuffle-and-remix" the separated vocal tracks and instrumental tracks of
different songs to artificially make the singers sing in different contexts. We
also incorporate melodic features learned from the vocal melody contour for
better performance. Evaluation results on a benchmark dataset called the
artist20 shows that this data augmentation method greatly improves the accuracy
of singer identification.

parameter-sharing, while still allowing for instrument-specific
parameterization. Meta-TasNet is shown to be more effective than the models
trained independently or in a multi-task setting, and achieve performance
comparable with state-of-the-art methods. In comparison to the latter, our
extractors contain fewer parameters and have faster run-time performance. We
discuss important architectural considerations, and explore the costs and

Title: Recommendation of Move Method Refactoring Using Path-Based
  Representation of Code
Authors: Zarina Kurbatova, Ivan Veselov, Yaroslav Golubev, Timofey Bryksin
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Software refactoring plays an important role in increasing code quality. One
of the most popular refactoring types is the Move Method refactoring. It is
usually applied when a method depends more on members of other classes than on
its own original class. Several approaches have been proposed to recommend Move
Method refactoring automatically. Most of them are based on heuristics and have
certain limitations (e.g., they depend on the selection of metrics and
manually-defined thresholds). In this paper, we propose an approach to
recommend Move Method refactoring based on a path-based representation of code
called code2vec that is able to capture the syntactic structure and semantic
information of a code fragment. We use this code representation to train a
machine learning classifier suggesting to move methods to more appropriate
classes. We evaluate the approach on two publicly available datasets: a
manually compiled dataset of well-known open-source projects and a synthetic
dataset with automatically injected code smell instances. The results show that
our approach is capable of recommending accurate refactoring opportunities and
outperforms JDeodorant and JMove, which are state of the art tools in this
field.

\\
  Studies indicate that much of the software created today is not accessible to
all users, indicating that developers don't see the need to devote sufficient
resources to creating accessible software. Compounding this problem, there is a
lack of robust, easily adoptable educational accessibility material available
to instructors for inclusion in their curricula. To address these issues, we
have created five Accessibility Learning Labs (ALL) using an experiential
learning structure. The labs are designed to educate and create awareness of
accessibility needs in computing. The labs enable easy classroom integration by
providing instructors with complete educational materials including lecture
slides, activities, and quizzes. The labs are hosted on our servers and require
only a browser to be utilized.
  To demonstrate the benefit of our material and the potential benefits of our
experiential lab format with empathy-creating material, we conducted a study
involving 276 students in ten sections of an introductory computing course. Our
findings include: (I) The demonstrated potential of the proposed experiential
learning format and labs are effective in motivating and educating students
about the importance of accessibility (II) The labs are effective in informing
students about foundational accessibility topics (III) Empathy-creating
material is demonstrated to be a beneficial component in computing
accessibility education, supporting students in placing a higher value on the
importance of creating accessible software. Created labs and project materials
are publicly available on the project website: http://all.rit.edu

Title: GDPR Compliance in the Context of Continuous Integration
Authors: Ze Shi Li, Colin Werner, Neil Ernst, and Daniela Damian
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: Manuscript submitted for publication, 14 pages
\\
  The enactment of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018 forced
any organization that collects and/or processes EU-based personal data to
comply with stringent privacy regulations. Software organizations have
struggled to achieve GDPR compliance both before and after the GDPR deadline.
While some studies have relied on surveys or interviews to find general
implications of the GDPR, there is a lack of in-depth studies that investigate
compliance practices and compliance challenges of software organizations. In
particular, there is no information on small and medium enterprises (SMEs),
which represent the majority of organizations in the EU, nor on organizations
that practice continuous integration. Using design science methodology, we
conducted an in-depth study over the span of 20 months regarding GDPR
compliance practices and challenges in collaboration with a small, startup
organization. We first identified our collaborator's business problems and then
iteratively developed two artifacts to address those problems: a set of
operationalized GDPR principles, and an automated GDPR tool that tests those
GDPR-derived privacy requirements. This design science approach resulted in
four implications for research and for practice. For example, our research
reveals that GDPR regulations can be partially operationalized and tested
through automated means, which improves compliance practices, but more research
is needed to create more efficient and effective means to disseminate and
manage GDPR knowledge among software developers.

Title: On the Relationship between Software Complexity and Security
Authors: Mamdouh Alenezi and Mohammad Zarour
Categories: cs.SE cs.CR

  (IJSEA), Vol.11, No.1, January 2020
\\
  This work aims at discussing the complexity aspect of software while
demonstrating its relationship with security. Complexity is an essential part
of software; however, numerous studies indicate that they increase the
vulnerability of the software systems and introduce bugs in the program. Many
developers face difficulty when trying to understand the complex components of
software. Complexity in software increases when objects in the software are
used to design a more complex object while creating a hierarchical complexity
in the system. However, it is necessary for the developers to strive for
minimum complexity, as increased complexity introduces security risks in the
software, which can cause severe monetary and reputational damage to a
government or a private organization. It even causes bodily harm to human
beings with various examples found in previous years where security breaches
led to severe consequences. Hence it is vital to maintain low complexity and
simple design of structure. Various developers tend to introduce deliberate
complexities in the system so that they do not have to write the same program
twice; however, it is getting problematic for the software organizations as the
demands of security are continually increasing.

Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis in Persian Social

\\
  With the social media engagement on the rise, the resulting data can be used
as a rich resource for analyzing and understanding different phenomena around
us. A sentiment analysis system employs these data to find the attitude of
social media users towards certain entities in a given document. In this paper
we propose a sentiment analysis method for Persian text using Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN), a feedforward Artificial Neural Network, that categorize
sentences into two and five classes (considering their intensity) by applying a
layer of convolution over input data through different filters. We evaluated
the method on three different datasets of Persian social media texts using Area
under Curve metric. The final results show the advantage of using CNN over
earlier attempts at developing traditional machine learning methods for Persian
texts sentiment classification especially for short texts.

Title: It is not just about the Melody: How Europe Votes for its Favorite Songs
Authors: Anej Svete and Jakob Hostnik
Categories: cs.SI
\\
  The Eurovision Song Contest is a popular annual international song
competition organized by the European Broadcasting Union. The winner is decided
by the audience and expert juries from each participating nation, which is why
the analysis of its voting network offers a great insight into what factors,
besides the quality of the performances, influence the voting decisions.
  In this paper, we present the findings of the analysis of the voting network,
together with the results of a predictive model based on the collected data. We
touch upon the methodology used and describe the dataset we carry the analysis
on. The results include some general features of the voting networks, the
exposed communities of countries that award significantly more points among
themselves than would be expected and some predictions on what the biggest
factors that lead to this phenomenon are. We also include the model to predict
the votes based on network structure of both previous votes and song
preferences of nations, which we found not to offer much improved predictions
than relying on the betting tables alone.

Title: Modeling Citation Trajectories of Scientific Papers
Authors: Dattatreya Mohapatra, Siddharth Pal, Soham De, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,

Categories: cs.SI
\\
  Several network growth models have been proposed in the literature that
attempt to incorporate properties of citation networks. Generally, these models
aim at retaining the degree distribution observed in real-world networks. In
this work, we explore whether existing network growth models can realize the
diversity in citation growth exhibited by individual papers - a new
node-centric property observed recently in citation networks across multiple
domains of research. We theoretically and empirically show that the network
growth models which are solely based on degree and/or intrinsic fitness cannot
realize certain temporal growth behaviors that are observed in real-world
citation networks. To this end, we propose two new growth models that localize
the influence of papers through an appropriate attachment mechanism.
Experimental results on the real-world citation networks of Computer Science
and Physics domains show that our proposed models can better explain the
temporal behavior of citation networks than existing models.

Title: Predicting event attendance exploring social influence
Authors: Fatemeh Salehi Rizi, Michael Granitzer
Categories: cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML
DOI: 10.1145/3297280.3297622
\\
  The problem of predicting people's participation in real-world events has
received considerable attention as it offers valuable insights for human
behavior analysis and event-related advertisement. Today social networks (e.g.
Twitter) widely reflect large popular events where people discuss their
interest with friends. Event participants usually stimulate friends to join the
event which propagates a social influence in the network. In this paper, we
propose to model the social influence of friends on event attendance. We
consider non-geotagged posts besides structures of social groups to infer
users' attendance. To leverage the information on network topology we apply
some of recent graph embedding techniques such as node2vec, HARP and Poincar`e.
We describe the approach followed to design the feature space and feed it to a
neural network. The performance evaluation is conducted using two large music
festivals datasets, namely the VFestival and Creamfields. The experimental
results show that our classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline with
89% accuracy observed for the VFestival dataset.

Title: Global and Local Feature Learning for Ego-Network Analysis
Authors: Fatemeh Salehi Rizi, Michael Granitzer, Konstantin Ziegler
Categories: cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML
DOI: 10.1109/DEXA.2017.36
\\
  In an ego-network, an individual (ego) organizes its friends (alters) in
different groups (social circles). This social network can be efficiently
analyzed after learning representations of the ego and its alters in a
low-dimensional, real vector space. These representations are then easily
exploited via statistical models for tasks such as social circle detection and
prediction. Recent advances in language modeling via deep learning have
inspired new methods for learning network representations. These methods can
capture the global structure of networks. In this paper, we evolve these
techniques to also encode the local structure of neighborhoods. Therefore, our
local representations capture network features that are hidden in the global
representation of large networks. We show that the task of social circle
prediction benefits from a combination of global and local features generated
by our technique.

  In this work, we propose an automatic evaluation and comparison of the
browsing behavior of Wikipedia readers that can be applied to any language
editions of Wikipedia. As an example, we focus on English, French, and Russian
languages during the last four months of 2018. The proposed method has three
steps. Firstly, it extracts the most trending articles over a chosen period of
time. Secondly, it performs a semi-supervised topic extraction and thirdly, it
compares topics across languages. The automated processing works with the data
that combines Wikipedia's graph of hyperlinks, pageview statistics and
summaries of the pages.
  The results show that people share a common interest and curiosity for
entertainment, e.g. movies, music, sports independently of their language.
Differences appear in topics related to local events or about cultural
particularities. Interactive visualizations showing clusters of trending pages
in each language edition are available online

Title: A Fast Counting Method for 6-motifs with Low Connectivity
Authors: Taha Sevim, Muhammet Sel\c{c}uk G\"uvel, and Lale \"Ozkahya
Categories: cs.SI cs.DS
\\
  A $k$-motif (or graphlet) is a subgraph on $k$ nodes in a graph or network.
Counting of motifs in complex networks has been a well-studied problem in
network analysis of various real-word graphs arising from the study of social
networks and bioinformatics. In particular, the triangle counting problem has
received much attention due to its significance in understanding the behavior
of social networks. Similarly, subgraphs with more than 3 nodes have received
much attention recently. While there have been successful methods developed on
this problem, most of the existing algorithms are not scalable to large
networks with millions of nodes and edges.
  The main contribution of this paper is a preliminary study that genaralizes
the exact counting algorithm provided by Pinar, Seshadhri and Vishal to a
collection of 6-motifs. This method uses the counts of motifs with smaller size
to obtain the counts of 6-motifs with low connecivity, that is, containing a
cut-vertex or a cut-edge. Therefore, it circumvents the combinatorial explosion
that naturally arises when counting subgraphs in large networks.

Title: Scalable Dyadic Independence Models with Local and Global Constraints
Authors: Florian Adriaens, Alexandru Mara, Jefrey Lijffijt, Tijl De Bie
Categories: cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  An important challenge in the field of exponential random graphs (ERGs) is
the fitting of non-trivial ERGs on large networks. By utilizing matrix
block-approximation techniques, we propose an approximative framework to such
non-trivial ERGs that result in dyadic independence (i.e., edge independent)
models, while being able to meaningfully model local information (degrees) as
well as global information (clustering coefficient, assortativity, etc.) if
desired. This allows one to efficiently generate random networks with similar
properties as an observed network, scalable up to sparse graphs consisting of
millions of nodes. Empirical evaluation demonstrates its competitiveness in
terms of accuracy with state-of-the-art methods for link prediction and network
reconstruction.

Title: Optimal Participation of Price-Maker Battery Energy Storage Systems
  (BESSs) in Energy, Reserve and Pay as Performance Regulation Markets
Authors: Reza Khalilisenobari and Meng Wu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Motivated by the need of assessing the optimal allocation of battery energy
storage services across various markets and the corresponding impact on market
operations, an optimization framework is proposed in this work to coordinate
the operation of an independent utility-scale price-maker battery energy
storage system (BESS) in the energy, spinning reserve and performance-based
regulation markets. The entire problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization
process, where the structure of all markets is modeled considering the joint
operation limits. The strategic bidding behavior of a price-maker BESS in a pay
as performance regulation market is investigated. Additionally, a specific
approach is introduced for modeling automatic generation control (AGC) signals
in the optimization. Although the formulated problem is non-linear, it is
converted to mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to find the optimum
solution. The proposed framework is evaluated using test case scenarios created
from real-world market data. Case study results show the impact of BESS's
price-making behavior on the joint operation of energy, reserve, and regulation
markets.

\\
  The real-time statistics on key consumer parameters and key utility
parameters earmark the implementation of demand response (DR) under the smart
grid (SG) paradigm. Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) enables monitoring
and control over both key parameters to reflect reliable information on SG.
Firstly, this paper aims at a physical realization of an AMI, which comprises a
meter data management system (MDMS) supported by smart meters. Secondly, a
sliding window based non-intrusive load monitoring algorithm is proposed to
illustrate the power consumption pattern. The MDMS features an incremental
block--rate tariff structure given by Tamil Nadu state electricity board for
the estimation and prediction of electricity bill. Finally, an implementation
perspective is presented describing the features of its constituents both
theoretically and experimentally, which could envision a consumer-facing grid
and exert the proposed self--DR scheme.

Title: An IoT-Based System: Big Urban Traffic Data Mining Through Airborne
  Pollutant Gases Analysis

Categories: eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY
\\
  Nowadays, in developing countries including Iran, the number of vehicles is
increasing due to growing population. This has recently led to waste time
getting stuck in traffic, take more time for daily commute, and increase
accidents. So it is necessary to control traffic congestion by traffic police
officers, expand paths efficiently and choose the best way for decreasing the
traffic by citizens. Therefore, it is important to have the knowledge of
instant traffic in each lane. Todays, many traffic organization services such
as traffic police officer and urban traffic control system use traffic cameras,
inductive sensors, satellite images, radar sensors, ultrasonic technology and
radio-frequency identification (RFID) for urban traffic diagnosis. But this
method has some problems such as inefficiency in heavy traffic influenced by
condition of the air and inability to detect parallel traffic. Our method
suggested in this article detects traffic congestion based on IOT containing a
smart system that gives us traffic congestion by calculating the air pollution
amount in that area. According to conducted experiment, the results were
satisfied.

  Motivated by the potentially high downlink traffic demands of commuters in
future autonomous vehicles, we study a network architecture where vehicles use
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) links to form relay network clusters, which in turn
use Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) links to connect to one or more Road Side
Units (RSUs). Such cluster-based multihoming offers improved performance, e.g.,
in coverage and per user shared rate, but depends on the penetration of V2V-V2I
capable vehicles and possible blockage, by legacy vehicles, of line of sight
based V2V links, such as those based on millimeter-wave and visible light
technologies. This paper provides a performance analysis of a typical vehicle's
connectivity and throughput on a highway in the free-flow regime, exploring its
dependence on vehicle density, sensitivity to blockages, number of lanes and
heterogeneity across lanes. The results show that, even with moderate vehicle
densities and penetration of V2V-V2I capable vehicles, such architectures can
achieve substantial improvements in connectivity and reduction in per-user rate
variability as compared to V2I based networks. The typical vehicle's
performance is also shown to improve considerably in the multilane highway
setting as compared to a single lane road. This paper also sheds light on how
the network performance is affected when vehicles can control their relative
positions, by characterizing the connectivity-throughput tradeoff faced by the
clusters of vehicles.

Title: Compositional Synthesis via a Convex Parameterization of

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
DOI: 10.1145/3365365.3382212
\\
  We develop an assume-guarantee framework for control of large scale linear
(time-varying) systems from finite-time reach and avoid or infinite-time
invariance specifications. The contracts describe the admissible set of states
and controls for individual subsystems. A set of contracts compose correctly if
mutual assumptions and guarantees match in a way that we formalize. We propose
a rich parameterization of contracts such that the set of parameters that
compose correctly is convex. Moreover, we design a potential function of
parameters that describes the distance of contracts from a correct composition.
Thus, the verification and synthesis for the aggregate system are broken to
solving small convex programs for individual subsystems, where correctness is
ultimately achieved in a compositional way. Illustrative examples demonstrate
the scalability of our method.

Title: Circumnavigating a Moving Target with Range-only Measurements
Authors: Fei Dong and Keyou You and Lihua Xie
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 12pages,15 figures
\\
  This paper designs a novel coordinate-free controller for an underactuated
pursuer to circumnavigate a fully actuated target with range-only measurements.
If the range rate is further available, the controller has a simple PD-like
form with a bias to eliminate steady-state circumnavigating error. In
particular, such a controller drives the circumnavigating error to zero with an
exponential convergence speed if the target is stationary, and otherwise to a
small region whose size is explicitly proportional to the maximum speed and
acceleration of the moving target. To access the range rate, we design a
second-order sliding mode (SOSM) filter and show that the SOSM filter can
exactly recover the range rate in a finite time. Thus, the above convergence
results can be easily achieved even without the explicit range rate. Finally,
the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed controller are validated via
simulations.

Title: Fully Distributed Resilient State Estimation based on Distributed Median
  Solver
Authors: Jin Gyu Lee and Junsoo Kim and Hyungbo Shim
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In this paper, we present a scheme of fully distributed resilient state
estimation for linear dynamical systems under sensor attacks. The proposed
state observer consists of a network of local observers, where each of them
utilizes local measurements and information transmitted from the neighbors. As
a fully distributed scheme, it does not necessarily collect a majority of
sensing data for the sake of attack identification, while the compromised
sensors are eventually identified by the distributed network and excluded from
the observers. For this, the overall network (not the individual local
observer) is assumed to have redundant sensors and assumed to be connected. The
proposed scheme is based on a novel design of a distributed median solver,
which approximately recovers the median value of local estimates.

  The study of multiplicative noise models has a long history in control theory
but is re-emerging in the context of complex networked systems and systems with

exploratory input signals along with a least-squares algorithm to
simultaneously estimate nominal system parameters and multiplicative noise
covariance matrices. The asymptotic consistency of the least-squares estimator
is demonstrated by analyzing first and second moment dynamics of the system.
The results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

Title: Electrical Machines Fault Detection through Frequency Response Analysis

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Remarkable performance of the Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) technique in
transformers' fault detection, structural similarity between transformers and
electrical machines, and the importance of machines' condition monitoring are
the main reasons for studying FRA in the electrical machines. In this paper,
the application of the FRA method for electrical machines fault detection is
investigated by experimental tests on a three-phase wound-rotor asynchronous
machine. First, the effect of the rotor position on the sound and defective
stator frequency responses is assessed under different circuit connections.
Second, the applicability of the FRA for detection of the stator inter-turn and
phase to phase short-circuit faults and insulation weaknesses is evaluated by
considering fault resistance, location, and severity. Third, the best circuit
connection for fault detection is determined. Finally, the performance of a
wide range of statistical indices that are used for FRA results comparison is
studied to find the best one. A new index for FRA interpretation is also
introduced.

Title: Second-order Conic Programming Approach for Wasserstein Distributionally
  Robust Two-stage Linear Programs
Authors: Zhuolin Wang, Keyou You, Shiji Song, Yuli Zhang
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper proposes a second-order conic programming (SOCP) approach to solve
distributionally robust two-stage stochastic linear programs over 1-Wasserstein
balls. We start from the case with distribution uncertainty only in the
objective function and exactly reformulate it as an SOCP problem. Then, we
study the case with distribution uncertainty only in constraints, and show that
such a robust program is generally NP-hard as it involves a norm maximization
problem over a polyhedron. However, it is reduced to an SOCP problem if the
extreme points of the polyhedron are given as a prior. This motivates to design
a constraint generation algorithm with provable convergence to approximately
solve the NP-hard problem. In sharp contrast to the exiting literature, the
distribution achieving the worst-case cost is given as an "empirical"
distribution by simply perturbing each sample for both cases. Finally,
experiments illustrate the advantages of the proposed model in terms of the
out-of-sample performance and the computational complexity.

Title: Price Volatility in Electricity Markets: A Stochastic Control
  Perspective
Authors: Avinash Mohan, Shie Mannor and Arman Kizilkale
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 28 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Spot prices in deregulated electricity markets in the United States and
Europe have historically displayed high volatility, leading to loss of revenue
in high electricity costs, weakening economic growth and lost business from
long blackouts. With rapidly increasing supply of intermittent solar and
wind-based power, conditions in the foreseeable future are only expected to
deteriorate. Geographic price variations, while capable of being quite dramatic
themselves, are a natural outcome of Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) that
takes finite transmission capacity and congestion into consideration, to
produce localized electricity prices. Temporal price volatility (considerable
fluctuation over periods as short as an hour in particular), however, is harder
to explain.
  In an effort to unearth the cause of these price fluctuations, we propose to
model the electricity market as a discrete time controlled stochastic process.
While this is a stylized model, it facilitates the analysis of spot markets and
helps exclude extraneous details that do not contribute significantly to the
discussion. We show that in any such market, improving social welfare must
necessarily be traded off with volatility in prices, i.e., it is impossible to
reduce volatility in the price of electricity without sacrificing social
welfare.
  We also show that, akin to communication systems, every market has a Capacity
Region associated with it, that dictates and quantifies how much welfare is
achievable at a given level of price volatility. In the context of renewable
power sources, our investigation uncovers an intriguing phenomenon we term the
volatility cliff, which suggests that with increasing penetration of
intermittent renewable production, price volatility could increase to
unacceptable levels, prompting the need for a complete restructuring of
existing electricity markets.

Title: On the Quadratic Programming Solution for Model Predictive Control with
  Move Blocking
Authors: Pavel Otta, Ondrej Santin, Vladimir Havlena
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a popular optimization-based control
technique. MPC is usually formulated as sparse or dense Quadratic Programming
(QP). This paper reviews two well-known methods, namely, state condensing and
move blocking, and brings them together. Their combination results in
generalized QP that serves arbitrarily sparse (or dense) QP for MPC with move
blocking. The proposed QP can be solved by a specialized solver capable of
exploiting a sparsity structure of the problem. Numerical examples give inside
in computational and memory requirements.

Title: Robust Initial Alignment for SINS/DVL Based on Reconstructed Observation
  Vectors
Authors: Xiang Xu, Jing Gui, Yifan Sun, Yiqing Yao and Tao Zhang
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Misalignment angle will result in a considerable error for the integration of
Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and of Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS).
In this paper, a robust initial alignment method for SINS/DVL is proposed to
solve a practical applicable issue, which is that the outputs of DVL are often
corrupted by the outliers. Firstly, the alignment principle for SINS/DVL is
summarized. Secondly, based on the principle of this alignment method, the
apparent velocity model is investigated, and the parameters expression of the
apparent velocity model are derived detailed. Using the apparent velocity
model, the unknown parameters of the apparent velocity model are estimated by
the developed Robust Kalman Filter (RKF), then the reconstructed observation
vector, where the outliers are detected and isolated, is reconstructed by the
estimated parameters. Based on the reconstructed observation vectors, the
initial attitude is determined. Finally, the simulation and field tests are
carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method. The test results
are shown that the proposed method can detect and isolate the outliers
effectively and get better performance than the previous work.

Title: Learning Optimal Control with MPC Layer
Authors: Jicheng Shi, Yingzhao Lian and Colin N. Jones
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper explores the potential to combine the Model Predictive Control
(MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This is achieved based on the technique
Cvxpy, which explores the differentiable optimization problems and embeds it as
a layer in machine learning. As the function approximaters in RL, the MPC
problem constructed by Cvxpy is deployed into all frameworks of RL algorithms,
including value-based RL, policy gradient, actor-critic RL. We detail the
combination method and provide the novel algorithm structure w.r.t some typical
RL algorithms. The major advantage of our MPC layer in RL algorithm is
flexibility and fast convergent rate. We provide some practical tricks, which
contains initial parameter training in advance and derivative computation by
Lagrange formula. We use openAI and pytorch to execute some experiments for the
new algorithms.

Title: Convex Fairness Constrained Model Using Causal Effect Estimators
Authors: Hikaru Ogura and Akiko Takeda
Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for the 2nd Workshop on Fairness,
  Accountability, Transparency, Ethics and Society on the Web (FATES on the Web
  2020), held in conjunction with the WWW'20
DOI: 10.1145/3366424.3383556
\\
  Recent years have seen much research on fairness in machine learning. Here,
mean difference (MD) or demographic parity is one of the most popular measures
of fairness. However, MD quantifies not only discrimination but also
explanatory bias which is the difference of outcomes justified by explanatory
features. In this paper, we devise novel models, called FairCEEs, which remove
discrimination while keeping explanatory bias. The models are based on
estimators of causal effect utilizing propensity score analysis. We prove that
FairCEEs with the squared loss theoretically outperform a naive MD constraint
model. We provide an efficient algorithm for solving FairCEEs in regression and
binary classification tasks. In our experiment on synthetic and real-world data
in these two tasks, FairCEEs outperformed an existing model that considers
explanatory bias in specific cases.

Title: Two-dimensional Multi-fiber Spectrum Image Correction Based on Machine
  Learning Techniques
Authors: Jiali Xu, Qian Yin, Ping Guo, and Xin Zheng
Categories: astro-ph.IM cs.AI
Comments: 10 pages, 14 figures
\\
  Due to limited size and imperfect of the optical components in a
spectrometer, aberration has inevitably been brought into two-dimensional
multi-fiber spectrum image in LAMOST, which leads to obvious spacial variation
of the point spread functions (PSFs). Consequently, if spatial variant PSFs are
estimated directly , the huge storage and intensive computation requirements
result in deconvolutional spectral extraction method become intractable. In
this paper, we proposed a novel method to solve the problem of spatial
variation PSF through image aberration correction. When CCD image aberration is
corrected, PSF, the convolution kernel, can be approximated by one spatial
invariant PSF only. Specifically, machine learning techniques are adopted to
calibrate distorted spectral image, including Total Least Squares (TLS)
algorithm, intelligent sampling method, multi-layer feed-forward neural
networks. The calibration experiments on the LAMOST CCD images show that the
calibration effect of proposed method is effectible. At the same time, the
spectrum extraction results before and after calibration are compared, results
show the characteristics of the extracted one-dimensional waveform are more
close to an ideal optics system, and the PSF of the corrected object spectrum
image estimated by the blind deconvolution method is nearly central symmetry,
which indicates that our proposed method can significantly reduce the
complexity of spectrum extraction and improve extraction accuracy.

Title: Adaptive Experience Selection for Policy Gradient
Authors: Saad Mohamad and Giovanni Montana
Categories: stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  Policy gradient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have achieved
impressive performance in challenging learning tasks such as continuous
control, but suffer from high sample complexity. Experience replay is a
commonly used approach to improve sample efficiency, but gradient estimators
using past trajectories typically have high variance. Existing sampling
strategies for experience replay like uniform sampling or prioritised
experience replay do not explicitly try to control the variance of the gradient
estimates. In this paper, we propose an online learning algorithm, adaptive
experience selection (AES), to adaptively learn an experience sampling
distribution that explicitly minimises this variance. Using a regret
minimisation approach, AES iteratively updates the experience sampling
distribution to match the performance of a competitor distribution assumed to
have optimal variance. Sample non-stationarity is addressed by proposing a
dynamic (i.e. time changing) competitor distribution for which a closed-form
solution is proposed. We demonstrate that AES is a low-regret algorithm with
reasonable sample complexity. Empirically, AES has been implemented for deep
deterministic policy gradient and soft actor critic algorithms, and tested on 8
continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym library. Ours results show that
AES leads to significantly improved performance compared to currently available
experience sampling strategies for policy gradient.

Title: 4D Semantic Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Image Synthesis on XCAT
  Anatomical Model

  Weese, Josien Pluim, Marcel Breeuwer
Categories: eess.IV cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Under Review for MIDL 2020
\\
  We propose a hybrid controllable image generation method to synthesize
anatomically meaningful 3D+t labeled Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) images.
Our hybrid method takes the mechanistic 4D eXtended CArdiac Torso (XCAT) heart
model as the anatomical ground truth and synthesizes CMR images via a
data-driven Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We employ the
state-of-the-art SPatially Adaptive De-normalization (SPADE) technique for
conditional image synthesis to preserve the semantic spatial information of
ground truth anatomy. Using the parameterized motion model of the XCAT heart,
we generate labels for 25 time frames of the heart for one cardiac cycle at 18
locations for the short axis view. Subsequently, realistic images are generated
from these labels, with modality-specific features that are learned from real
CMR image data. We demonstrate that style transfer from another cardiac image
can be accomplished by using a style encoder network. Due to the flexibility of
XCAT in creating new heart models, this approach can result in a realistic
virtual population to address different challenges the medical image analysis
research community is facing such as expensive data collection. Our proposed
method has a great potential to synthesize 4D controllable CMR images with
annotations and adaptable styles to be used in various supervised multi-site,
multi-vendor applications in medical image analysis.

Title: Topology optimization of fluidic flows on two-dimensional manifolds
Authors: Yongbo Deng, Jan G. Korvink
Categories: physics.comp-ph cs.CE physics.flu-dyn
\\
  This paper presents a topology optimization approach for the fluidic flows on
two-dimensional manifolds, which can represent the viscous and incompressible
material surfaces. The fluidic motion on such a material surface can be
described by the surface Navier-Stokes equations, which are derived by using
the elementary tangential calculus in terms of exterior differential operators
expressed in a Cartesian coordinate system. Based on the topology optimization
model for fluidic flows with porous medium filling the design domain, an
artificial Darcy friction is added to the area force term of the surface
Navier-Stokes equations and the physical area forces are penalized to eliminate
their existence in the fluidic regions and to avoid the invalidity of the
porous medium model. Topology optimization for unsteady and steady surface
flows is implemented by iteratively evolving the impermeability of the porous
medium on two-dimensional manifolds, where the impermeability is interpolated
by the material density derived from the design variable. The related partial
differential equations are solved by using the surface finite element method.
Numerical tests have been provided to demonstrated this topology optimization
approach for fluidic flows on two-dimensional manifolds.

  A hybrid estimator of the log-spectral density of a stationary time series is
proposed. First, a multiple taper estimate is performed, followed by kernel
smoothing the log-multitaper estimate. This procedure reduces the expected mean
square error by $({\pi^2 \over 4})^{.8}$ over simply smoothing the log tapered
periodogram. The optimal number of tapers is $O(N^{8/15})$. A data adaptive
implementation of a variable bandwidth kernel smoother is given. When the
spectral density is discontinuous, one sided smoothing estimates are used.

Title: Learning representations of irregular particle-detector geometry with

DOI: 10.1140/epjc/s10052-019-7113-9
\\
  We explore the use of graph networks to deal with irregular-geometry
detectors in the context of particle reconstruction. Thanks to their
representation-learning capabilities, graph networks can exploit the full
detector granularity, while natively managing the event sparsity and
arbitrarily complex detector geometries. We introduce two distance-weighted
graph network architectures, dubbed GarNet and GravNet layers, and apply them
to a typical particle reconstruction task. The performance of the new
architectures is evaluated on a data set of simulated particle interactions on
a toy model of a highly granular calorimeter, loosely inspired by the endcap
calorimeter to be installed in the CMS detector for the High-Luminosity LHC
phase. We study the clustering of energy depositions, which is the basis for
calorimetric particle reconstruction, and provide a quantitative comparison to
alternative approaches. The proposed algorithms provide an interesting
alternative to existing methods, offering equally performing or less
resource-demanding solutions with less underlying assumptions on the detector
geometry and, consequently, the possibility to generalize to other detectors.

Title: Large-scale biometry with interpretable neural network regression on UK
  Biobank body MRI
Authors: Taro Langner, H{\aa}kan Ahlstr\"om, Joel Kullberg
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  The UK Biobank study has successfully imaged more than 32,000 volunteer
participants with neck-to-knee body MRI. Each scan is linked to extensive
metadata, providing a comprehensive survey of imaged anatomy and related health
states. Despite its potential for research, this vast amount of data presents a
challenge to established methods of evaluation, which often rely on manual
input. To date, the range of reference values for cardiovascular and metabolic
risk factors is therefore incomplete. In this work, neural networks were
trained for regression to infer various biological metrics from the
neck-to-knee body MRI automatically. The approach requires no manual
intervention or ground truth segmentations for training. The examined fields
span 64 variables derived from anthropometric measurements, dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA), atlas-based segmentations, and dedicated liver scans. The
standardized framework achieved a close fit to the target values (median R^2 >
0.97) in 7-fold cross-validation with the ResNet50. Interpretation of
aggregated saliency maps suggests that the network correctly targets specific
body regions and limbs, and learned to emulate different modalities. On several
body composition metrics, the quality of the predictions is within the range of
variability observed between established gold standard techniques.

Title: PCSGAN: Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Networks
  for Thermal and NIR to Visible Image Transformation
Authors: Kancharagunta Kishan Babu and Shiv Ram Dubey
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG cs.MM
\\
  In many real world scenarios, it is difficult to capture the images in the
visible light spectrum (VIS) due to bad lighting conditions. However, the
images can be captured in such scenarios using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Thermal
(THM) cameras. The NIR and THM images contain the limited details. Thus, there
is a need to transform the images from THM/NIR to VIS for better understanding.
However, it is non-trivial task due to the large domain discrepancies and lack
of abundant datasets. Nowadays, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is able to
transform the images from one domain to another domain. Most of the available
GAN based methods use the combination of the adversarial and the pixel-wise
losses (like L1 or L2) as the objective function for training. The quality of
transformed images in case of THM/NIR to VIS transformation is still not up to
the mark using such objective function. Thus, better objective functions are
needed to improve the quality, fine details and realism of the transformed
images. A new model for THM/NIR to VIS image transformation called Perceptual
Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Network (PCSGAN) is introduced to
address these issues. The PCSGAN uses the combination of the perceptual (i.e.,
feature based) losses along with the pixel-wise and the adversarial losses.
Both the quantitative and qualitative measures are used to judge the
performance of the PCSGAN model over the WHU-IIP face and the RGB-NIR scene
datasets. The proposed PCSGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art image
transformation models, including Pix2pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN, PS2GAN, and PAN in
terms of the SSIM, MSE, PSNR and LPIPS evaluation measures. The code is
available at: \url{https://github.com/KishanKancharagunta/PCSGAN}.

\\
  Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is a rapidly growing field seeking to form
images of objects outside the field of view, with potential applications in
search and rescue, reconnaissance, and even medical imaging. The critical
challenge of NLOS imaging is that diffuse reflections scatter light in all
directions, resulting in weak signals and a loss of directional information. To
address this problem, we propose a method for seeing around corners that
derives angular resolution from vertical edges and longitudinal resolution from
the temporal response to a pulsed light source. We introduce an acquisition
strategy, scene response model, and reconstruction algorithm that enable the
formation of 2.5-dimensional representations -- a plan view plus heights -- and
a 180$^{\circ}$ field of view (FOV) for large-scale scenes. Our experiments
demonstrate accurate reconstructions of hidden rooms up to 3 meters in each
dimension.

Title: Distributed Averaging Methods for Randomized Second Order Optimization
Authors: Burak Bartan, Mert Pilanci
Categories: stat.ML cs.DC cs.LG
\\
  We consider distributed optimization problems where forming the Hessian is
computationally challenging and communication is a significant bottleneck. We
develop unbiased parameter averaging methods for randomized second order
optimization that employ sampling and sketching of the Hessian. Existing works
do not take the bias of the estimators into consideration, which limits their
application to massively parallel computation. We provide closed-form formulas
for regularization parameters and step sizes that provably minimize the bias
for sketched Newton directions. We also extend the framework of second order
averaging methods to introduce an unbiased distributed optimization framework
for heterogeneous computing systems with varying worker resources.
Additionally, we demonstrate the implications of our theoretical findings via
large scale experiments performed on a serverless computing platform.

Title: Knowledge and Social Relatedness Shape Research Portfolio
  Diversification
Authors: Giorgio Tripodi, Francesca Chiaromonte, and Fabrizio Lillo
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.DL cs.SI
\\
  Scientific discovery is shaped by scientists' choices and thus by their
career patterns. The increasing knowledge required to work at the frontier of
science makes it harder for an individual to embark on unexplored paths. Yet
collaborations can reduce learning costs -- albeit at the expense of increased
coordination costs. In this article, we use data on the publication histories
of a very large sample of physicists to measure the effects of knowledge and
social relatedness on their diversification strategies. Using bipartite
networks, we compute a measure of topics similarity and a measure of social
proximity. We find that scientists' strategies are not random, and that they
are significantly affected by both. Knowledge relatedness across topics
explains $\approx 10\%$ of logistic regression deviances and social relatedness
as much as $\approx 30\%$, suggesting that science is an eminently social
enterprise: when scientists move out of their core specialization, they do so
through collaborations. Interestingly, we also find a significant negative
interaction between knowledge and social relatedness, suggesting that the
farther scientists move from their specialization, the more they rely on
collaborations. Our results provide a starting point for broader quantitative
analyses of scientific diversification strategies, which could also be extended
to the domain of technological innovation -- offering insights from a
comparative and policy perspective.

Title: A two-stage algorithm for aircraft conflict resolution with trajectory
  recovery
Authors: Fernando H. C. Dias, Stephanie Rahme, David Rey
Categories: math.OC cs.DM
\\
  As air traffic volume is continuously increasing, it has become a priority to
improve traffic control algorithms to handle future air travel demand and
improve airspace capacity. We address the conflict resolution problem in air
traffic control using a novel approach for aircraft collision avoidance with
trajectory recovery. We present a two-stage algorithm that first solves all
initial conflicts by adjusting aircraft headings and speeds, before identifying
the optimal time for aircraft to recover towards their target destination. The
collision avoidance stage extends an existing mixed-integer programming
formulation to heading control. For the trajectory recovery stage, we introduce
a novel exact mixed-integer programming formulation as well as a greedy
heuristic algorithm. The proposed two-stage approach guarantees that all
trajectories during both the collision avoidance and recovery stages are
conflict-free. Numerical results on benchmark problems show that the proposed
heuristic for trajectory recovery is competitive while also emphasizing the
difficulty of this optimization problem. The proposed approach can be used as a
decision-support tool for introducing automation in air traffic control.

encouraged to join the premium class at a low price: Given that, those with

  We introduce a projective Riesz $s$-kernel for the unit sphere
$\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and investigate properties of $N$-point energy minimizing
configurations for such a kernel. We show that these configurations, for $s$
and $N$ sufficiently large, form frames that are well-separated (have low
coherence) and are nearly tight. Our results suggest an algorithm for computing
well-separated tight frames which is illustrated with numerical examples.

Title: Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Channels
Authors: Jiguang He and Markus Leinonen and Henk Wymeersch and Markku Juntti
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 5 pages, 6 figures, invited paper for IEEE SPAWC
\\
  A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can shape the radio propagation by
passively changing the directions of impinging electromagnetic waves. The
optimal control of the RIS requires perfect channel state information (CSI) of
all the links connecting the base station (BS) and the mobile station (MS) via
the RIS. Thereby the channel (parameter) estimation at the BS/MS and the
related message feedback mechanism are needed. In this paper, we adopt a
two-stage channel estimation scheme for the RIS-aided millimeter wave (mmWave)
MIMO channels using an iterative reweighted method to sequentially estimate the
channel parameters. We evaluate the average spectrum efficiency (SE) and the
RIS beamforming gain of the proposed scheme and demonstrate that it achieves
high-resolution estimation with the average SE comparable to that with perfect
CSI.

Title: Refined Belief Propagation Decoding of Sparse-Graph Quantum Codes
Authors: Kao-Yueh Kuo and Ching-Yi Lai
Categories: quant-ph cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Quantum stabilizer codes constructed from sparse matrices have good
performance and can be efficiently decoded by belief propagation (BP). A
conventional BP decoding algorithm treats binary stabilizer codes as additive
codes over GF(4). This algorithm has a relatively complex process of handling
check-node messages, which incurs higher decoding complexity. Moreover, BP
decoding of a stabilizer code usually suffers a performance loss due to the
many short cycles in the underlying Tanner graph. In this paper, we propose a
refined BP decoding algorithm for quantum codes with complexity roughly the
same as binary BP. For a given error syndrome, this algorithm decodes to the
same output as the conventional quaternary BP but the passed node-to-node
messages are single-valued, unlike the quaternary BP, where multivalued
node-to-node messages are required. Furthermore, the techniques of message
strength normalization can naturally be applied to these single-valued messages
to improve the performance. Another observation is that the message-update
schedule affects the performance of BP decoding against short cycles. We show
that running BP with message strength normalization according to a serial
schedule (or other schedules) may significantly improve the decoding
performance and error floor in computer simulation.

Title: Non-additivity in classical-quantum wiretap channels
Authors: Arkin Tikku and Mario Berta and Joseph M. Renes
Categories: quant-ph cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 8+6 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Due to Csiszar and Koerner, the capacity of classical wiretap channels has a
single-letter characterization in terms of the private information. For quantum
wiretap channels, however, it is known that regularization of the private
information is necessary to reach the capacity. Here, we study hybrid
classical-quantum wiretap channels in order to resolve to what extent quantum
effects are needed to witness non-additivity phenomena in quantum Shannon
theory. For wiretap channels with quantum inputs but classical outputs, we
prove that the characterization of the capacity in terms of the private
information stays single-letter. Hence, entangled input states are of no
asymptotic advantage in this setting. For wiretap channels with classical
inputs, we show by means of explicit examples that the private information
already becomes non-additive when either one of the two receivers becomes
quantum (with the other receiver staying classical). This gives non-additivity
examples that are not caused by entanglement and illustrates that quantum
adversaries are strictly different from classical adversaries in the wiretap
model.

  Given noisy data, function estimation is considered when the unknown function
is known apriori to consist of a small number of regions where the function is
either convex or concave. When the regions are known apriori, the estimate is
reduced to a finite dimensional convex optimization in the dual space. When the
number of regions is unknown, the model selection problem is to determine the
number of convexity change points. We use a pilot estimator based on the
expected number of false inflection points.

Title: An implicit function learning approach for parametric modal regression
Authors: Yangchen Pan, Ehsan Imani, Martha White, Amir-massoud Farahmand
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  For multi-valued functions---such as when the conditional distribution on
targets given the inputs is multi-modal---standard regression approaches are
not always desirable because they provide the conditional mean. Modal
regression aims to instead find the conditional mode, but is restricted to
nonparametric approaches. Such methods can be difficult to scale, and cannot
benefit from parametric function approximation, like neural networks, which can
learn complex relationships between inputs and targets. In this work, we
propose a parametric modal regression algorithm, by using the implicit function
theorem to develop an objective for learning a joint parameterized function
over inputs and targets. We empirically demonstrate on several synthetic
problems that our method (i) can learn multi-valued functions and produce the
conditional modes, (ii) scales well to high-dimensional inputs and (iii) is
even more effective for certain uni-modal problems, particularly for high
frequency data where the joint function over inputs and targets can better
capture the complex relationship between them. We then demonstrate that our
method is practically useful in a real-world modal regression problem. We
conclude by showing that our method provides small improvements on two
regression datasets that have asymmetric distributions over the targets.

Title: Ensemble Slice Sampling
Authors: Minas Karamanis and Florian Beutler
Categories: stat.ML astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM cs.LG stat.CO
\\
  Slice Sampling has emerged as a powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
that adapts to the characteristics of the target distribution with minimal
hand-tuning. However, Slice Sampling's performance is highly sensitive to the
user-specified initial length scale hyperparameter. Moreover, Slice Sampling
generally struggles with poorly scaled or strongly correlated distributions.
This paper introduces Ensemble Slice Sampling, a new class of algorithms that
bypasses such difficulties by adaptively tuning the length scale. Furthermore,
Ensemble Slice Sampling's performance is immune to linear correlations by
exploiting an ensemble of parallel walkers. These algorithms are trivial to
construct, require no hand-tuning, and can easily be implemented in parallel
computing environments. Empirical tests show that Ensemble Slice Sampling can
improve efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional
MCMC methods on highly correlated target distributions such as the
Autoregressive Process of Order 1 and the Correlated Funnel distribution.

Title: Top-K Training of GANs: Improving Generators by Making Critics Less
  Critical
Authors: Samarth Sinha, Anirudh Goyal, Colin Raffel, Augustus Odena
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We introduce a simple (one line of code) modification to the Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) training algorithm that materially improves results
with no increase in computational cost: When updating the generator parameters,
we simply zero out the gradient contributions from the elements of the batch
that the critic scores as `least realistic'. Through experiments on many
different GAN variants, we show that this `top-k update' procedure is a
generally applicable improvement. In order to understand the nature of the
improvement, we conduct extensive analysis on a simple mixture-of-Gaussians
dataset and discover several interesting phenomena. Among these is that, when
gradient updates are computed using the worst-scoring batch elements, samples
can actually be pushed further away from the their nearest mode.

Title: Boosted Locality Sensitive Hashing: Discriminative Binary Codes for
  Source Separation
Authors: Sunwoo Kim, Haici Yang, Minje Kim
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD
\\
  Speech enhancement tasks have seen significant improvements with the advance
of deep learning technology, but with the cost of increased computational
complexity. In this study, we propose an adaptive boosting approach to learning
locality sensitive hash codes, which represent audio spectra efficiently. We
use the learned hash codes for single-channel speech denoising tasks as an
alternative to a complex machine learning model, particularly to address the
resource-constrained environments. Our adaptive boosting algorithm learns
simple logistic regressors as the weak learners. Once trained, their binary
classification results transform each spectrum of test noisy speech into a bit
string. Simple bitwise operations calculate Hamming distance to find the
K-nearest matching frames in the dictionary of training noisy speech spectra,
whose associated ideal binary masks are averaged to estimate the denoising mask
for that test mixture. Our proposed learning algorithm differs from AdaBoost in
the sense that the projections are trained to minimize the distances between
the self-similarity matrix of the hash codes and that of the original spectra,
rather than the misclassification rate. We evaluate our discriminative hash
codes on the TIMIT corpus with various noise types, and show comparative
performance to deep learning methods in terms of denoising performance and
complexity.

  Model
Authors: Yusuke Uchiyama, Kei Nakagawa
Categories: q-fin.PM cs.LG math.ST q-fin.ST stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  Optimal asset allocation is a key topic in modern finance theory. To realize
the optimal asset allocation on investor's risk aversion, various portfolio
construction methods have been proposed. Recently, the applications of machine
learning are rapidly growing in the area of finance. In this article, we
propose the Student's $t$-process latent variable model (TPLVM) to describe
non-Gaussian fluctuations of financial timeseries by lower dimensional latent
variables. Subsequently, we apply the TPLVM to minimum-variance portfolio as an
alternative of existing nonlinear factor models. To test the performance of the
proposed portfolio, we construct minimum-variance portfolios of global stock
market indices based on the TPLVM or Gaussian process latent variable model. By
comparing these portfolios, we confirm the proposed portfolio outperforms that
of the existing Gaussian process latent variable model.

\\
  Stress is known as one of the major factors threatening human health. A large
number of studies have been performed in order to either assess or relieve
stress by analyzing the brain and heart-related signals. In this study, signals
produced by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) of the brain recorded
from 10 healthy volunteers are employed to assess the stress induced by the
Montreal Imaging Stress Task by means of a deep learning system. The proposed
deep learning system consists of two main parts: First, the one-dimensional
convolutional neural network is employed to build informative feature maps.
Then, a stack of deep fully connected layers is used to predict the stress
existence probability. Experiment results showed that the trained fNIRS model
performs stress classification by achieving 88.52 -+ 0.77% accuracy. Employment
of the proposed deep learning system trained on the fNIRS measurements leads to
higher stress classification accuracy than the existing methods proposed in
fNIRS studies in which the same experimental procedure has been employed. The
proposed method suggests better stability with lower variation in prediction.
Furthermore, its low computational cost opens up the possibility to be applied
in real-time stress assessment.

Title: Higher order co-occurrence tensors for hypergraphs via face-splitting

  A popular trick for computing a pairwise co-occurrence matrix is the product
of an incidence matrix and its transpose. We present an analog for higher order
tuple co-occurrences using the face-splitting product, or alternately known as
the transpose Khatri-Rao product. These higher order co-occurrences encode the
commonality of tokens in the company of other tokens, and thus generalize the
mutual information commonly studied. We demonstrate this tensor's use via a
popular NLP model, and hypergraph models of similarity.

\\
  Training a classifier over a large number of classes, known as 'extreme
classification', has become a topic of major interest with applications in
technology, science, and e-commerce. Traditional softmax regression induces a
gradient cost proportional to the number of classes $C$, which often is
prohibitively expensive. A popular scalable softmax approximation relies on
uniform negative sampling, which suffers from slow convergence due a poor
signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a simple training method for
drastically enhancing the gradient signal by drawing negative samples from an
adversarial model that mimics the data distribution. Our contributions are
three-fold: (i) an adversarial sampling mechanism that produces negative
samples at a cost only logarithmic in $C$, thus still resulting in cheap
gradient updates; (ii) a mathematical proof that this adversarial sampling
minimizes the gradient variance while any bias due to non-uniform sampling can
be removed; (iii) experimental results on large scale data sets that show a
reduction of the training time by an order of magnitude relative to several
competitive baselines.

Title: Small energy masking for improved neural network training for end-to-end

Comments: Accepted at ICASSP 2020
\\
  In this paper, we present a Small Energy Masking (SEM) algorithm, which masks
inputs having values below a certain threshold. More specifically, a
time-frequency bin is masked if the filterbank energy in this bin is less than
a certain energy threshold. A uniform distribution is employed to randomly
generate the ratio of this energy threshold to the peak filterbank energy of
each utterance in decibels. The unmasked feature elements are scaled so that
the total sum of the feature values remain the same through this masking
procedure. This very simple algorithm shows relatively 11.2 % and 13.5 % Word
Error Rate (WER) improvements on the standard LibriSpeech test-clean and
test-other sets over the baseline end-to-end speech recognition system.
Additionally, compared to the input dropout algorithm, SEM algorithm shows
relatively 7.7 % and 11.6 % improvements on the same LibriSpeech test-clean and
test-other sets. With a modified shallow-fusion technique with a Transformer
LM, we obtained a 2.62 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-clean set and a 7.87 % WER
on the LibriSpeech test-other set.

Title: Posterior Ratio Estimation for Latent Variables
Authors: Yulong Zhang, Mingxuan Yi, Song Liu, Mladen Kolar
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Density Ratio Estimation has attracted attention from machine learning
community due to its ability of comparing the underlying distributions of two
datasets. However, in some applications, we want to compare distributions of
\emph{latent} random variables that can be only inferred from observations. In
this paper, we study the problem of estimating the ratio between two posterior
probability density functions of a latent variable. Particularly, we assume the
posterior ratio function can be well-approximated by a parametric model, which
is then estimated using observed datasets and synthetic prior samples. We prove
consistency of our estimator and the asymptotic normality of the estimated
parameters as the number of prior samples tending to infinity. Finally, we
validate our theories using numerical experiments and demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed method through some real-world applications.

performance. At the same time, deep learning ensembles have provided

in-domain uncertainty for image classification. We explore the standards for
its quantification and point out pitfalls of existing metrics. Avoiding these
pitfalls, we perform a broad study of different ensembling techniques. To
provide more insight in this study, we introduce the deep ensemble equivalent
score (DEE) and show that many sophisticated ensembling techniques are
equivalent to an ensemble of only few independently trained networks in terms
of test performance.

Comments: 35 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Higher-order tensors arise frequently in applications such as neuroimaging,
recommendation system, social network analysis, and psychological studies. We
consider the problem of low-rank tensor estimation from possibly incomplete,
ordinal-valued observations. Two related problems are studied, one on tensor
denoising and another on tensor completion. We propose a multi-linear
cumulative link model, develop a rank-constrained M-estimator, and obtain
theoretical accuracy guarantees. Our mean squared error bound enjoys a faster
convergence rate than previous results, and we show that the proposed estimator
is minimax optimal under the class of low-rank models. Furthermore, the
procedure developed serves as an efficient completion method which guarantees
consistent recovery of an order-$K$ $(d,\ldots,d)$-dimensional low-rank tensor
using only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(Kd)$ noisy, quantized observations. We
demonstrate the outperformance of our approach over previous methods on the
tasks of clustering and collaborative filtering.

Title: Active Bayesian Assessment for Black-Box Classifiers
Authors: Disi Ji, Robert L. Logan IV, Padhraic Smyth, Mark Steyvers
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Recent advances in machine learning have led to increased deployment of
black-box classifiers across a wide variety of applications. In many such
situations there is a crucial need to assess the performance of these
pre-trained models, for instance to ensure sufficient predictive accuracy, or
that class probabilities are well-calibrated. Furthermore, since labeled data
may be scarce or costly to collect, it is desirable for such assessment be
performed in an efficient manner. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian
approach for model assessment that satisfies these desiderata. We develop
inference strategies to quantify uncertainty for common assessment metrics
(accuracy, misclassification cost, expected calibration error), and propose a
framework for active assessment using this uncertainty to guide efficient
selection of instances for labeling. We illustrate the benefits of our approach
in experiments assessing the performance of modern neural classifiers (e.g.,
ResNet and BERT) on several standard image and text classification datasets.

Title: Speech-to-Singing Conversion in an Encoder-Decoder Framework
Authors: Jayneel Parekh, Preeti Rao, Yi-Hsuan Yang
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD
Comments: Accepted at IEEE ICASSP 2020
\\
  In this paper our goal is to convert a set of spoken lines into sung ones.
Unlike previous signal processing based methods, we take a learning based
approach to the problem. This allows us to automatically model various aspects
of this transformation, thus overcoming dependence on specific inputs such as
high quality singing templates or phoneme-score synchronization information.
Specifically, we propose an encoder--decoder framework for our task. Given
time-frequency representations of speech and a target melody contour, we learn
encodings that enable us to synthesize singing that preserves the linguistic
content and timbre of the speaker while adhering to the target melody. We also
propose a multi-task learning based objective to improve lyric intelligibility.
We present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of our framework.

Title: Structures of Spurious Local Minima in $k$-means
Authors: Wei Qian, Yuqian Zhang, Yudong Chen
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.OC math.ST stat.TH
\\
  $k$-means clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning. The
problem concerns finding a partition of the data points into $k$ clusters such
that the within-cluster variation is minimized. Despite its importance and wide
applicability, a theoretical understanding of the $k$-means problem has not
been completely satisfactory. Existing algorithms with theoretical performance
guarantees often rely on sophisticated (sometimes artificial) algorithmic
techniques and restricted assumptions on the data. The main challenge lies in
the non-convex nature of the problem; in particular, there exist additional
local solutions other than the global optimum. Moreover, the simplest and most
popular algorithm for $k$-means, namely Lloyd's algorithm, generally converges
to such spurious local solutions both in theory and in practice.
  In this paper, we approach the $k$-means problem from a new perspective, by
investigating the structures of these spurious local solutions under a
probabilistic generative model with $k$ ground truth clusters. As soon as
$k=3$, spurious local minima provably exist, even for well-separated and
balanced clusters. One such local minimum puts two centers at one true cluster,
and the third center in the middle of the other two true clusters. For general
$k$, one local minimum puts multiple centers at a true cluster, and one center
in the middle of multiple true clusters. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that
this is essentially the only type of spurious local minima under a separation
condition. Our results pertain to the $k$-means formulation for mixtures of
Gaussians or bounded distributions. Our theoretical results corroborate
existing empirical observations and provide justification for several improved
algorithms for $k$-means clustering.

Title: Stochastic Normalizing Flows
Authors: Hao Wu, Jonas K\"ohler and Frank No\'e
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG physics.chem-ph physics.data-an
\\
  Normalizing flows are popular generative learning methods that train an
invertible function to transform a simple prior distribution into a complicated
target distribution. Here we generalize the framework by introducing Stochastic
Normalizing Flows (SNF) - an arbitrary sequence of deterministic invertible
functions and stochastic processes such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or
Langevin Dynamics. This combination can be powerful as adding stochasticity to
a flow helps overcoming expressiveness limitations of a chosen deterministic
invertible function, while the trainable flow transformations can improve the
sampling efficiency over pure MCMC. Key to our approach is that we can match a
marginal target density without having to marginalize out the stochasticity of
traversed paths. Invoking ideas from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, we
introduce a training method that only uses conditional path probabilities. We
can turn an SNF into a Boltzmann Generator that samples asymptotically unbiased
from a given target density by importance sampling of these paths. We
illustrate the representational power, sampling efficiency and asymptotic
correctness of SNFs on several benchmarks.

Title: Automatic Frame Selection using CNN in Ultrasound Elastography
Authors: Abdelrahman Zayed, Guy Cloutier and Hassan Rivaz
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Ultrasound elastography is used to estimate the mechanical properties of the
tissue by monitoring its response to an internal or external force. Different
levels of deformation are obtained from different tissue types depending on
their mechanical properties, where stiffer tissues deform less. Given two radio
frequency (RF) frames collected before and after some deformation, we estimate
displacement and strain images by comparing the RF frames. The quality of the
strain image is dependent on the type of motion that occurs during deformation.
In-plane axial motion results in high-quality strain images, whereas
out-of-plane motion results in low-quality strain images. In this paper, we
introduce a new method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to determine
the suitability of a pair of RF frames for elastography in only 5.4 ms. Our
method could also be used to automatically choose the best pair of RF frames,
yielding a high-quality strain image. The CNN was trained on 3,818 pairs of RF
frames, while testing was done on 986 new unseen pairs, achieving an accuracy
of more than 91%. The RF frames were collected from both phantom and in vivo
data.

Title: A Newton Frank-Wolfe Method for Constrained Self-Concordant Minimization
Authors: Deyi Liu, Volkan Cevher, Quoc Tran-Dinh
Categories: math.OC cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We demonstrate how to scalably solve a class of constrained self-concordant
minimization problems using linear minimization oracles (LMO) over the
constraint set. We prove that the number of LMO calls of our method is nearly
the same as that of the Frank-Wolfe method in the L-smooth case. Specifically,
our Newton Frank-Wolfe method uses $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\nu})$ LMO's, where
$\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy and $\nu:= 1 + o(1)$. In addition, we
demonstrate how our algorithm can exploit the improved variants of the
LMO-based schemes, including away-steps, to attain linear convergence rates. We
also provide numerical evidence with portfolio design with the competitive
ratio, D-optimal experimental design, and logistic regression with the elastic
net where Newton Frank-Wolfe outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Title: The Synthesizability of Molecules Proposed by Generative Models
Authors: Wenhao Gao, Connor W. Coley
Categories: q-bio.QM cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The discovery of functional molecules is an expensive and time-consuming
process, exemplified by the rising costs of small molecule therapeutic
discovery. One class of techniques of growing interest for early-stage drug
discovery is de novo molecular generation and optimization, catalyzed by the
development of new deep learning approaches. These techniques can suggest novel
molecular structures intended to maximize a multi-objective function, e.g.,
suitability as a therapeutic against a particular target, without relying on
brute-force exploration of a chemical space. However, the utility of these
approaches is stymied by ignorance of synthesizability. To highlight the
severity of this issue, we use a data-driven computer-aided synthesis planning
program to quantify how often molecules proposed by state-of-the-art generative
models cannot be readily synthesized. Our analysis demonstrates that there are
several tasks for which these models generate unrealistic molecular structures
despite performing well on popular quantitative benchmarks. Synthetic
complexity heuristics can successfully bias generation toward
synthetically-tractable chemical space, although doing so necessarily detracts
from the primary objective. This analysis suggests that to improve the utility
of these models in real discovery workflows, new algorithm development is
warranted.

\\
  The current methodology in tackling Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) task
can be described in two steps, preprocessing of the audio waveform into log-mel
spectrogram and then using it as the input representation for Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). This paradigm shift occurs after DCASE 2016 where this
framework model achieves the state-of-the-art result in ASC tasks on the
(ESC-50) dataset and achieved an accuracy of 64.5%, which constitute to 20.5%
improvement over the baseline model, and DCASE 2016 dataset with an accuracy of
90.0% (development) and 86.2% (evaluation), which constitute a 6.4% and 9%
improvements with respect to the baseline system. In this paper, we explored
the use of harmonic and percussive source separation (HPSS) to split the audio
into harmonic audio and percussive audio, which has received popularity in the
field of music information retrieval (MIR). Although works have been done in
using HPSS as input representation for CNN model in ASC task, this paper
further investigate the possibility on leveraging the separated harmonic
component and percussive component by curating 2 CNNs which tries to understand
harmonic audio and percussive audio in their natural form, one specialized in
extracting deep features in time biased domain and another specialized in
extracting deep features in frequency biased domain, respectively. The deep
features extracted from these 2 CNNs will then be combined using bilinear
pooling. Hence, presenting a two-stream time and frequency CNN architecture
approach in classifying acoustic scene. The model is being evaluated on DCASE
2019 sub task 1a dataset and scored an average of 65% on development dataset,

  Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized biological
discovery, providing an unbiased picture of cellular heterogeneity in tissues.
While scRNA-seq has been used extensively to provide insight into health and
disease, it has not been used for disease prediction or diagnostics. Graph
Attention Networks have proven to be versatile for a wide range of tasks by
learning from both original features and graph structures. Here we present a
graph attention model for predicting disease state from single-cell data on a
large dataset of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. MS is a disease of the
central nervous system that is difficult to diagnose. We train our model on
single-cell data obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for a cohort
of seven MS patients and six healthy adults (HA), resulting in 66,667
individual cells. We achieve $\mathbf{92}$ \% accuracy in predicting MS,
outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such as a graph convolutional
network, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron. Further, we use the learned
graph attention model to get insight into the features (cell types and genes)
that are important for this prediction. The graph attention model also allow us
to infer a new feature space for the cells that emphasizes the difference
between the two conditions. Finally we use the attention weights to learn a new
low-dimensional embedding which we visualize with PHATE and UMAP. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first effort to use graph attention, and deep
learning in general, to predict disease state from single-cell data. We
envision applying this method to single-cell data for other diseases.

\\
  The synthesis of high performance computing (particularly Graphics Processing
Units), cloud computing services (like Google Colab), and high-level deep
learning frameworks (such as PyTorch) has powered the burgeoning field of
artificial intelligence. While these technologies are popular in the computer
science discipline, the physics community is less aware of how such
innovations, freely available online, can improve research and education. In
this tutorial, we take the Hopfield Network as an example to show how the
confluence of these fields can dramatically accelerate physics-based computer
simulations and remove technical barriers in implementing such programs,
thereby making physics experimentation and education faster and more
accessible. To do so, we introduce the cloud, the GPU, and AI frameworks that
can be easily repurposed for physics simulation. We then introduce the Hopfield
Network and explain how to produce large-scale simulations & visualizations for
free in the cloud with very little code (fully self-contained in the text).
Finally, we suggest programming exercises throughout the paper, geared towards
advanced undergraduate students studying physics, biophysics, or computer
science.

\\
  A space-time collocation method (STCM) using asymptotically-constant basis
functions is proposed and applied to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint for a
loop-quantized treatment of the Schwarzschild interior. Canonically, these
descriptions take the form of a partial-difference equation (PDE). The
space-time collocation approach presents a computationally efficient,
convergent, and easily parallelizable method for solving this class of
equations, which is the main novelty of this study. Results of the numerical
simulations will demonstrate the benefit from a parallel computing approach;
and show general flexibility of the framework to handle arbitrarily-sized
domains. Computed solutions will be compared, when applicable, to a solution
computed in the conventional method via iteratively stepping through a
predefined grid of discrete values, computing the solution via a recursive
relationship.

Title: Optimization-Based MCMC Methods for Nonlinear Hierarchical Statistical
  Inverse Problems
Authors: Johnathan Bardsley, Tiangang Cui
Categories: stat.CO cs.NA math.NA stat.ML
\\
  In many hierarchical inverse problems, not only do we want to estimate high-
or infinite-dimensional model parameters in the parameter-to-observable maps,
but we also have to estimate hyperparameters that represent critical
assumptions in the statistical and mathematical modeling processes. As a joint
effect of high-dimensionality, nonlinear dependence, and non-concave structures
in the joint posterior posterior distribution over model parameters and
hyperparameters, solving inverse problems in the hierarchical Bayesian setting
poses a significant computational challenge. In this work, we aim to develop
scalable optimization-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for solving
hierarchical Bayesian inverse problems with nonlinear parameter-to-observable
maps and a broader class of hyperparameters. Our algorithmic development is
based on the recently developed scalable randomize-then-optimize (RTO) method
[4] for exploring the high- or infinite-dimensional model parameter space. By
using RTO either as a proposal distribution in a Metropolis-within-Gibbs update
or as a biasing distribution in the pseudo-marginal MCMC [2], we are able to
design efficient sampling tools for hierarchical Bayesian inversion. In
particular, the integration of RTO and the pseudo-marginal MCMC has sampling
performance robust to model parameter dimensions. We also extend our methods to
nonlinear inverse problems with Poisson-distributed measurements. Numerical
examples in PDE-constrained inverse problems and positron emission tomography
(PET) are used to demonstrate the performance of our methods.

Title: Sound Event Localization based on Sound Intensity Vector Refined By

\\
  We propose a direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation method for Sound Event
Localization and Detection (SELD). Direct estimation of DOA using a deep neural
network (DNN), i.e. completely-datadriven approach, achieves high accuracy.
However, there is a gap in the accuracy between DOA estimation for single and
overlapping sources because they cannot incorporate physical knowledge.
Meanwhile, although the accuracy of physics-based approaches is inferior to
DNN-based approaches, it is robust for overlapping source. In this study, we
consider a combination of physics-based and DNN-based approaches; the sound
intensity vectors (IVs) for physics-based DOA estimation is refined based on
DNN-based denoising and source separation. This method enables the accurate DOA
estimation for both single and overlapping sources using a spherical microphone
array. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art DOA estimation accuracy on an open dataset of the SELD.

  Speaker diarization is an important pre-processing step for many speech
applications, and it aims to solve the "who spoke when" problem. Although the
standard diarization systems can achieve satisfactory results in various
scenarios, they are composed of several independently-optimized modules and
cannot deal with the overlapped speech. In this paper, we propose a novel
speaker diarization method: Region Proposal Network based Speaker Diarization
(RPNSD). In this method, a neural network generates overlapped speech segment
proposals, and compute their speaker embeddings at the same time. Compared with
standard diarization systems, RPNSD has a shorter pipeline and can handle the
overlapped speech. Experimental results on three diarization datasets reveal
that RPNSD achieves remarkable improvements over the state-of-the-art x-vector
baseline.

Title: A Comparison of Pooling Methods on LSTM Models for Rare Acoustic Event
  Classification
Authors: Chieh-Chi Kao, Ming Sun, Weiran Wang, Chao Wang
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: Accepted to ICASSP 2020
\\
  Acoustic event classification (AEC) and acoustic event detection (AED) refer
to the task of detecting whether specific target events occur in audios. As
long short-term memory (LSTM) leads to state-of-the-art results in various
speech related tasks, it is employed as a popular solution for AEC as well.
This paper focuses on investigating the dynamics of LSTM model on AEC tasks. It
includes a detailed analysis on LSTM memory retaining, and a benchmarking of
nine different pooling methods on LSTM models using 1.7M generated mixture
clips of multiple events with different signal-to-noise ratios. This paper
focuses on understanding: 1) utterance-level classification accuracy; 2)
sensitivity to event position within an utterance. The analysis is done on the
dataset for the detection of rare sound events from DCASE 2017 Challenge. We
find max pooling on the prediction level to perform the best among the nine
pooling approaches in terms of classification accuracy and insensitivity to
event position within an utterance. To authors' best knowledge, this is the
first kind of such work focused on LSTM dynamics for AEC tasks.

Title: Real-time binaural speech separation with preserved spatial cues
Authors: Cong Han, Yi Luo, Nima Mesgarani
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: To appear in ICASSP 2020
\\
  Deep learning speech separation algorithms have achieved great success in
improving the quality and intelligibility of separated speech from mixed audio.
Most previous methods focused on generating a single-channel output for each of
the target speakers, hence discarding the spatial cues needed for the
localization of sound sources in space. However, preserving the spatial
information is important in many applications that aim to accurately render the
acoustic scene such as in hearing aids and augmented reality (AR). Here, we
propose a speech separation algorithm that preserves the interaural cues of
separated sound sources and can be implemented with low latency and high
fidelity, therefore enabling a real-time modification of the acoustic scene.
Based on the time-domain audio separation network (TasNet), a single-channel
time-domain speech separation system that can be implemented in real-time, we
propose a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) end-to-end extension of TasNet that
takes binaural mixed audio as input and simultaneously separates target
speakers in both channels. Experimental results show that the proposed
end-to-end MIMO system is able to significantly improve the separation
performance and keep the perceived location of the modified sources intact in
various acoustic scenes.

  The state of charge (SoC) and the rate of charging/discharging current are
the vital parameters associated with a battery by which its accurate runtime
can be estimated. This paper aims to design a controller which comprises of a
field-programmable gate array, back to back connected dc-dc converters, and a
resistive touch display based graphical user interface (GUI). The controller
estimates SoC and performs constant current charging or discharging of the
battery. The implementation of GUI is to input the reference
charging/discharging current from the user and to display the SoC. This
research delves into battery and obtains its internal parameters by conducting
hybrid pulse power characterization test. Furthermore, the obtained internal
parameters are processed through an extended Kalman filter which yields the
SoC. This controller has large applications in the renewable energy system,
battery testing system, smart residential energy management systems, and
micro-grids.
