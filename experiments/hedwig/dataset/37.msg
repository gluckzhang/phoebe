Title: High-Level Plan for Behavioral Robot Navigation with Natural Language
  Directions and R-NET
Authors: Amar Shrestha, Krittaphat Pugdeethosapol, Haowen Fang, Qinru Qiu
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures
\\
  When the navigational environment is known, it can be represented as a graph
where landmarks are nodes, the robot behaviors that move from node to node are
edges, and the route is a set of behavioral instructions. The route path from
source to destination can be viewed as a class of combinatorial optimization
problems where the path is a sequential subset from a set of discrete items.
The pointer network is an attention-based recurrent network that is suitable
for such a task. In this paper, we utilize a modified R-NET with gated
attention and self-matching attention translating natural language instructions
to a high-level plan for behavioral robot navigation by developing an
understanding of the behavioral navigational graph to enable the pointer
network to produce a sequence of behaviors representing the path. Tests on the
navigation graph dataset show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art
approach for both known and unknown environments.

Title: From Natural Language Instructions to Complex Processes: Issues in
  Chaining Trigger Action Rules
Authors: Nobuhiro Ito, Yuya Suzuki and Akiko Aizawa
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Automation services for complex business processes usually require a high
level of information technology literacy. There is a strong demand for a
smartly assisted process automation (IPA: intelligent process automation)
service that enables even general users to easily use advanced automation. A
natural language interface for such automation is expected as an elemental
technology for the IPA realization. The workflow targeted by IPA is generally
composed of a combination of multiple tasks. However, semantic parsing, one of
the natural language processing methods, for such complex workflows has not yet
been fully studied. The reasons are that (1) the formal expression and grammar
of the workflow required for semantic analysis have not been sufficiently
examined and (2) the dataset of the workflow formal expression with its
corresponding natural language description required for learning workflow
semantics did not exist. This paper defines a new grammar for complex workflows
with chaining machine-executable meaning representations for semantic parsing.
The representations are at a high abstraction level. Additionally, an approach
to creating datasets is proposed based on this grammar.

Title: D3BA: A Tool for Optimizing Business Processes Using Non-Deterministic
  Planning
Authors: Tathagata Chakraborti and Yasaman Khazaeni
Categories: cs.AI cs.CE
Comments: Appears in the Proceedings of the AAAI 2020 Workshop on Intelligent
  Process Automation
\\
  This paper builds upon recent work in the declarative design of dialogue
agents and proposes an exciting new tool -- D3BA -- Declarative Design for
Digital Business Automation, built to optimize business processes using the
power of AI planning. The tool provides a powerful framework to build,
optimize, and maintain complex business processes and optimize them by
composing with services that automate one or more subtasks. We illustrate
salient features of this composition technique, compare with other philosophies
of composition, and highlight exciting opportunities for research in this
emerging field of business process automation.

Title: Nullstellensatz Size-Degree Trade-offs from Reversible Pebbling
Authors: Susanna F. de Rezende, Or Meir, Jakob Nordstr\"om, Robert Robere
Categories: cs.CC
\\
  We establish an exactly tight relation between reversible pebblings of graphs
and Nullstellensatz refutations of pebbling formulas, showing that a graph $G$
can be reversibly pebbled in time $t$ and space $s$ if and only if there is a
Nullstellensatz refutation of the pebbling formula over $G$ in size $t+1$ and
degree $s$ (independently of the field in which the Nullstellensatz refutation
is made). We use this correspondence to prove a number of strong size-degree
trade-offs for Nullstellensatz, which to the best of our knowledge are the
first such results for this proof system.

Title: ILS-MPM: an implicit level-set-based material point method for
  frictional particulate contact mechanics of deformable particles
Authors: Chuanqi Liu and Waiching Sun
Categories: cs.CE
\\
  Finite element simulations of frictional multi-body contact problems via
conformal meshes can be challenging and computationally demanding. To render
geometrical features, unstructured meshes must be used and this unavoidably
increases the degrees of freedom and therefore makes the construction of
slave/master pairs more demanding. In this work, we introduce an implicit
material point method designed to bypass the meshing of bodies by employing
level set functions to represent boundaries at structured grids. This implicit
function representation provides an elegant mean to link an unbiased
intermediate reference surface with the true boundaries by closest point
projection as shown in leichner et al. (2019). We then enforce the contact
constraints by a penalty method where the Coulomb friction law is implemented
as an elastoplastic constitutive model such that a return mapping algorithm can
be used to provide constitutive updates for both the stick and slip states. To
evolve the geometry of the contacts properly, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is
solved incrementally such that the level set and material points are both
updated accord to the deformation field. To improve the accuracy and regularity
of the numerical integration of the material point method, a moving least
square method is used to project numerical values of the material points back
to the standard locations for Gaussian-Legendre quadrature. Several benchmarks
are used to verify the proposed model. Comparisons with discrete element
simulations are made to analyze the importance of stress fields on predicting
the macroscopic responses of granular assemblies.

Title: Automatic surface mesh generation for discrete models: A complete and
  automatic pipeline based on reparameterization
Authors: Pierre-Alexandre Beaufort, Christophe Geuzaine, Jean-Fran\c{c}ois
  Remacle
Categories: cs.CG
Comments: Images have lower quality in order to meet arxiv requirements
\\
  Triangulations are an ubiquitous input for the finite element community.
However, most raw triangulations obtained by imaging techniques are unsuitable
as-is for finite element analysis. In this paper, we give a robust pipeline for
handling those triangulations, based on the computation of a one-to-one
parametrization for automatically selected patches of input triangles, which
makes each patch amenable to remeshing by standard finite element meshing
algorithms. Using only geometrical arguments, we prove that a discrete
parametrization of a patch is one-to-one if (and only if) its image in the
parameter space is such that all parametric triangles have a positive area. We
then derive a non-standard linear discretization scheme based on mean value
coordinates to compute such one-to-one parametrizations, and show that the
scheme does not discretize a Laplacian on a structured mesh. The proposed
pipeline is implemented in the open source mesh generator Gmsh, where the
creation of suitable patches is based on triangulation topology and
parametrization quality, combined with feature edge detection. Several examples
illustrate the robustness of the resulting implementation.

Title: The Simplex Tree: an Efficient Data Structure for General Simplicial
  Complexes
Authors: Jean-Daniel Boissonnat (DATASHAPE, Inria), Cl\'ement Maria (DATASHAPE,
  Inria)
Categories: cs.CG
Journal-ref: Algorithmica, Springer Verlag, 2014, 70 (3), pp.20
DOI: 10.1007/s00453-014-9887-3
\\
  This paper introduces a data structure, called simplex tree, to represent
abstract simplicial complexes of any dimension. All faces of the simplicial
complex are explicitly stored in a trie whose nodes are in bijection with the
faces of the complex. This data structure allows to efficiently implement a
large range of basic operations on simplicial complexes. We provide theoretical
complexity analysis as well as detailed experimental results. We more
specifically study Rips and witness complexes.

Title: Multipurpose Intelligent Process Automation via Conversational Assistant
Authors: Alena Moiseeva, Dietrich Trautmann, Hinrich Sch\"utze
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
Comments: Presented at the AAAI-20 Workshop on Intelligent Process Automation
\\
  Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) is an emerging technology with a primary
goal to assist the knowledge worker by taking care of repetitive, routine and
low-cognitive tasks. Conversational agents that can interact with users in a
natural language are potential application for IPA systems. Such intelligent
agents can assist the user by answering specific questions and executing
routine tasks that are ordinarily performed in a natural language (i.e.,
customer support). In this work, we tackle a challenge of implementing an IPA
conversational assistant in a real-world industrial setting with a lack of
structured training data. Our proposed system brings two significant benefits:
First, it reduces repetitive and time-consuming activities and, therefore,
allows workers to focus on more intelligent processes. Second, by interacting
with users, it augments the resources with structured and to some extent
labeled training data. We showcase the usage of the latter by re-implementing
several components of our system with Transfer Learning (TL) methods.

Title: Generative Adversarial Zero-Shot Relational Learning for Knowledge
  Graphs
Authors: Pengda Qin, Xin Wang, Wenhu Chen, Chunyun Zhang, Weiran Xu, William
  Yang Wang
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) are shown to become more important in
current information systems. To expand the coverage of KGs, previous studies on
knowledge graph completion need to collect adequate training instances for
newly-added relations. In this paper, we consider a novel formulation,
zero-shot learning, to free this cumbersome curation. For newly-added
relations, we attempt to learn their semantic features from their text
descriptions and hence recognize the facts of unseen relations with no examples
being seen. For this purpose, we leverage Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) to establish the connection between text and knowledge graph domain: The
generator learns to generate the reasonable relation embeddings merely with
noisy text descriptions. Under this setting, zero-shot learning is naturally
converted to a traditional supervised classification task. Empirically, our
method is model-agnostic that could be potentially applied to any version of KG
embeddings, and consistently yields performance improvements on NELL and Wiki
dataset.

Title: A Neural Approach to Discourse Relation Signal Detection
Authors: Amir Zeldes and Yang Liu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: D&D
\\
  Previous data-driven work investigating the types and distributions of
discourse relation signals, including discourse markers such as 'however' or
phrases such as 'as a result' has focused on the relative frequencies of signal
words within and outside text from each discourse relation. Such approaches do
not allow us to quantify the signaling strength of individual instances of a
signal on a scale (e.g. more or less discourse-relevant instances of 'and'), to
assess the distribution of ambiguity for signals, or to identify words that
hinder discourse relation identification in context ('anti-signals' or
'distractors'). In this paper we present a data-driven approach to signal
detection using a distantly supervised neural network and develop a metric,
{\Delta}s (or 'delta-softmax'), to quantify signaling strength. Ranging between
-1 and 1 and relying on recent advances in contextualized words embeddings, the
metric represents each word's positive or negative contribution to the
identifiability of a relation in specific instances in context. Based on an
English corpus annotated for discourse relations using Rhetorical Structure
Theory and signal type annotations anchored to specific tokens, our analysis
examines the reliability of the metric, the places where it overlaps with and
differs from human judgments, and the implications for identifying features
that neural models may need in order to perform better on automatic discourse
relation classification.

Title: LTP: A New Active Learning Strategy for Bert-CRF Based Named Entity
  Recognition
Authors: Mingyi Liu, Zhiying Tu, Zhongjie Wang, Xiaofei Xu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in many natural
language processing tasks including named entity recognition. The shortcoming
is that a large amount of manually-annotated data is usually required. Previous
studies have demonstrated that both transfer learning and active learning could
elaborately reduce the cost of data annotation in terms of their corresponding
advantages, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. We assume that
the convergence of the two methods can complement with each other, so that the
model could be trained more accurately with less labelled data, and active
learning method could enhance transfer learning method to accurately select the
minimum data samples for iterative learning. However, in real applications we
found this approach is challenging because the sample selection of traditional
active learning strategy merely depends on the final probability value of its
model output, and this makes it quite difficult to evaluate the quality of the
selected data samples. In this paper, we first examine traditional active
learning strategies in a specific case of BERT-CRF that has been widely used in
named entity recognition. Then we propose an uncertainty-based active learning
strategy called Lowest Token Probability (LTP) which considers not only the
final output but also the intermediate results. We test LTP on multiple
datasets, and the experiments show that LTP performs better than traditional
strategies (incluing LC and NLC) on both token-level $F_1$ and sentence-level
accuracy, especially in complex imbalanced datasets.

Title: REST: A thread embedding approach for identifying and classifying
  user-specified information in security forums
Authors: Joobin Gharibshah, Evangelos E. Papalexakis, Michalis Faloutsos
Categories: cs.CL cs.IR
Comments: Accepted in ICWSM 2020
\\
  How can we extract useful information from a security forum? We focus on
identifying threads of interest to a security professional: (a) alerts of
worrisome events, such as attacks, (b) offering of malicious services and
products, (c) hacking information to perform malicious acts, and (d) useful
security-related experiences. The analysis of security forums is in its infancy
despite several promising recent works. Novel approaches are needed to address
the challenges in this domain: (a) the difficulty in specifying the "topics" of
interest efficiently, and (b) the unstructured and informal nature of the text.
We propose, REST, a systematic methodology to: (a) identify threads of interest
based on a, possibly incomplete, bag of words, and (b) classify them into one
of the four classes above. The key novelty of the work is a multi-step weighted
embedding approach: we project words, threads and classes in appropriate
embedding spaces and establish relevance and similarity there. We evaluate our
method with real data from three security forums with a total of 164k posts and
21K threads. First, REST robustness to initial keyword selection can extend the
user-provided keyword set and thus, it can recover from missing keywords.
Second, REST categorizes the threads into the classes of interest with superior
accuracy compared to five other methods: REST exhibits an accuracy between
63.3-76.9%. We see our approach as a first step for harnessing the wealth of
information of online forums in a user-friendly way, since the user can loosely
specify her keywords of interest.

Title: A Prevention and a Traction System for Ransomware Attacks
Authors: Murat Ozer, Said Varlioglu, Bilal Gonen, Mehmet F. Bastug
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Over the past three years, especially following WannaCry malware, ransomware
has become one of the biggest concerns for private businesses, state, and local
government agencies. According to Homeland Security statistics, 1.5 million
ransomware attacks have occurred per year since 2016. Cybercriminals often use
creative methods to inject their malware into the target machines and use
sophisticated cryptographic techniques to hold hostage victims' files and
programs unless a certain amount of equivalent Bitcoin is paid. The return to
the cybercriminals is so high (estimated \$1 billion in 2019) without any cost
because of the advanced anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies, especially
Bitcoin \cite{Paquet-Clouston2019}. Given this context, this study first
discusses the current state of ransomware, detection, and prevention systems.
Second, we propose a global ransomware center to better manage our concerted
efforts against cybercriminals. The policy implications of the proposed study
are discussed in the conclusion section.

Title: Plunge into the Underworld: A Survey on Emergence of Darknet
Authors: Victor Adewopo, Bilal Gonen, Said Varlioglu, Murat Ozer
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  The availability of sophisticated technologies and methods of perpetrating
criminogenic activities in the cyberspace is a pertinent societal problem.
Darknet is an encrypted network technology that uses the internet
infrastructure and can only be accessed using special network configuration and
software tools to access its contents which are not indexed by search engines.
Over the years darknets traditionally are used for criminogenic activities and
famously acclaimed to promote cybercrime, procurements of illegal drugs, arms
deals, and cryptocurrency markets. In countries with oppressive regimes,
censorship of digital communications, and strict policies prompted journalists
and freedom fighters to seek freedom using darknet technologies anonymously
while others simply exploit it for illegal activities. Recently, MIT's Lincoln
Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence augmented a tool that can be used to
expose illegal activities behind the darknet. We studied relevant literature
reviews to help researchers to better understand the darknet technologies,
identify future areas of research on the darknet and ultimately to optimize how
data-driven insights can be utilized to support governmental agencies in
unraveling the depths of darknet technologies. This paper focuses on the use of
the internet for crimes, deanonymization of TOR-services, darknet a new digital
street for illicit drugs, research questions and hypothesis to guide
researchers in further studies. Finally, in this study, we propose a model to
examine and investigate anonymous online illicit markets.

  Existing microgrid communication relies on classical public key systems,

key distribution (QKD) to solve these quantum-era microgrid challenges.
Specifically, this paper makes the following novel contributions: 1) it offers
a QKD-based microgrid communication architecture for microgrids; 2) it shows
how to build a quantum-secure microgrid testbed in an RTDS environment; 3) it
develops a key pool sharing (KPS) strategy to improve the cyberattack
resilience of the QKD-based microgrid; and 4) it analyzes the impacts of
critical QKD parameters with the testbed. Test results provide insightful
resources for building a quantum-secure microgrid.

Title: $\mu$VulDeePecker: A Deep Learning-Based System for Multiclass
  Vulnerability Detection
Authors: Deqing Zou, Sujuan Wang, Shouhuai Xu, Zhen Li, Hai Jin
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
Comments: To be published in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure
  Computing
DOI: 10.1109/TDSC.2019.2942930
\\
  Fine-grained software vulnerability detection is an important and challenging
problem. Ideally, a detection system (or detector) not only should be able to
detect whether or not a program contains vulnerabilities, but also should be
able to pinpoint the type of a vulnerability in question. Existing
vulnerability detection methods based on deep learning can detect the presence
of vulnerabilities (i.e., addressing the binary classification or detection
problem), but cannot pinpoint types of vulnerabilities (i.e., incapable of
addressing multiclass classification). In this paper, we propose the first deep
learning-based system for multiclass vulnerability detection, dubbed
$\mu$VulDeePecker. The key insight underlying $\mu$VulDeePecker is the concept
of code attention, which can capture information that can help pinpoint types
of vulnerabilities, even when the samples are small. For this purpose, we
create a dataset from scratch and use it to evaluate the effectiveness of
$\mu$VulDeePecker. Experimental results show that $\mu$VulDeePecker is
effective for multiclass vulnerability detection and that accommodating
control-dependence (other than data-dependence) can lead to higher detection
capabilities.

Title: VulDeeLocator: A Deep Learning-based Fine-grained Vulnerability Detector
Authors: Zhen Li, Deqing Zou, Shouhuai Xu, Zhaoxuan Chen, Yawei Zhu, Hai Jin
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Automatically detecting software vulnerabilities is an important problem that
has attracted much attention. However, existing vulnerability detectors still
cannot achieve the vulnerability detection capability and locating precision
that would warrant their adoption for real-world use. In this paper, we present
Vulnerability Deep Learning-based Locator (VulDeeLocator), a deep
learning-based fine-grained vulnerability detector, for C programs with source
code. VulDeeLocator advances the state-of-the-art by simultaneously achieving a
high detection capability and a high locating precision. When applied to three
real-world software products, VulDeeLocator detects four vulnerabilities that
are not reported in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD); among these four
vulnerabilities, three are not known to exist in these products until now, but
the other one has been "silently" patched by the vendor when releasing newer
versions of the vulnerable product. The core innovations underlying
VulDeeLocator are (i) the leverage of intermediate code to accommodate semantic
information that cannot be conveyed by source code-based representations, and
(ii) the concept of granularity refinement for precisely pinning down locations
of vulnerabilities.

incorporated in LIP, which can be viewed as explicit modeling of the
adversary's background knowledge. It enables the design of privacy-preserving
mechanisms leveraging the prior distribution, which can potentially achieve a
better utility-privacy tradeoff than context-free notions such as Local
Differential Privacy (LDP). We present an optimization framework to minimize
the mean square error in the data aggregation while protecting the privacy of
each individual user's input data or a correlated latent variable while
satisfying LIP constraints. Then, we study two different types of applications:
(weighted) summation and histogram estimation, and derive the optimal
context-aware data perturbation parameters for each case, based on randomized
response type of mechanism. We further compare the utility-privacy tradeoff
between LIP and LDP and theoretically explain why the incorporation of prior
knowledge enlarges feasible regions of the perturbation parameters, which
thereby leads to higher utility. We also extend the LIP-based privacy
mechanisms to the more general case when exact prior knowledge is not
available. Finally, we validate our analysis by simulations using both
synthetic and real-world data. Results show that our LIP-based privacy
mechanism provides better utility-privacy tradeoffs than LDP, and the advantage
of LIP is even more significant when the prior distribution is more skewed.

Title: Bridging Knowledge Graphs to Generate Scene Graphs
Authors: Alireza Zareian, Svebor Karaman, Shih-Fu Chang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Scene graphs are powerful representations that encode images into their
abstract semantic elements, i.e, objects and their interactions, which
facilitates visual comprehension and explainable reasoning. On the other hand,
commonsense knowledge graphs are rich repositories that encode how the world is
structured, and how general concepts interact. In this paper, we present a
unified formulation of these two constructs, where a scene graph is seen as an
image-conditioned instantiation of a commonsense knowledge graph. Based on this
new perspective, we re-formulate scene graph generation as the inference of a
bridge between the scene and commonsense graphs, where each entity or predicate
instance in the scene graph has to be linked to its corresponding entity or
predicate class in the commonsense graph. To this end, we propose a
heterogeneous graph inference framework allowing to exploit the rich structure
within the scene and commonsense at the same time. Through extensive
experiments, we show the proposed method achieves significant improvement over
the state of the art.

Title: Perception and Decision-Making of Autonomous Systems in the Era of
  Learning: An Overview
Authors: Yang Tang, Chaoqiang Zhao, Jianrui Wang, Chongzhen Zhang, Qiyu Sun,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 23 pages, 7 figures
\\
  The ability of inferring its own ego-motion, autonomous understanding the
surroundings and planning trajectory are the features of autonomous robot
systems. Therefore, in order to improve the perception and decision-making
ability of autonomous robot systems, Simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) and autonomous trajectory planning are widely researched, especially
combining learning-based algorithms.
  In this paper, we mainly focus on the application of learning-based
approaches to perception and decision-making, and survey the current
state-of-the-art SLAM and trajectory planning algorithms. Firstly, we delineate
the existing classical SLAM solutions and review deep learning-based methods of
environment perception and understanding, including deep learning-based
monocular depth estimation, ego-motion prediction, image enhancement, object
detection, semantic segmentation and their combinations with previous SLAM
frameworks. Secondly, we summarize the existing path planning and trajectory
planning methods and survey the navigation methods based on reinforcement
learning. Finally, several challenges and promising directions are concluded to
related researchers for future work in both autonomous perception and
decision-making.

Title: VisionNet: A Drivable-space-based Interactive Motion Prediction Network
  for Autonomous Driving
Authors: Yanliang Zhu, Deheng Qian, Dongchun Ren, Huaxia Xia
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  The comprehension of environmental traffic situation largely ensures the
driving safety of autonomous vehicles. Recently, the mission has been
investigated by plenty of researches, while it is hard to be well addressed due
to the limitation of collective influence in complex scenarios. These
approaches model the interactions through the spatial relations between the
target obstacle and its neighbors. However, they oversimplify the challenge
since the training stage of the interactions lacks effective supervision. As a
result, these models are far from promising. More intuitively, we transform the
problem into calculating the interaction-aware drivable spaces and propose the
CNN-based VisionNet for trajectory prediction. The VisionNet accepts a sequence
of motion states, i.e., location, velocity, and acceleration, to estimate the
future drivable spaces. The reified interactions significantly increase the
interpretation ability of the VisionNet and refine the prediction. To further
advance the performance, we propose an interactive loss to guide the generation
of the drivable spaces. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed VisionNet.

Title: Weakly Supervised Visual Semantic Parsing
Authors: Alireza Zareian, Svebor Karaman, Shih-Fu Chang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to extract entities, predicates and their
intrinsic structure from images, leading to a deep understanding of visual
content, with many potential applications such as visual reasoning and image
retrieval. Nevertheless, computer vision is still far from a practical solution
for this task. Existing SGG methods require millions of manually annotated
bounding boxes for scene graph entities in a large set of images. Moreover,
they are computationally inefficient, as they exhaustively process all pairs of
object proposals to predict their relationships. In this paper, we address
those two limitations by first proposing a generalized formulation of SGG,
namely Visual Semantic Parsing, which disentangles entity and predicate
prediction, and enables sub-quadratic performance. Then we propose the Visual
Semantic Parsing Network, \textsc{VSPNet}, based on a novel three-stage message
propagation network, as well as a role-driven attention mechanism to route
messages efficiently without a quadratic cost. Finally, we propose the first
graph-based weakly supervised learning framework based on a novel graph
alignment algorithm, which enables training without bounding box annotations.
Through extensive experiments on the Visual Genome dataset, we show
\textsc{VSPNet} outperforms weakly supervised baselines significantly and
approaches fully supervised performance, while being five times faster.

  In the last years, image classification processes like neural networks in the
area of art-history and Heritage Informatics have experienced a broad
distribution (Lang and Ommer 2018). These methods face several challenges,
including the handling of comparatively small amounts of data as well as
high-dimensional data in the Digital Humanities. Here, a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) is used that output is not, as usual, a series of flat text
labels but a series of semantically loaded vectors. These vectors result from a
Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) which is generated from an in-domain text

\\
  While hardware implementations of inference routines for Binarized Neural
Networks (BNNs) are plentiful, current realizations of efficient BNN hardware
training accelerators, suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices,
leave much to be desired. Conventional BNN hardware training accelerators
perform forward and backward propagations with parameters adopting binary
representations, and optimization using parameters adopting floating or
fixed-point real-valued representations--requiring two distinct sets of network
parameters. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly training method that,
contrary to conventional methods, progressively binarizes a singular set of
fixed-point network parameters, yielding notable reductions in power and
resource utilizations. We use the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL development
environment to train our progressively binarizing DNNs on an OpenVINO FPGA. We
benchmark our training approach on both GPUs and FPGAs using CIFAR-10 and
compare it to conventional BNNs.

Title: Disentangling Representations using Gaussian Processes in Variational
  Autoencoders for Video Prediction
Authors: Sarthak Bhagat, Shagun Uppal, Vivian Yin and Nengli Lim
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We introduce MGP-VAE, a variational autoencoder which uses Gaussian processes
(GP) to model the latent space distribution. We employ MGP-VAE for the
unsupervised learning of video sequences to obtain disentangled
representations. Previous work in this area has mainly been confined to
separating dynamic information from static content. We improve on previous
results by establishing a framework by which multiple features, static or
dynamic, can be disentangled. Specifically we use fractional Brownian motions
(fBM) and Brownian bridges (BB) to enforce an inter-frame correlation structure
in each independent channel. We show that varying this correlation structure
enables one to capture different aspects of variation in the data. We
demonstrate the quality of our disentangled representations on numerous
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and also perform quantitative
tests on a video prediction task. In addition, we introduce a novel geodesic
loss function which takes into account the curvature of the data manifold to
improve learning in the prediction task. Our experiments show quantitatively
that the combination of our improved disentangled representations with the
novel loss function enable MGP-VAE to outperform the state-of-the-art in video
prediction.

\\
  Tables present summarized and structured information to the reader, which
makes table structure extraction an important part of document understanding
applications. However, table structure identification is a hard problem not
only because of the large variation in the table layouts and styles, but also
owing to the variations in the page layouts and the noise contamination levels.
A lot of research has been done to identify table structure, most of which is
based on applying heuristics with the aid of optical character recognition
(OCR) to hand pick layout features of the tables. These methods fail to
generalize well because of the variations in the table layouts and the errors
generated by OCR. In this paper, we have proposed a robust deep learning based
approach to extract rows and columns from a detected table in document images
with a high precision. In the proposed solution, the table images are first
pre-processed and then fed to a bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network with
Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) followed by a fully-connected layer with soft max
activation. The network scans the images from top-to-bottom as well as
left-to-right and classifies each input as either a row-separator or a
column-separator. We have benchmarked our system on publicly available UNLV as
well as ICDAR 2013 datasets on which it outperformed the state-of-the-art table
structure extraction systems by a significant margin.

Title: Fast Neural Network Adaptation via Parameter Remapping and Architecture
  Search
Authors: Jiemin Fang, Yuzhu Sun, Kangjian Peng, Qian Zhang, Yuan Li, Wenyu Liu,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ICLR 2020
\\
  Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance in many computer vision
tasks. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic segmentation and object detection
approaches reuse neural network architectures designed for image classification
as the backbone, commonly pre-trained on ImageNet. However, performance gains
can be achieved by designing network architectures specifically for detection
and segmentation, as shown by recent neural architecture search (NAS) research
for detection and segmentation. One major challenge though, is that ImageNet
pre-training of the search space representation (a.k.a. super network) or the
searched networks incurs huge computational cost. In this paper, we propose a
Fast Neural Network Adaptation (FNA) method, which can adapt both the
architecture and parameters of a seed network (e.g. a high performing manually
designed backbone) to become a network with different depth, width, or kernels
via a Parameter Remapping technique, making it possible to utilize NAS for
detection/segmentation tasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we
conduct FNA on MobileNetV2 to obtain new networks for both segmentation and
detection that clearly out-perform existing networks designed both manually and
by NAS. The total computation cost of FNA is significantly less than SOTA
segmentation/detection NAS approaches: 1737$\times$ less than DPC, 6.8$\times$
less than Auto-DeepLab and 7.4$\times$ less than DetNAS. The code is available
at https://github.com/JaminFong/FNA.

Title: An Analysis of Object Representations in Deep Visual Trackers
Authors: Ross Goroshin, Jonathan Tompson, Debidatta Dwibedi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Fully convolutional deep correlation networks are integral components of
state-of the-art approaches to single object visual tracking. It is commonly
assumed that these networks perform tracking by detection by matching features
of the object instance with features of the entire frame. Strong architectural
priors and conditioning on the object representation is thought to encourage
this tracking strategy. Despite these strong priors, we show that deep trackers
often default to tracking by saliency detection - without relying on the object
instance representation. Our analysis shows that despite being a useful prior,
salience detection can prevent the emergence of more robust tracking strategies
in deep networks. This leads us to introduce an auxiliary detection task that
encourages more discriminative object representations that improve tracking
performance.

  We present an algorithm to generate diverse foreground objects and composite
them into background images using a GAN architecture. Given an object class, a
user-provided bounding box, and a background image, we first use a mask
generator to create an object shape, and then use a texture generator to fill
the mask such that the texture integrates with the background. By separating
the problem of object insertion into these two stages, we show that our model
allows us to improve the realism of diverse object generation that also agrees
with the provided background image. Our results on the challenging COCO dataset
show improved overall quality and diversity compared to state-of-the-art object
insertion approaches.

\\
  Free-hand sketches are highly hieroglyphic and illustrative, which have been
widely used by humans to depict objects or stories from ancient times to the
present. The recent prevalence of touchscreen devices has made sketch creation
a much easier task than ever and consequently made sketch-oriented applications
increasingly more popular. The prosperity of deep learning has also immensely
promoted the research for the free-hand sketch. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of the free-hand sketch oriented deep learning techniques.
The main contents of this survey include: (i) The intrinsic traits and
domain-unique challenges of the free-hand sketch are discussed, to clarify the
essential differences between free-hand sketch and other data modalities, e.g.,
natural photo. (ii) The development of the free-hand sketch community in the
deep learning era is reviewed, by surveying the existing datasets, research
topics, and the state-of-the-art methods via a detailed taxonomy. (iii)
Moreover, the bottlenecks, open problems, and potential research directions of
this community have also been discussed to promote the future works.

\\
  Creating plausible virtual actors from images of real actors remains one of
the key challenges in computer vision and computer graphics. Marker-less human
motion estimation and shape modeling from images in the wild bring this
challenge to the fore. Although the recent advances on view synthesis and
image-to-image translation, currently available formulations are limited to
transfer solely style and do not take into account the character's motion and
shape, which are by nature intermingled to produce plausible human forms. In
this paper, we propose a unifying formulation for transferring appearance and
retargeting human motion from monocular videos that regards all these aspects.
Our method is composed of four main components and synthesizes new videos of
people in a different context where they were initially recorded. Differently
from recent appearance transferring methods, our approach takes into account
body shape, appearance and motion constraints. The evaluation is performed with
several experiments using publicly available real videos containing hard
conditions. Our method is able to transfer both human motion and appearance
outperforming state-of-the-art methods, while preserving specific features of
the motion that must be maintained (e.g., feet touching the floor, hands
touching a particular object) and holding the best visual quality and
appearance metrics such as Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Learned Perceptual
Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS).

Title: Don't Forget The Past: Recurrent Depth Estimation from Monocular Video
Authors: Vaishakh Patil, Wouter Van Gansbeke, Dengxin Dai, Luc Van Gool
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO eess.IV
\\
  Autonomous cars need continuously updated depth information. Thus far, the
depth is mostly estimated independently for a single frame at a time, even if
the method starts from video input. Our method produces a time series of depth
maps, which makes it an ideal candidate for online learning approaches. In
particular, we put three different types of depth estimation (supervised depth
prediction, self-supervised depth prediction, and self-supervised depth
completion) into a common framework. We integrate the corresponding networks
with a convolutional LSTM such that the spatiotemporal structures of depth
across frames can be exploited to yield a more accurate depth estimation. Our
method is flexible. It can be applied to monocular videos only or be combined
with different types of sparse depth patterns. We carefully study the
architecture of the recurrent network and its training strategy. We are first
to successfully exploit recurrent networks for real-time self-supervised
monocular depth estimation and completion. Extensive experiments show that our
recurrent method outperforms its image-based counterpart consistently and
significantly in both self-supervised scenarios. It also outperforms previous
depth estimation methods of the three popular groups.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present a robust estimator for fitting multiple parametric models of the
same form to noisy measurements. Applications include finding multiple
vanishing points in man-made scenes, fitting planes to architectural imagery,
or estimating multiple rigid motions within the same sequence. In contrast to
previous works, which resorted to hand-crafted search strategies for multiple
model detection, we learn the search strategy from data. A neural network
conditioned on previously detected models guides a RANSAC estimator to
different subsets of all measurements, thereby finding model instances one
after another. We train our method supervised as well as self-supervised. For
supervised training of the search strategy, we contribute a new dataset for
vanishing point estimation. Leveraging this dataset, the proposed algorithm is
superior with respect to other robust estimators as well as to designated
vanishing point estimation algorithms. For self-supervised learning of the
search, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on multi-homography estimation and
demonstrate an accuracy that is superior to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Extracting Multiple Viewpoint Models from Relational Databases
Authors: Alessandro Berti, Wil van der Aalst
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  Much time in process mining projects is spent on finding and understanding
data sources and extracting the event data needed. As a result, only a fraction
of time is spent actually applying techniques to discover, control and predict
the business process. Moreover, current process mining techniques assume a
single case notion. However, in reallife processes often different case notions
are intertwined. For example, events of the same order handling process may
refer to customers, orders, order lines, deliveries, and payments. Therefore,
we propose to use Multiple Viewpoint (MVP) models that relate events through
objects and that relate activities through classes. The required event data are
much closer to existing relational databases. MVP models provide a holistic
view on the process, but also allow for the extraction of classical event logs
using different viewpoints. This way existing process mining techniques can be
used for each viewpoint without the need for new data extractions and
transformations. We provide a toolchain allowing for the discovery of MVP
models (annotated with performance and frequency information) from relational
databases. Moreover, we demonstrate that classical process mining techniques
can be applied to any selected viewpoint.

Title: HyperSched: Dynamic Resource Reallocation for Model Development on a
  Deadline
Authors: Richard Liaw, Romil Bhardwaj, Lisa Dunlap, Yitian Zou, Joseph
  Gonzalez, Ion Stoica, Alexey Tumanov
Categories: cs.DC cs.LG
\\
  Prior research in resource scheduling for machine learning training workloads
has largely focused on minimizing job completion times. Commonly, these model
training workloads collectively search over a large number of parameter values
that control the learning process in a hyperparameter search. It is preferable
to identify and maximally provision the best-performing hyperparameter
configuration (trial) to achieve the highest accuracy result as soon as
possible.
  To optimally trade-off evaluating multiple configurations and training the
most promising ones by a fixed deadline, we design and build HyperSched -- a
dynamic application-level resource scheduler to track, identify, and
preferentially allocate resources to the best performing trials to maximize
accuracy by the deadline. HyperSched leverages three properties of a
hyperparameter search workload over-looked in prior work - trial disposability,
progressively identifiable rankings among different configurations, and
space-time constraints - to outperform standard hyperparameter search
algorithms across a variety of benchmarks.

Title: From Trend Analysis to New Virtual World System Design Requirements and
  Requirement Satisfaction Study
Authors: Bingqing Shen, Weiming Tan, Jingzhi Guo, Bin Wang
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: Submitted to PRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality
\\
  Virtual worlds have become global platforms connecting millions of people and
containing various technologies. The development of technology, shift of market
value, and change of user preference shape the features of virtual worlds. In
this paper, we first study the new features of virtual worlds and emergent
requirements of system development through trend analysis. Based on the trend
analysis, we constructed the new design requirement space. We then discuss the
requirement satisfaction of existing virtual world system architectures and
highlight their limitations through a literature survey. The comparison of
existing system architectures sheds some light on future virtual world system
development to match the changing trends of the user market. At the end of this
study, we briefly introduce our ongoing study, a new architecture, called
Virtual Net, and discuss its possibility in requirement satisfaction and new
research challenges.

Title: GraphACT: Accelerating GCN Training on CPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Platforms
Authors: Hanqing Zeng, Viktor Prasanna
Categories: cs.DC cs.LG
Comments: Published in ACM/SIGDA FPGA '20
DOI: 10.1145/3373087.3375312
\\
  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art deep
learning model for representation learning on graphs. It is challenging to
accelerate training of GCNs, due to (1) substantial and irregular data
communication to propagate information within the graph, and (2) intensive
computation to propagate information along the neural network layers. To
address these challenges, we design a novel accelerator for training GCNs on
CPU-FPGA heterogeneous systems, by incorporating multiple
algorithm-architecture co-optimizations. We first analyze the computation and
communication characteristics of various GCN training algorithms, and select a
subgraph-based algorithm that is well suited for hardware execution. To
optimize the feature propagation within subgraphs, we propose a lightweight
pre-processing step based on a graph theoretic approach. Such pre-processing
performed on the CPU significantly reduces the memory access requirements and
the computation to be performed on the FPGA. To accelerate the weight update in
GCN layers, we propose a systolic array based design for efficient
parallelization. We integrate the above optimizations into a complete hardware
pipeline, and analyze its load-balance and resource utilization by accurate
performance modeling. We evaluate our design on a Xilinx Alveo U200 board
hosted by a 40-core Xeon server. On three large graphs, we achieve an order of
magnitude training speedup with negligible accuracy loss, compared with
state-of-the-art implementation on a multi-core platform.

Title: High Performance Depthwise and Pointwise Convolutions on Mobile Devices
Authors: Pengfei Zhang, Eric Lo, Baotong Lu
Categories: cs.DC cs.PF
Comments: 8 pages, Thirty-Four AAAI conference on Artificial Intelligence
\\
  Lightweight convolutional neural networks (e.g., MobileNets) are specifically
designed to carry out inference directly on mobile devices. Among the various
lightweight models, depthwise convolution (DWConv) and pointwise convolution
(PWConv) are their key operations. In this paper, we observe that the existing
implementations of DWConv and PWConv are not well utilizing the ARM processors
in the mobile devices, and exhibit lots of cache misses under multi-core and
poor data reuse at register level. We propose techniques to re-optimize the
implementations of DWConv and PWConv based on ARM architecture. Experimental
results show that our implementation can respectively achieve a speedup of up
to 5.5x and 2.1x against TVM (Chen et al. 2018) on DWConv and PWConv.

Title: SmartWatts: Self-Calibrating Software-Defined Power Meter for Containers
Authors: Guillaume Fieni, Romain Rouvoy, Lionel Seinturier
Categories: cs.DC cs.PF
\\
  Fine-grained power monitoring of software activities becomes unavoidable to
maximize the power usage efficiency of data centers. In particular, achieving
an optimal scheduling of containers requires the deployment of software-defined
power~meters to go beyond the granularity of hardware power monitoring sensors,
such as Power Distribution Units (PDU) or Intel's Running Average Power Limit
(RAPL), to deliver power estimations of activities at the granularity of
software~containers. However, the definition of the underlying power models
that estimate the power consumption remains a long and fragile process that is
tightly coupled to the host machine.
  To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces SmartWatts: a
lightweight power monitoring system that adopts online calibration to
automatically adjust the CPU and DRAM power models in order to maximize the
accuracy of runtime power estimations of containers. Unlike state-of-the-art
techniques, SmartWatts does not require any a priori training phase or hardware
equipment to configure the power models and can therefore be deployed on a wide
range of machines including the latest power optimizations, at no cost.

Comments: To Appear in 2020 IEEE International Symposium on High Performance
  Computer Architecture
\\
  In this work, we first characterize the hybrid execution patterns of GCNs on
Intel Xeon CPU. Guided by the characterization, we design a GCN accelerator,
HyGCN, using a hybrid architecture to efficiently perform GCNs. Specifically,
first, we build a new programming model to exploit the fine-grained parallelism
for our hardware design. Second, we propose a hardware design with two
efficient processing engines to alleviate the irregularity of Aggregation phase
and leverage the regularity of Combination phase. Besides, these engines can
exploit various parallelism and reuse highly reusable data efficiently. Third,
we optimize the overall system via inter-engine pipeline for inter-phase fusion
and priority-based off-chip memory access coordination to improve off-chip
bandwidth utilization. Compared to the state-of-the-art software framework
running on Intel Xeon CPU and NVIDIA V100 GPU, our work achieves on average
1509$\times$ speedup with 2500$\times$ energy reduction and average 6.5$\times$
speedup with 10$\times$ energy reduction, respectively.

Title: A Multi-Objective Approach for Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Brokering in
  Dynamic Markets
Authors: Fabio Lopez-Pires and Lino Chamorro and Benjamin Baran
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Cloud Service Brokers (CSBs) facilitate complex resource allocation
decisions, efficiently mapping dynamic tenant demands onto dynamic provider
offers, where several objectives should ideally be considered. This work
proposes for the first time a pure multi-objective formulation of a
broker-oriented Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) problem for dynamic
environments, simultaneously optimizing the following objective functions: (i)
Total Infrastructure CPU (TICPU), (ii) Total Infrastructure Memory (TIMEM) and
(iii) Total Infrastructure Price (TIP) while considering load balancing across
providers. To solve the formulated multi-objective problem, a Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) is proposed. Considering that each time a demand
(or offer) change occurs, a set of non-dominated solutions is found by
Pareto-based algorithms as the one proposed, different selection strategies
were evaluated in order to automatically select a convenient solution.
Additionally, the proposed algorithm, including the considered selection
strategies, was compared against mono-objective state-of-the-art alternatives
in different scenarios with real data from providers in actual markets.
Experimental results demonstrate that a pure multi-objective optimization
approach considering the preferred solution selection strategy (S3)
outperformed other mono-objective evaluated alternatives.

Title: Synchronous Byzantine Lattice Agreement in ${\cal O}(\log (f))$ Rounds
Authors: Giuseppe Antonio Di Luna, Emmanuelle Anceaume, Silvia Bonomi, Leonardo
  Querzoni
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  In the Lattice Agreement (LA) problem, originally proposed by Attiya et al.,
a set of processes has to decide on a chain of a lattice. More precisely, each
correct process proposes an element $e$ of a certain join-semi lattice $L$ and
it has to decide on a value that contains $e$. Moreover, any pair $p_i,p_j$ of
correct processes has to decide two values $dec_i$ and $dec_j$ that are
comparable (e.g. $dec_i \leq dec_j$ or $dec_j < dec_i$). LA has been studied
for its practical applications, as example it can be used to implement a
snapshot objects or a replicated state machine with commutative operations.
Interestingly, the study of the Byzantine Lattice Agreement started only
recently, and it has been mainly devoted to asynchronous systems. The
synchronous case has been object of a recent pre-print where Zheng et al.
propose an algorithm terminating in ${\cal O}(\sqrt f)$ rounds and tolerating
$n/3-1$ Byzantine processes. In this paper we present new contributions for the
synchronous case. We investigate the problem in the usual message passing model
for a system of $n$ processes with distinct unique IDs. We first prove that,
when only authenticated channels are available, the problem cannot be solved if
$f=n/3$ or more processes are Byzantine. We then propose a novel algorithm that
works in a synchronous system model with signatures (i.e., the {\em
authenticated message} model), tolerates up to $f$ byzantine failures (where
$f<n/3$) and that terminates in ${\cal O}(\log f)$ rounds. We discuss how to
remove authenticated messages at the price of algorithm resiliency ($f < n/4$).

Title: Induced odd cycle packing number, independent sets, and chromatic number
Authors: Zden\v{e}k Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Jakub Pek\'arek
Categories: cs.DM cs.DS math.CO
\\
  The \emph{induced odd cycle packing number} $\text{iocp}(G)$ of a graph $G$
is the maximum integer $k$ such that $G$ contains an induced subgraph
consisting of $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint odd cycles. Motivated by
applications to geometric graphs, Bonamy et al. proved that graphs of bounded
induced odd cycle packing number, bounded VC dimension, and linear independence
number admit a randomized EPTAS for the independence number. We show that the
assumption of bounded VC dimension is not necessary, exhibiting a randomized
algorithm that for any integers $k\ge 0$ and $t\ge 1$ and any $n$-vertex graph
$G$ of induced odd cycle packing number returns in time $O_{k,t}(n^{k+4})$ an
independent set of $G$ whose size is at least $\alpha(G)-n/t$ with high
probability. In addition, we present $\chi$-boundedness results for graphs with
bounded odd cycle packing number, and use them to design a QPTAS for the
independence number only assuming bounded induced odd cycle packing number.

  \sum_{i=0}^n\min(2^i,2^{2^{n-i}}-1). \] We show that for the nondeterministic

need the strictly increasing initial terms in this sum.

  New algorithmic and hardware developments over the past two decades have

finding growing popularity in scientific visualization and games. However,
interactive ray tracing has not been as widely explored in the context of
production film rendering, where challenges due to the complexity of the models
and, from a practical standpoint, their unavailability to the wider research

experimentation. In this paper, we detail the challenges posed by this scene to
an interactive ray tracer, and the solutions we have employed and developed to
enable interactive path tracing of the scene with full geometric and shading

Title: Egoistic Incentives Based on Zero-Determinant Alliances for Large-Scale
  Systems
Authors: Shengling Wang, Peizi Ma, Qin Hu, Xiuzhen Cheng, and Weifeng Lv
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  Social dilemmas exist in various fields and give rise to the so-called
free-riding problem, leading to collective fiascos. The difficulty of tracking
individual behaviors makes egoistic incentives in large-scale systems a
challenging task. However, the state-of-the-art mechanisms are either
individual-based or state-dependent, resulting in low efficiency in large-scale
networks. In this paper, we propose an egoistic incentive mechanism from a
connected (network) perspective rather than an isolated (individual)
perspective by taking advantage of the social nature of people. We make use of
a zero-determinant (ZD) strategy for rewarding cooperation and sanctioning
defection. After proving cooperation is the dominant strategy for ZD players,
we optimize their deployment to facilitate cooperation over the whole system.
To further speed up cooperation, we derive a ZD alliance strategy for
sequential multiple-player repeated games to empower ZD players with higher
controllable leverage, which undoubtedly enriches the theoretical system of ZD
strategies and broadens their application domain. Our approach is stateless and
stable, which contributes to its scalability. Extensive simulations based on a
real world trace data as well as synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed egoistic incentive approach under different networking
scenarios.

  The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is the most effective way to prevent
HPV-related cancers. Integrating provider vaccine counseling is crucial to
improving HPV vaccine completion rates. Automating the counseling experience
through a conversational agent could help improve HPV vaccine coverage and
reduce the burden of vaccine counseling for providers. In a previous study, we
tested a simulated conversational agent that provided HPV vaccine counseling
for parents using the Wizard of OZ protocol. In the current study, we assessed
the conversational agent among young college adults (n=24), a population that
may have missed the HPV vaccine during their adolescence when vaccination is
recommended. We also administered surveys for system and voice usability, and
for health beliefs concerning the HPV vaccine. Participants perceived the agent
to have high usability that is slightly better or equivalent to other voice
interactive interfaces, and there is some evidence that the agent impacted
their beliefs concerning the harms, uncertainty, and risk denials for the HPV
vaccine. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential for conversational
agents to be an impactful tool for health promotion endeavors.

Title: Surfacing Visualization Mirages
Authors: Andrew McNutt, Gordon Kindlmann, Michael Correll
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Dirty data and deceptive design practices can undermine, invert, or
invalidate the purported messages of charts and graphs. These failures can
arise silently: a conclusion derived from a particular visualization may look
plausible unless the analyst looks closer and discovers an issue with the
backing data, visual specification, or their own assumptions. We term such
silent but significant failures "visualization mirages". We describe a
conceptual model of mirages and show how they can be generated at every stage
of the visual analytics process. We adapt a methodology from software testing,
"metamorphic testing", as a way of automatically surfacing potential mirages at
the visual encoding stage of analysis through modifications to the underlying
data and chart specification. We show that metamorphic testing can reliably
identify mirages across a variety of chart types with relatively little prior
knowledge of the data or the domain.

Title: Emo-CNN for Perceiving Stress from Audio Signals: A Brain Chemistry
  Approach
Authors: Anup Anand Deshmukh, Catherine Soladie, Renaud Seguier
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 2 pages, 2 tables and 2 figures
\\
  Emotion plays a key role in many applications like healthcare, to gather
patients emotional behavior. There are certain emotions which are given more
importance due to their effectiveness in understanding human feelings. In this
paper, we propose an approach that models human stress from audio signals. The
research challenge in speech emotion detection is defining the very meaning of
stress and being able to categorize it in a precise manner. Supervised Machine
Learning models, including state of the art Deep Learning classification
methods, rely on the availability of clean and labelled data. One of the
problems in affective computation and emotion detection is the limited amount
of annotated data of stress. The existing labelled stress emotion datasets are
highly subjective to the perception of the annotator.
  We address the first issue of feature selection by exploiting the use of
traditional MFCC features in Convolutional Neural Network. Our experiments show
that Emo-CNN consistently and significantly outperforms the popular existing
methods over multiple datasets. It achieves 90.2% categorical accuracy on the
Emo-DB dataset. To tackle the second and the more significant problem of
subjectivity in stress labels, we use Lovheim's cube, which is a 3-dimensional
projection of emotions. The cube aims at explaining the relationship between
these neurotransmitters and the positions of emotions in 3D space. The learnt
emotion representations from the Emo-CNN are mapped to the cube using three
component PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which is then used to model human
stress. This proposed approach not only circumvents the need for labelled
stress data but also complies with the psychological theory of emotions given
by Lovheim's cube. We believe that this work is the first step towards creating
a connection between Artificial Intelligence and the chemistry of human
emotions.

  Large-scale shape-changing interfaces have great potential, but creating such
systems requires substantial time, cost, space, and efforts, which hinders the
research community to explore interactions beyond the scale of human hands. We
introduce modular inflatable actuators as building blocks for prototyping
room-scale shape-changing interfaces. Each actuator can change its height from
15cm to 150cm, actuated and controlled by air pressure. Each unit is low-cost
(8 USD), lightweight (10 kg), compact (15 cm), and robust, making it
well-suited for prototyping room-scale shape transformations. Moreover, our
modular and reconfigurable design allows researchers and designers to quickly
construct different geometries and to explore various applications. This paper
contributes to the design and implementation of highly extendable inflatable
actuators, and demonstrates a range of scenarios that can leverage this modular
building block.

explainable AI products. To do so, we develop an algorithm-informed XAI
question bank in which user needs for explainability are represented as
prototypical questions users might ask about the AI, and use it as a study
probe. Our work contributes insights into the design space of XAI, informs
efforts to support design practices in this space, and identifies opportunities
for future XAI work. We also provide an extended XAI question bank and discuss
how it can be used for creating user-centered XAI.

Title: Dark Patterns after the GDPR: Scraping Consent Pop-ups and Demonstrating

  New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to
conform with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its
requirements for consent when companies collect and process users' personal
data. This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's
consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the
top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied
consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet the minimal requirements that we set
based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40
participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent
choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect;
removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22--23
percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page
decreases consent by 8--20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical
basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular
the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an
effective way to increase compliance.

Title: On the Evaluation of Intelligence Process Automation
Authors: Deborah Ferreira, Julia Rozanova, Krishna Dubba, Dell Zhang, Andre
  Freitas
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: Submitted to the AAAI-20 Workshop on Intelligent Process Automation
\\
  Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) is emerging as a sub-field of AI to
support the automation of long-tail processes which requires the coordination
of tasks across different systems. So far, the field of IPA has been largely
driven by systems and use cases, lacking a more formal definition of the task
and its assessment. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a
formalisation of IPA and by proposing specific metrics to support the empirical
evaluation of IPA systems. This work also compares and contrasts IPA against
related tasks such as end-user programming and program synthesis.

Title: Citation Recommendations Considering Content and Structural Context
  Embedding
Authors: Yang Zhang, Qiang Ma
Categories: cs.IR
Journal-ref: 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing
\\
  The number of academic papers being published is increasing exponentially in
recent years, and recommending adequate citations to assist researchers in
writing papers is a non-trivial task. Conventional approaches may not be
optimal, as the recommended papers may already be known to the users, or be
solely relevant to the surrounding context but not other ideas discussed in the
manuscript. In this work, we propose a novel embedding algorithm DocCit2Vec,
along with the new concept of ``structural context'', to tackle the
aforementioned issues. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performances
to baseline models in extensive experiments designed to simulate practical
usage scenarios.

  For many years, achievements and discoveries made by scientists are made
aware through research papers published in appropriate journals or conferences.
Often, established scientists and especially newbies are caught up in the
dilemma of choosing an appropriate conference to get their work through. Every
scientific conference and journal is inclined towards a particular field of
research and there is a vast multitude of them for any particular field.
Choosing an appropriate venue is vital as it helps in reaching out to the right
audience and also to further one's chance of getting their paper published. In
this work, we address the problem of recommending appropriate conferences to
the authors to increase their chances of acceptance. We present three different
approaches for the same involving the use of social network of the authors and
the content of the paper in the settings of dimensionality reduction and topic
modeling. In all these approaches, we apply Correspondence Analysis (CA) to
derive appropriate relationships between the entities in question, such as
conferences and papers. Our models show promising results when compared with
existing methods such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering and
hybrid filtering.

Title: Managing Device Lifecycle: Reconfigurable Constrained Codes for
  M/T/Q/P-LC Flash Memories
Authors: Ahmed Hareedy, Beyza Dabak, Robert Calderbank
Categories: cs.IT math.IT

  Transactions on Information Theory (TIT), a short version is to be submitted

\\
  Flash memory devices are winning the competition for storage density against
magnetic recording devices. This outcome results from advances in physics that
allow storage of more than one bit per cell, coupled with advances in signal
processing that reduce the effect of physical instabilities. Constrained codes
are used in storage to avoid problematic patterns. Recently, we introduced
binary symmetric lexicographically-ordered constrained codes (LOCO codes) for
data storage and data transmission. This paper introduces simple constrained
codes that support non-binary physical substrates; multi, triple, quad, and the
currently-in-development penta-level cell (M/T/Q/P-LC) Flash memories. The new
codes can be easily modified if problematic patterns change with time. These
codes are designed to mitigate inter-cell interference, which is a critical
source of error in Flash devices. The occurrence of errors is a consequence of
parasitic capacitances in and across floating gate transistors, resulting in
charge propagation from cells being programmed to the highest charge level to
neighboring cells being programmed to lower levels. The new codes are called
$q$-ary asymmetric LOCO codes (QA-LOCO codes), and the construction subsumes
codes previously designed for single-level cell (SLC) Flash devices (A-LOCO
codes). QA-LOCO codes work for a Flash device with any number, $q$, of levels
per cell. For $q \geq 4$, we show that QA-LOCO codes can achieve rates greater
than $0.95 \log_2 q$ information bits per coded symbol. The complexity of
encoding and decoding is modest, and reconfiguring a code is as easy as
reprogramming an adder. Capacity-achieving rates, affordable encoding-decoding
complexity, and ease of reconfigurability support the growing development of
M/T/Q/P-LC Flash memory devices, as well as lifecycle management as the
characteristics of these devices change with time.

Title: Unsupervised Learning for Passive Beamforming

\\
  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has recently emerged as a promising
candidate to improve the energy and spectral efficiency of wireless
communication systems. However, the unit modulus constraint on the phase shift
of reflecting elements makes the design of optimal passive beamforming solution
a challenging issue. The conventional approach is to find a suboptimal solution
using the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique, yet the resultant
suboptimal iterative algorithm usually incurs high complexity, hence is not
amenable for real-time implementation. Motivated by this, we propose a deep
learning approach for passive beamforming design in RIS-assisted systems. In
particular, a customized deep neural network is trained offline using the
unsupervised learning mechanism, which is able to make real-time prediction
when deployed online. Simulation results show that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms the conventional SDR-based method in terms of both
performance and complexity.

\\
  Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a recently proposed
waveform for reliable communication in high-speed vehicular communications. It
has better resilience to inter-carrier interference (ICI) as compared to
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In OTFS, information is
generated in the Doppler-delay domain as opposed to time-frequency domain in
conventional OFDM. In this work, we describe OTFS as block-OFDM with a cyclic
prefix and time interleaving. Through this description, we explained the
improved performance of OTFS over OFDM. We also compare the performance of OTFS
against its contender 5G new radio (NR)'s OFDM configuration of variable
subcarrier bandwidth (VSB) while considering practical forward error correction
codes and 3GPP high-speed channel model. We have considered practical channel
estimates in the demodulation and find that OTFS outperforms VSB with 5G NR
parameter. We also study the influence of pilot in OTFS in its peak to average
power ratio (PAPR).

\\
  Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) has been recently proposed as a
promising solution to enhance the spectral and energy efficiency of future
wireless networks by tuning a massive number of low-cost passive reflecting
elements and thereby constructing favorable wireless propagation environment.
Different from the prior works that focus on link-level performance
optimization for IRS-aided wireless systems, this letter characterizes the
spatial throughput of a single-cell multiuser system aided by multiple IRSs
that are randomly deployed in the cell. It is shown by simulation that our
analysis is valid and the IRS-aided system outperforms the full-duplex
relay-aided counterpart system in terms of spatial throughput when the number
of IRSs exceeds a certain value. Moreover, it is shown that different deploying
strategies for IRSs/active relays should be adopted for their respective
throughput maximization. Finally, it is revealed that given the total number of
reflecting elements for IRSs, the system spatial throughput increases when
fewer IRSs are deployed each with more reflecting elements, but at the cost of
more spatially varying user rates.

Title: Minimizing the Age of Information of Cognitive Radio-Based IoT Systems
  Under A Collision Constraint
Authors: Qian Wang, He Chen, Yifan Gu, Yonghui Li, Branka Vucetic

\\
  This paper considers a cognitive radio-based IoT monitoring system,
consisting of an IoT device that aims to update its measurement to a
destination using cognitive radio technique. Specifically, the IoT device as a
secondary user (SIoT), seeks and exploits the spectrum opportunities of the
licensed band vacated by its primary user (PU) to deliver status updates
without causing visible effects to the licensed operation. In this context, the
SIoT should carefully make use of the licensed band and schedule when to
transmit to maintain the timeliness of the status update. We adopt a recent
metric, Age of Information (AoI), to characterize the timeliness of the status
update of the SIoT. We aim to minimize the long-term average AoI of the SIoT
while satisfying the collision constraint imposed by the PU by formulating a
constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem. We first prove the
existence of optimal stationary policy of the CMDP problem. The optimal
stationary policy (termed age-optimal policy) is shown to be a randomized
simple policy that randomizes between two deterministic policies with a fixed
probability. We prove that the two deterministic policies have a threshold
structure and further derive the closed-form expression of average AoI and
collision probability for the deterministic threshold-structured policy by
conducting Markov Chain analysis. The analytical expression offers an efficient
way to calculate the threshold and randomization probability to form the
age-optimal policy. For comparison, we also consider the throughput
maximization policy (termed throughput-optimal policy) and analyze the average
AoI performance under the throughput-optimal policy in the considered system.
Numerical simulations show the superiority of the derived age-optimal policy
over the throughput-optimal policy. We also unveil the impacts of various
system parameters on the corresponding optimal policy and the resultant average
AoI.

Title: Address-Event Variable-Length Compression for Time-Encoded Data
Authors: Sharu Theresa Jose and Osvaldo Simeone
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: submitted to ISIT 2020
\\
  Time-encoded signals, such as social network update logs and spiking traces
in neuromorphic processors, are defined by multiple traces carrying information
in the timing of events, or spikes. When time-encoded data is processed at a
remote site with respect to the location it is produced, the occurrence of
events needs to be encoded and transmitted in a timely fashion. The standard
Address-Event Representation (AER) protocol for neuromorphic chips encodes the
indices of the ``spiking" traces in the payload of a packet produced at the
same time the events are recorded, hence implicitly encoding the events' timing
in the timing of the packet. This paper investigates the potential bandwidth
saving that can be obtained by carrying out variable-length compression of
packets' payloads. Compression leverages both intra-trace and inter-trace
correlations over time that are typical in applications such as social networks
or neuromorphic computing. The approach is based on discrete-time Hawkes
processes and entropy coding with conditional codebooks. Results from an
experiment based on a real-world retweet dataset are also provided.

Title: The importance of phase in complex compressive sensing
Authors: Laurent Jacques and Thomas Feuillen
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 19 pages, 2 figures
\\
  We consider the question of estimating a real low-complexity signal (such as
a sparse vector or a low-rank matrix) from the phase of complex random
measurements, i.e., in a phase-only compressive sensing (PO-CS) scenario. We
show that, with high probability and up to global unknown signal amplitude, we
can perfectly recover such a signal if the sensing matrix is a complex,
Gaussian random matrix and if the number of measurements is large compared to
the complexity level of the signal space. Moreover, this recovery is still
possible if each measurement is multiplied by an unknown sign. Our approach
proceeds by recasting the (non-linear) PO-CS scheme as a linear compressive
sensing model built from a signal normalization constraint, and a
phase-consistency constraint imposing any signal estimate to match the observed
phases in the measurement domain. Practically, stable and robust signal
direction estimation is achieved from any instance optimal algorithm of the
compressive sensing literature (e.g., basis pursuit denoising). This is ensured
by proving that the matrix associated with this equivalent linear model
satisfies with high probability the restricted isometry property under the
above condition on the number of measurements. We finally observe
experimentally that robust signal direction recovery is reached at about twice
the number of measurements needed for signal recovery in compressive sensing.

Title: Joint Optimization of File Placement and Delivery in Cache-Assisted
  Wireless Networks with Limited Lifetime and Cache Space
Authors: Bojie Lv, Rui Wang, Ying Cui, Yi Gong, Haisheng Tan
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: submit to IEEE journal
\\
  In this paper, the scheduling of downlink file transmission in one cell with
the assistance of cache nodes with finite cache space is studied. Specifically,
requesting users arrive randomly and the base station (BS) reactively
multicasts files to the requesting users and selected cache nodes. The latter
can offload the traffic in their coverage areas from the BS. We consider the
joint optimization of the abovementioned file placement and delivery within a
finite lifetime subject to the cache space constraint. Within the lifetime, the
allocation of multicast power and symbol number for each file transmission at
the BS is formulated as a dynamic programming problem with a random stage
number. Note that there are no existing solutions to this problem. We develop
an asymptotically optimal solution framework by transforming the original
problem to an equivalent finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with a
fixed stage number. A novel approximation approach is then proposed to address
the curse of dimensionality, where the analytical expressions of approximate
value functions are provided. We also derive analytical bounds on the exact
value function and approximation error. The approximate value functions depend
on some system statistics, e.g., requesting users' distribution. One
reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed for the scenario where these
statistics are unknown.

Title: Quadratically Constrained Two-way Adversarial Channels
Authors: Yihan Zhang, Shashank Vatedka, Sidharth Jaggi
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  We study achievable rates of reliable communication in a power-constrained
two-way additive interference channel over the real alphabet where
communication is disrupted by a power-constrained jammer. This models the
wireless communication scenario where two users Alice and Bob, operating in the
full duplex mode, wish to exchange messages with each other in the presence of
a jammer, James. Alice and Bob simultaneously transmit their encodings $
\underline{x}_A $ and $\underline{x}_B $ over $ n $ channel uses. It is assumed
that James can choose his jamming signal $ \underline{s} $ as a noncausal
randomized function of $ \underline{x}_A $ and $ \underline{x}_B $, and the
codebooks used by Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob observe $
\underline{x}_A+\underline{x}_B +\underline{s}$, and must recover each others'
messages reliably. In this article, we give upper and lower bounds on the
capacity of this channel which match each other in the high-$\mathsf{SNR}$
(signal to noise ratios, defined as the ratio of the power constraints of the
users to the power constraint of the jammer) regime. We give a code
construction based on lattice codes, and derive achievable rates for large
$\mathsf{SNR}$. We also present upper bounds based on two specific attack
strategies for James. For the converse, we also derive general properties of
capacity-achieving codes for memoryless channels, which might be of independent
interest.

  An adaptive joint source-channel coding (JSCC) scheme is presented for
transmitting correlated sources over discrete-memoryless two-way channels
subject to distortion constraints. The proposed JSCC scheme makes use of the
previously transmitted and received channel signals as well as the sources'
correlation to facilitate coordination between terminals. It is shown that the
adaptive scheme strictly subsumes prior lossy coding methods for two-way
simultaneous transmission and yields a new adaptive separate source-channel
coding result. Two examples are given to show the scheme's advantages.

Title: Comments on "Physical-layer cryptography through massive MIMO"
Authors: Amin Sakzad, Ron Steinfeld
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1507.08015
\\
  We present two attacks on two different versions of physical layer
cryptography schemes based on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).
Both cryptosystems employ a singular value decomposition (SVD) precoding
technique. For the first one, we show that the eavesdropper (who knows its own
channel and the channel between legitimate users) can decrypt the information
data under the same condition as the legitimate receiver. We study the
signal-to-noise advantage ratio for decoding by the legitimate user over the
eavesdropper in a more generalized scheme when an arbitrary precoder at the
transmitter is employed. On the negative side, we show that if the eavesdropper
uses a number of receive antennas much larger than the number of legitimate
user antennas, then there is no advantage, independent of the precoding scheme
employed at the transmitter. On the positive side, for the case where the
adversary is limited to have the same number of antennas as legitimate users,
we give an $O\left(n^2\right)$ upper bound on the advantage and show that this
bound can be approached using an inverse precoder. For the second cryptosystem,
we show that the required security conditions prevent the legitimate user from
decoding the plaintext uniquely.

  The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks has been
widely demonstrated (e.g., adversarial example attacks). Traditional attacks
perform unstructured pixel-wise perturbation to fool the classifier. An
alternative approach is to have perturbations in the latent space. However,
such perturbations are hard to control due to the lack of interpretability and
disentanglement. In this paper, we propose a more practical adversarial attack
by designing structured perturbation with semantic meanings. Our proposed
technique manipulates the semantic attributes of images via the disentangled
latent codes. The intuition behind our technique is that images in similar
domains have some commonly shared but theme-independent semantic attributes,
e.g. thickness of lines in handwritten digits, that can be bidirectionally
mapped to disentangled latent codes. We generate adversarial perturbation by
manipulating a single or a combination of these latent codes and propose two
unsupervised semantic manipulation approaches: vector-based disentangled
representation and feature map-based disentangled representation, in terms of
the complexity of the latent codes and smoothness of the reconstructed images.
We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on real-world image data to
demonstrate the power of our attacks for black-box classifiers. We further
demonstrate the existence of a universal, image-agnostic semantic adversarial
example.

Title: Visual-Semantic Graph Attention Network for Human-Object Interaction
  Detection
Authors: Zhijun Liang, Yisheng Guan, and Juan Rojas
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables
\\
  In scene understanding, machines benefit from not only detecting individual
scene instances but also from learning their possible interactions.
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Detection tries to infer the predicate on a
<subject,predicate,object> triplet. Contextual information has been found
critical in inferring interactions. However, most works use features from
single object instances that have a direct relation with the subject. Few works
have studied the disambiguating contribution of subsidiary relations in
addition to how attention might leverage them for inference. We contribute a
dual-graph attention network that aggregates contextual visual, spatial, and
semantic information dynamically for primary subject-object relations as well
as subsidiary relations. Graph attention networks dynamically leverage node
neighborhood information. Our network uses attention to first leverage
visual-spatial and semantic cues from primary and subsidiary relations
independently and then combines them before a final readout step. Our network
learns to use primary and subsidiary relations to improve inference:
encouraging the right interpretations and discouraging incorrect ones. We call
our model: Visual-Semantic Graph Attention Networks (VS-GATs). We surpass
state-of-the-art HOI detection mAPs in the challenging HICO-DET dataset,
including in long-tail cases that are harder to interpret. Code, video, and
supplementary information is available at http://www.juanrojas.net/VSGAT.

Title: Stochastic Weight Averaging in Parallel: Large-Batch Training that

\\
  We propose Stochastic Weight Averaging in Parallel (SWAP), an algorithm to
accelerate DNN training. Our algorithm uses large mini-batches to compute an
approximate solution quickly and then refines it by averaging the weights of
multiple models computed independently and in parallel. The resulting models
generalize equally well as those trained with small mini-batches but are
produced in a substantially shorter time. We demonstrate the reduction in
training time and the good generalization performance of the resulting models
on the computer vision datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.

Title: On Thompson Sampling for Smoother-than-Lipschitz Bandits
Authors: James A. Grant and David S. Leslie
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted to AISTATS 2020. 26 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Thompson Sampling is a well established approach to bandit and reinforcement
learning problems. However its use in continuum armed bandit problems has
received relatively little attention. We provide the first bounds on the regret
of Thompson Sampling for continuum armed bandits under weak conditions on the
function class containing the true function and sub-exponential observation
noise. Our bounds are realised by analysis of the eluder dimension, a recently
proposed measure of the complexity of a function class, which has been
demonstrated to be useful in bounding the Bayesian regret of Thompson Sampling
for simpler bandit problems under sub-Gaussian observation noise. We derive a
new bound on the eluder dimension for classes of functions with Lipschitz
derivatives, and generalise previous analyses in multiple regards.

  Imitation Learning is a promising area of active research. Over the last 30
years, Imitation Learning has advanced significantly and been used to solve
difficult tasks ranging from Autonomous Driving to playing Atari games. In the
course of this development, different methods for performing Imitation Learning
have fallen into and out of favor. In this paper, I explore the development of
these different methods and attempt to examine how the field has progressed. I
focus my analysis on surveying 4 landmark papers that sequentially build upon
each other to develop increasingly impressive Imitation Learning methods.

Title: MACER: Attack-free and Scalable Robust Training via Maximizing Certified

  Adversarial training is one of the most popular ways to learn robust models
but is usually attack-dependent and time costly. In this paper, we propose the
MACER algorithm, which learns robust models without using adversarial training
but performs better than all existing provable l2-defenses. Recent work shows
that randomized smoothing can be used to provide a certified l2 radius to
smoothed classifiers, and our algorithm trains provably robust smoothed
classifiers via MAximizing the CErtified Radius (MACER). The attack-free
characteristic makes MACER faster to train and easier to optimize. In our
experiments, we show that our method can be applied to modern deep neural
networks on a wide range of datasets, including Cifar-10, ImageNet, MNIST, and
SVHN. For all tasks, MACER spends less training time than state-of-the-art
adversarial training algorithms, and the learned models achieve larger average
certified radius.

Title: An improved online learning algorithm for general fuzzy min-max neural
  network

\\
  This paper proposes an improved version of the current online learning
algorithm for a general fuzzy min-max neural network (GFMM) to tackle existing
issues concerning expansion and contraction steps as well as the way of dealing
with unseen data located on decision boundaries. These drawbacks lower its
classification performance, so an improved algorithm is proposed in this study
to address the above limitations. The proposed approach does not use the
contraction process for overlapping hyperboxes, which is more likely to
increase the error rate as shown in the literature. The empirical results
indicated the improvement in the classification accuracy and stability of the
proposed method compared to the original version and other fuzzy min-max
classifiers. In order to reduce the sensitivity to the training samples
presentation order of this new on-line learning algorithm, a simple ensemble
method is also proposed.

Title: Convolutional Networks with Dense Connectivity

  and Kilian Q. Weinberger
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: Journal(PAMI) version of DenseNet(CVPR'17)
\\
  Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially
deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter
connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In
this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional
Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a
feed-forward fashion.Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers
have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our
network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of
all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as
inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling
advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, encourage feature
reuse and substantially improve parameter efficiency. We evaluate our proposed
architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks
(CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less
parameters and computation to achieve high performance.

Title: EEG-based Drowsiness Estimation for Driving Safety using Deep Q-Learning
Authors: Yurui Ming, Dongrui Wu, Yu-Kai Wang, Yuhui Shi, Chin-Teng Lin
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  Fatigue is the most vital factor of road fatalities and one manifestation of
fatigue during driving is drowsiness. In this paper, we propose using deep
Q-learning to analyze an electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset captured during a
simulated endurance driving test. By measuring the correlation between
drowsiness and driving performance, this experiment represents an important
brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm especially from an application
perspective. We adapt the terminologies in the driving test to fit the
reinforcement learning framework, thus formulate the drowsiness estimation
problem as an optimization of a Q-learning task. By referring to the latest
deep Q-Learning technologies and attending to the characteristics of EEG data,
we tailor a deep Q-network for action proposition that can indirectly estimate
drowsiness. Our results show that the trained model can trace the variations of
mind state in a satisfactory way against the testing EEG data, which
demonstrates the feasibility and practicability of this new computation
paradigm. We also show that our method outperforms the supervised learning
counterpart and is superior for real applications. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to introduce the deep reinforcement learning method
to this BCI scenario, and our method can be potentially generalized to other
BCI cases.

Title: SPACE: Unsupervised Object-Oriented Scene Representation via Spatial
  Attention and Decomposition
Authors: Zhixuan Lin, Yi-Fu Wu, Skand Vishwanath Peri, Weihao Sun, Gautam

Categories: cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV stat.ML
Comments: Accepted in ICLR 2020
\\
  The ability to decompose complex multi-object scenes into meaningful
abstractions like objects is fundamental to achieve higher-level cognition.
Previous approaches for unsupervised object-oriented scene representation
learning are either based on spatial-attention or scene-mixture approaches and
limited in scalability which is a main obstacle towards modeling real-world
scenes. In this paper, we propose a generative latent variable model, called
SPACE, that provides a unified probabilistic modeling framework that combines
the best of spatial-attention and scene-mixture approaches. SPACE can
explicitly provide factorized object representations for foreground objects
while also decomposing background segments of complex morphology. Previous
models are good at either of these, but not both. SPACE also resolves the
scalability problems of previous methods by incorporating parallel
spatial-attention and thus is applicable to scenes with a large number of
objects without performance degradations. We show through experiments on Atari
and 3D-Rooms that SPACE achieves the above properties consistently in
comparison to SPAIR, IODINE, and GENESIS. Results of our experiments can be
found on our project website: https://sites.google.com/view/space-project-page

\\
  Current prognostic risk scores in cardiac surgery are based on statistics and
do not yet benefit from machine learning. Statistical predictors are not robust
enough to correctly identify patients who would benefit from Transcatheter
Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). This research aims to create a machine
learning model to predict one-year mortality of a patient after TAVI. We adopt
a modern gradient boosting on decision trees algorithm, specifically designed
for categorical features. In combination with a recent technique for model
interpretations, we developed a feature analysis and selection stage, enabling
to identify the most important features for the prediction. We base our
prediction model on the most relevant features, after interpreting and
discussing the feature analysis results with clinical experts. We validated our
model on 270 TAVI cases, reaching an AUC of 0.83. Our approach outperforms
several widespread prognostic risk scores, such as logistic EuroSCORE II, the
STS risk score and the TAVI2-score, which are broadly adopted by cardiologists
worldwide.

Title: A Nonparametric Offpolicy Policy Gradient
Authors: Samuele Tosatto, Joao Carvalho, Hany Abdulsamad, Jan Peters
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms still suffer from high sample
complexity despite outstanding recent successes. The need for intensive
interactions with the environment is especially observed in many widely popular
policy gradient algorithms that perform updates using on-policy samples. The
price of such inefficiency becomes evident in real-world scenarios such as
interaction-driven robot learning, where the success of RL has been rather
limited. We address this issue by building on the general sample efficiency of
off-policy algorithms. With nonparametric regression and density estimation
methods we construct a nonparametric Bellman equation in a principled manner,
which allows us to obtain closed-form estimates of the value function, and to
analytically express the full policy gradient. We provide a theoretical
analysis of our estimate to show that it is consistent under mild smoothness
assumptions and empirically show that our approach has better sample efficiency
than state-of-the-art policy gradient methods.

Title: To Transfer or Not to Transfer: Misclassification Attacks Against
  Transfer Learned Text Classifiers
Authors: Bijeeta Pal and Shruti Tople
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.IR stat.ML
\\
  Transfer learning --- transferring learned knowledge --- has brought a
paradigm shift in the way models are trained. The lucrative benefits of
improved accuracy and reduced training time have shown promise in training
models with constrained computational resources and fewer training samples.
Specifically, publicly available text-based models such as GloVe and BERT that
are trained on large corpus of datasets have seen ubiquitous adoption in
practice. In this paper, we ask, "can transfer learning in text prediction
models be exploited to perform misclassification attacks?" As our main
contribution, we present novel attack techniques that utilize unintended
features learnt in the teacher (public) model to generate adversarial examples
for student (downstream) models. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the
first work to show that transfer learning from state-of-the-art word-based and
sentence-based teacher models increase the susceptibility of student models to
misclassification attacks. First, we propose a novel word-score based attack
algorithm for generating adversarial examples against student models trained
using context-free word-level embedding model. On binary classification tasks
trained using the GloVe teacher model, we achieve an average attack accuracy of
97% for the IMDB Movie Reviews and 80% for the Fake News Detection. For
multi-class tasks, we divide the Newsgroup dataset into 6 and 20 classes and
achieve an average attack accuracy of 75% and 41% respectively. Next, we
present length-based and sentence-based misclassification attacks for the Fake
News Detection task trained using a context-aware BERT model and achieve 78%
and 39% attack accuracy respectively. Thus, our results motivate the need for
designing training techniques that are robust to unintended feature learning,
specifically for transfer learned models.

Title: A Group Norm Regularized LRR Factorization Model for Spectral Clustering
Authors: Xishun Wang and Zhouwang Yang and Xingye Yue and Hui Wang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Spectral clustering is a very important and classic graph clustering method.
Its clustering results are heavily dependent on affine matrix produced by data.
Solving Low-Rank Representation~(LRR) problems is a very effective method to
obtain affine matrix. This paper proposes LRR factorization model based on
group norm regularization and uses Augmented Lagrangian Method~(ALM) algorithm
to solve this model. We adopt group norm regularization to make the columns of
the factor matrix sparse, thereby achieving the purpose of low rank. And no
Singular Value Decomposition~(SVD) is required, computational complexity of
each step is great reduced. We get the affine matrix by different LRR model and
then perform cluster testing on synthetic noise data and real data~(Hopkin155
and EYaleB) respectively. Compared to traditional models and algorithms, ours
are faster to solve affine matrix and more robust to noise. The final
clustering results are better. And surprisingly, the numerical results show
that our algorithm converges very fast, and the convergence condition is
satisfied in only about ten steps. Group norm regularized LRR factorization
model with the algorithm designed for it is effective and fast to obtain a
better affine matrix.

Title: Learning Dynamic and Personalized Comorbidity Networks from Event Data
  using Deep Diffusion Processes
Authors: Zhaozhi Qian, Ahmed M. Alaa, Alexis Bellot, Jem Rashbass, Mihaela van
  der Schaar
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Comorbid diseases co-occur and progress via complex temporal patterns that
vary among individuals. In electronic medical records, we only observe onsets
of diseases, but not their triggering comorbidities i.e., the mechanisms
underlying temporal relations between diseases need to be inferred. Learning
such temporal patterns from event data is crucial for understanding disease
pathology and predicting prognoses. To this end, we develop deep diffusion
processes (DDP) to model ''dynamic comorbidity networks'', i.e., the temporal
relationships between comorbid disease onsets expressed through a dynamic
graph. A DDP comprises events modelled as a multi-dimensional point process,
with an intensity function parameterized by the edges of a dynamic weighted
graph. The graph structure is modulated by a neural network that maps patient
history to edge weights, enabling rich temporal representations for disease
trajectories. The DDP parameters decouple into clinically meaningful
components, which enables serving the dual purpose of accurate risk prediction
and intelligible representation of disease pathology. We illustrate these
features in experiments using cancer registry data.

Title: iDLG: Improved Deep Leakage from Gradients
Authors: Bo Zhao, Konda Reddy Mopuri, Hakan Bilen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  It is widely believed that sharing gradients will not leak private training
data in distributed learning systems such as Collaborative Learning and
Federated Learning, etc. Recently, Zhu et al. presented an approach which shows
the possibility to obtain private training data from the publicly shared
gradients. In their Deep Leakage from Gradient (DLG) method, they synthesize
the dummy data and corresponding labels with the supervision of shared
gradients. However, DLG has difficulty in convergence and discovering the
ground-truth labels consistently. In this paper, we find that sharing gradients
definitely leaks the ground-truth labels. We propose a simple but reliable
approach to extract accurate data from the gradients. Particularly, our
approach can certainly extract the ground-truth labels as opposed to DLG, hence
we name it Improved DLG (iDLG). Our approach is valid for any differentiable
model trained with cross-entropy loss over one-hot labels. We mathematically
illustrate how our method can extract ground-truth labels from the gradients
and empirically demonstrate the advantages over DLG.

Title: Sample-based Distributional Policy Gradient
Authors: Rahul Singh, Keuntaek Lee, Yongxin Chen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) is a recent reinforcement
learning framework whose success has been supported by various empirical
studies. It relies on the key idea of replacing the expected return with the
return distribution, which captures the intrinsic randomness of the long term
rewards. Most of the existing literature on DRL focuses on problems with
discrete action space and value based methods. In this work, motivated by
applications in robotics with continuous action space control settings, we
propose sample-based distributional policy gradient (SDPG) algorithm. It models
the return distribution using samples via a reparameterization technique widely
used in generative modeling and inference. We compare SDPG with the
state-of-art policy gradient method in DRL, distributed distributional
deterministic policy gradients (D4PG), which has demonstrated state-of-art
performance. We apply SDPG and D4PG to multiple OpenAI Gym environments and
observe that our algorithm shows better sample efficiency as well as higher
reward for most tasks.

Title: SGD with Hardness Weighted Sampling for Distributionally Robust Deep
  Learning
Authors: Lucas Fidon, Sebastien Ourselin, Tom Vercauteren
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
\\
  Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has been proposed as an
alternative to Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) in order to account for
potential biases in the training data distribution. However, its use in deep
learning has been severely restricted due to the relative inefficiency of the
optimizers available for DRO in comparison to the wide-spread Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) based optimizers for deep learning with ERM. We propose
SGD with Hardness weighted sampling, an efficient optimization method for
machine learning with DRO with a focus on deep learning. In this work, we
propose SGD with hardness weighted sampling, a principled and efficient
optimization method for DRO in machine learning that is particularly suited in
the context of deep learning. We show that our optimization method can be
interpreted as a principled Hard Example Mining strategy. Similar to an online
hard example mining strategy in essence and in practice, the proposed algorithm
is straightforward to implement and computationally as efficient as SGD-based
optimizers used for deep learning. It only requires adding a softmax layer and
maintaining a history of the loss values for each training example to compute
adaptive sampling probabilities. In contrast to typical ad hoc hard mining
approaches, and exploiting recent theoretical results in deep learning
optimization, we We also prove the convergence of our DRO algorithm for
over-parameterized deep learning networks with ReLU activation and finite
number of layers and parameters. Preliminary results demonstrate the
feasibility and usefulness of our approach.

  In the near future, our streets will be populated by myriads of autonomous
self-driving vehicles to serve our diverse mobility needs. This will raise the
need to coordinate their movements in order to properly handle both access to
shared resources (e.g., intersections and parking slots) and the execution of
mobility tasks (e.g., platooning and ramp merging). In this paper, we firstly
introduce the general issues associated to coordination of autonomous vehicles,
by identifying and framing the key classes of coordination problems. Following,
we overview the different approaches that can be adopted to manage such
coordination problems, by classifying them in terms of the degree of autonomy
in decision making that is left to autonomous vehicles during coordination.
Finally, we overview some further peculiar challenges that research will have
to address before autonomously coordinated vehicles can safely hit our streets.

Title: Natural Steganography in JPEG Domain with a Linear Development Pipeline
Authors: Taburet Th\'eo, Bas Patrick, Sawaya Wadih, Jessica Fridrich

Comments: 13 pages, 14 figures
ACM-class: I.4.1
\\
  In order to achieve high practical security, Natural Steganography (NS) uses
cover images captured at ISO sensitivity $ISO_{1}$ and generates stego images
mimicking ISO sensitivity $ISO_{2}>ISO_{1}$. This is achieved by adding a stego
signal to the cover that mimics the sensor photonic noise. This paper proposes
an embedding mechanism to perform NS in the JPEG domain after linear
developments by explicitly computing the correlations between DCT coefficients
before quantization. In order to compute the covariance matrix of the photonic
noise in the DCT domain, we first develop the matrix representation of
demosaicking, luminance averaging, pixel section, and 2D-DCT. A detailed
analysis of the resulting covariance matrix is done in order to explain the
origins of the correlations between the coefficients of $3\times3$ DCT blocks.
An embedding scheme is then presented that takes in order to take into account
all the correlations. It employs 4 sub-lattices and 64 lattices per
sub-lattices. The modification probabilities of each DCT coefficient are then
derived by computing conditional probabilities from the multivariate Gaussian
distribution using the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. This
derivation is also used to compute the embedding capacity of each image. Using
a specific database called E1 Base, we show that in the JPEG domain NS
(J-Cov-NS) enables to achieve high capacity (more than 2 bits per non-zero AC
DCT) and with high practical security ($P_{\mathrm{E}}\simeq40\%$ using DCTR
from QF 75 to QF 100).

Title: Automatic Generation of Efficient Sparse Tensor Format Conversion
  Routines
Authors: Stephen Chou, Fredrik Kjolstad, Saman Amarasinghe
Categories: cs.MS cs.PL
\\
  This paper shows how to generate code that efficiently converts sparse
tensors between disparate storage formats (data layouts) like CSR, DIA, ELL,
and many others. We decompose sparse tensor conversion into three logical
phases: coordinate remapping, analysis, and assembly. We then develop a
language that precisely describes how different formats group together and
order a tensor's nonzeros in memory. This enables a compiler to emit code that
performs complex reorderings (remappings) of nonzeros when converting between
formats. We additionally develop a query language that can extract complex
statistics about sparse tensors, and we show how to emit efficient analysis
code that computes such queries. Finally, we define an abstract interface that
captures how data structures for storing a tensor can be efficiently assembled
given specific statistics about the tensor. Disparate formats can implement
this common interface, thus letting a compiler emit optimized sparse tensor
conversion code for arbitrary combinations of a wide range of formats without
hard-coding for any specific one.
  Our evaluation shows that our technique generates sparse tensor conversion
routines with performance between 0.99 and 2.2$\times$ that of hand-optimized
implementations in two widely used sparse linear algebra libraries, SPARSKIT
and Intel MKL. By emitting code that avoids materializing temporaries, our
technique also outperforms both libraries by between 1.4 and 3.4$\times$ for
CSC/COO to DIA/ELL conversion.

solvers, which apply (e.g.) micro and macro steps to resolve fast and slow
changes in a transient simulation accordingly. The use of extrapolation and
interpolation procedures is a genuine way for coupling the different parts,
which are defined on different time grids.
  This paper contains for the first time, to the best knowledge of the authors,
a complete convergence theory for inter/extrapolation-based multirate schemes
for both ODEs and DAEs of index one, which are based on the fully-decoupled
approach, the slowest-first and the fastest-first approach. The convergence
theory is based on linking these schemes to multirate dynamic iteration
schemes, i.e., dynamic iteration schemes without further iterations. This link
defines naturally stability conditions for the DAE case.

Title: Convergence rates for an inexact ADMM applied to separable convex
  optimization
Authors: William W. Hager and Hongchao Zhang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1604.02494
\\
  Convergence rates are established for an inexact accelerated alternating
direction method of multipliers (I-ADMM) for general separable convex
optimization with a linear constraint. Both ergodic and non-ergodic iterates
are analyzed. Relative to the iteration number k, the convergence rate is
O(1/k) in a convex setting and O(1/k^2) in a strongly convex setting. When an
error bound condition holds, the algorithm is 2-step linearly convergent. The
I-ADMM is designed so that the accuracy of the inexact iteration preserves the
global convergence rates of the exact iteration, leading to better performance
in the test problems.

Title: On some stable boundary closures of finite difference schemes for the
  transport equation
Authors: Jean-Fran\c{c}ois Coulombel (IMT), Tomas Lundquist (IMT)
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We explore in this article the possibilities and limitations of the so-called
energy method for analyzing the stability of finite difference approximations
to the transport equation with extrapolation numerical boundary conditions at
the outflow boundary. We first show that for the most simple schemes, namely
the explicit schemes with a three point stencil, the energy method can be
applied for proving stability estimates when the scheme is implemented with
either the first or second order extrapolation boundary condition. We then
examine the case of five point stencils and give several examples of schemes
and second order extrapolation numerical boundary conditions for which the
energy method produces stability estimates. However, we also show that for the
standard first or second order translatory extrapolation boundary conditions,
the energy method cannot be applied for proving stability of the classical
fourth order scheme originally proposed by Strang. This gives a clear
limitation of the energy method with respect to the more general approach based
on the normal mode decomposition.

Title: Optimal quadrature formulas for CT image reconstruction in the Sobolev
  space of non-periodic functions

\\
  In the present paper, optimal quadrature formulas in the sense of Sard are
constructed for numerical integration of the integral $\int_a^b e^{2\pi i\omega
x}\varphi(x)dx$ with $\omega\in \mathbb{R}$ in the Sobolev space
$L_2^{(m)}[a,b]$ of complex-valued functions which are square integrable with
$m$-th order derivative. Here, using the discrete analogue of the differential
operator $\frac{d^{2m}}{d x^{2m}}$, the explicit formulas for optimal
coefficients are obtained. The order of convergence of the obtained optimal
quadrature formula is $O(h^m)$. The optimal quadrature formulas of the cases
$m=2$ and $m=3$ are applied for reconstruction of Computed Tomography (CT)
images by approximating Fourier transforms in the filtered back-projection
formula. In numerical experiments two kinds of phantoms are considered and
numerical results are compared with the results of a built-in function of
MATLAB 2019a, iradon. Numerical results show that the quality of the
reconstructed images with optimal quadrature formula of the second and third
orders is better than that of the results obtained by iradon.

Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: submitted to Int. J. Numer. Methods Eng
\\
  We present novel coupling schemes for partitioned multi-physics simulation
that combine four important aspects for strongly coupled problems: implicit
coupling per time step, fast and robust acceleration of the corresponding
iterative coupling, support for multi-rate time stepping, and higher-order
convergence in time. To achieve this, we combine waveform relaxation -- a known
method to achieve higher order in applications with split time stepping based
on continuous representations of coupling variables in time -- with interface
quasi-Newton coupling, which has been developed throughout the last decade and
is generally accepted as a very robust iterative coupling method even for
gluing together black-box simulation codes. We show convergence results (in
terms of convergence of the iterative solver and in terms of approximation
order in time) for two academic test cases -- a heat transfer scenario and a
fluid-structure interaction simulation. We show that we achieve the expected
approximation order and that our iterative method is competitive in terms of
iteration counts with those designed for simpler first-order-in-time coupling.

  One of the most recently developed heuristic optimization algorithms is
dragonfly by Mirjalili. Dragonfly algorithm has shown its ability to optimizing
different real world problems. It has three variants. In this work, an overview
of the algorithm and its variants is presented. Moreover, the hybridization
versions of the algorithm are discussed. Furthermore, the results of the
applications that utilized dragonfly algorithm in applied science are offered
in the following area: Machine Learning, Image Processing, Wireless, and
Networking. It is then compared with some other metaheuristic algorithms. In
addition, the algorithm is tested on the CEC-C06 2019 benchmark functions. The
results prove that the algorithm has great exploration ability and its
convergence rate is better than other algorithms in the literature, such as PSO
and GA. In general, in this survey the strong and weak points of the algorithm
are discussed. Furthermore, some future works that will help in improving the
algorithm's weak points are recommended. This study is conducted with the hope
of offering beneficial information about dragonfly algorithm to the researchers
who want to study the algorithm.

Title: Online Joint Placement and Allocation of Virtual Network Functions with
  Heterogeneous Servers
Authors: Yicheng Xu, Vincent Chau, Chenchen Wu, Yong Zhang, Yifei Zou
Categories: cs.NI cs.DM
\\
  Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising virtualization
technology that has the potential to significantly reduce the expenses and
improve the service agility. NFV makes it possible for Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to employ various Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) without
installing new equipments. One of the most attractive approaches in NFV
technology is a so-called Joint Placement and Allocation of Virtual Network
Functions (JPA-VNF) which considers the balance between VNF investment with
Quality of Services (QoS). We introduce a novel capability function to measure
the potential of locating VNF instances for each server in the proposed OJPA-HS
model. This model allows the servers in the network to be heterogeneous, at the
same time combines and generalizes many classical JPA-VNF models. Despite its
NP-hardness, we present a provable best-possible deterministic online algorithm
based on dynamic programming (DP). To conquer the high complexity of DP, we
propose two additional randomized heuristics, the Las Vegas (LV) and Monte
Carlo (MC) randomized algorithms, which performs even as good as DP with much
smaller complexity. Besides, MC is a promising heuristic in practice as it has
the advantage to deal with big data environment. Extensive numerical
experiments are constructed for the proposed algorithms in the paper.

Title: Improving BLE Beacon Proximity Estimation Accuracy through Bayesian
  Filtering
Authors: Andrew Mackey, Petros Spachos, Liang Song and Konstantinos Plataniotis
Categories: cs.NI cs.PF
\\
  The interconnectedness of all things is continuously expanding which has
allowed every individual to increase their level of interaction with their
surroundings. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are used in a plethora of
context-aware application such as Proximity-Based Services (PBS), and
Location-Based Services (LBS). For these systems to perform, it is essential to
have reliable hardware and predict a user's position in the area with high
accuracy in order to differentiate between individuals in a small area. A
variety of wireless solutions that utilize Received Signal Strength Indicators
(RSSI) have been proposed to provide PBS and LBS for indoor environments,
though each solution presents its own drawbacks. In this work, Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) beacons are examined in terms of their accuracy in proximity
estimation. Specifically, a mobile application is developed along with three
Bayesian filtering techniques to improve the BLE beacon proximity estimation
accuracy. This includes a Kalman filter, a particle filter, and a
Non-parametric Information (NI) filter. Since the RSSI is heavily influenced by
the environment, experiments were conducted to examine the performance of
beacons from three popular vendors in two different environments. The error is
compared in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE). According to the experimental results, Bayesian filters can improve
proximity estimation accuracy up to 30 % in comparison with traditional
filtering, when the beacon and the receiver are within 3 m.

Title: Watching the Weak Link into Your Home: An Inspection and Monitoring
  Toolkit for TR-069
Authors: Maximilian Hils, Rainer B\"ohme
Categories: cs.NI cs.CR
Comments: Full Version. Abridged Conference Version to be published (ACNS 2019)
\\
  TR-069 is a standard for the remote management of end-user devices by service
providers. Despite being implemented in nearly a billion devices, almost no
research has been published on the security and privacy aspects of TR-069. The
first contribution of this paper is a study of the TR-069 ecosystem and
techniques to inspect TR-069 communication. We find that the majority of
analyzed providers do not use recommended security measures, such as TLS.
Second, we present a TR-069 honeyclient to both analyze TR-069 behavior of
providers and test configuration servers for security vulnerabilities. We find
that popular open-source configuration servers use insecure methods to
authenticate clients. TR-069 implementations based on these servers expose, for
instance, their users' internet telephony credentials. Third, we develop
components for a distributed system to continuously monitor activities in
providers' TR-069 deployments. Our setup consists of inexpensive hardware
sensors deployed on customer premises and centralized log collectors. We
perform real-world measurements and find that the purported security benefits
of TR-069 are not realized as providers' firmware update processes are lacking.

Title: On Competitive Analysis for Polling Systems
Authors: Jin Xu and Natarajan Gautam
Categories: cs.PF cs.DM math.OC
\\
  Polling systems have been widely studied, however most of these studies focus
on polling systems with renewal processes for arrivals and random variables for
service times. There is a need driven by practical applications to study
polling systems with arbitrary arrivals (not restricted to time-varying or in
batches) and revealed service time upon a job's arrival. To address that need,
our work considers a polling system with generic setting and for the first time
provides the worst case analysis for online scheduling policies in this system.
We provide conditions for the existence of constant competitive ratio for this
system, and also the competitive ratios for several well-studied policies such
as cyclic exhaustive, gated and \emph{l}-limited policies, Stochastic Largest
Queue policy, One Machine policy and Gittins Index policy for polling systems.
We show that any policy with (1) purely static, (2) queue-length based or (3)
job-processing-time based routing discipline does not have a competitive ratio
smaller than $k$, where $k$ is the number of queues. Finally, a mixed strategy
is provided for a practical scenario where setup time is large but bounded.

Title: Deep Static Modeling of invokedynamic

Journal-ref: ECOOP 2019
DOI: 10.4230/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2019.15
\\
  Java 7 introduced programmable dynamic linking in the form of the
invokedynamic framework. Static analysis of code containing programmable
dynamic linking has often been cited as a significant source of unsoundness in
the analysis of Java programs. For example, Java lambdas, introduced in Java 8,
are a very popular feature, which is, however, resistant to static analysis,
since it mixes invokedynamic with dynamic code generation. These techniques
invalidate static analysis assumptions: programmable linking breaks reasoning
about method resolution while dynamically generated code is, by definition, not
available statically. In this paper, we show that a static analysis can
predictively model uses of invokedynamic while also cooperating with extra
rules to handle the runtime code generation of lambdas. Our approach plugs into
an existing static analysis and helps eliminate all unsoundness in the handling
of lambdas (including associated features such as method references) and
generic invokedynamic uses. We evaluate our technique on a benchmark suite of
our own and on third-party benchmarks, uncovering all code previously
unreachable due to unsoundness, highly efficiently.

\\
  Coinductive reasoning about infinitary structures such as streams is widely
applicable. However, practical frameworks for developing coinductive proofs and
finding reasoning principles that help structure such proofs remain a
challenge, especially in the context of machine-checked formalization.
  This paper gives a novel presentation of an equational theory for reasoning
about structures up to weak bisimulation. The theory is both compositional,
making it suitable for defining general-purpose lemmas, and also incremental,
meaning that the bisimulation can be created interactively. To prove the
theory's soundness, this paper also introduces generalized parameterized
coinduction, which addresses expressivity problems of earlier works and
provides a practical framework for coinductive reasoning. The paper presents
the resulting equational theory for streams, but the technique applies to other
structures too.
  All of the results in this paper have been proved in Coq, and the generalized
parameterized coinduction framework is available as a Coq library.

Title: Aggressive Perception-Aware Navigation using Deep Optical Flow Dynamics
  and PixelMPC
Authors: Keuntaek Lee, Jason Gibson, Evangelos A. Theodorou
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Recently, vision-based control has gained traction by leveraging the power of
machine learning. In this work, we couple a model predictive control (MPC)
framework to a visual pipeline. We introduce deep optical flow (DOF) dynamics,
which is a combination of optical flow and robot dynamics. Using the DOF
dynamics, MPC explicitly incorporates the predicted movement of relevant pixels
into the planned trajectory of a robot. Our implementation of DOF is
memory-efficient, data-efficient, and computationally cheap so that it can be
computed in real-time for use in an MPC framework. The suggested Pixel Model
Predictive Control (PixelMPC) algorithm controls the robot to accomplish a
high-speed racing task while maintaining visibility of the important features
(gates). This improves the reliability of vision-based estimators for
localization and can eventually lead to safe autonomous flight. The proposed
algorithm is tested in a photorealistic simulation with a high-speed drone
racing task.

Title: RoboFly: An insect-sized robot with simplified fabrication that is

Authors: Yogesh M Chukewad, Johannes James, Avinash Singh, and Sawyer Fuller
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 15 pages. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)
\\
  Aerial robots the size of a honeybee (~100 mg) have advantages over larger
robots because of their small size, low mass and low materials cost. Previous
iterations have demonstrated controlled flight but were difficult to fabricate
because they consisted of many separate parts assembled together. They also
were unable to perform locomotion modes besides flight. This paper presents a
new design of a 74 mg flapping-wing robot that dramatically reduces the number
of parts and simplifies fabrication. It also has a lower center of mass, which
allows the robot to additionally land without the need for long legs, even in
case of unstable flight. Furthermore, we show that the new design allows for
wing-driven ground and air-water interfacial locomotion, improving the
versatility of the robot. Forward thrust is generated by increasing the speed
of downstroke relative to the upstroke of the flapping wings. This also allows
for steering. The ability to land and subsequently move along the ground allows
the robot to negotiate extremely confined spaces, underneath obstacles, and to
precise locations. We describe the new design in detail and present results
demonstrating these capabilities, as well as hovering flight and controlled
landing.

Title: Learning to Move with Affordance Maps
Authors: William Qi, Ravi Teja Mullapudi, Saurabh Gupta, Deva Ramanan
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  The ability to autonomously explore and navigate a physical space is a
fundamental requirement for virtually any mobile autonomous agent, from
household robotic vacuums to autonomous vehicles. Traditional SLAM-based
approaches for exploration and navigation largely focus on leveraging scene
geometry, but fail to model dynamic objects (such as other agents) or semantic
constraints (such as wet floors or doorways). Learning-based RL agents are an
attractive alternative because they can incorporate both semantic and geometric
information, but are notoriously sample inefficient, difficult to generalize to
novel settings, and are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we combine the
best of both worlds with a modular approach that learns a spatial
representation of a scene that is trained to be effective when coupled with
traditional geometric planners. Specifically, we design an agent that learns to
predict a spatial affordance map that elucidates what parts of a scene are
navigable through active self-supervised experience gathering. In contrast to
most simulation environments that assume a static world, we evaluate our
approach in the VizDoom simulator, using large-scale randomly-generated maps
containing a variety of dynamic actors and hazards. We show that learned
affordance maps can be used to augment traditional approaches for both
exploration and navigation, providing significant improvements in performance.

\\
  The computer vision and robotics research communities are each strong.
However progress in computer vision has become turbo-charged in recent years
due to big data, GPU computing, novel learning algorithms and a very effective
research methodology. By comparison, progress in robotics seems slower. It is
true that robotics came later to exploring the potential of learning -- the
advantages over the well-established body of knowledge in dynamics, kinematics,
planning and control is still being debated, although reinforcement learning
seems to offer real potential. However, the rapid development of computer
vision compared to robotics cannot be only attributed to the former's adoption
of deep learning. In this paper, we argue that the gains in computer vision are
due to research methodology -- evaluation under strict constraints versus
experiments; bold numbers versus videos.

  We consider the problem of finding a condition for a univariate polynomial
having a given multiplicity structure when the number of distinct roots is
given. It is well known that such conditions can be written as conjunctions of
several polynomial equations and one inequation in the coefficients, by using
repeated parametric gcd's. In this paper, we give a novel condition which is
not based on repeated gcd's. Furthermore, it is shown that the number of
polynomials in the condition is optimal and the degree of polynomials is
smaller than that in the previous condition based on repeated gcd's.

Title: Streaming automatic speech recognition with the transformer model
Authors: Niko Moritz, Takaaki Hori, Jonathan Le Roux
Categories: cs.SD cs.CL cs.LG eess.AS stat.ML
\\
  Encoder-decoder based sequence-to-sequence models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art results in end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR).
Recently, the transformer architecture, which uses self-attention to model
temporal context information, has been shown to achieve significantly lower
word error rates (WERs) compared to recurrent neural network (RNN) based system
architectures. Despite its success, the practical usage is limited to offline
ASR tasks, since encoder-decoder architectures typically require an entire
speech utterance as input. In this work, we propose a transformer based
end-to-end ASR system for streaming ASR, where an output must be generated
shortly after each spoken word. To achieve this, we apply time-restricted
self-attention for the encoder and triggered attention for the encoder-decoder
attention mechanism. Our proposed streaming transformer architecture achieves
2.7% and 7.0% WER for the ``clean'' and ``other'' test data of LibriSpeech,
which to the best of our knowledge is the best published streaming end-to-end
ASR result for this task.

  To achieve this, we use supervised learning over test execution traces. We
label a small fraction of the execution traces with their verdict of pass or
fail. We use the labelled traces to train a neural network (NN) model to learn
to distinguish runtime patterns for passing versus failing executions for a
given program. Our approach for building this NN model involves the following
steps, 1. Instrument the program to record execution traces as sequences of
method invocations and global state, 2. Label a small fraction of the execution
traces with their verdicts, 3. Designing a NN component that embeds information
in execution traces to fixed length vectors, 4. Design a NN model that uses the
trace information for classification, 5. Evaluate the inferred classification
model on unseen execution traces from the program.
  We evaluate our approach using case studies from different application
domains: 1. Module from Ethereum Blockchain, 2. Module from PyTorch deep
learning framework, 3. Microsoft SEAL encryption library components, 4. Sed
stream editor, 5. Value pointer library and 6. Nine network protocols from
Linux packet identifier, L7-Filter. We found the classification models for all
subject programs resulted in high precision, recall and specificity, over 95%,
while only training with an average 9% of the total traces. Our experiments
show that the proposed neural network model is highly effective as a test
oracle and is able to learn runtime patterns to distinguish passing and failing
test executions for systems and tests from different application domains.

Title: Comparing Constraints Mined From Execution Logs to Understand Software
  Evolution
Authors: Thomas Krismayer and Michael Vierhauser and Rick Rabiser and Paul

DOI: 10.1109/ICSME.2019.00082
\\
  Complex software systems evolve frequently, e.g., when introducing new
features or fixing bugs during maintenance. However, understanding the impact
of such changes on system behavior is often difficult. Many approaches have
thus been proposed that analyze systems before and after changes, e.g., by
comparing source code, model-based representations, or system execution logs.
In this paper, we propose an approach for comparing run-time constraints,
synthesized by a constraint mining algorithm, based on execution logs recorded
before and after changes. Specifically, automatically mined constraints define
the expected timing and order of recurring events and the values of data
elements attached to events. Our approach presents the differences of the mined
constraints to users, thereby providing a higher-level view on software
evolution and supporting the analysis of the impact of changes on system
behavior. We present a motivating example and a preliminary evaluation based on
a cyber-physical system controlling unmanned aerial vehicles. The results of
our preliminary evaluation show that our approach can help to analyze changed
behavior and thus contributes to understanding software evolution.

Title: Comparing Python, Go, and C++ on the N-Queens Problem
Authors: Pascal Fua, Krzysztof Lis
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Python currently is the dominant language in the field of Machine Learning
but is often criticized for being slow to perform certain tasks. In this
report, we use the well-known $N$-queens puzzle as a benchmark to show that
once compiled using the Numba compiler it becomes competitive with C++ and Go
in terms of execution speed while still allowing for very fast prototyping.
This is true of both sequential and parallel programs. In most cases that arise
in an academic environment, it therefore makes sense to develop in ordinary
Python, identify computational bottlenecks, and use Numba to remove them.

Title: Architecting Safe Automated Driving with Legacy Platforms
Authors: Naveen Mohan
Categories: cs.SE cs.RO
\\
  Modern vehicles have electrical architectures whose complexity grows year
after year due to feature growth corresponding to customer expectations. The
latest of the expectations, automation of the dynamic driving task however, is
poised to bring about some of the largest changes seen so far. In one fell
swoop, not only does required functionality for automated driving drastically
increase the system complexity, it also removes the fall-back of the human
driver who is usually relied upon to handle unanticipated failures after the
fact. The need to architect thus requires a greater rigour than ever before, to
maintain the level of safety that has been associated with the automotive
industry. The work that is part of this thesis has been conducted, in close
collaboration with our industrial partner Scania CV AB, within the Vinnova FFI
funded project ARCHER. This thesis aims to provide a methodology for
architecting during the concept phase of development, using industrial
practices and principles including those from safety standards such as ISO
26262. The main contributions of the thesis are in two areas. The first area
i.e. Part A contributes, (i) an analysis of the challenges of architecting
automated driving, and serves as a motivation for the approach taken in the
rest of this thesis, i.e. Part B where the contributions include, (ii) a
definition of a viewpoint for functional safety according to the definitions of
ISO 42010, (iii) a method to systematically extract information from legacy
components and (iv) a process to use legacy information and architect in the
presence of uncertainty to provide a work product, the Preliminary
Architectural Assumptions (PAA), as required by ISO 26262. The contributions of
Part B together comprise a methodology to architect the PAA. <read full

\\
  The use of autonomous bots for automatic support in software development
tasks is increasing. In the past, however, they were not always perceived
positively and sometimes experienced a negative bias compared to their human
counterparts. We conducted a qualitative study in which we deployed an
autonomous refactoring bot for 41 days in a student software development
project. In between and at the end, we conducted semi-structured interviews to
find out how developers perceive the bot and whether they are more or less
critical when reviewing the contributions of a bot compared to human
contributions. Our findings show that the bot was perceived as a useful and
unobtrusive contributor, and developers were no more critical of it than they
were about their human colleagues, but only a few team members felt responsible
for the bot.

  We propose a information theoretical framework to capture transition and
information costs of network navigation models. Based on the minimum
description length principle and the Markov decision process, we demonstrate
that efficient global navigation can be achieved with only partial information.
Additionally, we derived a scalable algorithm for optimal solutions under
certain conditions. The proposed algorithm can be interpreted as a dynamical
process on network, making it a useful tool for analysing and understanding
navigation strategies on real world networks.

Title: A Soft Recommender System for Social Networks
Authors: Marzieh Pourhojjati-Sabet and Azam Rabiee
Categories: cs.SI cs.IR cs.LG
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Recent social recommender systems benefit from friendship graph to make an
accurate recommendation, believing that friends in a social network have
exactly the same interests and preferences. Some studies have benefited from
hard clustering algorithms (such as K-means) to determine the similarity
between users and consequently to define degree of friendships. In this paper,
we went a step further to identify true friends for making even more realistic
recommendations. we calculated the similarity between users, as well as the
dependency between a user and an item. Our hypothesis is that due to the
uncertainties in user preferences, the fuzzy clustering, instead of the
classical hard clustering, is beneficial in accurate recommendations. We
incorporated the C-means algorithm to get different membership degrees of soft
users' clusters. Then, the users' similarity metric is defined according to the
soft clusters. Later, in a training scheme we determined the latent
representations of users and items, extracting from the huge and sparse
user-item-tag matrix using matrix factorization. In the parameter tuning, we
found the optimum coefficients for the influence of our soft social
regularization and the user-item dependency terms. Our experimental results
convinced that the proposed fuzzy similarity metric improves the
recommendations in real data compared to the baseline social recommender system
with the hard clustering.

Title: Peer-to-Peer based Social Networks: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Newton Masinde and Kalman Graffi
Categories: cs.SI cs.DC
\\
  Online social networks, such as Facebook and twitter, are a growing
phenomenon in today's world, with various platforms providing capabilities for
individuals to collaborate through messaging and chatting as well as sharing of
content such as videos and photos. Most, if not all, of these platforms are
based on centralized computing systems, meaning that the control and management
of the systems lies in the hand of one provider, which must be trusted to treat
the data and communication traces securely. While users aim for privacy and
data sovereignty, often the providers aim to monetize the data they store.
Even, federated privately run social networks require a few enthusiasts that
serve the community and have, through that, access to the data they manage. As
a zero-trust alternative, peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies promise networks that
are self organizing and secure-by-design, in which the final data sovereignty
lies at the corresponding user. Such networks support end-to-end communication,
uncompromising access control, anonymity and resilience against censorship and
massive data leaks through misused trust. The goals of this survey are
three-fold. Firstly, the survey elaborates the properties of P2P-based online
social networks and defines the requirements for such (zero-trust) platforms.
Secondly, it elaborates on the building blocks for P2P frameworks that allow
the creation of such sophisticated and demanding applications, such as
user/identity management, reliable data storage, secure communication, access
control and general-purpose extensibility, features that are not addressed in
other P2P surveys. As a third point, it gives an overview of proposed P2P-based
online social network applications, frameworks and architectures. In specific,
it explores the technical details, inter-dependencies and maturity of the
available solutions.

Title: Blue River Controls: A toolkit for Reinforcement Learning Control
  Systems on Hardware
Authors: Kirill Polzounov, Ramitha Sundar, Lee Redden
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  We provide a simple hardware wrapper around the Quanser's
hardware-in-the-loop software development kit (HIL SDK) to allow for easy
development of new Quanser hardware. To connect to the hardware we use a module
written in Cython. The internal QuanserWrapper class handles most of the
difficult aspects of interacting with hardware, including the timing (using a
hardware timer), and ensuring the data sent to hardware is safe and correct,
where safety corresponds to safe operating voltage and current for the
specified hardware. Much of the recent success of Reinforcement learning (RL)
has been made possible with training and testing tools like OpenAI Gym and
Deepmind Control Suite. Unfortunately, tools for quickly testing and
transferring high-frequency RL algorithms from simulation to real hardware
environment remain mostly absent. We present Blue River Controls, a tool that
allows to train and test reinforcement learning algorithms on real-world
hardware. It features a simple interface based on OpenAI Gym, that works
directly on both simulation and hardware. We use Quanser's Qube Servo2-USB
platform, an underactuated rotary pendulum as an initial testing device. We
also provide tools to simplify training RL algorithms on other hardware.
Several baselines, from both classical controllers and pretrained RL agents are
included to compare performance across tasks. Blue River Controls is available

Title: Enabling Cyberattack-Resilient Load Forecasting through Adversarial
  Machine Learning
Authors: Zefan Tang, Jieying Jiao, Peng Zhang, Meng Yue, Chen Chen, Jun Yan
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In the face of an increasingly broad cyberattack surface,
cyberattack-resilient load forecasting for electric utilities is both more
necessary and more challenging than ever. In this paper, we propose an
adversarial machine learning (AML) approach, which can respond to a wide range
of attack behaviors without detecting outliers. It strikes a balance between
enhancing a system's robustness against cyberattacks and maintaining a
reasonable degree of forecasting accuracy when there is no attack. Attack
models and configurations for the adversarial training were selected and
evaluated to achieve the desired level of performance in a simulation study.
The results validate the effectiveness and excellent performance of the
proposed method.

Title: Temperature states in Powder Bed Fusion additive manufacturing are
  structurally controllable and observable
Authors: Nathaniel Wood, David Hoelzle
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) is a type of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology
that builds parts in a layer-by-layer fashion out of a bed of metal powder via
the selective melting action of a laser or electron beam heat source. The
technology has become widespread, however the demand is growing for closed loop
process monitoring and control in PBF systems to replace the open loop
architectures that exist today. Controls-based models have potential to satisfy
this demand by utilizing computationally tractable, simplified models while
also decreasing the error associated with these models. This paper introduces a
controls theoretic analysis of the PBF process, demonstrating models of PBF
that are asymptotically stable, stabilizable, and detectable. We show that
linear models of PBF are structurally controllable and structurally observable,
provided that any portion of the build is exposed to the energy source and
measurement, we provide conditions for which time-invariant PBF models are
classically controllable/observable, and we demonstrate energy requirements for
performing state estimation and control for time-invariant systems. This paper
therefore presents the foundation for an effective means of realizing closed
loop PBF quality control.

Title: Payload-Mass-Aware Trajectory Planning on Multi-User Autonomous Unmanned
  Aerial Vehicles
Authors: Vasileios Tsoutsouras, Joseph Story, Phillip Stanley-Marbell
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Future unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) will be shared by multiple users and
will have to operate in conditions where their fully-autonomous function is
required. Calculation of a drones trajectory will be important but optimal
trajectories cannot be calculated unless mass and flight speed are taken into
account. This article presents the case for on-drone trajectory planning in a
multi-user dynamic payload mass scenario, allowing a drone to calculate its
trajectory with no need for ground control communication. We formulate and
investigate on-drone trajectory planning under variable payload mass and flight
speed awareness, in cases where it is shared by multiple users or applications.
We present efficient solutions using a combination of heuristic and
optimization algorithms. To support this investigation, we present a new model
for the power dissipation of drone propulsion as a function of speed and
payload mass. We evaluate our proposed algorithmic solution on contemporary
embedded processors and demonstrate its capability to generate near-optimal
trajectories with limited computational overhead (less than 300 milliseconds on
an ARM Cortex-A9 SoC).

  Confidence intervals for the population mean of normally distributed data are
some of the most standard statistical outputs one might want from a database.
In this work we give practical differentially private algorithms for this task.
We provide five algorithms and then compare them to each other and to prior
work. We give concrete, experimental analysis of their accuracy and find that
our algorithms provide much more accurate confidence intervals than prior work.
For example, in one setting (with {\epsilon} = 0.1 and n = 2782) our algorithm
yields an interval that is only 1/15th the size of the standard set by prior
work.

Title: Learning to Zoom-in via Learning to Zoom-out: Real-world
  Super-resolution by Generating and Adapting Degradation
Authors: Dong Gong, Wei Sun, Qinfeng Shi, Anton van den Hengel, Yanning Zhang
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Most learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods aim to recover
high-resolution (HR) image from a given low-resolution (LR) image via learning
on LR-HR image pairs. The SR methods learned on synthetic data do not perform
well in real-world, due to the domain gap between the artificially synthesized
and real LR images. Some efforts are thus taken to capture real-world image
pairs. The captured LR-HR image pairs usually suffer from unavoidable
misalignment, which hampers the performance of end-to-end learning, however.
Here, focusing on the real-world SR, we ask a different question: since
misalignment is unavoidable, can we propose a method that does not need LR-HR
image pairing and alignment at all and utilize real images as they are? Hence
we propose a framework to learn SR from an arbitrary set of unpaired LR and HR
images and see how far a step can go in such a realistic and "unsupervised"
setting. To do so, we firstly train a degradation generation network to
generate realistic LR images and, more importantly, to capture their
distribution (i.e., learning to zoom out). Instead of assuming the domain gap
has been eliminated, we minimize the discrepancy between the generated data and
real data while learning a degradation adaptive SR network (i.e., learning to
zoom in). The proposed unpaired method achieves state-of-the-art SR results on
real-world images, even in the datasets that favor the paired-learning methods
more.

Title: Hypergraph Spectral Analysis and Processing in 3D Point Cloud
Authors: Songyang Zhang, Shuguang Cui, and Zhi Ding
Categories: eess.SP cs.CV
\\
  Along with increasingly popular virtual reality applications, the
three-dimensional (3D) point cloud has become a fundamental data structure to
characterize 3D objects and surroundings. To process 3D point clouds
efficiently, a suitable model for the underlying structure and outlier noises
is always critical. In this work, we propose a hypergraph-based new point cloud
model that is amenable to efficient analysis and processing. We introduce
tensor-based methods to estimate hypergraph spectrum components and frequency
coefficients of point clouds in both ideal and noisy settings. We establish an
analytical connection between hypergraph frequencies and structural features.
We further evaluate the efficacy of hypergraph spectrum estimation in two
common point cloud applications of sampling and denoising for which also we
elaborate specific hypergraph filter design and spectral properties. The
empirical performance demonstrates the strength of hypergraph signal processing
as a tool in 3D point clouds and the underlying properties.

\\
  Automated medical image segmentation is an important step in many medical
procedures. Recently, deep learning networks have been widely used for various
medical image segmentation tasks, with U-Net and generative adversarial nets
(GANs) being some of the commonly used ones. Foreground-background class
imbalance is a common occurrence in medical images, and U-Net has difficulty in
handling class imbalance because of its cross entropy (CE) objective function.
Similarly, GAN also suffers from class imbalance because the discriminator
looks at the entire image to classify it as real or fake. Since the
discriminator is essentially a deep learning classifier, it is incapable of
correctly identifying minor changes in small structures. To address these
issues, we propose a novel context based CE loss function for U-Net, and a
novel architecture Seg-GLGAN. The context based CE is a linear combination of
CE obtained over the entire image and its region of interest (ROI). In
Seg-GLGAN, we introduce a novel context discriminator to which the entire image
and its ROI are fed as input, thus enforcing local context. We conduct
extensive experiments using two challenging unbalanced datasets: PROMISE12 and
ACDC. We observe that segmentation results obtained from our methods give
better segmentation metrics as compared to various baseline methods.

\\
  Several variants of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been developed
for Magnetic Resonance (MR) image reconstruction. Among them, U-Net has shown
to be the baseline architecture for MR image reconstruction. However,
sub-sampling is performed by its pooling layers, causing information loss which
in turn leads to blur and missing fine details in the reconstructed image. We
propose a modification to the U-Net architecture to recover fine structures.
The proposed network is a wavelet packet transform based encoder-decoder CNN
with residual learning called CNN. The proposed WCNN has discrete wavelet
transform instead of pooling and inverse wavelet transform instead of unpooling
layers and residual connections. We also propose a deep cascaded framework
(DC-WCNN) which consists of cascades of WCNN and k-space data fidelity units to
achieve high quality MR reconstruction. Experimental results show that WCNN and
DC-WCNN give promising results in terms of evaluation metrics and better
recovery of fine details as compared to other methods.

Comments: Accepted at BVM 2020
\\
  Eye movements, blinking and other motion during the acquisition of optical
coherence tomography (OCT) can lead to artifacts, when processed to OCT
angiography (OCTA) images. Affected scans emerge as high intensity (white) or
missing (black) regions, resulting in lost information. The aim of this
research is to fill these gaps using a deep generative model for OCT to OCTA
image translation relying on a single intact OCT scan. Therefore, a U-Net is
trained to extract the angiographic information from OCT patches. At inference,
a detection algorithm finds outlier OCTA scans based on their surroundings,
which are then replaced by the trained network. We show that generative models
can augment the missing scans. The augmented volumes could then be used for 3-D
segmentation or increase the diagnostic value.

  Purpose: To advance research in the field of machine learning for MR image
reconstruction with an open challenge. Methods: We provided participants with a
dataset of raw k-space data from 1,594 consecutive clinical exams of the knee.
The goal of the challenge was to reconstruct images from these data. In order
to strike a balance between realistic data and a shallow learning curve for
those not already familiar with MR image reconstruction, we ran multiple tracks
for multi-coil and single-coil data. We performed a two-stage evaluation based
on quantitative image metrics followed by evaluation by a panel of
radiologists. The challenge ran from June to December of 2019. Results: We
received a total of 33 challenge submissions. All participants chose to submit
results from supervised machine learning approaches. Conclusion: The challenge
led to new developments in machine learning for image reconstruction, provided
insight into the current state of the art in the field, and highlighted
remaining hurdles for clinical adoption.

computing. We prove a general theorem for efficient local computation, giving
the necessary and sufficient conditions for a local operation to have zero
modularity cost. Applied to thermodynamically-generating stochastic processes
it confirms a conjecture that classical generators are efficient if and only if
they satisfy retrodiction, which places minimal memory requirements on the
generator. We extend this to quantum computation: any quantum generator that
employs quantum memory compression cannot be thermodynamically efficient.

Title: Coherent Quantum Channel Discrimination
Authors: Mark M. Wilde
Categories: quant-ph cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures, submission to ISIT 2020
\\
  This paper introduces coherent quantum channel discrimination as a coherent
version of conventional quantum channel discrimination. Coherent channel
discrimination is phrased here as a quantum interactive proof system between a
verifier and a prover, wherein the goal of the prover is to distinguish two
channels called in superposition in order to distill a Bell state at the end.
The key measure considered here is the success probability of distilling a Bell
state, and I prove that this success probability does not increase under the
action of a quantum superchannel, thus establishing this measure as a
fundamental measure of channel distinguishability. Also, I establish some
bounds on this success probability in terms of the success probability of
conventional channel discrimination. Finally, I provide an explicit
semi-definite program that can compute the success probability.

Title: Infinite-Horizon Differentiable Model Predictive Control
Authors: Sebastian East, Marco Gallieri, Jonathan Masci, Jan Koutnik, Mark
  Cannon
Categories: math.OC cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  This paper proposes a differentiable linear quadratic Model Predictive
Control (MPC) framework for safe imitation learning. The infinite-horizon cost
is enforced using a terminal cost function obtained from the discrete-time
algebraic Riccati equation (DARE), so that the learned controller can be proven
to be stabilizing in closed-loop. A central contribution is the derivation of
the analytical derivative of the solution of the DARE, thereby allowing the use
of differentiation-based learning methods. A further contribution is the
structure of the MPC optimization problem: an augmented Lagrangian method
ensures that the MPC optimization is feasible throughout training whilst
enforcing hard constraints on state and input, and a pre-stabilizing controller
ensures that the MPC solution and derivatives are accurate at each iteration.
The learning capabilities of the framework are demonstrated in a set of
numerical studies.

Title: Stochastic Local Interaction Model: Geostatistics without Kriging

\\
  Classical geostatistical methods face serious computational challenges if
they are confronted with large sets of spatially distributed data. We present a
simplified stochastic local interaction (SLI) model for computationally
efficient spatial prediction that can handle large data. The SLI method
constructs a spatial interaction matrix (precision matrix) that accounts for
the data values, their locations, and the sampling density variations without
user input. We show that this precision matrix is strictly positive definite.
The SLI approach does not require matrix inversion for parameter estimation,
spatial prediction, and uncertainty estimation, leading to computational
procedures that are significantly less intensive computationally than kriging.
The precision matrix involves compact kernel functions (spherical, quadratic,
etc.) which enable the application of sparse matrix methods, thus improving
computational time and memory requirements. We investigate the proposed SLI
method with a data set that includes approximately 11500 drill-hole data of
coal thickness from Campbell County (Wyoming, USA). We also compare SLI with
ordinary kriging (OK) in terms of estimation performance, using cross
validation analysis, and computational time. According to the validation
measures used, SLI performs slightly better in estimating seam thickness than
OK in terms of cross-validation measures. In terms of computation time, SLI
prediction is 3 to 25 times (depending on the size of the kriging neighborhood)
faster than OK for the same grid size.

Title: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Connected
  Vehicles
Authors: Dohyun Kwon and Joongheon Kim
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures, conference paper (GLOBECOM 2019)
\\
  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) base station can offer abundant high capacity
channel resources toward connected vehicles so that quality-of-service (QoS) of
them in terms of downlink throughput can be highly improved. The mmWave base
station can operate among existing base stations (e.g., macro-cell base
station) on non-overlapped channels among them and the vehicles can make
decision what base station to associate, and what channel to utilize on
heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, because of the non-omni property of mmWave
communication, the vehicles decide how to align the beam direction toward
mmWave base station to associate with it. However, such joint problem requires
high computational cost, which is NP-hard and has combinatorial features. In
this paper, we solve the problem in 3-tier heterogeneous vehicular network
(HetVNet) with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in a way that
maximizes expected total reward (i.e., downlink throughput) of vehicles. The
multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach is introduced
to achieve optimal policy in continuous action domain.

Title: Semi-Sequential Probabilistic Model For Indoor Localization Enhancement
Authors: Minh Tu Hoang, Brosnan Yuen, Xiaodai Dong, Tao Lu, Robert Westendorp,
  and Kishore Reddy
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
\\
  This paper proposes a semi-sequential probabilistic model (SSP) that applies
an additional short term memory to enhance the performance of the probabilistic
indoor localization. The conventional probabilistic methods normally treat the
locations in the database indiscriminately. In contrast, SSP leverages the
information of the previous position to determine the probable location since
the user's speed in an indoor environment is bounded and locations near the
previous one have higher probability than the other locations. Although the SSP
utilizes the previous location information, it does not require the exact
moving speed and direction of the user. On-site experiments using the received
signal strength indicator (RSSI) and channel state information (CSI)
fingerprints for localization demonstrate that SSP reduces the maximum error
and boosts the performance of existing probabilistic approaches by 25% - 30%.

\\
  Clinical trials in the medical domain are constrained by budgets. The number
of patients that can be recruited is therefore limited. When a patient
population is heterogeneous, this creates difficulties in learning subgroup
specific responses to a particular drug and especially for a variety of
dosages. In addition, patient recruitment can be difficult by the fact that
clinical trials do not aim to provide a benefit to any given patient in the
trial. In this paper, we propose C3T-Budget, a contextual constrained clinical
trial algorithm for dose-finding under both budget and safety constraints. The
algorithm aims to maximize drug efficacy within the clinical trial while also
learning about the drug being tested. C3T-Budget recruits patients with
consideration of the remaining budget, the remaining time, and the
characteristics of each group, such as the population distribution, estimated
expected efficacy, and estimation credibility. In addition, the algorithm aims
to avoid unsafe dosages. These characteristics are further illustrated in a
simulated clinical trial study, which corroborates the theoretical analysis and
demonstrates an efficient budget usage as well as a balanced learning-treatment
trade-off.

Title: Limited Angle Tomography for Transmission X-Ray Microscopy Using Deep
  Learning
Authors: Yixing Huang, Shengxiang Wang, Yong Guan, Andreas Maier

ACM-class: I.2.1; J.3

\\
  In transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) systems, the rotation of a scanned
sample might be restricted to a limited angular range to avoid collision to
other system parts or high attenuation at certain tilting angles. Image
reconstruction from such limited angle data suffers from artifacts due to
missing data. In this work, deep learning is applied to limited angle
reconstruction in TXMs for the first time. With the challenge to obtain
sufficient real data for training, training a deep neural network from
synthetic data is investigated. Particularly, the U-Net, the state-of-the-art
neural network in biomedical imaging, is trained from synthetic ellipsoid data
and multi-category data to reduce artifacts in filtered back-projection (FBP)
reconstruction images. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic data and
real scanned chlorella data in $100^\circ$ limited angle tomography. For
synthetic test data, the U-Net significantly reduces root-mean-square error
(RMSE) from $2.55 \times 10^{-3}$ {\mu}m$^{-1}$ in the FBP reconstruction to
$1.21 \times 10^{-3}$ {\mu}m$^{-1}$ in the U-Net reconstruction, and also
improves structural similarity (SSIM) index from 0.625 to 0.920. With penalized
weighted least square denoising of measured projections, the RMSE and SSIM are
further improved to $1.16 \times 10^{-3}$ {\mu}m$^{-1}$ and 0.932,
respectively. For real test data, the proposed method remarkably improves the
3-D visualization of the subcellular structures in the chlorella cell, which
indicates its important value for nano-scale imaging in biology, nanoscience
and materials science.

Title: Quantum subspace alignment for domain adaptation
Authors: Xi He and Xiaoting Wang
Categories: quant-ph cs.LG
Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Domain adaptation (DA) is used for adaptively obtaining labels of an
unprocessed data set with given a related, but different labelled data set.
Subspace alignment (SA), a representative DA algorithm, attempts to find a
linear transformation to align the two different data sets. The classifier
trained on the aligned labelled data set can be transferred to the unlabelled
data set to classify the target labels. In this paper, a quantum version of the
SA algorithm is proposed to implement the domain adaptation procedure on a
quantum computer. Compared with the classical SA algorithm, the quantum
algorithm presented in our work achieves at least quadratic speedup in the
number of given samples and the data dimension. In addition, the kernel method
is applied to the quantum SA algorithm to capture the nonlinear characteristics
of the data sets.

Title: Nonlinear Traffic Prediction as a Matrix Completion Problem with
  Ensemble Learning
Authors: Wenqing Li, Chuhan Yang, and Saif Eddin Jabari
Categories: math.OC cs.LG
\\
  We focus on short-term traffic forecasting for traffic operations management.
Specifically, we focus on forecasting traffic network sensor states in
high-resolution (second-by-second). Most work on traffic forecasting has
focused on predicting aggregated traffic variables, typically over intervals
that are no shorter than 5 minutes. The data resolution required for traffic
operations is challenging since high-resolution data exhibit heavier
oscillations and precise patterns are harder to capture. We propose a (big)
data-driven methodology for this purpose. Our contributions can be summarized
as offering three major insights: first, we show how the forecasting problem
can be modeled as a matrix completion problem. Second, we employ a
block-coordinate descent algorithm and demonstrate that the algorithm converges
in sub-linear time to a block coordinate-wise optimizer. This allows us to
capitalize on the ``bigness'' of high-resolution data in a computationally
feasible way. Third, we develop an adaptive boosting (or ensemble learning)
approach to reduce the training error to within any arbitrary error threshold.
The latter utilizes past days so that the boosting can be interpreted as
capturing periodic patterns in the data. The performance of the proposed method
is analyzed theoretically and tested empirically using a real-world
high-resolution traffic dataset from Abu Dhabi, UAE. Our experimental results
show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.

Title: Towards Automated Statistical Physics : Data-driven Modeling of Complex
  Systems with Deep Learning
Authors: Seungwoong Ha, Hawoong Jeong
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech cs.LG
Comments: 18 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables
\\
  Rich phenomena from complex systems have long intrigued researchers, and yet
modeling system micro-dynamics and inferring the forms of interaction are
challenging for conventional data-driven approaches, being generally
established by human scientists. In this study, we propose AgentNet, a
generalized data-driven framework to analyze and understand the hidden
interactions in complex systems. AgentNet utilizes a graph attention network to
model the interaction between individual agents and employs various encoders
and decoders that can be selectively applied to any desired system. Our model
successfully captured three different simulated complex systems, namely
cellular automata, the Vicsek model, and active Orenstein--Uhlenbeck particles
in which, notably, AgentNet's visualized attention values coincided with the
true interaction strength. Demonstration with empirical data from a flock of
birds showed that AgentNet prediction could yield the qualitatively same
collective phenomena as exhibited by real birds. We expect our framework to
open a novel path to investigating complex systems and to provide insight into
process-driven modeling.

\\
  Device variability is a bottleneck for the scalability of semiconductor
quantum devices. Increasing device control comes at the cost of a large
parameter space that has to be explored in order to find the optimal operating
conditions. We demonstrate a statistical tuning algorithm that navigates this
entire parameter space, using just a few modelling assumptions, in the search
for specific electron transport features. We focused on gate-defined quantum
dot devices, demonstrating fully automated tuning of two different devices to
double quantum dot regimes in an up to eight-dimensional gate voltage space. We
considered a parameter space defined by the maximum range of each gate voltage
in these devices, demonstrating expected tuning in under 70 minutes. This
performance exceeded a human benchmark, although we recognise that there is
room for improvement in the performance of both humans and machines. Our
approach is approximately 180 times faster than a pure random search of the
parameter space, and it is readily applicable to different material systems and
device architectures. With an efficient navigation of the gate voltage space we
are able to give a quantitative measurement of device variability, from one
device to another and after a thermal cycle of a device. This is a key
demonstration of the use of machine learning techniques to explore and optimise
the parameter space of quantum devices and overcome the challenge of device
variability.

Stochastic probabilistic programs allow straightforward specification and

nondeterminism. We give several examples of stochastic probabilistic programs,
and compare the programs with corresponding deterministic probabilistic
programs in terms of model specification and inference. We conclude with

Title: A Deterministic Model for the Transshipment Problem of a Fast Fashion
  Retailer under Capacity Constraints
Authors: Siamak Naderi, Kemal Kilic, and Abdullah Dasci
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.NA
Comments: Submitted to the International Journal of Production Economics
\\
  In this paper we present a novel transshipment problem for a large apparel
retailer that operates an extensive retail network. Our problem is inspired by
the logistics operations of a very large fast fashion retailer in Turkey, LC
Waikiki, with over 450 retail branches and thousands of products. The purpose
of transshipments is to rebalance stocks across the retail network to better
match supply with demand. We formulate this problem as a large mixed integer
linear program and develop a Lagrangian relaxation with a primal-dual approach
to find upper bounds and a simulated annealing based metaheuristic to find
promising solutions, both of which have proven to be quite effective. While our
metaheuristic does not always produce better solutions than a commercial
optimizer, it has consistently produced solutions with optimality gaps lower
than 7% while the commercial optimizer may produce very poor solutions with
optimality gaps as high as almost 300%. We have also conducted a set of
numerical experiments to uncover implications of various operational practices
of LC Waikiki on its system's performance and important managerial insights.

Authors: Ond\v{r}ej Mokr\'y and Pavel Rajmic
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
\\
  We deal with the problem of sparsity-based audio inpainting. A consequence of
optimization approaches is actually the insufficient energy of the signal
within the filled gap. We propose improvements to the audio inpainting
framework based on sparsity and convex optimization, aiming at compensating for
this energy loss. The new ideas are based on different types of weighting, both
in the coefficient and the time domains. We show that our propositions improve
the inpainting performance both in terms of the SNR and ODG. However, the
autoregressive Janssen algorithm remains a strong competitor.
