Title: Imagination-Augmented Deep Learning for Goal Recognition
Authors: Thibault Duhamel, Mariane Maynard and Froduald Kabanza
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Being able to infer the goal of people we observe, interact with, or read
stories about is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. A prominent idea
in current goal-recognition research is to infer the likelihood of an agent's
goal from the estimations of the costs of plans to the different goals the
agent might have. Different approaches implement this idea by relying only on
handcrafted symbolic representations. Their application to real-world settings
is, however, quite limited, mainly because extracting rules for the factors
that influence goal-oriented behaviors remains a complicated task. In this
paper, we introduce a novel idea of using a symbolic planner to compute
plan-cost insights, which augment a deep neural network with an imagination
capability, leading to improved goal recognition accuracy in real and synthetic
domains compared to a symbolic recognizer or a deep-learning goal recognizer
alone.

Title: FlapAI Bird: Training an Agent to Play Flappy Bird Using Reinforcement
  Learning Techniques
Authors: Tai Vu, Leon Tran
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Reinforcement learning is one of the most popular approach for automated game
playing. This method allows an agent to estimate the expected utility of its
state in order to make optimal actions in an unknown environment. We seek to
apply reinforcement learning algorithms to the game Flappy Bird. We implement
SARSA and Q-Learning with some modifications such as $\epsilon$-greedy policy,
discretization and backward updates. We find that SARSA and Q-Learning
outperform the baseline, regularly achieving scores of 1400+, with the highest
in-game score of 2069.

Title: Towards Automatic Bayesian Optimization: A first step involving
  acquisition functions
Authors: Eduardo C. Garrido Merch\'an, Luis C. Jariego P\'erez
Categories: cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Bayesian Optimization is the state of the art technique for the optimization
of black boxes, i.e., functions where we do not have access to their analytical
expression nor its gradients, they are expensive to evaluate and its evaluation
is noisy. The most popular application of bayesian optimization is the
automatic hyperparameter tuning of machine learning algorithms, where we obtain
the best configuration of machine learning algorithms by optimizing the
estimation of the generalization error of these algorithms. Despite being
applied with success, bayesian optimization methodologies also have
hyperparameters that need to be configured such as the probabilistic surrogate
model or the acquisition function used. A bad decision over the configuration
of these hyperparameters implies obtaining bad quality results. Typically,
these hyperparameters are tuned by making assumptions of the objective function
that we want to evaluate but there are scenarios where we do not have any prior
information about the objective function. In this paper, we propose a first
attempt over automatic bayesian optimization by exploring several heuristics
that automatically tune the acquisition function of bayesian optimization. We
illustrate the effectiveness of these heurisitcs in a set of benchmark problems
and a hyperparameter tuning problem of a machine learning algorithm.

Title: Basic concepts, definitions, and methods in D number theory
Authors: Xinyang Deng
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 28 pages, 2 figures
\\
  As a generalization of Dempster-Shafer theory, D number theory (DNT) aims to
provide a framework to deal with uncertain information with non-exclusiveness
and incompleteness. Although there are some advances on DNT in previous
studies, however, they lack of systematicness, and many important issues have
not yet been solved. In this paper, several crucial aspects in constructing a
perfect and systematic framework of DNT are considered. At first the
non-exclusiveness in DNT is formally defined and discussed. Secondly, a method
to combine multiple D numbers is proposed by extending previous exclusive
conflict redistribution (ECR) rule. Thirdly, a new pair of belief and
plausibility measures for D numbers are defined and many desirable properties
are satisfied by the proposed measures. Fourthly, the combination of
information-incomplete D numbers is studied specially to show how to deal with
the incompleteness of information in DNT. In this paper, we mainly give
relative math definitions, properties, and theorems, concrete examples and
applications will be considered in the future study.

Title: Identifying At-Risk K-12 Students in Multimodal Online Environments: A
  Machine Learning Approach
Authors: Hang Li, Wenbiao Ding, Songfan Yang, Zitao Liu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  With the rapid emergence of K-12 online learning platforms, a new era of
education has been opened up. By offering more affordable and personalized
courses compared to in-person classrooms, K-12 online tutoring is pushing the
boundaries of education to the general public. It is crucial to have a dropout
warning framework to preemptively identify K-12 students who are at risk of
dropping out of the online courses. Prior researchers have focused on
predicting dropout in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which often deliver
higher education, i.e., graduate level courses at top institutions. However,
few studies have focused on developing a machine learning approach for students
in K-12 online courses. The dropout prediction scenarios are significantly
different between MOOC based learning and K-12 online tutoring in many aspects
such as environmental modalities, learning goals, online behaviors, etc. In
this paper, we develop a machine learning framework to conduct accurate at-risk
student identification specialized in K-12 multimodal online environments. Our
approach considers both online and offline factors around K-12 students and
aims at solving the challenging problems of (1) multiple modalities, i.e., K-12
online environments involve interactions from different modalities such as
video, voice, etc; (2) length variability, i.e., students with different
lengths of learning history; (3) time sensitivity, i.e., the dropout likelihood
is changing with time; and (4) data imbalance, i.e., only less than 20\% of
K-12 students will choose to drop out the class. We conduct a wide range of
offline and online experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. In our offline experiments, we show that our method improves the
dropout prediction performance when compared to state-of-the-art baselines on a
real-world educational data set.

Title: Probabilistic Dual Network Architecture Search on Graphs
Authors: Yiren Zhao, Duo Wang, Xitong Gao, Robert Mullins, Pietro Lio, Mateja
  Jamnik
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  We present the first differentiable Network Architecture Search (NAS) for
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs show promising performance on a wide range
of tasks, but require a large amount of architecture engineering. First, graphs
are inherently a non-Euclidean and sophisticated data structure, leading to
poor adaptivity of GNN architectures across different datasets. Second, a
typical graph block contains numerous different components, such as aggregation
and attention, generating a large combinatorial search space. To counter these
problems, we propose a Probabilistic Dual Network Architecture Search (PDNAS)
framework for GNNs. PDNAS not only optimises the operations within a single
graph block (micro-architecture), but also considers how these blocks should be
connected to each other (macro-architecture). The dual architecture (micro- and
marco-architectures) optimisation allows PDNAS to find deeper GNNs on diverse
datasets with better performance compared to other graph NAS methods. Moreover,
we use a fully gradient-based search approach to update architectural
parameters, making it the first differentiable graph NAS method. PDNAS
outperforms existing hand-designed GNNs and NAS results, for example, on the
PPI dataset, PDNAS beats its best competitors by 1.67 and 0.17 in F1 scores.

  Studies on the Semantic Web Series

  Reasoning over OWL 2 is a very expensive task in general, and therefore the
W3C identified tractable profiles exhibiting good computational properties.
Ontological reasoning for many fragments of OWL 2 can be reduced to the
evaluation of Datalog queries. This paper surveys some of these compilations,
and in particular the one addressing queries over Horn-$\mathcal{SHIQ}$
knowledge bases and its implementation in DLV2 enanched by a new version of the

Title: Adaptive Informative Path Planning with Multimodal Sensing
Authors: Shushman Choudhury, Nate Gruver, Mykel J. Kochenderfer
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: First two authors contributed equally; International Conference on
  Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) 2020
\\
  Adaptive Informative Path Planning (AIPP) problems model an agent tasked with
obtaining information subject to resource constraints in unknown, partially
observable environments. Existing work on AIPP has focused on representing
observations about the world as a result of agent movement. We formulate the
more general setting where the agent may choose between different sensors at
the cost of some energy, in addition to traversing the environment to gather
information. We call this problem AIPPMS (MS for Multimodal Sensing). AIPPMS
requires reasoning jointly about the effects of sensing and movement in terms
of both energy expended and information gained. We frame AIPPMS as a Partially
Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and solve it with online planning.
Our approach is based on the Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning
framework with modifications to ensure constraint feasibility and a heuristic
rollout policy tailored for AIPPMS. We evaluate our method on two domains: a
simulated search-and-rescue scenario and a challenging extension to the classic
RockSample problem. We find that our approach outperforms a classic AIPP
algorithm that is modified for AIPPMS, as well as online planning using a
random rollout policy.

Title: Composite Monte Carlo Decision Making under High Uncertainty of Novel
  Coronavirus Epidemic Using Hybridized Deep Learning and Fuzzy Rule Induction
Authors: Simon James Fong, Gloria Li, Nilanjan Dey, Ruben Gonzalez Crespo,
  Enrique Herrera-Viedma
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 19 pages
\\
  In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019,
governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions
under high uncertainty at their best efforts. Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC)
simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are
broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many
possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability
distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested
cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities
around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the
population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds
and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is
reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of
a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and
the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case
study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule
induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development
is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a
MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction
of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited
from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell
about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.

Title: K-Core based Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Dynamic Graphs
Authors: Jingxin Liu, Chang Xu, Chang Yin, Weiqiang Wu and You Song
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Graph representation learning is a fundamental task of various applications,
aiming to learn low-dimensional embeddings for nodes which can preserve graph
topology information. However, many existing methods focus on static graphs
while ignoring graph evolving patterns. Inspired by the success of graph
convolutional networks(GCNs) in static graph embedding, we propose a novel
k-core based temporal graph convolutional network, namely CTGCN, to learn node
representations for dynamic graphs. In contrast to previous dynamic graph
embedding methods, CTGCN can preserve both local connective proximity and
global structural similarity in a unified framework while simultaneously
capturing graph dynamics. In the proposed framework, the traditional graph
convolution operation is generalized into two parts: feature transformation and
feature aggregation, which gives CTGCN more flexibility and enables CTGCN to
learn connective and structural information under the same framework.
Experimental results on 7 real-world graphs demonstrate CTGCN outperforms
existing state-of-the-art graph embedding methods in several tasks, such as
link prediction and structural role classification. The source code of this
work can be obtained from https://github.com/jhljx/CTGCN.

  In this paper we designed an efficient expert system to diagnose diseases for
human beings. The system depended on several clinical features for different
diseases which will be used as knowledge base for this system. We used fuzzy
logic system which is one of the most expert systems techniques that used in
building knowledge base of expert systems. Fuzzy logic will be used to
inference the results of disease diagnosing. We also provided the system with
multimedia such as videos, pictures and information for most of disease that
have been achieved in our system. The system implemented using Matlab ToolBox
and fifteen diseases were studied. Five cases for normal, affected and
unaffected people's different diseases have been tested on this system. The
results show that system was able to predict the status whether a human has a
disease or not accurately. All system results are reported in tables and
discussed in detail.

Title: Toward Tag-free Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis: A Multiple Attention
  Network Approach
Authors: Yao Qiang, Xin Li, Dongxiao Zhu
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: to appear in the proceedings of IJCNN'20
\\
  Existing aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) approaches leverage various
neural network models to extract the aspect sentiments via learning
aspect-specific feature representations. However, these approaches heavily rely
on manual tagging of user reviews according to the predefined aspects as the
input, a laborious and time-consuming process. Moreover, the underlying methods
do not explain how and why the opposing aspect level polarities in a user
review lead to the overall polarity. In this paper, we tackle these two
problems by designing and implementing a new Multiple-Attention Network (MAN)
approach for more powerful ABSA without the need for aspect tags using two new
tag-free data sets crawled directly from TripAdvisor
({https://www.tripadvisor.com}). With the Self- and Position-Aware attention
mechanism, MAN is capable of extracting both aspect level and overall
sentiments from the text reviews using the aspect level and overall customer
ratings, and it can also detect the vital aspect(s) leading to the overall
sentiment polarity among different aspects via a new aspect ranking scheme. We
carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate the strong performance of MAN
compared to other state-of-the-art ABSA approaches and the explainability of
our approach by visualizing and interpreting attention weights in case studies.

Title: Optimization of Operation Startegy for Primary Torque based hydrostatic
  Drivetrain using Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Yusheng Xiang and Marcus Geimer
Categories: cs.AI cs.RO
Comments: 9 pages, 23 figures
\\
  A new primary torque control concept for hydrostatics mobile machines was
introduced in 2018. The mentioned concept controls the pressure in a closed
circuit by changing the angle of the hydraulic pump to achieve the desired
pressure based on a feedback system. Thanks to this concept, a series of
advantages are expected. However, while working in a Y cycle, the primary
torque-controlled wheel loader has worse performance in efficiency compared to
secondary controlled earthmover due to lack of recuperation ability.
Alternatively, we use deep learning algorithms to improve machines'
regeneration performance. In this paper, we firstly make a potential analysis
to show the benefit by utilizing the regeneration process, followed by
proposing a series of CRDNNs, which combine CNN, RNN, and DNN, to precisely
detect Y cycles. Compared to existing algorithms, the CRDNN with bi-directional
LSTMs has the best accuracy, and the CRDNN with LSTMs has a comparable
performance but much fewer training parameters. Based on our dataset including
119 truck loading cycles, our best neural network shows a 98.2% test accuracy.
Therefore, even with a simple regeneration process, our algorithm can improve
the holistic efficiency of mobile machines up to 9% during Y cycle processes if
primary torque concept is used.

Authors: Ion Matei, Johan de Kleer, Christoforos Somarakis, Rahul Rai and John
  S. Baras
Categories: cs.AI math.DS math.OC
\\
  To understand changes in physical systems and facilitate decisions,
explaining how model predictions are made is crucial. We use model-based
interpretability, where models of physical systems are constructed by composing
basic constructs that explain locally how energy is exchanged and transformed.
We use the port Hamiltonian (p-H) formalism to describe the basic constructs
that contain physically interpretable processes commonly found in the behavior
of physical systems. We describe how we can build models out of the p-H
constructs and how we can train them. In addition we show how we can impose
physical properties such as dissipativity that ensure numerical stability of
the training process. We give examples on how to build and train models for
describing the behavior of two physical systems: the inverted pendulum and
swarm dynamics.

\\
  In this paper we present a novel approach to optimise tactical and strategic
decision making in football (soccer). We model the game of football as a
multi-stage game which is made up from a Bayesian game to model the pre-match
decisions and a stochastic game to model the in-match state transitions and
decisions. Using this formulation, we propose a method to predict the
probability of game outcomes and the payoffs of team actions. Building upon
this, we develop algorithms to optimise team formation and in-game tactics with
different objectives. Empirical evaluation of our approach on real-world
datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics from our
Bayesian and stochastic games, we can increase a team chances of winning by up
to 16.1\% and 3.4\% respectively.

Title: From Bit To Bedside: A Practical Framework For Artificial Intelligence
  Product Development In Healthcare
Authors: David Higgins and Vince I. Madai
Categories: cs.AI stat.AP
Comments: 30 pages, 4 figures
ACM-class: I.2.1; J.3; H.4.1
\\
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare holds great potential to expand
access to high-quality medical care, whilst reducing overall systemic costs.
Despite hitting the headlines regularly and many publications of
proofs-of-concept, certified products are failing to breakthrough to the
clinic. AI in healthcare is a multi-party process with deep knowledge required
in multiple individual domains. The lack of understanding of the specific
challenges in the domain is, therefore, the major contributor to the failure to
deliver on the big promises. Thus, we present a decision perspective framework,
for the development of AI-driven biomedical products, from conception to market
launch. Our framework highlights the risks, objectives and key results which
are typically required to proceed through a three-phase process to the market
launch of a validated medical AI product. We focus on issues related to
Clinical validation, Regulatory affairs, Data strategy and Algorithmic
development. The development process we propose for AI in healthcare software
strongly diverges from modern consumer software development processes. We
highlight the key time points to guide founders, investors and key stakeholders
throughout their relevant part of the process. Our framework should be seen as
a template for innovation frameworks, which can be used to coordinate team
communications and responsibilities towards a reasonable product development
roadmap, thus unlocking the potential of AI in medicine.

  With the widespread adoption of the quantified self movement, an increasing
number of users rely on mobile applications to monitor their physical activity
through their smartphones. Granting to applications a direct access to sensor
data expose users to privacy risks. Indeed, usually these motion sensor data
are transmitted to analytics applications hosted on the cloud leveraging
machine learning models to provide feedback on their health to users. However,
nothing prevents the service provider to infer private and sensitive
information about a user such as health or demographic attributes.In this
paper, we present DySan, a privacy-preserving framework to sanitize motion
sensor data against unwanted sensitive inferences (i.e., improving privacy)
while limiting the loss of accuracy on the physical activity monitoring (i.e.,
maintaining data utility). To ensure a good trade-off between utility and
privacy, DySan leverages on the framework of Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) to sanitize the sensor data. More precisely, by learning in a competitive
manner several networks, DySan is able to build models that sanitize motion
data against inferences on a specified sensitive attribute (e.g., gender) while
maintaining a high accuracy on activity recognition. In addition, DySan
dynamically selects the sanitizing model which maximize the privacy according
to the incoming data. Experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate that
DySan can drasticallylimit the gender inference to 47% while only reducing the
accuracy of activity recognition by 3%.

Title: Weighting NTBEA for Game AI Optimisation
Authors: James Goodman and Simon Lucas
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  The N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm (NTBEA) has proven very effective
in optimising algorithm parameters in Game AI. A potential weakness is the use
of a simple average of all component Tuples in the model. This study
investigates a refinement to the N-Tuple model used in NTBEA by weighting these
component Tuples by their level of information and specificity of match. We
introduce weighting functions to the model to obtain Weighted- NTBEA and test
this on four benchmark functions and two game environments. These tests show
that vanilla NTBEA is the most reliable and performant of the algorithms
tested. Furthermore we show that given an iteration budget it is better to
execute several independent NTBEA runs, and use part of the budget to find the
best recommendation from these runs.

Title: What is Normal, What is Strange, and What is Missing in a Knowledge
  Graph: Unified Characterization via Inductive Summarization

\\
  Knowledge graphs (KGs) store highly heterogeneous information about the world
in the structure of a graph, and are useful for tasks such as question
answering and reasoning. However, they often contain errors and are missing
information. Vibrant research in KG refinement has worked to resolve these
issues, tailoring techniques to either detect specific types of errors or
complete a KG.
  In this work, we introduce a unified solution to KG characterization by
formulating the problem as unsupervised KG summarization with a set of
inductive, soft rules, which describe what is normal in a KG, and thus can be
used to identify what is abnormal, whether it be strange or missing. Unlike
first-order logic rules, our rules are labeled, rooted graphs, i.e., patterns
that describe the expected neighborhood around a (seen or unseen) node, based
on its type, and information in the KG. Stepping away from the traditional
support/confidence-based rule mining techniques, we propose KGist, Knowledge
Graph Inductive SummarizaTion, which learns a summary of inductive rules that
best compress the KG according to the Minimum Description Length principle---a
formulation that we are the first to use in the context of KG rule mining. We
apply our rules to three large KGs (NELL, DBpedia, and Yago), and tasks such as
compression, various types of error detection, and identification of incomplete
information. We show that KGist outperforms task-specific, supervised and
unsupervised baselines in error detection and incompleteness identification,
(identifying the location of up to 93% of missing entities---over 10% more than
baselines), while also being efficient for large knowledge graphs.

Title: Soft-Error and Hard-fault Tolerant Architecture and Routing Algorithm
  for Reliable 3D-NoC Systems
Authors: Khanh N. Dang, Yuichi Okuyama, Abderazek Ben Abdallah
Categories: cs.AR
\\
  Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm has been proposed as an auspicious solution to
handle the strict communication requirements between the increasingly large
number of cores on a single multi and many-core chips. However, NoC systems are
exposed to a variety of manufacturing, design and energetic particles factors
making them vulnerable to permanent (hard) faults and transient (soft) errors.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive soft error and hard fault tolerant
3D-NoC architecture, named 3D-Hard-Fault-Soft-Error-Tolerant-OASIS-NoC
(3D-FETO). With the aid of adaptive algorithms, 3D-FETO is capable of detecting
and recovering from soft errors occurring in the routing pipeline stages and is
leveraging on reconfigurable components to handle permanent faults occurrence
in links, input buffers, and crossbar. In-depth evaluation results show that
the 3D-FETO system is able to work around different kinds of hard faults and
soft errors while ensuring graceful performance degradation, minimizing the
additional hardware complexity and remaining power-efficient.

\\
  Three-Dimensional Networks-on-Chips (3D-NoCs) have been proposed as an
auspicious solution, merging the high parallelism of the Network-on-Chip (NoC)
paradigm with the high-performance and low-power cost of 3D-ICs. However, as
technology scales down, the reliability issues are becoming more crucial,
especially for complex 3D-NoC which provides the communication requirements of
multi and many-core systems-on-chip. Reliability assessment is prominent for
early stages of the manufacturing process to prevent costly redesigns of a
target system. In this paper, we present an accurate reliability assessment and
quantitative evaluation of a soft-error resilient 3D-NoC based on a soft-error
resilient mechanism. The system can recover from transient errors occurring in
different pipeline stages of the router. Based on this analysis, the effects of
failures in the network's principal components are determined.

Title: $P\neq NP$
Authors: Tianrong Lin
Categories: cs.CC
Comments: Submission for review, comments are welcome
\\
  The whole discussions are divided into two parts, one is for $|\Sigma|\geq 2$
(general case), another is for $|\Sigma|=1$ (special case). The main
contribution of the present paper is that a series of results are obtained.
Specifically, we prove in general case that: (1) Let $L_1\in NP-P$ and $L_2\in
P$, then the complexity of problem on reducibility from $L_1$ to $L_2$ is
$\Omega(m^{p(|\omega|)})$, $m\geq 2$ is a constant, where $p$ is a polynomial
and $\omega\in\Sigma^*$ the input; (2) There exists no polynomial-time
algorithm for {\it SAT}; (3) An immediate corollary of (1) and (2) is that
$P\neq NP$, which also can be deduced from (6), see Remark 7.1; (4) Let $L_1\in
coNP-coP$ and $L_2\in coP$, then the complexity of problem on reducibility from
$L_1$ to $L_2$ is $\Omega(m^{p(|\omega|)})$, $m\geq 2$ is a constant, where $p$
is a polynomial and $\omega\in\Sigma^*$ the input; (5) There exists no
polynomial-time algorithm for {\it TAUT}; (6) An immediate corollary of (4) and
(5) is that $coP\neq coNP$;
  We next study the problem in special case. It is shown that:
  (1) the complexity of problem of reducibility from $L_1\in NP-P$ (resp.~
$L_1\in coNP-coP$) to $L_2\in P$ (resp.~$L_2\in coP$) is $\mathcal
{O}(p^{''}(|\omega|))$ where $p^{''}$ is a polynomial and $\omega\in\Sigma^*$
the input; (2) an immediate corollary is that $P=NP$ and $coP=coNP$ in the
special case.
  However, the title of the paper will only reflect the general case.

Title: Lower Bounds on the Running Time of Two-Way Quantum Finite Automata and
  Sublogarithmic-Space Quantum Turing Machines
Authors: Zachary Remscrim (MIT)
Categories: cs.CC
\\
  The two-way finite automaton with quantum and classical states (2QCFA),
defined by Ambainis and Watrous, is a model of quantum computation whose
quantum part is extremely limited; however, as they showed, 2QCFA are
surprisingly powerful: a 2QCFA with only a single-qubit can recognize the
language $L_{pal}=\{w \in \{a,b\}^*:w \text{ is a palindrome}\}$ with bounded
error in expected time $2^{O(n)}$, on inputs of length $n$.
  We prove that their result essentially cannot be improved upon: a 2QCFA (of
any size) cannot recognize $L_{pal}$ with bounded error in expected time
$2^{o(n)}$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a language that can
be recognized with bounded error by a 2QCFA in exponential time but not in
subexponential time. Moreover, we prove that a quantum Turing machine (QTM)
running in space $o(\log n)$ and expected time $2^{n^{1-\Omega(1)}}$ cannot
recognize $L_{pal}$ with bounded error; again, this is the first lower bound of
its kind.
  Far more generally, we establish a lower bound on the running time of any
2QCFA or $o(\log n)$-space QTM that recognizes any language $L$ in terms of a
natural ``hardness measure" of $L$. This allows us to exhibit a large family of
languages for which we have asymptotically matching lower and upper bounds on
the running time of any such 2QCFA or QTM recognizer.

Title: The Power of a Single Qubit: Two-way Quantum Finite Automata and the
  Word Problem
Authors: Zachary Remscrim (MIT)
Categories: cs.CC
\\
  The two-way finite automaton with quantum and classical states (2QCFA),
defined by Ambainis and Watrous, is a model of quantum computation whose
quantum part is extremely limited; however, as they showed, 2QCFA are
surprisingly powerful: a 2QCFA, with a single qubit, can recognize, with
bounded error, the language $L_{eq}=\{a^m b^m :m \in \mathbb{N}\}$ in expected
polynomial time and the language $L_{pal}=\{w \in \{a,b\}^*:w \text{ is a
palindrome}\}$ in expected exponential time.
  We further demonstrate the power of 2QCFA by showing that they can recognize
the word problems of many groups. In particular 2QCFA, with a single qubit and
algebraic number transition amplitudes, can recognize, with bounded error, the
word problem of any finitely generated virtually abelian group in expected
polynomial time, as well as the word problems of a large class of linear groups
in expected exponential time. This latter class (properly) includes all groups
with context-free word problem. We also exhibit results for 2QCFA with any
finite number of qubits.
  As a corollary, we obtain a direct improvement on the original Ambainis and
Watrous result by showing that $L_{eq}$ can be recognized by a 2QCFA with
better parameters. As a further corollary, we show that 2QCFA can recognize
certain non-context-free languages in expected polynomial time.
  In a companion paper, we prove matching lower bounds, thereby showing that
the class of languages recognizable with bounded error by a 2QCFA in expected
$\mathit{subexponential}$ time is properly contained in the class of languages
recognizable with bounded error by a 2QCFA in expected $\mathit{exponential}$
time.

\\
  Consider $n^2-1$ unit-square blocks in an $n \times n$ square board, where
each block is labeled as movable horizontally (only), movable vertically
(only), or immovable -- a variation of Rush Hour with only $1 \times 1$ cars
and fixed blocks. We prove that it is PSPACE-complete to decide whether a given
block can reach the left edge of the board, by reduction from Nondeterministic
Constraint Logic via 2-color oriented Subway Shuffle. By contrast,
polynomial-time algorithms are known for deciding whether a given block can be
moved by one space, or when each block either is immovable or can move both
horizontally and vertically. Our result answers a 15-year-old open problem by
Tromp and Cilibrasi, and strengthens previous PSPACE-completeness results for
Rush Hour with vertical $1 \times 2$ and horizontal $2 \times 1$ movable blocks
and 4-color Subway Shuffle.

Title: The Computational Complexity of Evil Hangman
Authors: J\'er\'emy Barbay, Bernardo Subercaseaux
Categories: cs.CC
\\
  The game of Hangman is a classical asymmetric two player game in which one
player, the setter, chooses a secret word from a language, that the other
player, the guesser, tries to discover through single letter matching queries,
answered by all occurrences of this letter if any. In the Evil Hangman variant,
the setter can change the secret word during the game, as long as the new
choice is consistent with the information already given to the guesser. We show
that a greedy strategy for Evil Hangman can perform arbitrarily far from
optimal, and most importantly, that playing optimally as an Evil Hangman setter
is computationally difficult. The latter result holds even assuming perfect
knowledge of the language, for several classes of languages, ranging from
Finite to Turing Computable. The proofs are based on reductions to Dominating
Set on 3-regular graphs and to the Membership problem, combinatorial problems
already known to be computationally hard.

Title: Intelligent multiscale simulation based on process-guided composite
  database
Authors: Zeliang Liu, Haoyan Wei, Tianyu Huang, C.T. Wu
Categories: cs.CE cs.LG physics.comp-ph
Comments: 15 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables
\\
  In the paper, we present an integrated data-driven modeling framework based
on process modeling, material homogenization, mechanistic machine learning, and
concurrent multiscale simulation. We are interested in the injection-molded
short fiber reinforced composites, which have been identified as key material
systems in automotive, aerospace, and electronics industries. The molding
process induces spatially varying microstructures across various length scales,
while the resulting strongly anisotropic and nonlinear material properties are
still challenging to be captured by conventional modeling approaches. To
prepare the linear elastic training data for our machine learning tasks,
Representative Volume Elements (RVE) with different fiber orientations and
volume fractions are generated through stochastic reconstruction. More
importantly, we utilize the recently proposed Deep Material Network (DMN) to
learn the hidden microscale morphologies from data. With essential physics
embedded in its building blocks, this data-driven material model can be
extrapolated to predict nonlinear material behaviors efficiently and
accurately. Through the transfer learning of DMN, we create a unified
process-guided material database that covers a full range of geometric
descriptors for short fiber reinforced composites. Finally, this unified DMN
database is implemented and coupled with macroscale finite element model to
enable concurrent multiscale simulations. From our perspective, the proposed
framework is also promising in many other emergent multiscale engineering
systems, such as additive manufacturing and compressive molding.

Title: Testing Polynomials for Vanishing on Cartesian Products of Planar Point
  Sets
Authors: Boris Aronov, Esther Ezra, and Micha Sharir
Categories: cs.CG
ACM-class: F.2.2
\\
  We present subquadratic algorithms, in the algebraic decision-tree model of
computation, for detecting whether there exists a triple of points, belonging
to three respective sets $A$, $B$, and $C$ of points in the plane, that satisfy
a certain polynomial equation or two equations. The best known instance of such
a problem is testing for the existence of a collinear triple of points in
$A\times B\times C$, a classical 3SUM-hard problem that has so far defied any
attempt to obtain a subquadratic solution, whether in the (uniform) real RAM
model, or in the algebraic decision-tree model. While we are still unable to
solve this problem, in full generality, in subquadratic time, we obtain such a
solution, in the algebraic decision-tree model, that uses only roughly
$O(n^{28/15})$ constant-degree polynomial sign tests, for the special case
where two of the sets lie on one-dimensional curves and the third is placed
arbitrarily in the plane.
  As a second application of our technique, we again have three $n$-point sets
$A$, $B$, and $C$ in the plane, and we want to determine whether there exists a
triple $(a,b,c) \in A\times B\times C$ that simultaneously satisfies two real
polynomial equations. For example, this is the setup when testing for the
existence of pairs of similar triangles spanned by the input points, in various
contexts discussed later in the paper. We show that problems of this kind can
be solved with roughly $O(n^{24/13})$ constant-degree polynomial sign tests.
This is a considerable improvement, given the 3SUM-hardness of the triangle
similarity problem that we discuss and the lack of any subquadratic algorithm
for it (or for any similar problem) in the uniform model.

Title: On the snappability and singularity-distance of frameworks with bars and

Authors: Georg Nawratil

MSC-class: 74A05
\\
  In a recent article the author presented a method to measure the snapping
capability -- shortly called snappability -- of bar-joint frameworks based on
the total elastic strain energy by computing the deformation of all bars using
Hooke's law and the definition of Cauchy/Engineering strain. Within the paper
at hand, we extend this approach to frameworks composed of bars and triangular
plates by using the physical concept of Green-Lagrange strain. An intrinsic
pseudometric based on the resulting total elastic strain energy density cannot
only be used for evaluating the snappability but also for measuring the
distance to the closest singular configuration. The presented methods are
demonstrated on the basis of the 3-legged planar parallel manipulator.

Categories: cs.CG
Comments: To appear in: Proceedings 36th International Symposium on
  Computational Geometry (SoCG 2020)
\\
  We investigate how the complexity of Euclidean TSP for point sets $P$ inside
the strip $(-\infty,+\infty)\times [0,\delta]$ depends on the strip width
$\delta$. We obtain two main results. First, for the case where the points have
distinct integer $x$-coordinates, we prove that a shortest bitonic tour (which
can be computed in $O(n\log^2 n)$ time using an existing algorithm) is
guaranteed to be a shortest tour overall when $\delta\leq 2\sqrt{2}$, a bound
which is best possible. Second, we present an algorithm that is fixed-parameter
tractable with respect to $\delta$. More precisely, our algorithm has running
time $2^{O(\sqrt{\delta})} n^2$ for sparse point sets, where each
$1\times\delta$ rectangle inside the strip contains $O(1)$ points. For random
point sets, where the points are chosen uniformly at random from the
rectangle~$[0,n]\times [0,\delta]$, it has an expected running time of
$2^{O(\sqrt{\delta})} n^2 + O(n^3)$.

Title: TArC: Incrementally and Semi-Automatically Collecting a Tunisian Arabish
  Corpus
Authors: Elisa Gugliotta, Marco Dinarelli
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  This article describes the constitution process of the first
morpho-syntactically annotated Tunisian Arabish Corpus (TArC). Arabish, also
known as Arabizi, is a spontaneous coding of Arabic dialects in Latin
characters and arithmographs (numbers used as letters). This code-system was
developed by Arabic-speaking users of social media in order to facilitate the
writing in the Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) and text messaging
informal frameworks. There is variety in the realization of Arabish amongst
dialects, and each Arabish code-system is under-resourced, in the same way as
most of the Arabic dialects. In the last few years, the focus on Arabic
dialects in the NLP field has considerably increased. Taking this into
consideration, TArC will be a useful support for different types of analyses,
computational and linguistic, as well as for NLP tools training. In this
article we will describe preliminary work on the TArC semi-automatic
construction process and some of the first analyses we developed on TArC. In
addition, in order to provide a complete overview of the challenges faced
during the building process, we will present the main Tunisian dialect
characteristics and their encoding in Tunisian Arabish.

Title: A Framework for Generating Explanations from Temporal Personal Health
  Data

Categories: cs.CL cs.DB
Comments: 30 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Whereas it has become easier for individuals to track their personal health
data (e.g., heart rate, step count, food log), there is still a wide chasm
between the collection of data and the generation of meaningful explanations to
help users better understand what their data means to them. With an increased
comprehension of their data, users will be able to act upon the newfound
information and work towards striving closer to their health goals. We aim to
bridge the gap between data collection and explanation generation by mining the
data for interesting behavioral findings that may provide hints about a user's
tendencies. Our focus is on improving the explainability of temporal personal
health data via a set of informative summary templates, or "protoforms." These
protoforms span both evaluation-based summaries that help users evaluate their
health goals and pattern-based summaries that explain their implicit behaviors.
In addition to individual users, the protoforms we use are also designed for
population-level summaries. We apply our approach to generate summaries (both
univariate and multivariate) from real user data and show that our system can
generate interesting and useful explanations.

Title: Analyzing Word Translation of Transformer Layers
Authors: Hongfei Xu and Josef van Genabith and Deyi Xiong and Qiuhui Liu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The Transformer translation model is popular for its effective
parallelization and performance. Though a wide range of analysis about the
Transformer has been conducted recently, the role of each Transformer layer in
translation has not been studied to our knowledge. In this paper, we propose
approaches to analyze the translation performed in encoder / decoder layers of
the Transformer. Our approaches in general project the representations of an
analyzed layer to the pre-trained classifier and measure the word translation
accuracy. For the analysis of encoder layers, our approach additionally learns
a weight vector to merge multiple attention matrices into one and transform the
source encoding to the target side with the merged alignment matrix to align
source tokens with target translations while bridging different input - output
lengths. While analyzing decoder layers, we additionally study the effects of
the source context and the decoding history in word prediction through
bypassing the corresponding self-attention or cross-attention sub-layers. Our
analysis reveals that the translation starts at the very beginning of the
"encoding" (specifically at the source word embedding layer), and shows how
translation evolves during the forward computation of layers. Based on
observations gained in our analysis, we propose that increasing encoder depth
while removing the same number of decoder layers can simply but significantly
boost the decoding speed. Furthermore, simply inserting a linear projection
layer before the decoder classifier which shares the weight matrix with the
embedding layer can effectively provide small but consistent and significant
improvements in our experiments on the WMT 14 English-German, English-French
and WMT 15 Czech-English translation tasks (+0.42, +0.37 and +0.47

Title: A Joint Approach to Compound Splitting and Idiomatic Compound Detection
Authors: Irina Krotova and Sergey Aksenov and Ekaterina Artemova
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 8 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure, accepted at LREC 2020
\\
  Applications such as machine translation, speech recognition, and information
retrieval require efficient handling of noun compounds as they are one of the
possible sources for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In-depth processing of noun
compounds requires not only splitting them into smaller components (or even
roots) but also the identification of instances that should remain unsplitted
as they are of idiomatic nature. We develop a two-fold deep learning-based
approach of noun compound splitting and idiomatic compound detection for the
German language that we train using a newly collected corpus of annotated
German compounds. Our neural noun compound splitter operates on a sub-word
level and outperforms the current state of the art by about 5%.

Title: Prior Knowledge Driven Label Embedding for Slot Filling in Natural
  Language Understanding
Authors: Su Zhu, Zijian Zhao, Rao Ma, and Kai Yu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI

  SPEECH, AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING
DOI: 10.1109/TASLP.2020.2980152
\\
  Traditional slot filling in natural language understanding (NLU) predicts a
one-hot vector for each word. This form of label representation lacks semantic
correlation modelling, which leads to severe data sparsity problem, especially
when adapting an NLU model to a new domain. To address this issue, a novel
label embedding based slot filling framework is proposed in this paper. Here,
distributed label embedding is constructed for each slot using prior knowledge.
Three encoding methods are investigated to incorporate different kinds of prior
knowledge about slots: atomic concepts, slot descriptions, and slot exemplars.
The proposed label embeddings tend to share text patterns and reuses data with
different slot labels. This makes it useful for adaptive NLU with limited data.
Also, since label embedding is independent of NLU model, it is compatible with
almost all deep learning based slot filling models. The proposed approaches are
evaluated on three datasets. Experiments on single domain and domain adaptation
tasks show that label embedding achieves significant performance improvement
over traditional one-hot label representation as well as advanced zero-shot
approaches.

Title: SAC: Accelerating and Structuring Self-Attention via Sparse Adaptive
  Connection
Authors: Xiaoya Li, Yuxian Meng, Qinghong Han, Fei Wu and Jiwei Li
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  While the self-attention mechanism has been widely used in a wide variety of
tasks, it has the unfortunate property of a quadratic cost with respect to the
input length, which makes it difficult to deal with long inputs. In this paper,
we present a method for accelerating and structuring self-attentions: Sparse
Adaptive Connection (SAC). In SAC, we regard the input sequence as a graph and
attention operations are performed between linked nodes. In contrast with
previous self-attention models with pre-defined structures (edges), the model
learns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances. In
this way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the
quadratic complexity regardless of the sequence length. Based on SAC, we show
that previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases. Through
extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph
representation learning and image classification, we demonstrate SAC is
competitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory
cost.

Title: Caption Generation of Robot Behaviors based on Unsupervised Learning of
  Action Segments
Authors: Koichiro Yoshino, Kohei Wakimoto, Yuta Nishimura, Satoshi Nakamura
Categories: cs.CL cs.RO
Comments: Will appear in IWSDS2020
\\
  Bridging robot action sequences and their natural language captions is an
important task to increase explainability of human assisting robots in their
recently evolving field. In this paper, we propose a system for generating
natural language captions that describe behaviors of human assisting robots.
The system describes robot actions by using robot observations; histories from
actuator systems and cameras, toward end-to-end bridging between robot actions
and natural language captions. Two reasons make it challenging to apply
existing sequence-to-sequence models to this mapping: 1) it is hard to prepare
a large-scale dataset for any kind of robots and their environment, and 2)
there is a gap between the number of samples obtained from robot action
observations and generated word sequences of captions. We introduced
unsupervised segmentation based on K-means clustering to unify typical robot
observation patterns into a class. This method makes it possible for the
network to learn the relationship from a small amount of data. Moreover, we
utilized a chunking method based on byte-pair encoding (BPE) to fill in the gap
between the number of samples of robot action observations and words in a
caption. We also applied an attention mechanism to the segmentation task.
Experimental results show that the proposed model based on unsupervised
learning can generate better descriptions than other methods. We also show that
the attention mechanism did not work well in our low-resource setting.

Title: E2EET: From Pipeline to End-to-end Entity Typing via Transformer-Based
  Embeddings
Authors: Michael Stewart and Wei Liu
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Entity Typing (ET) is the process of identifying the semantic types of every
entity within a corpus. In contrast to Named Entity Recognition, where each
token in a sentence is labelled with zero or one class label, ET involves
labelling each entity mention with one or more class labels. Existing entity
typing models, which operate at the mention level, are limited by two key
factors: they do not make use of recently-proposed context-dependent
embeddings, and are trained on fixed context windows. They are therefore
sensitive to window size selection and are unable to incorporate the context of
the entire document. In light of these drawbacks we propose to incorporate
context using transformer-based embeddings for a mention-level model, and an
end-to-end model using a Bi-GRU to remove the dependency on window size. An
extensive ablative study demonstrates the effectiveness of contextualised
embeddings for mention-level models and the competitiveness of our end-to-end
model for entity typing.

Title: Unsupervised Word Polysemy Quantification with Multiresolution Grids of
  Contextual Embeddings
Authors: Christos Xypolopoulos, Antoine J.-P. Tixier, Michalis Vazirgiannis
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Equal contribution by Christos Xypolopoulos and Antoine J.-P. Tixier
\\
  The number of senses of a given word, or polysemy, is a very subjective
notion, which varies widely across annotators and resources. We propose a novel
method to estimate polysemy, based on simple geometry in the contextual
embedding space. Our approach is fully unsupervised and purely data-driven. We
show through rigorous experiments that our rankings are well correlated (with
strong statistical significance) with 6 different rankings derived from famous
human-constructed resources such as WordNet, OntoNotes, Oxford, Wikipedia etc.,
for 6 different standard metrics. We also visualize and analyze the correlation
between the human rankings. A valuable by-product of our method is the ability
to sample, at no extra cost, sentences containing different senses of a given
word. Finally, the fully unsupervised nature of our method makes it applicable
to any language. Code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/ksipos/polysemy-assessment.

Title: Fast Cross-domain Data Augmentation through Neural Sentence Editing
Authors: Guillaume Raille, Sandra Djambazovska, Claudiu Musat
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 7 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables
\\
  Data augmentation promises to alleviate data scarcity. This is most important
in cases where the initial data is in short supply. This is, for existing
methods, also where augmenting is the most difficult, as learning the full data
distribution is impossible. For natural language, sentence editing offers a
solution - relying on small but meaningful changes to the original ones.
Learning which changes are meaningful also requires large amounts of training
data. We thus aim to learn this in a source domain where data is abundant and
apply it in a different, target domain, where data is scarce - cross-domain
augmentation.
  We create the Edit-transformer, a Transformer-based sentence editor that is
significantly faster than the state of the art and also works cross-domain. We
argue that, due to its structure, the Edit-transformer is better suited for
cross-domain environments than its edit-based predecessors. We show this
performance gap on the Yelp-Wikipedia domain pairs. Finally, we show that due
to this cross-domain performance advantage, the Edit-transformer leads to
meaningful performance gains in several downstream tasks.

Title: PathVQA: 30000+ Questions for Medical Visual Question Answering
Authors: Xuehai He, Yichen Zhang, Luntian Mou, Eric Xing, Pengtao Xie
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  Is it possible to develop an "AI Pathologist" to pass the board-certified
examination of the American Board of Pathology? To achieve this goal, the first
step is to create a visual question answering (VQA) dataset where the AI agent
is presented with a pathology image together with a question and is asked to
give the correct answer. Our work makes the first attempt to build such a
dataset. Different from creating general-domain VQA datasets where the images
are widely accessible and there are many crowdsourcing workers available and
capable of generating question-answer pairs, developing a medical VQA dataset
is much more challenging. First, due to privacy concerns, pathology images are
usually not publicly available. Second, only well-trained pathologists can
understand pathology images, but they barely have time to help create datasets
for AI research. To address these challenges, we resort to pathology textbooks
and online digital libraries. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to extract
pathology images and captions from textbooks and generate question-answer pairs
from captions using natural language processing. We collect 32,799 open-ended
questions from 4,998 pathology images where each question is manually checked
to ensure correctness. To our best knowledge, this is the first dataset for
pathology VQA. Our dataset will be released publicly to promote research in
medical VQA.

Title: Adaptive Name Entity Recognition under Highly Unbalanced Data
Authors: Thong Nguyen, Duy Nguyen, Pramod Rao
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  For several purposes in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as
Information Extraction, Sentiment Analysis or Chatbot, Named Entity Recognition
(NER) holds an important role as it helps to determine and categorize entities
in text into predefined groups such as the names of persons, locations,
quantities, organizations or percentages, etc. In this report, we present our
experiments on a neural architecture composed of a Conditional Random Field
(CRF) layer stacked on top of a Bi-directional LSTM (BI-LSTM) layer for solving
NER tasks. Besides, we also employ a fusion input of embedding vectors (Glove,
BERT), which are pre-trained on the huge corpus to boost the generalization
capacity of the model. Unfortunately, due to the heavy unbalanced distribution
cross-training data, both approaches just attained a bad performance on less
training samples classes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an add-on
classification model to split sentences into two different sets: Weak and
Strong classes and then designing a couple of Bi-LSTM-CRF models properly to
optimize performance on each set. We evaluated our models on the test set and
discovered that our method can improve performance for Weak classes
significantly by using a very small data set (approximately 0.45\%) compared to
the rest classes.

Title: Generating Natural Language Adversarial Examples on a Large Scale with
  Generative Models
Authors: Yankun Ren and Jianbin Lin and Siliang Tang and Jun Zhou and Shuang
  Yang and Yuan Qi and Xiang Ren
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Today text classification models have been widely used. However, these
classifiers are found to be easily fooled by adversarial examples. Fortunately,
standard attacking methods generate adversarial texts in a pair-wise way, that
is, an adversarial text can only be created from a real-world text by replacing
a few words. In many applications, these texts are limited in numbers,
therefore their corresponding adversarial examples are often not diverse enough
and sometimes hard to read, thus can be easily detected by humans and cannot
create chaos at a large scale. In this paper, we propose an end to end solution
to efficiently generate adversarial texts from scratch using generative models,
which are not restricted to perturbing the given texts. We call it unrestricted
adversarial text generation. Specifically, we train a conditional variational
autoencoder (VAE) with an additional adversarial loss to guide the generation
of adversarial examples. Moreover, to improve the validity of adversarial
texts, we utilize discrimators and the training framework of generative
adversarial networks (GANs) to make adversarial texts consistent with real
data. Experimental results on sentiment analysis demonstrate the scalability
and efficiency of our method. It can attack text classification models with a
higher success rate than existing methods, and provide acceptable quality for
humans in the meantime.

Title: An Empirical Study on Benchmarks of Artificial Software Vulnerabilities
Authors: Sijia Geng, Yuekang Li, Yunlan Du, Jun Xu, Yang Liu, Bing Mao
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Recently, various techniques (e.g., fuzzing) have been developed for
vulnerability detection. To evaluate those techniques, the community has been
developing benchmarks of artificial vulnerabilities because of a shortage of
ground-truth. However, people have concerns that such vulnerabilities cannot
represent reality and may lead to unreliable and misleading results.
Unfortunately, there lacks research on handling such concerns.
  In this work, to understand how close these benchmarks mirror reality, we
perform an empirical study on three artificial vulnerability benchmarks -
LAVA-M, Rode0day and CGC (2669 bugs) and various real-world memory-corruption
vulnerabilities (80 CVEs). Furthermore, we propose a model to depict the
properties of memory-corruption vulnerabilities. Following this model, we
conduct intensive experiments and data analyses. Our analytic results reveal
that while artificial benchmarks attempt to approach the real world, they still
significantly differ from reality. Based on the findings, we propose a set of
strategies to improve the quality of artificial benchmarks.

Title: Dragoon: Private Decentralized HITs Made Practical
Authors: Yuan Lu, Qiang Tang, Guiling Wang
Categories: cs.CR cs.HC
\\
  With the rapid popularity of blockchain, decentralized human intelligence
tasks (HITs) are proposed to crowdsource human knowledge without relying on
vulnerable third-party platforms. However, the inherent limits of blockchain
cause decentralized HITs to face a few "new" challenges. For example, the
confidentiality of solicited data turns out to be the sine qua non, though it
was an arguably dispensable property in the centralized setting. To ensure the
"new" requirement of data privacy, existing decentralized HITs use generic
zero-knowledge proof frameworks (e.g. SNARK), but scarcely perform well in
practice, due to the inherently expensive cost of generality.
  We present a practical decentralized protocol for HITs, which also achieves
the fairness between requesters and workers. At the core of our contributions,
we avoid the powerful yet highly-costly generic zk-proof tools and propose a
special-purpose scheme to prove the quality of encrypted data. By various
non-trivial statement reformations, proving the quality of encrypted data is
reduced to efficient verifiable encryption, thus making decentralized HITs
practical. Along the way, we rigorously define the ideal functionality of
decentralized HITs and then prove the security due to the ideal-real paradigm.
  We further instantiate our protocol to implement a system called Dragoon, an
instance of which is deployed atop Ethereum to facilitate an image annotation
task used by ImageNet. Our evaluations demonstrate its practicality: the
on-chain handling cost of Dragoon is even less than the handling fee of
Amazon's Mechanical Turk for the same ImageNet HIT.

as GDPR and CCPA. Soteria represents user data rights as formal executable
sharing agreements, which can automatically be translated into a human readable
form and enforced as data are queried. To support revocation and to prove
compliance, an indelible, audited trail of the hash of data access and sharing
agreements are stored on a two-layer distributed ledger. The main chain ensures
partition tolerance and availability (PA) properties while side chains ensure
consistency and availability (CA), thus providing the three properties of the
CAP (consistency, availability, and partition tolerance) theorem. Besides

  This study presents early phase detection of Coronavirus (COVID-19), which is
named by World Health Organization (WHO), by machine learning methods. The
detection process was implemented on abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) images.
The expert radiologists detected from CT images that COVID-19 shows different
behaviours from other viral pneumonia. Therefore, the clinical experts specify
that COV\.ID-19 virus needs to be diagnosed in early phase. For detection of
the COVID-19, four different datasets were formed by taking patches sized as
16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 from 150 CT images. The feature extraction process
was applied to patches to increase the classification performance. Grey Level
Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Directional Pattern (LDP), Grey Level Run
Length Matrix (GLRLM), Grey-Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), and Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) algorithms were used as feature extraction methods.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) classified the extracted features. 2-fold, 5-fold
and 10-fold cross-validations were implemented during the classification
process. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F-score metrics
were used to evaluate the classification performance. The best classification
accuracy was obtained as 99.68% with 10-fold cross-validation and GLSZM feature
extraction method.

Title: ROAM: Random Layer Mixup for Semi-Supervised Learning in Medical Imaging
Authors: Tariq Bdair, Nassir Navab, Shadi Albarqouni
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Medical image segmentation is one of the major challenges addressed by
machine learning methods. Yet, deep learning methods profoundly depend on a
huge amount of annotated data which is time-consuming and costly. Though
semi-supervised learning methods approach this problem by leveraging an
abundant amount of unlabeled data along with a small amount of labeled data in
the training process. Recently, MixUp regularizer [32] has been successfully
introduced to semi-supervised learning methods showing superior performance
[3]. MixUp augments the model with new data points through linear interpolation
of the data at the input space. In this paper, we argue that this option is
limited, instead, we propose ROAM, a random layer mixup, which encourages the
network to be less confident for interpolated data points at randomly selected
space. Hence, avoids over-fitting and enhances the generalization ability. We
validate our method on publicly available datasets on whole-brain image
segmentation (MALC) achieving state-of-the-art results in fully supervised
(89.8%) and semi-supervised (87.2%) settings with relative improvement up to
2.75% and 16.73%, respectively.

\\
  With the increasing availability of new image registration approaches, an
unbiased evaluation is becoming more needed so that clinicians can choose the
most suitable approaches for their applications. Current evaluations typically
use landmarks in manually annotated datasets. As a result, the quality of
annotations is crucial for unbiased comparisons. Even though most data
providers claim to have quality control over their datasets, an objective
third-party screening can be reassuring for intended users. In this study, we
use the variogram to screen the manually annotated landmarks in two datasets
used to benchmark registration in image-guided neurosurgeries. The variogram
provides an intuitive 2D representation of the spatial characteristics of
annotated landmarks. Using variograms, we identified potentially problematic
cases and had them examined by experienced radiologists. We found that (1) a
small number of annotations may have fiducial localization errors; (2) the
landmark distribution for some cases is not ideal to offer fair comparisons. If
unresolved, both findings could incur bias in registration evaluation.

MSC-class: 65D19
\\
  Purpose: We describe a 3D multi-view perception system for the da Vinci
surgical system to enable Operating room (OR) scene understanding and context
awareness.
  Methods: Our proposed system is comprised of four Time-of-Flight (ToF)
cameras rigidly attached to strategic locations on the daVinci Xi patient side
cart (PSC). The cameras are registered to the robot's kinematic chain by
performing a one-time calibration routine and therefore, information from all
cameras can be fused and represented in one common coordinate frame. Based on
this architecture, a multi-view 3D scene semantic segmentation algorithm is
created to enable recognition of common and salient objects/equipment and
surgical activities in a da Vinci OR. Our proposed 3D semantic segmentation
method has been trained and validated on a novel densely annotated dataset that
has been captured from clinical scenarios.
  Results: The results show that our proposed architecture has acceptable
registration error ($3.3\%\pm1.4\%$ of object-camera distance) and can robustly
improve scene segmentation performance (mean Intersection Over Union - mIOU)
for less frequently appearing classes ($\ge 0.013$) compared to a single-view
method.
  Conclusion: We present the first dynamic multi-view perception system with a
novel segmentation architecture, which can be used as a building block
technology for applications such as surgical workflow analysis, automation of
surgical sub-tasks and advanced guidance systems.

Title: Fast Symmetric Diffeomorphic Image Registration with Convolutional
  Neural Networks
Authors: Tony C.W. Mok, Albert C.S. Chung
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  Diffeomorphic deformable image registration is crucial in many medical image
studies, as it offers unique, special properties including topology
preservation and invertibility of the transformation. Recent deep
learning-based deformable image registration methods achieve fast image
registration by leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the
spatial transformation from the synthetic ground truth or the similarity
metric. However, these approaches often ignore the topology preservation of the
transformation and the smoothness of the transformation which is enforced by a
global smoothing energy function alone. Moreover, deep learning-based
approaches often estimate the displacement field directly, which cannot
guarantee the existence of the inverse transformation. In this paper, we
present a novel, efficient unsupervised symmetric image registration method
which maximizes the similarity between images within the space of diffeomorphic
maps and estimates both forward and inverse transformations simultaneously. We
evaluate our method on 3D image registration with a large scale brain image
dataset. Our method achieves state-of-the-art registration accuracy and running
time while maintaining desirable diffeomorphic properties.

\\
  Most active depth sensors sample their visual field using a fixed pattern,
decided by accuracy, speed and cost trade-offs, rather than scene content.
However, a number of recent works have demonstrated that adapting measurement
patterns to scene content can offer significantly better trade-offs. We propose
a hardware LIDAR design that allows flexible real-time measurements according
to dynamically specified measurement patterns. Our flexible depth sensor design
consists of a controllable scanning LIDAR that can foveate, or increase
resolution in regions of interest, and that can fully leverage the power of
adaptive depth sensing. We describe our optical setup and calibration, which
enables fast sparse depth measurements using a scanning MEMS (micro-electro
mechanical) mirror. We validate the efficacy of our prototype LIDAR design by
testing on over 75 static and dynamic scenes spanning a range of environments.
We also show CNN-based depth-map completion of sparse measurements obtained by
our sensor. Our experiments show that our sensor can realize adaptive depth
sensing systems.

Title: Appearance Fusion of Multiple Cues for Video Co-localization
Authors: Koteswar Rao Jerripothula
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: 9 Pages and 9 figures. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and
  Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT)
\\
  This work addresses a problem named video co-localization that aims at
localizing the objects in videos jointly. Although there are numerous cues
available for this purpose, for example, saliency, motion, and joint, their
robust fusion can be quite challenging at times due to their spatial
inconsistencies. To overcome this, in this paper, we propose a novel appearance
fusion method where we fuse appearance models derived from these cues rather
than spatially fusing their maps. In this method, we evaluate the cues in terms
of their reliability and consensus to guide the appearance fusion process. We
also develop a novel joint cue relying on topological hierarchy. We utilize the
final fusion results to produce a few candidate bounding boxes and for
subsequent optimal selection among them while considering the spatiotemporal
constraints. The proposed method achieves promising results on the YouTube
Objects dataset.

Title: Monocular Real-time Hand Shape and Motion Capture using Multi-modal Data
Authors: Yuxiao Zhou and Marc Habermann and Weipeng Xu and Ikhsanul Habibie and
  Christian Theobalt and Feng Xu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020
\\
  We present a novel method for monocular hand shape and pose estimation at
unprecedented runtime performance of 100fps and at state-of-the-art accuracy.
This is enabled by a new learning based architecture designed such that it can
make use of all the sources of available hand training data: image data with
either 2D or 3D annotations, as well as stand-alone 3D animations without
corresponding image data. It features a 3D hand joint detection module and an
inverse kinematics module which regresses not only 3D joint positions but also
maps them to joint rotations in a single feed-forward pass. This output makes
the method more directly usable for applications in computer vision and
graphics compared to only regressing 3D joint positions. We demonstrate that
our architectural design leads to a significant quantitative and qualitative
improvement over the state of the art on several challenging benchmarks. Our
model is publicly available for future research.

Title: Who2com: Collaborative Perception via Learnable Handshake Communication
Authors: Yen-Cheng Liu, Junjiao Tian, Chih-Yao Ma, Nathan Glaser, Chia-Wen Kuo

Categories: cs.CV cs.MA cs.RO
Comments: Accepted to ICRA 2020
\\
  In this paper, we propose the problem of collaborative perception, where
robots can combine their local observations with those of neighboring agents in
a learnable way to improve accuracy on a perception task. Unlike existing work
in robotics and multi-agent reinforcement learning, we formulate the problem as
one where learned information must be shared across a set of agents in a
bandwidth-sensitive manner to optimize for scene understanding tasks such as
semantic segmentation. Inspired by networking communication protocols, we
propose a multi-stage handshake communication mechanism where the neural
network can learn to compress relevant information needed for each stage.
Specifically, a target agent with degraded sensor data sends a compressed
request, the other agents respond with matching scores, and the target agent
determines who to connect with (i.e., receive information from). We
additionally develop the AirSim-CP dataset and metrics based on the AirSim
simulator where a group of aerial robots perceive diverse landscapes, such as
roads, grasslands, buildings, etc. We show that for the semantic segmentation
task, our handshake communication method significantly improves accuracy by
approximately 20% over decentralized baselines, and is comparable to
centralized ones using a quarter of the bandwidth.

Title: Topological Sweep for Multi-Target Detection of Geostationary Space
  Objects
Authors: Daqi Liu, Bo Chen, Tat-Jun Chin and Mark Rutten
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: 12 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Conducting surveillance of the Earth's orbit is a key task towards achieving
space situational awareness (SSA). Our work focuses on the optical detection of
man-made objects (e.g., satellites, space debris) in Geostationary orbit (GEO),
which is home to major space assets such as telecommunications and navigational
satellites. GEO object detection is challenging due to the distance of the
targets, which appear as small dim points among a clutter of bright stars. In
this paper, we propose a novel multi-target detection technique based on
topological sweep, to find GEO objects from a short sequence of optical images.
Our topological sweep technique exploits the geometric duality that underpins
the approximately linear trajectory of target objects across the input
sequence, to extract the targets from significant clutter and noise. Unlike
standard multi-target methods, our algorithm deterministically solves a
combinatorial problem to ensure high-recall rates without requiring accurate
initializations. The usage of geometric duality also yields an algorithm that
is computationally efficient and suitable for online processing.

\\
  We demonstrate a deep learning-based offline autofocusing method, termed
Deep-R, that is trained to rapidly and blindly autofocus a single-shot
microscopy image of a specimen that is acquired at an arbitrary out-of-focus
plane. We illustrate the efficacy of Deep-R using various tissue sections that
were imaged using fluorescence and brightfield microscopy modalities and
demonstrate snapshot autofocusing under different scenarios, such as a uniform
axial defocus as well as a sample tilt within the field-of-view. Our results
reveal that Deep-R is significantly faster when compared with standard online
algorithmic autofocusing methods. This deep learning-based blind autofocusing
framework opens up new opportunities for rapid microscopic imaging of large
sample areas, also reducing the photon dose on the sample.

Title: Cooling-Shrinking Attack: Blinding the Tracker with Imperceptible Noises
Authors: Bin Yan and Dong Wang and Huchuan Lu and Xiaoyun Yang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR2020
\\
  Adversarial attack of CNN aims at deceiving models to misbehave by adding
imperceptible perturbations to images. This feature facilitates to understand
neural networks deeply and to improve the robustness of deep learning models.
Although several works have focused on attacking image classifiers and object
detectors, an effective and efficient method for attacking single object
trackers of any target in a model-free way remains lacking. In this paper, a
cooling-shrinking attack method is proposed to deceive state-of-the-art
SiameseRPN-based trackers. An effective and efficient perturbation generator is
trained with a carefully designed adversarial loss, which can simultaneously
cool hot regions where the target exists on the heatmaps and force the
predicted bounding box to shrink, making the tracked target invisible to
trackers. Numerous experiments on OTB100, VOT2018, and LaSOT datasets show that
our method can effectively fool the state-of-the-art SiameseRPN++ tracker by
adding small perturbations to the template or the search regions. Besides, our
method has good transferability and is able to deceive other top-performance
trackers such as DaSiamRPN, DaSiamRPN-UpdateNet, and DiMP. The source codes are

Title: A level set representation method for N-dimensional convex shape and
  applications
Authors: Lingfeng li and Shousheng Luo and Xue-Cheng Tai and Jiang Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this work, we present a new efficient method for convex shape
representation, which is regardless of the dimension of the concerned objects,
using level-set approaches. Convexity prior is very useful for object
completion in computer vision. It is a very challenging task to design an
efficient method for high dimensional convex objects representation. In this
paper, we prove that the convexity of the considered object is equivalent to
the convexity of the associated signed distance function. Then, the second
order condition of convex functions is used to characterize the shape convexity
equivalently. We apply this new method to two applications: object segmentation
with convexity prior and convex hull problem (especially with outliers). For
both applications, the involved problems can be written as a general
optimization problem with three constraints. Efficient algorithm based on
alternating direction method of multipliers is presented for the optimization
problem. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed representation method and algorithm.

Title: BiCANet: Bi-directional Contextual Aggregating Network for Image
  Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Quan Zhou, Dechun Cong, Bin Kang, Xiaofu Wu, Baoyu Zheng, Huimin Lu
  and Longin Jan Latecki
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Exploring contextual information in convolution neural networks (CNNs) has
gained substantial attention in recent years for semantic segmentation. This
paper introduces a Bi-directional Contextual Aggregating Network, called
BiCANet, for semantic segmentation. Unlike previous approaches that encode
context in feature space, BiCANet aggregates contextual cues from a categorical
perspective, which is mainly consist of three parts: contextual condensed
projection block (CCPB), bi-directional context interaction block (BCIB), and
muti-scale contextual fusion block (MCFB). More specifically, CCPB learns a
category-based mapping through a split-transform-merge architecture, which
condenses contextual cues with different receptive fields from intermediate
layer. BCIB, on the other hand, employs dense skipped-connections to enhance
the class-level context exchanging. Finally, MCFB integrates multi-scale
contextual cues by investigating short- and long-ranged spatial dependencies.
To evaluate BiCANet, we have conducted extensive experiments on three semantic
segmentation datasets: PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and ADE20K. The
experimental results demonstrate that BiCANet outperforms recent
state-of-the-art networks without any postprocess techniques. Particularly,
BiCANet achieves the mIoU score of 86.7%, 82.4% and 38.66% on PASCAL VOC 2012,
Cityscapes and ADE20K testset, respectively.

\\
  Vision-based localization of an agent in a map is an important problem in
robotics and computer vision. In that context, localization by learning
matchable image features is gaining popularity due to recent advances in
machine learning. Features that uniquely describe the visual contents of images
have a wide range of applications, including image retrieval and understanding.
In this work, we propose a method that learns image features targeted for
image-retrieval-based localization. Retrieval-based localization has several
benefits, such as easy maintenance and quick computation. However, the
state-of-the-art features only provide visual similarity scores which do not
explicitly reveal the geometric distance between query and retrieved images.
Knowing this distance is highly desirable for accurate localization, especially
when the reference images are sparsely distributed in the scene. Therefore, we
propose a novel loss function for learning image features which are both
visually representative and geometrically relatable. This is achieved by
guiding the learning process such that the feature and geometric distances
between images are directly proportional. In our experiments we show that our
features not only offer significantly better localization accuracy, but also
allow to estimate the trajectory of a query sequence in absence of the
reference images.

\\
  Rain removal in images is an important task in computer vision filed and
attracting attentions of more and more people. In this paper, we address a
non-trivial issue of removing visual effect of rain streak from a single image.
Differing from existing work, our method combines various semantic constraint
task in a proposed multi-task regression model for rain removal. These tasks
reinforce the model's capabilities from the content, edge-aware, and local
texture similarity respectively. To further improve the performance of
multi-task learning, we also present two simple but powerful dynamic weighting
algorithms. The proposed multi-task enhanced network (MENET) is a powerful
convolutional neural network based on U-Net for rain removal research, with a
specific focus on utilize multiple tasks constraints and exploit the synergy
among them to facilitate the model's rain removal capacity. It is noteworthy
that the adaptive weighting scheme has further resulted in improved network
capability. We conduct several experiments on synthetic and real rain images,
and achieve superior rain removal performance over several selected
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The overall effect of our method is
impressive, even in the decomposition of heavy rain and rain streak
accumulation.The source code and some results can be found

Comments: CVPR 2020
\\
  We present an approach for estimating surface normals from in-the-wild color
images of faces. While data-driven strategies have been proposed for single
face images, limited available ground truth data makes this problem difficult.
To alleviate this issue, we propose a method that can leverage all available
image and normal data, whether paired or not, thanks to a novel cross-modal
learning architecture. In particular, we enable additional training with single
modality data, either color or normal, by using two encoder-decoder networks
with a shared latent space. The proposed architecture also enables face details
to be transferred between the image and normal domains, given paired data,
through skip connections between the image encoder and normal decoder. Core to
our approach is a novel module that we call deactivable skip connections, which
allows integrating both the auto-encoded and image-to-normal branches within
the same architecture that can be trained end-to-end. This allows learning of a
rich latent space that can accurately capture the normal information. We
compare against state-of-the-art methods and show that our approach can achieve
significant improvements, both quantitative and qualitative, with natural face
images.

Title: Video-based Person Re-Identification using Gated Convolutional Recurrent
  Neural Networks
Authors: Yang Feng, Yu Wang, Jiebo Luo
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: This work was done in 2017
\\
  Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to solving the
video-based person re-identification problem with impressive results reported.
The existing networks for person re-id are designed to extract discriminative
features that preserve the identity information. Usually, whole video frames
are fed into the neural networks and all the regions in a frame are equally
treated. This may be a suboptimal choice because many regions, e.g., background
regions in the video, are not related to the person. Furthermore, the person of
interest may be occluded by another person or something else. These unrelated
regions may hinder person re-identification. In this paper, we introduce a
novel gating mechanism to deep neural networks. Our gating mechanism will learn
which regions are helpful for person re-identification and let these regions
pass the gate. The unrelated background regions or occluding regions are
filtered out by the gate. In each frame, the color channels and optical flow
channels provide quite different information. To better leverage such
information, we generate one gate using the color channels and another gate
using the optical flow channels. These two gates are combined to provide a more
reliable gate with a novel fusion method. Experimental results on two major
datasets demonstrate the performance improvements due to the proposed gating
mechanism.

Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  Autonomous assembly is a crucial capability for robots in many applications.
For this task, several problems such as obstacle avoidance, motion planning,
and actuator control have been extensively studied in robotics. However, when
it comes to task specification, the space of possibilities remains
underexplored. Towards this end, we introduce a novel problem,
single-image-guided 3D part assembly, along with a learningbased solution. We
study this problem in the setting of furniture assembly from a given complete
set of parts and a single image depicting the entire assembled object. Multiple
challenges exist in this setting, including handling ambiguity among parts
(e.g., slats in a chair back and leg stretchers) and 3D pose prediction for
parts and part subassemblies, whether visible or occluded. We address these
issues by proposing a two-module pipeline that leverages strong 2D-3D
correspondences and assembly-oriented graph message-passing to infer part
relationships. In experiments with a PartNet-based synthetic benchmark, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as compared with three baseline
approaches.

\\
  This paper reports a new continuous 3D loss function for learning depth from
monocular images. The dense depth prediction from a monocular image is
supervised using sparse LIDAR points, exploiting available data from
camera-LIDAR sensor suites during training. Currently, accurate and affordable
range sensor is not available. Stereo cameras and LIDARs measure depth either
inaccurately or sparsely/costly. In contrast to the current point-to-point loss
evaluation approach, the proposed 3D loss treats point clouds as continuous
objects; and therefore, it overcomes the lack of dense ground truth depth due
to the sparsity of LIDAR measurements. Experimental evaluations show that the
proposed method achieves accurate depth measurement with consistent 3D
geometric structures through a monocular camera.

\\
  We address the problem of single photo age progression and regression-the
prediction of how a person might look in the future, or how they looked in the
past. Most existing aging methods are limited to changing the texture,
overlooking transformations in head shape that occur during the human aging and
growth process. This limits the applicability of previous methods to aging of
adults to slightly older adults, and application of those methods to photos of
children does not produce quality results. We propose a novel multi-domain
image-to-image generative adversarial network architecture, whose learned
latent space models a continuous bi-directional aging process. The network is
trained on the FFHQ dataset, which we labeled for ages, gender, and semantic
segmentation. Fixed age classes are used as anchors to approximate continuous
age transformation. Our framework can predict a full head portrait for ages
0-70 from a single photo, modifying both texture and shape of the head. We
demonstrate results on a wide variety of photos and datasets, and show
significant improvement over the state of the art.

\\
  Nowadays it is prevalent to take features extracted from pre-trained deep
learning models as image representations which have achieved promising
classification performance. Existing methods usually consider either
object-based features or scene-based features only. However, both types of
features are important for complex images like scene images, as they can
complement each other. In this paper, we propose a novel type of features --
hybrid deep features, for scene images. Specifically, we exploit both
object-based and scene-based features at two levels: part image level (i.e.,
parts of an image) and whole image level (i.e., a whole image), which produces
a total number of four types of deep features. Regarding the part image level,
we also propose two new slicing techniques to extract part based features.
Finally, we aggregate these four types of deep features via the concatenation
operator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid deep features on three
commonly used scene datasets (MIT-67, Scene-15, and Event-8), in terms of the
scene image classification task. Extensive comparisons show that our introduced
features can produce state-of-the-art classification accuracies which are more
consistent and stable than the results of existing features across all
datasets.

The model takes two types of data as input: 1) the historical density generated
from the historical data, and 2) the future sUAS mission information. The
architecture of our model contains four components: Historical Density
Formulation module, UAS Mission Translation module, Mission Feature Extraction
module, and Density Map Projection module. The training and testing data are
generated by a python based simulator which is inspired by the multi-agent air
traffic resource usage simulator (MATRUS) framework. The quality of prediction
is measured by the correlation score and the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristics (AUROC) between the predicted value and simulated value. The
experimental results demonstrate outstanding performance of the deep
learning-based UAS density predictor. Compared to the baseline models, for
simplified traffic scenario where no-fly zones and safe distance among sUASs
are not considered, our model improves the prediction accuracy by more than
15.2% and its correlation score reaches 0.947. In a more realistic scenario,
where the no-fly zone avoidance and the safe distance among sUASs are
maintained using A* routing algorithm, our model can still achieve 0.823
correlation score. Meanwhile, the AUROC can reach 0.951 for the hot spot
prediction.

Title: Exploring Bottom-up and Top-down Cues with Attentive Learning for Webly
  Supervised Object Detection
Authors: Zhonghua Wu and Qingyi Tao and Guosheng Lin and Jianfei Cai
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Fully supervised object detection has achieved great success in recent years.
However, abundant bounding boxes annotations are needed for training a detector
for novel classes. To reduce the human labeling effort, we propose a novel
webly supervised object detection (WebSOD) method for novel classes which only
requires the web images without further annotations. Our proposed method
combines bottom-up and top-down cues for novel class detection. Within our
approach, we introduce a bottom-up mechanism based on the well-trained fully
supervised object detector (i.e. Faster RCNN) as an object region estimator for
web images by recognizing the common objectiveness shared by base and novel
classes. With the estimated regions on the web images, we then utilize the
top-down attention cues as the guidance for region classification. Furthermore,
we propose a residual feature refinement (RFR) block to tackle the domain
mismatch between web domain and the target domain. We demonstrate our proposed
method on PASCAL VOC dataset with three different novel/base splits. Without
any target-domain novel-class images and annotations, our proposed webly
supervised object detection model is able to achieve promising performance for
novel classes. Moreover, we also conduct transfer learning experiments on large
scale ILSVRC 2013 detection dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Modal Regression based Structured Low-rank Matrix Recovery for

\\
  Low-rank Multi-view Subspace Learning (LMvSL) has shown great potential in
cross-view classification in recent years. Despite their empirical success,
existing LMvSL based methods are incapable of well handling view discrepancy
and discriminancy simultaneously, which thus leads to the performance
degradation when there is a large discrepancy among multi-view data. To
circumvent this drawback, motivated by the block-diagonal representation
learning, we propose Structured Low-rank Matrix Recovery (SLMR), a unique
method of effectively removing view discrepancy and improving discriminancy
through the recovery of structured low-rank matrix. Furthermore, recent
low-rank modeling provides a satisfactory solution to address data contaminated
by predefined assumptions of noise distribution, such as Gaussian or Laplacian
distribution. However, these models are not practical since complicated noise
in practice may violate those assumptions and the distribution is generally
unknown in advance. To alleviate such limitation, modal regression is elegantly
incorporated into the framework of SLMR (term it MR-SLMR). Different from
previous LMvSL based methods, our MR-SLMR can handle any zero-mode noise
variable that contains a wide range of noise, such as Gaussian noise, random
noise and outliers. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
framework and half-quadratic theory are used to efficiently optimize MR-SLMR.
Experimental results on four public databases demonstrate the superiority of
MR-SLMR and its robustness to complicated noise.

Title: Review of data analysis in vision inspection of power lines with an
  in-depth discussion of deep learning technology
Authors: Xinyu Liu, Xiren Miao, Hao Jiang, Jing Chen
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  The widespread popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles enables an immense
amount of power lines inspection data to be collected. How to employ massive
inspection data especially the visible images to maintain the reliability,
safety, and sustainability of power transmission is a pressing issue. To date,
substantial works have been conducted on the analysis of power lines inspection
data. With the aim of providing a comprehensive overview for researchers who
are interested in developing a deep-learning-based analysis system for power
lines inspection data, this paper conducts a thorough review of the current
literature and identifies the challenges for future research. Following the
typical procedure of inspection data analysis, we categorize current works in
this area into component detection and fault diagnosis. For each aspect, the
techniques and methodologies adopted in the literature are summarized. Some
valuable information is also included such as data description and method
performance. Further, an in-depth discussion of existing deep-learning-related
analysis methods in power lines inspection is proposed. Finally, we conclude
the paper with several research trends for the future of this area, such as
data quality problems, small object detection, embedded application, and
evaluation baseline.

Title: Visual Question Answering for Cultural Heritage

Comments: accepted at FlorenceHeritech 2020
\\
  Technology and the fruition of cultural heritage are becoming increasingly
more entwined, especially with the advent of smart audio guides, virtual and
augmented reality, and interactive installations. Machine learning and computer
vision are important components of this ongoing integration, enabling new
interaction modalities between user and museum. Nonetheless, the most frequent
way of interacting with paintings and statues still remains taking pictures.
Yet images alone can only convey the aesthetics of the artwork, lacking is
information which is often required to fully understand and appreciate it.
Usually this additional knowledge comes both from the artwork itself (and
therefore the image depicting it) and from an external source of knowledge,
such as an information sheet. While the former can be inferred by computer
vision algorithms, the latter needs more structured data to pair visual content
with relevant information. Regardless of its source, this information still
must be be effectively transmitted to the user. A popular emerging trend in
computer vision is Visual Question Answering (VQA), in which users can interact
with a neural network by posing questions in natural language and receiving
answers about the visual content. We believe that this will be the evolution of
smart audio guides for museum visits and simple image browsing on personal
smartphones. This will turn the classic audio guide into a smart personal
instructor with which the visitor can interact by asking for explanations
focused on specific interests. The advantages are twofold: on the one hand the
cognitive burden of the visitor will decrease, limiting the flow of information
to what the user actually wants to hear; and on the other hand it proposes the
most natural way of interacting with a guide, favoring engagement.

Authors: Feng Shi, Liming Xia, Fei Shan, Dijia Wu, Ying Wei, Huan Yuan, Huiting

\\
  The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a
threatening risk for global public health. It is of great importance to rapidly
and accurately screen patients with COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia
(CAP). In this study, a total of 1658 patients with COVID-19 and 1027 patients
of CAP underwent thin-section CT. All images were preprocessed to obtain the
segmentations of both infections and lung fields, which were used to extract
location-specific features. An infection Size Aware Random Forest method
(iSARF) was proposed, in which subjects were automated categorized into groups
with different ranges of infected lesion sizes, followed by random forests in
each group for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed
method yielded sensitivity of 0.907, specificity of 0.833, and accuracy of
0.879 under five-fold cross-validation. Large performance margins against
comparison methods were achieved especially for the cases with infection size
in the medium range, from 0.01% to 10%. The further inclusion of Radiomics
features show slightly improvement. It is anticipated that our proposed
framework could assist clinical decision making.

Title: Progressive Domain-Independent Feature Decomposition Network for
  Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval
Authors: Xinxun Xu, Cheng Deng, Muli Yang and Hao Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a specific cross-modal
retrieval task for searching natural images given free-hand sketches under the
zero-shot scenario. Most existing methods solve this problem by simultaneously
projecting visual features and semantic supervision into a low-dimensional
common space for efficient retrieval. However, such low-dimensional projection
destroys the completeness of semantic knowledge in original semantic space, so
that it is unable to transfer useful knowledge well when learning semantic from
different modalities. Moreover, the domain information and semantic information
are entangled in visual features, which is not conducive for cross-modal
matching since it will hinder the reduction of domain gap between sketch and
image. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Domain-independent Feature
Decomposition (PDFD) network for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, with the supervision of
original semantic knowledge, PDFD decomposes visual features into domain
features and semantic ones, and then the semantic features are projected into
common space as retrieval features for ZS-SBIR. The progressive projection
strategy maintains strong semantic supervision. Besides, to guarantee the
retrieval features to capture clean and complete semantic information, the
cross-reconstruction loss is introduced to encourage that any combinations of
retrieval features and domain features can reconstruct the visual features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our PDFD over
state-of-the-art competitors.

Title: COVID-Net: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for
  Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest Radiography Images
Authors: Linda Wang and Alexander Wong
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 6 pages
\\
  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health
and well-being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against
COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key
screening approaches being radiological imaging using chest radiography.
Motivated by this, a number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on
deep learning have been proposed and results have been shown to be quite
promising in terms of accuracy in detecting patients infected with COVID-19
using chest radiography images. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge,
these developed AI systems have been closed source and unavailable to the
research community for deeper understanding and extension, and unavailable for
public access and use. Therefore, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep
convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19
cases from chest radiography images that is open source and available to the
general public. We also describe the chest radiography dataset leveraged to
train COVID-Net, which we will refer to as COVIDx and is comprised of 5941
posteroanterior chest radiography images across 2839 patient cases from two
open access data repositories. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes
predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to gain deeper
insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid
clinicians in improved screening. By no means a production-ready solution, the
hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on
constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon
by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the
development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for
detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the
most.

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  User studies have shown that reducing the latency of our simultaneous lecture
translation system should be the most important goal. We therefore have worked
on several techniques for reducing the latency for both components, the
automatic speech recognition and the speech translation module. Since the
commonly used commitment latency is not appropriate in our case of continuous
stream decoding, we focused on word latency. We used it to analyze the
performance of our current system and to identify opportunities for
improvements. In order to minimize the latency we combined run-on decoding with
a technique for identifying stable partial hypotheses when stream decoding and
a protocol for dynamic output update that allows to revise the most recent
parts of the transcription. This combination reduces the latency at word level,
where the words are final and will never be updated again in the future, from
18.1s to 1.1s without sacrificing performance in terms of word error rate.

  Despite the fact that notable improvements have been made recently in the
field of feature extraction and classification, human action recognition is
still challenging, especially in images, in which, unlike videos, there is no
motion. Thus, the methods proposed for recognizing human actions in videos
cannot be applied to still images. A big challenge in action recognition in
still images is the lack of large enough datasets, which is problematic for
training deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to the overfitting
issue. In this paper, by taking advantage of pre-trained CNNs, we employ the
transfer learning technique to tackle the lack of massive labeled action
recognition datasets. Furthermore, since the last layer of the CNN has
class-specific information, we apply an attention mechanism on the output
feature maps of the CNN to extract more discriminative and powerful features
for classification of human actions. Moreover, we use eight different
pre-trained CNNs in our framework and investigate their performance on Stanford
40 dataset. Finally, we propose using the Ensemble Learning technique to
enhance the overall accuracy of action classification by combining the
predictions of multiple models. The best setting of our method is able to
achieve 93.17$\%$ accuracy on the Stanford 40 dataset.

Title: Curved Buildings Reconstruction from Airborne LiDAR Data by Matching and
  Deforming Geometric Primitives
Authors: Jingwei Song, Shaobo Xia, Jun Wang, Dong Chen
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages. 14 figures
\\
  Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data is widely applied in
building reconstruction, with studies reporting success in typical buildings.
However, the reconstruction of curved buildings remains an open research
problem. To this end, we propose a new framework for curved building
reconstruction via assembling and deforming geometric primitives. The input
LiDAR point cloud are first converted into contours where individual buildings
are identified. After recognizing geometric units (primitives) from building
contours, we get initial models by matching basic geometric primitives to these
primitives. To polish assembly models, we employ a warping field for model
refinements. Specifically, an embedded deformation (ED) graph is constructed
via downsampling the initial model. Then, the point-to-model displacements are
minimized by adjusting node parameters in the ED graph based on our objective
function. The presented framework is validated on several highly curved
buildings collected by various LiDAR in different cities. The experimental
results, as well as accuracy comparison, demonstrate the advantage and
effectiveness of our method. {The new insight attributes to an efficient
reconstruction manner.} Moreover, we prove that the primitive-based framework
significantly reduces the data storage to 10-20 percent of classical mesh
models.

Comments: Published at ICCV workshop 2019: Human Behaviour Understanding
\\
  The problem of Online Human Behaviour Recognition in untrimmed videos, aka
Online Action Detection (OAD), needs to be revisited. Unlike traditional
offline action detection approaches, where the evaluation metrics are clear and
well established, in the OAD setting we find few works and no consensus on the
evaluation protocols to be used. In this paper we introduce a novel online
metric, the Instantaneous Accuracy ($IA$), that exhibits an \emph{online}
nature, solving most of the limitations of the previous (offline) metrics. We
conduct a thorough experimental evaluation on TVSeries dataset, comparing the
performance of various baseline methods to the state of the art. Our results
confirm the problems of previous evaluation protocols, and suggest that an
IA-based protocol is more adequate to the online scenario for human behaviour
understanding. Code of the metric available

Title: Self-Supervised 2D Image to 3D Shape Translation with Disentangled
  Representations
Authors: Berk Kaya, Radu Timofte
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present a framework to translate between 2D image views and 3D object
shapes. Recent progress in deep learning enabled us to learn structure-aware
representations from a scene. However, the existing literature assumes that
pairs of images and 3D shapes are available for training in full supervision.
In this paper, we propose SIST, a Self-supervised Image to Shape Translation
framework that fulfills three tasks: (i) reconstructing the 3D shape from a
single image; (ii) learning disentangled representations for shape, appearance
and viewpoint; and (iii) generating a realistic RGB image from these
independent factors. In contrast to the existing approaches, our method does
not require image-shape pairs for training. Instead, it uses unpaired image and
shape datasets from the same object class and jointly trains image generator
and shape reconstruction networks. Our translation method achieves promising
results, comparable in quantitative and qualitative terms to the
state-of-the-art achieved by fully-supervised methods.

Title: High Performance Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Streaming Speech
  Recognition
Authors: Thai-Son Nguyen, Ngoc-Quan Pham, Sebastian Stueker, Alex Waibel
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recently sequence-to-sequence models have started to achieve state-of-the art
performance on standard speech recognition tasks when processing audio data in
batch mode, i.e., the complete audio data is available when starting
processing. However, when it comes to perform run-on recognition on an input
stream of audio data while producing recognition results in real-time and with
a low word-based latency, these models face several challenges. For many
techniques, the whole audio sequence to be decoded needs to be available at the
start of the processing, e.g., for the attention mechanism or for the
bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM). In this paper we propose several techniques to
mitigate these problems. We introduce an additional loss function controlling
the uncertainty of the attention mechanism, a modified beam search identifying
partial, stable hypotheses, ways of working with BLSTM in the encoder, and the
use of chunked BLSTM. Our experiments show that with the right combination of
these techniques it is possible to perform run-on speech recognition with a low
word-based latency without sacrificing performance in terms of word error rate.

Comments: Technical report
\\
  Rectified linear units (ReLU) are commonly used in deep neural networks. So
far ReLU and its generalizations (either non-parametric or parametric) are
static, performing identically for all input samples. In this paper, we propose
Dynamic ReLU (DY-ReLU), a dynamic rectifier whose parameters are
input-dependent as a hyper function over all input elements. The key insight is
that DY-ReLU encodes the global context into the hyper function and adapts the
piecewise linear activation function accordingly. Compared to its static
counterpart, DY-ReLU has negligible extra computational cost, but significantly
more representation capability, especially for light-weight neural networks. By
simply using DY-ReLU for MobileNetV2, the top-1 accuracy on ImageNet
classification is boosted from 72.0% to 76.2% with only 5% additional FLOPs.

  Endoscopy Images

Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Endoscopy is a widely used imaging modality to diagnose and treat diseases in
hollow organs as for example the gastrointestinal tract, the kidney and the
liver. However, due to varied modalities and use of different imaging protocols
at various clinical centers impose significant challenges when generalising
deep learning models. Moreover, the assembly of large datasets from different
clinical centers can introduce a huge label bias that renders any learnt model
unusable. Also, when using new modality or presence of images with rare
patterns, a bulk amount of similar image data and their corresponding labels
are required for training these models. In this work, we propose to use a
few-shot learning approach that requires less training data and can be used to
predict label classes of test samples from an unseen dataset. We propose a
novel additive angular margin metric in the framework of prototypical network
in few-shot learning setting. We compare our approach to the several
established methods on a large cohort of multi-center, multi-organ, and
multi-modal endoscopy data. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Architectural Resilience to Foreground-and-Background Adversarial Noise
Authors: Carl Cheng, Evan Hu
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Adversarial attacks in the form of imperceptible perturbations of normal
images have been extensively studied, and for every new defense methodology
created, multiple adversarial attacks are found to counteract it. In
particular, a popular style of attack, exemplified in recent years by DeepFool
and Carlini-Wagner, relies solely on white-box scenarios in which full access
to the predictive model and its weights are required. In this work, we instead
propose distinct model-agnostic benchmark perturbations of images in order to
investigate the resilience and robustness of different network architectures.
Results empirically determine that increasing depth within most types of
Convolutional Neural Networks typically improves model resilience towards
general attacks, with improvement steadily decreasing as the model becomes
deeper. Additionally, we find that a notable difference in adversarial
robustness exists between residual architectures with skip connections and
non-residual architectures of similar complexity. Our findings provide
direction for future understanding of residual connections and depth on network
robustness.

Title: Fast(er) Reconstruction of Shredded Text Documents via Self-Supervised
  Deep Asymmetric Metric Learning

\\
  The reconstruction of shredded documents consists in arranging the pieces of
paper (shreds) in order to reassemble the original aspect of such documents.
This task is particularly relevant for supporting forensic investigation as
documents may contain criminal evidence. As an alternative to the laborious and
time-consuming manual process, several researchers have been investigating ways
to perform automatic digital reconstruction. A central problem in automatic
reconstruction of shredded documents is the pairwise compatibility evaluation
of the shreds, notably for binary text documents. In this context, deep
learning has enabled great progress for accurate reconstructions in the domain
of mechanically-shredded documents. A sensitive issue, however, is that current
deep model solutions require an inference whenever a pair of shreds has to be
evaluated. This work proposes a scalable deep learning approach for measuring
pairwise compatibility in which the number of inferences scales linearly
(rather than quadratically) with the number of shreds. Instead of predicting
compatibility directly, deep models are leveraged to asymmetrically project the
raw shred content onto a common metric space in which distance is proportional
to the compatibility. Experimental results show that our method has accuracy
comparable to the state-of-the-art with a speed-up of about 22 times for a test
instance with 505 shreds (20 mixed shredded-pages from different documents).

Title: Linguistically Driven Graph Capsule Network for Visual Question
  Reasoning
Authors: Qingxing Cao and Xiaodan Liang and Keze Wang and Liang Lin
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Submitted to TPAMI 2020. We have achieved an end-to-end interpretable
  structural reasoning for general images without the requirement of layout
  annotations
\\
  Recently, studies of visual question answering have explored various
architectures of end-to-end networks and achieved promising results on both
natural and synthetic datasets, which require explicitly compositional
reasoning. However, it has been argued that these black-box approaches lack
interpretability of results, and thus cannot perform well on generalization
tasks due to overfitting the dataset bias. In this work, we aim to combine the
benefits of both sides and overcome their limitations to achieve an end-to-end
interpretable structural reasoning for general images without the requirement
of layout annotations. Inspired by the property of a capsule network that can
carve a tree structure inside a regular convolutional neural network (CNN), we
propose a hierarchical compositional reasoning model called the "Linguistically
driven Graph Capsule Network", where the compositional process is guided by the
linguistic parse tree. Specifically, we bind each capsule in the lowest layer
to bridge the linguistic embedding of a single word in the original question
with visual evidence and then route them to the same capsule if they are
siblings in the parse tree. This compositional process is achieved by
performing inference on a linguistically driven conditional random field (CRF)
and is performed across multiple graph capsule layers, which results in a
compositional reasoning process inside a CNN. Experiments on the CLEVR dataset,
CLEVR compositional generation test, and FigureQA dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness and composition generalization ability of our end-to-end model.

Title: ASLFeat: Learning Local Features of Accurate Shape and Localization
Authors: Zixin Luo, Lei Zhou, Xuyang Bai, Hongkai Chen, Jiahui Zhang, Yao Yao,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020, supplementary materials included, code
  available
\\
  This work focuses on mitigating two limitations in the joint learning of
local feature detectors and descriptors. First, the ability to estimate the
local shape (scale, orientation, etc.) of feature points is often neglected
during dense feature extraction, while the shape-awareness is crucial to
acquire stronger geometric invariance. Second, the localization accuracy of
detected keypoints is not sufficient to reliably recover camera geometry, which
has become the bottleneck in tasks such as 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we
present ASLFeat, with three light-weight yet effective modifications to
mitigate above issues. First, we resort to deformable convolutional networks to
densely estimate and apply local transformation. Second, we take advantage of
the inherent feature hierarchy to restore spatial resolution and low-level
details for accurate keypoint localization. Finally, we use a peakiness
measurement to relate feature responses and derive more indicative detection
scores. The effect of each modification is thoroughly studied, and the
evaluation is extensively conducted across a variety of practical scenarios.
State-of-the-art results are reported that demonstrate the superiority of our
methods.

Title: Illumination-based Transformations Improve Skin Lesion Segmentation in
  Dermoscopic Images
Authors: Kumar Abhishek, Ghassan Hamarneh, and Mark S. Drew
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures
\\
  The semantic segmentation of skin lesions is an important and common initial
task in the computer aided diagnosis of dermoscopic images. Although deep
learning-based approaches have considerably improved the segmentation accuracy,
there is still room for improvement by addressing the major challenges, such as
variations in lesion shape, size, color and varying levels of contrast. In this
work, we propose the first deep semantic segmentation framework for dermoscopic
images which incorporates, along with the original RGB images, information
extracted using the physics of skin illumination and imaging. In particular, we
incorporate information from specific color bands, illumination invariant
grayscale images, and shading-attenuated images. We evaluate our method on
three datasets: the ISBI ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Segmentation Challenge dataset,
the DermoFit Image Library, and the PH2 dataset and observe improvements of
12.02%, 4.30%, and 8.86% respectively in the mean Jaccard index over a baseline
model trained only with RGB images.

Title: Efficient Crowd Counting via Structured Knowledge Transfer
Authors: Lingbo Liu, Jiaqi Chen, Hefeng Wu, Tianshui Chen, Guanbin Li, Liang
  Lin
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Crowd counting is an application-oriented task and its inference efficiency
is crucial for real-world applications. However, most previous works relied on
heavy backbone networks and required prohibitive runtimes, which would
seriously restrict their deployment scopes and cause poor scalability. To
liberate these crowd counting models, we propose a novel Structured Knowledge
Transfer (SKT) framework integrating two complementary transfer modules, which
can generate a lightweight but still highly effective student network by fully
exploiting the structured knowledge of a well-trained teacher network.
Specifically, an Intra-Layer Pattern Transfer sequentially distills the
knowledge embedded in single-layer features of the teacher network to guide
feature learning of the student network. Simultaneously, an Inter-Layer
Relation Transfer densely distills the cross-layer correlation knowledge of the
teacher to regularize the student's feature evolution. In this way, our student
network can learn compact and knowledgeable features, yielding high efficiency
and competitive performance. Extensive evaluations on three benchmarks well
demonstrate the knowledge transfer effectiveness of our SKT for extensive crowd
counting models. In particular, only having one-sixteenth of the parameters and
computation cost of original models, our distilled VGG-based models obtain at
least 6.5$\times$ speed-up on an Nvidia 1080 GPU and even achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Depth Edge Guided CNNs for Sparse Depth Upsampling
Authors: Yi Guo, Ji Liu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Guided sparse depth upsampling aims to upsample an irregularly sampled sparse
depth map when an aligned high-resolution color image is given as guidance.
Many neural networks have been designed for this task. However, they often
ignore the structural difference between the depth and the color image,
resulting in obvious artifacts such as texture copy and depth blur at the
upsampling depth. Inspired by the normalized convolution operation, we propose
a guided convolutional layer to recover dense depth from sparse and irregular
depth image with an depth edge image as guidance. Our novel guided network can
prevent the depth value from crossing the depth edge to facilitate upsampling.
We further design a convolution network based on proposed convolutional layer
to combine the advantages of different algorithms and achieve better
performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify our method on
real-world indoor and synthetic outdoor datasets. Our method produces strong
results. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the Virtual KITTI dataset
and the Middlebury dataset. It also presents strong generalization capability
under different 3D point densities, various lighting and weather conditions.

Title: EPSNet: Efficient Panoptic Segmentation Network with Cross-layer
  Attention Fusion
Authors: Chia-Yuan Chang, Shuo-En Chang, Pei-Yung Hsiao, and Li-Chen Fu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Technical report
\\
  Panoptic segmentation is a scene parsing task which unifies semantic
segmentation and instance segmentation into one single task. However, the
current state-of-the-art studies did not take too much concern on inference
time. In this work, we propose an Efficient Panoptic Segmentation Network
(EPSNet) to tackle the panoptic segmentation tasks with fast inference speed.
Basically, EPSNet generates masks based on simple linear combination of
prototype masks and mask coefficients. The light-weight network branches for
instance segmentation and semantic segmentation only need to predict mask
coefficients and produce masks with the shared prototypes predicted by
prototype network branch. Furthermore, to enhance the quality of shared
prototypes, we adopt a module called "cross-layer attention fusion module",
which aggregates the multi-scale features with attention mechanism helping them
capture the long-range dependencies between each other. To validate the
proposed work, we have conducted various experiments on the challenging COCO
panoptic dataset, which achieve highly promising performance with significantly
faster inference speed (53ms on GPU).

Title: GeoGraph: Learning graph-based multi-view object detection with
  geometric cues end-to-end
Authors: Ahmed Samy Nassar, S\'ebastien Lef\`evre, and Jan D. Wegner
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper we propose an end-to-end learnable approach that detects static
urban objects from multiple views, re-identifies instances, and finally assigns
a geographic position per object. Our method relies on a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) to, detect all objects and output their geographic positions given images
and approximate camera poses as input. Our GNN simultaneously models relative
pose and image evidence, and is further able to deal with an arbitrary number
of input views. Our method is robust to occlusion, with similar appearance of
neighboring objects, and severe changes in viewpoints by jointly reasoning
about visual image appearance and relative pose. Experimental evaluation on two
challenging, large-scale datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art methods
show significant and systematic improvements both in accuracy and efficiency,
with 2-6% gain in detection and re-ID average precision as well as 8x reduction
of training time.

Title: SOLOv2: Dynamic, Faster and Stronger
Authors: Xinlong Wang, Rufeng Zhang, Tao Kong, Lei Li, Chunhua Shen
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 12 pages
\\
  In this work, we aim at building a simple, direct, and fast instance
segmentation framework with strong performance. We follow the principle of the
SOLO method of Wang et al. "SOLO: segmenting objects by locations".
Importantly, we take one step further by dynamically learning the mask head of
the object segmenter such that the mask head is conditioned on the location.
Specifically, the mask branch is decoupled into a mask kernel branch and mask
feature branch, which are responsible for learning the convolution kernel and
the convolved features respectively. Moreover, we propose Matrix NMS (non
maximum suppression) to significantly reduce the inference time overhead due to
NMS of masks. Our Matrix NMS performs NMS with parallel matrix operations in
one shot, and yields better results. We demonstrate a simple direct instance
segmentation system, outperforming a few state-of-the-art methods in both speed
and accuracy. A light-weight version of SOLOv2 executes at 31.3 FPS and yields
37.1% AP. Moreover, our state-of-the-art results in object detection (from our
mask byproduct) and panoptic segmentation show the potential to serve as a new
strong baseline for many instance-level recognition tasks besides instance
segmentation. Code is available at: https://git.io/AdelaiDet

Title: Balanced Alignment for Face Recognition: A Joint Learning Approach
Authors: Huawei Wei, Peng Lu, Yichen Wei
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 17 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Face alignment is crucial for face recognition and has been widely adopted.
However, current practice is too simple and under-explored. There lacks an
understanding of how important face alignment is and how it should be
performed, for recognition. This work studies these problems and makes two
contributions. First, it provides an in-depth and quantitative study of how
alignment strength affects recognition accuracy. Our results show that
excessive alignment is harmful and an optimal balanced point of alignment is in
need. To strike the balance, our second contribution is a novel joint learning
approach where alignment learning is controllable with respect to its strength
and driven by recognition. Our proposed method is validated by comprehensive
experiments on several benchmarks, especially the challenging ones with large
pose.

\\
  With the advent of consumer grade depth sensors, low-cost volumetric capture
systems are easier to deploy. Their wider adoption though depends on their
usability and by extension on the practicality of spatially aligning multiple
sensors. Most existing alignment approaches employ visual patterns, e.g.
checkerboards, or markers and require high user involvement and technical
knowledge. More user-friendly and easier-to-use approaches rely on markerless
methods that exploit geometric patterns of a physical structure. However,
current SoA approaches are bounded by restrictions in the placement and the
number of sensors. In this work, we improve markerless data-driven
correspondence estimation to achieve more robust and flexible multi-sensor
spatial alignment. In particular, we incorporate geometric constraints in an
end-to-end manner into a typical segmentation based model and bridge the
intermediate dense classification task with the targeted pose estimation one.
This is accomplished by a soft, differentiable procrustes analysis that
regularizes the segmentation and achieves higher extrinsic calibration
performance in expanded sensor placement configurations, while being
unrestricted by the number of sensors of the volumetric capture system. Our
model is experimentally shown to achieve similar results with marker-based
methods and outperform the markerless ones, while also being robust to the pose
variations of the calibration structure. Code and pretrained models are
available at https://vcl3d.github.io/StructureNet/.

Title: Learning Better Lossless Compression Using Lossy Compression
Authors: Fabian Mentzer, Luc Van Gool, Michael Tschannen
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: CVPR'20 camera-ready version
\\
  We leverage the powerful lossy image compression algorithm BPG to build a
lossless image compression system. Specifically, the original image is first
decomposed into the lossy reconstruction obtained after compressing it with BPG
and the corresponding residual. We then model the distribution of the residual
with a convolutional neural network-based probabilistic model that is
conditioned on the BPG reconstruction, and combine it with entropy coding to
losslessly encode the residual. Finally, the image is stored using the
concatenation of the bitstreams produced by BPG and the learned residual coder.
The resulting compression system achieves state-of-the-art performance in
learned lossless full-resolution image compression, outperforming previous
learned approaches as well as PNG, WebP, and JPEG2000.

Title: Spatial Pyramid Based Graph Reasoning for Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Xia Li, Yibo Yang, Qijie Zhao, Tiancheng Shen, Zhouchen Lin, Hong Liu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR 2020
\\
  The convolution operation suffers from a limited receptive filed, while
global modeling is fundamental to dense prediction tasks, such as semantic
segmentation. In this paper, we apply graph convolution into the semantic
segmentation task and propose an improved Laplacian. The graph reasoning is
directly performed in the original feature space organized as a spatial
pyramid. Different from existing methods, our Laplacian is data-dependent and
we introduce an attention diagonal matrix to learn a better distance metric. It
gets rid of projecting and re-projecting processes, which makes our proposed
method a light-weight module that can be easily plugged into current computer
vision architectures. More importantly, performing graph reasoning directly in
the feature space retains spatial relationships and makes spatial pyramid
possible to explore multiple long-range contextual patterns from different
scales. Experiments on Cityscapes, COCO Stuff, PASCAL Context and PASCAL VOC
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods on semantic segmentation.
We achieve comparable performance with advantages in computational and memory
overhead.

Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1905.03466 by other authors
\\
  We propose a novel Enhanced Feature Aggregation and Selection network
(EFASNet) for multi-person 2D human pose estimation. Due to enhanced feature
representation, our method can well handle crowded, cluttered and occluded
scenes. More specifically, a Feature Aggregation and Selection Module (FASM),
which constructs hierarchical multi-scale feature aggregation and makes the
aggregated features discriminative, is proposed to get more accurate
fine-grained representation, leading to more precise joint locations. Then, we
perform a simple Feature Fusion (FF) strategy which effectively fuses
high-resolution spatial features and low-resolution semantic features to obtain
more reliable context information for well-estimated joints. Finally, we build
a Dense Upsampling Convolution (DUC) module to generate more precise
prediction, which can recover missing joint details that are usually
unavailable in common upsampling process. As a result, the predicted keypoint
heatmaps are more accurate. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves the
superior performance over three benchmark datasets: the recent big dataset
CrowdPose, the COCO keypoint detection dataset and the MPII Human Pose dataset.
Our code will be released upon acceptance.

  Neural networks reach state-of-the-art performance in a variety of learning
tasks. However, a lack of understanding the decision making process yields to
an appearance as black box. We address this and propose ConstraintNet, a neural
network with the capability to constrain the output space in each forward pass
via an additional input. The prediction of ConstraintNet is proven within the
specified domain. This enables ConstraintNet to exclude unintended or even
hazardous outputs explicitly whereas the final prediction is still learned from
data. We focus on constraints in form of convex polytopes and show the
generalization to further classes of constraints. ConstraintNet can be
constructed easily by modifying existing neural network architectures. We
highlight that ConstraintNet is end-to-end trainable with no overhead in the
forward and backward pass. For illustration purposes, we model ConstraintNet by
modifying a CNN and construct constraints for facial landmark prediction tasks.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the application to a follow object controller for
vehicles as a safety-critical application. We submitted an approach and system
for the generation of safety-critical outputs of an entity based on
ConstraintNet at the German Patent and Trademark Office with the official
registration mark DE10 2019 119 739.

Title: Cross-domain Object Detection through Coarse-to-Fine Feature Adaptation
Authors: Yangtao Zheng, Di Huang, Songtao Liu and Yunhong Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent years have witnessed great progress in deep learning based object
detection. However, due to the domain shift problem, applying off-the-shelf
detectors to an unseen domain leads to significant performance drop. To address
such an issue, this paper proposes a novel coarse-to-fine feature adaptation
approach to cross-domain object detection. At the coarse-grained stage,
different from the rough image-level or instance-level feature alignment used
in the literature, foreground regions are extracted by adopting the attention
mechanism, and aligned according to their marginal distributions via
multi-layer adversarial learning in the common feature space. At the
fine-grained stage, we conduct conditional distribution alignment of
foregrounds by minimizing the distance of global prototypes with the same
category but from different domains. Thanks to this coarse-to-fine feature
adaptation, domain knowledge in foreground regions can be effectively
transferred. Extensive experiments are carried out in various cross-domain
detection scenarios. The results are state-of-the-art, which demonstrate the
broad applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Accurate Optimization of Weighted Nuclear Norm for Non-Rigid Structure
  from Motion
Authors: Jos\'e Pedro Iglesias, Carl Olsson, Marcus Valtonen \"Ornhag
Categories: cs.CV math.OC
\\
  Fitting a matrix of a given rank to data in a least squares sense can be done
very effectively using 2nd order methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt by
explicitly optimizing over a bilinear parameterization of the matrix. In
contrast, when applying more general singular value penalties, such as weighted
nuclear norm priors, direct optimization over the elements of the matrix is
typically used. Due to non-differentiability of the resulting objective
function, first order sub-gradient or splitting methods are predominantly used.
While these offer rapid iterations it is well known that they become inefficent
near the minimum due to zig-zagging and in practice one is therefore often
forced to settle for an approximate solution.
  In this paper we show that more accurate results can in many cases be
achieved with 2nd order methods. Our main result shows how to construct
bilinear formulations, for a general class of regularizers including weighted
nuclear norm penalties, that are provably equivalent to the original problems.
With these formulations the regularizing function becomes twice differentiable
and 2nd order methods can be applied. We show experimentally, on a number of
structure from motion problems, that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

video images have been proposed in the literature, key limitations remain to be
addressed: Firstly, robustness, that is, the reliable performance of
state-of-the-art methods when run on challenging images (e.g. in the presence
of blood, smoke or motion artifacts). Secondly, generalization; algorithms
trained for a specific intervention in a specific hospital should generalize to
other interventions or institutions.
  In an effort to promote solutions for these limitations, we organized the
Robust Medical Instrument Segmentation (ROBUST-MIS) challenge as an
international benchmarking competition with a specific focus on the robustness
and generalization capabilities of algorithms. For the first time in the field
of endoscopic image processing, our challenge included a task on binary
segmentation and also addressed multi-instance detection and segmentation. The
challenge was based on a surgical data set comprising 10,040 annotated images
acquired from a total of 30 surgical procedures from three different types of
surgery. The validation of the competing methods for the three tasks (binary
segmentation, multi-instance detection and multi-instance segmentation) was
performed in three different stages with an increasing domain gap between the
training and the test data. The results confirm the initial hypothesis, namely
that algorithm performance degrades with an increasing domain gap. While the
average detection and segmentation quality of the best-performing algorithms is
high, future research should concentrate on detection and segmentation of
small, crossing, moving and transparent instrument(s) (parts).

Title: Adversarial Attacks on Monocular Depth Estimation
Authors: Ziqi Zhang, Xinge Zhu, Yingwei Li, Xiangqun Chen, Yao Guo
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent advances of deep learning have brought exceptional performance on many
computer vision tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.
However, the vulnerability of deep neural networks towards adversarial examples
have caused grave concerns for real-world deployment. In this paper, we present
to the best of our knowledge the first systematic study of adversarial attacks
on monocular depth estimation, an important task of 3D scene understanding in
scenarios such as autonomous driving and robot navigation. In order to
understand the impact of adversarial attacks on depth estimation, we first
define a taxonomy of different attack scenarios for depth estimation, including
non-targeted attacks, targeted attacks and universal attacks. We then adapt
several state-of-the-art attack methods for classification on the field of
depth estimation. Besides, multi-task attacks are introduced to further improve
the attack performance for universal attacks. Experimental results show that it
is possible to generate significant errors on depth estimation. In particular,
we demonstrate that our methods can conduct targeted attacks on given objects
(such as a car), resulting in depth estimation 3-4x away from the ground truth
(e.g., from 20m to 80m).

Title: Neural Contours: Learning to Draw Lines from 3D Shapes
Authors: Difan Liu, Mohamed Nabail, Aaron Hertzmann, Evangelos Kalogerakis
Categories: cs.CV cs.GR
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020
\\
  This paper introduces a method for learning to generate line drawings from 3D
models. Our architecture incorporates a differentiable module operating on
geometric features of the 3D model, and an image-based module operating on
view-based shape representations. At test time, geometric and view-based
reasoning are combined with the help of a neural module to create a line
drawing. The model is trained on a large number of crowdsourced comparisons of
line drawings. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant
improvements in line drawing over the state-of-the-art when evaluated on
standard benchmarks, resulting in drawings that are comparable to those
produced by experienced human artists.

Title: Weakly Supervised 3D Human Pose and Shape Reconstruction with
  Normalizing Flows
Authors: Andrei Zanfir, Eduard Gabriel Bazavan, Hongyi Xu, Bill Freeman, Rahul

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Monocular 3D human pose and shape estimation is challenging due to the many
degrees of freedom of the human body and thedifficulty to acquire training data
for large-scale supervised learning in complex visual scenes. In this paper we
present practical semi-supervised and self-supervised models that support
training and good generalization in real-world images and video. Our
formulation is based on kinematic latent normalizing flow representations and
dynamics, as well as differentiable, semantic body part alignment loss
functions that support self-supervised learning. In extensive experiments using
3D motion capture datasets like CMU, Human3.6M, 3DPW, or AMASS, as well as
image repositories like COCO, we show that the proposed methods outperform the
state of the art, supporting the practical construction of an accurate family
of models based on large-scale training with diverse and incompletely labeled
image and video data.

Title: Inherent Adversarial Robustness of Deep Spiking Neural Networks: Effects
  of Discrete Input Encoding and Non-Linear Activations
Authors: Saima Sharmin, Nitin Rathi, Priyadarshini Panda and Kaushik Roy
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In the recent quest for trustworthy neural networks, we present Spiking
Neural Network (SNN) as a potential candidate for inherent robustness against
adversarial attacks. In this work, we demonstrate that accuracy degradation is
less severe in SNNs than in their non-spiking counterparts for CIFAR10 and
CIFAR100 datasets on deep VGG architectures. We attribute this robustness to
two fundamental characteristics of SNNs and analyze their effects. First, we
exhibit that input discretization introduced by the Poisson encoder improves
adversarial robustness with reduced number of timesteps. Second, we quantify
the amount of adversarial accuracy with increased leak rate in
Leaky-Integrate-Fire (LIF) neurons. Our results suggest that SNNs trained with
LIF neurons and smaller number of timesteps are more robust than the ones with
IF (Integrate-Fire) neurons and larger number of timesteps. We overcome the
bottleneck of creating gradient-based adversarial inputs in temporal domain by
proposing a technique for crafting attacks from SNN.

Title: Learning Dynamic Routing for Semantic Segmentation

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020 as Oral
\\
  Recently, numerous handcrafted and searched networks have been applied for
semantic segmentation. However, previous works intend to handle inputs with
various scales in pre-defined static architectures, such as FCN, U-Net, and
DeepLab series. This paper studies a conceptually new method to alleviate the
scale variance in semantic representation, named dynamic routing. The proposed
framework generates data-dependent routes, adapting to the scale distribution
of each image. To this end, a differentiable gating function, called soft
conditional gate, is proposed to select scale transform paths on the fly. In
addition, the computational cost can be further reduced in an end-to-end manner
by giving budget constraints to the gating function. We further relax the
network level routing space to support multi-path propagations and
skip-connections in each forward, bringing substantial network capacity. To
demonstrate the superiority of the dynamic property, we compare with several
static architectures, which can be modeled as special cases in the routing
space. Extensive experiments are conducted on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 to
illustrate the effectiveness of the dynamic framework. Code is available at

Title: Atlas: End-to-End 3D Scene Reconstruction from Posed Images
Authors: Zak Murez, Tarrence van As, James Bartolozzi, Ayan Sinha, Vijay
  Badrinarayanan, and Andrew Rabinovich
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We present an end-to-end 3D reconstruction method for a scene by directly
regressing a truncated signed distance function (TSDF) from a set of posed RGB
images. Traditional approaches to 3D reconstruction rely on an intermediate
representation of depth maps prior to estimating a full 3D model of a scene. We
hypothesize that a direct regression to 3D is more effective. A 2D CNN extracts
features from each image independently which are then back-projected and
accumulated into a voxel volume using the camera intrinsics and extrinsics.
After accumulation, a 3D CNN refines the accumulated features and predicts the
TSDF values. Additionally, semantic segmentation of the 3D model is obtained
without significant computation. This approach is evaluated on the Scannet
dataset where we significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines (deep
multiview stereo followed by traditional TSDF fusion) both quantitatively and
qualitatively. We compare our 3D semantic segmentation to prior methods that
use a depth sensor since no previous work attempts the problem with only RGB
input.

Title: Proximity: a recipe to break the outbreak
Authors: Marco Faggian, Michele Urbani, Luca Zanotto
Categories: cs.CY
\\
  We present a mobile app solution to help the containment of an epidemic
outbreak by keeping track of possible infections in the incubation period. We
consider the particular case of an infection which primarily spreads among
people through proximal contact, via respiratory droplets. This smartphone
application will work offline and will be able to detect other devices in close
proximity and list all the interactions in an anonymous and encrypted way. If
an app user is tested positive and so is certified as infected, the application
notifies immediately the potential contagion to the devices in the list and
suggests to start a voluntary quarantine and undergo a medical test. We believe
this solution may be useful in particular in the current COVID-19 pandemic and
moreover could be used to prevent similar events in the future.

Title: Transforming Commercial Contracts through Computable Contracting
Authors: John Cummins and Christopher Clack
Categories: cs.CY
Comments: 14 pages, 5 figures, 3 pages of references
\\
  Contracts are an essential and fundamental component of commerce and society,
serving to clarify agreement between multiple parties. While digital
technologies have helped to automate many activities associated with
contracting, the contracts themselves continue, in the main, to be in the form
of unstructured, natural-language text. This limits the scope for improvements
in productivity and automation, as well as the emergence of new business
models. To this end, this paper examines the concept of computable contracts as
objects that are understandable by both humans and computers, and goes on to
present a framework that unifies a range of technologies and approaches that
collectively will help to make computable contracting a reality.

Title: Efficient Oblivious Database Joins
Authors: Simeon Krastnikov, Florian Kerschbaum, Douglas Stebila
Categories: cs.DB cs.CR cs.DS
\\
  A major algorithmic challenge in designing applications intended for secure
remote execution is ensuring that they are oblivious to their inputs, in the
sense that their memory access patterns do not leak sensitive information to
the server. This problem is particularly relevant to cloud databases that wish
to allow queries over the client's encrypted data. One of the major obstacles
to such a goal is the join operator, which is non-trivial to implement
obliviously without resorting to generic but inefficient solutions like
Oblivious RAM (ORAM).
  We present an oblivious algorithm for equi-joins which (up to a logarithmic
factor) matches the optimal $O(n\log n)$ complexity of the standard non-secure
sort-merge join (on inputs producing $O(n)$ outputs). We do not use use
expensive primitives like ORAM or rely on unrealistic hardware or security
assumptions. Our approach, which is based on sorting networks and novel
provably-oblivious constructions, is conceptually simple, easily verifiable,
and very efficient in practice. Its data-independent algorithmic structure
makes it secure in various different settings for remote computation, even in
those that are known to be vulnerable to certain side-channel attacks (such as
Intel SGX) or with strict requirements for low circuit complexity (like secure
multiparty computation). We confirm that our approach is easily realizable
through a compact prototype implementation which matches our expectations for
performance and is shown, both formally and empirically, to possess the desired
security characteristics.

Title: Covering the Relational Join
Authors: Shi Li and Sai Vikneshwar Mani Jayaraman and Atri Rudra
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  In this paper, we initiate a theoretical study of what we call the join
covering problem. We are given a natural join query instance $Q$ on $n$
attributes and $m$ relations $(R_i)_{i \in [m]}$. Let $J_{Q} = \ \Join_{i=1}^m
R_i$ denote the join output of $Q$. In addition to $Q$, we are given a
parameter $\Delta: 1\le \Delta\le n$ and our goal is to compute the smallest
subset $\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta} \subseteq J_{Q}$ such that every tuple in
$J_{Q}$ is within Hamming distance $\Delta - 1$ from some tuple in
$\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta}$. The join covering problem captures both computing
the natural join from database theory and constructing a covering code with
covering radius $\Delta - 1$ from coding theory, as special cases.
  We consider the combinatorial version of the join covering problem, where our
goal is to determine the worst-case $|\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta}|$ in terms of the
structure of $Q$ and value of $\Delta$. One obvious approach to upper bound
$|\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta}|$ is to exploit a distance property (of Hamming
distance) from coding theory and combine it with the worst-case bounds on
output size of natural joins (AGM bound hereon) due to Atserias, Grohe and Marx
[SIAM J. of Computing'13]. Somewhat surprisingly, this approach is not tight
even for the case when the input relations have arity at most two. Instead, we
show that using the polymatroid degree-based bound of Abo Khamis, Ngo and Suciu
[PODS'17] in place of the AGM bound gives us a tight bound (up to constant
factors) on the $|\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta}|$ for the arity two case. We prove
lower bounds for $|\mathcal{T}_{Q, \Delta}|$ using well-known classes of
error-correcting codes e.g, Reed-Solomon codes. We can extend our results for
the arity two case to general arity with a polynomial gap between our upper and
lower bounds.

Title: Causality-Guided Adaptive Interventional Debugging
Authors: Anna Fariha, Suman Nath, Alexandra Meliou
Categories: cs.DB cs.SE
Comments: Technical report of AID (To appear in SIGMOD 2020)
\\
  Runtime nondeterminism is a fact of life in modern database applications.
Previous research has shown that nondeterminism can cause applications to
intermittently crash, become unresponsive, or experience data corruption. We
propose Adaptive Interventional Debugging (AID) for debugging such intermittent
failures. AID combines existing statistical debugging, causal analysis, fault
injection, and group testing techniques in a novel way to (1) pinpoint the
root-cause of an application's intermittent failure and (2) generate an
explanation of how the root-cause triggers the failure. AID works by first
identifying a set of runtime behaviors (called predicates) that are strongly
correlated to the failure. It then utilizes temporal properties of the
predicates to (over)-approximate their causal relationships. Finally, it uses a
sequence of runtime interventions of the predicates to discover their true
causal relationships. This enables AID to identify the true root-cause and its
causal relationship to the failure. We theoretically analyze how fast AID can
converge to the identification. We evaluate AID with three real-world
applications that intermittently fail under specific inputs. In each case, AID
was able to identify the root-cause and explain how the root-cause triggered
the failure, much faster than group testing and more precisely than statistical
debugging. We also evaluate AID with many synthetically generated applications
with known root-causes and confirm that the benefits also hold for them.

Title: A Synopses Data Engine for Interactive Extreme-Scale Analytics

Categories: cs.DB
\\
  In this work, we detail the design and structure of a Synopses Data Engine
(SDE) which combines the virtues of parallel processing and stream
summarization towards delivering interactive analytics at extreme scale. Our
SDE is built on top of Apache Flink and implements a synopsis-as-a-service
paradigm. In that it achieves (a) concurrently maintaining thousands of
synopses of various types for thousands of streams on demand, (b) reusing
maintained synopses among various concurrent workflows, (c) providing data
summarization facilities even for cross-(Big Data) platform workflows, (d)
pluggability of new synopses on-the-fly, (e) increased potential for workflow
execution optimization. The proposed SDE is useful for interactive analytics at
extreme scales because it enables (i) enhanced horizontal scalability, i.e.,
not only scaling out the computation to a number of processing units available
in a computer cluster, but also harnessing the processing load assigned to each
by operating on carefully-crafted data summaries, (ii) vertical scalability,
i.e., scaling the computation to very high numbers of processed streams and
(iii) federated scalability i.e., scaling the computation beyond single
clusters and clouds by controlling the communication required to answer global
queries posed over a number of potentially geo-dispersed clusters.

\\
  Large volumes of data generated by scientific experiments and simulations
come in the form of arrays, while programs that analyze these data are
frequently expressed in terms of array operations in an imperative, loop-based
language. But, as datasets grow larger, new frameworks in distributed Big Data
analytics have become essential tools to large-scale scientific computing.
Scientists, who are typically comfortable with numerical analysis tools but are
not familiar with the intricacies of Big Data analytics, must now learn to
convert their loop-based programs to distributed data-parallel programs. We
present a novel framework for translating programs expressed as array-based
loops to distributed data parallel programs that is more general and efficient
than related work. Although our translations are over sparse arrays, we extend
our framework to handle packed arrays, such as tiled matrices, without
sacrificing performance. We report on a prototype implementation on top of
Spark and evaluate the performance of our system relative to hand-written
programs.

  Large-scale training is important to ensure high performance and accuracy of
machine-learning models. At Facebook we use many different models, including
computer vision, video and language models. However, in this paper we focus on
the deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs), which are responsible for more
than 50% of the training demand in our data centers. Recommendation models
present unique challenges in training because they exercise not only compute
but also memory capacity as well as memory and network bandwidth. As model size
and complexity increase, efficiently scaling training becomes a challenge. To
address it we design Zion -- Facebook's next-generation large-memory training
platform that consists of both CPUs and accelerators. Also, we discuss the
design requirements of future scale-out training systems.

  Mobile platforms must satisfy the contradictory requirements of fast response
time and minimum energy consumption as a function of dynamically changing
applications. To address this need, system-on-chips (SoC) that are at the heart
of these devices provide a variety of control knobs, such as the number of
active cores and their voltage/frequency levels. Controlling these knobs
optimally at runtime is challenging for two reasons. First, the large
configuration space prohibits exhaustive solutions. Second, control policies
designed offline are at best sub-optimal since many potential new applications
are unknown at design-time. We address these challenges by proposing an online
imitation learning approach. Our key idea is to construct an offline policy and
adapt it online to new applications to optimize a given metric (e.g., energy).
The proposed methodology leverages the supervision enabled by power-performance
models learned at runtime. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a commercial
mobile platform with 16 diverse benchmarks. Our approach successfully adapts
the control policy to an unknown application after executing less than 25% of
its instructions.

Title: Message complexity of population protocols
Authors: Talley Amir, James Aspnes, David Doty, Mahsa Eftekhari H., Eric
  Severson
Categories: cs.DC cs.CC
\\
  The standard population protocol model assumes that when two agents interact,
each observes the entire state of the other agent. We initiate the study of the
$\textbf{message complexity}$ for population protocols, where the state of an
agent is divided into an externally-visible $\textbf{message}$ and an internal
component, where only the message can be observed by the other agent in an
interaction.
  We consider the case of $O(1)$ message complexity. When time is unrestricted,
we obtain an exact characterization of the stably computable predicates based
on the number of internal states $s(n)$: If $s(n) = o(n)$ then the protocol
computes a semilinear predicate (unlike the original model, which can compute
non-semilinear predicates with $s(n) = O(\log n)$), and otherwise it computes a
predicate decidable by a nondeterministic $O(n \log s(n))$-space-bounded Turing
machine. We then consider time complexity, introducing novel
$O(\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ expected time protocols for junta/leader election and
general purpose broadcast correct with high probability, and approximate and
exact population size counting correct with probability 1. Finally, we show
that the main constraint on the power of bounded-message-size protocols is the
size of the internal states: with unbounded internal states, any computable
function can be computed with probability 1 in the limit by a protocol that
uses only one-bit messages.

Title: Resilience in Collaborative Optimization: Redundant and Independent Cost
  Functions
Authors: Nirupam Gupta and Nitin H. Vaidya
Categories: cs.DC cs.MA
Comments: 26 pages, and 1 figure
\\
  This report considers the problem of Byzantine fault-tolerance in multi-agent
collaborative optimization. In this problem, each agent has a local cost
function. The goal of a collaborative optimization algorithm is to compute a
minimum of the aggregate of the agents' cost functions. We consider the case
when a certain number of agents may be Byzantine faulty. Such faulty agents may
not follow a prescribed algorithm, and they may send arbitrary or incorrect
information regarding their local cost functions. A reasonable goal in presence
of such faulty agents is to minimize the aggregate cost of the non-faulty
agents. In this report, we show that this goal can be achieved if and only if
the cost functions of the non-faulty agents have a minimal redundancy property.
We present different algorithms that achieve such tolerance against faulty
agents, and demonstrate a trade-off between the complexity of an algorithm and
the properties of the agents' cost functions.
  Further, we also consider the case when the cost functions are independent or
do not satisfy the minimal redundancy property. In that case, we quantify the
tolerance against faulty agents by introducing a metric called weak resilience.
We present an algorithm that attains weak resilience when the faulty agents are
in the minority and the cost functions are non-negative.

Title: Towards an Enterprise-Ready Implementation of Artificial
  Intelligence-Enabled, Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts
Authors: Philipp Brune (Neu-Ulm University of Applied Sciences, Neu-Ulm,
  Germany)

\\
  Blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) are current hot topics
in research and practice. However, the potentials of their combination have
been studied just recently to a larger extend. While different use cases for
combining AI and blockchain have been discussed, the idea of enabling
blockchain-based smart contracts to perform "smarter" decisions by using AI or
machine learning (ML) models has only been considered on the conceptual level
so far. It remained open, how such AI-enabled smart contracts could be
implemented in a robust way for real-world applications. Therefore, in this
paper a new, enterprise-class implementation of AI-enabled smart contracts is
presented and first insights regarding its feasibility are discussed.

Title: Being Fast Means Being Chatty: The Local Information Cost of Graph
  Spanners
Authors: Peter Robinson
Categories: cs.DC cs.DS
\\
  We introduce a new measure for quantifying the amount of information that the
nodes in a network need to learn to jointly solve a graph problem. We show that
the local information cost presents a natural lower bound on the communication
complexity of distributed algorithms. We demonstrate the application of local
information cost by deriving a lower bound on the communication complexity of
computing a $(2t-1)$-spanner that consists of at most $O(n^{1+\frac{1}{t} +
\epsilon})$ edges, where $\epsilon = \Theta \left( {1}/{t^2} \right)$. Our main
result is that any $O(\text{poly}(n))$-time algorithm must send at least
$\tilde\Omega\left(\tfrac{1}{t^2} n^{1+{1}/{2t}}\right)$ bits in the CONGEST
model under the KT1 assumption, where each node has knowledge of its neighbors'
IDs initially. Previously, only a trivial lower bound of $\tilde \Omega(n)$
bits was known for this problem; in fact, our result is the first nontrivial
lower bound on the communication complexity of a sparse subgraph problem under
the KT1 assumption. A consequence of our lower bound is that achieving both
time- and communication-optimality is impossible when designing spanner
algorithms for this setting. In light of the work of King, Kutten, and Thorup
(PODC 2015), this shows that computing a minimum spanning tree can be done
significantly faster than finding a spanner when considering algorithms with
$\tilde O(n)$ communication complexity. Our result also implies time complexity
lower bounds for constructing a spanner in the node-congested clique of
Augustine et al. (2019) and in the push-pull gossip model with limited
bandwidth.

\\
  New regulations are imposing noise emissions limitations for the aviation
industry which are pushing researchers and engineers to invest efforts in
studying the aeroacoustics phenomena. Following this trend, an in-house
computational fluid dynamics tool is build to reproduce high fidelity results
of supersonic jet flows for aeroacoustic analogy applications. The solver is
written using the large eddy simulation formulation that is discretized using a
finite difference approach and an explicit time integration. Numerical
simulations of supersonic jet flows are very expensive and demand efficient
high-performance computing. Therefore, non-blocking message passage interface
protocols and parallel Input/Output features are implemented into the code in
order to perform simulations which demand up to one billion grid points. The
present work addresses the evaluation of code improvements along with the
computational performance of the solver running on a computer with maximum
theoretical peak of 2.727 PFlops. Different mesh configurations, whose size
varies from a few hundred thousand to approximately one billion grid points,
are evaluated in the present paper. Calculations are performed using different
workloads in order to assess the strong and weak scalability of the parallel
computational tool. Moreover, validation results of a realistic flow condition
are also presented in the current work.

Title: A Transactional Perspective on Execute-order-validate Blockchains
Authors: Pingcheng Ruan, Dumitrel Loghin, Quang-Trung Ta, Meihui Zhang, Gang
  Chen, Beng Chin Ooi
Categories: cs.DC cs.DB cs.PF
\\
  Smart contracts have enabled blockchain systems to evolve from simple
cryptocurrency platforms, such as Bitcoin, to general transactional systems,
such as Ethereum. Catering for emerging business requirements, a new
architecture called execute-order-validate has been proposed in Hyperledger
Fabric to support parallel transactions and improve the blockchain's
throughput. However, this new architecture might render many invalid
transactions when serializing them. This problem is further exaggerated as the
block formation rate is inherently limited due to other factors beside data
processing, such as cryptography and consensus.
  In this work, we propose a novel method to enhance the execute-order-validate
architecture, by reducing invalid transactions to improve the throughput of
blockchains. Our method is inspired by state-of-the-art optimistic concurrency
control techniques in modern database systems. In contrast to existing
blockchains that adopt database's preventive approaches which might abort
serializable transactions, our method is theoretically more fine-grained.
Specifically, unserializable transactions are aborted before ordering and the
remaining transactions are guaranteed to be serializable. For evaluation, we
implement our method in two blockchains respectively, FabricSharp on top of
Hyperledger Fabric, and FastFabricSharp on top of FastFabric. We compare the
performance of FabricSharp with vanilla Fabric and three related systems, two
of which are respectively implemented with one standard and one
state-of-the-art concurrency control techniques from databases. The results
demonstrate that FabricSharp achieves 25% higher throughput compared to the
other systems in nearly all experimental scenarios. Moreover, the
FastFabricSharp's improvement over FastFabric is up to 66%.

Title: Author's approach to the topological modeling of parallel computing
  systems
Authors: Victor A. Melent'ev

MSC-class: 05C62 (Primary) 68R10, 05C85, 05C38, 05C40 (Secondary)
\\
  The author's research of topologies of parallel computing systems and the
tasks solved with them, including the corresponding tools of their modeling, is
summarized in the present paper. The original topological model of such systems
is presented based on the modified Amdahl law. It allowed formalizing the
dependence of the necessary number of processors and the maximal distance
between information-adjacent vertices in a graph on the directive values of
acceleration or efficiency. The dependences of these values on the system
interconnection topology and on the information graph of the parallel task are
also formalized. The tools for a comparative evaluation of these dependences,
topological criteria and the functions of scaling and fault-tolerant operation
of parallel systems are based on the author|s technique of projective
description of graphs and the algorithms used in it.

\\
  Many digital libraries recommend literature to their users considering the
similarity between a query document and their repository. However, they often
fail to distinguish what is the relationship that makes two documents alike. In
this paper, we model the problem of finding the relationship between two
documents as a pairwise document classification task. To find the semantic
relation between documents, we apply a series of techniques, such as GloVe,
Paragraph-Vectors, BERT, and XLNet under different configurations (e.g.,
sequence length, vector concatenation scheme), including a Siamese architecture
for the Transformer-based systems. We perform our experiments on a newly
proposed dataset of 32,168 Wikipedia article pairs and Wikidata properties that
define the semantic document relations. Our results show vanilla BERT as the
best performing system with an F1-score of 0.93, which we manually examine to
better understand its applicability to other domains. Our findings suggest that
classifying semantic relations between documents is a solvable task and
motivates the development of recommender systems based on the evaluated
techniques. The discussions in this paper serve as first steps in the
exploration of documents through SPARQL-like queries such that one could find
documents that are similar in one aspect but dissimilar in another.

\\
  Novelty is an inherent part of innovations and discoveries. Such processes
may be considered as an appearance of new ideas or as an emergence of atypical
connections between the existing ones. The importance of such connections hints
for investigation of innovations through network or graph representation in the
space of ideas. In such representation, a graph node corresponds to the
relevant concept (idea), whereas an edge between two nodes means that the
corresponding concepts have been used in a common context. In this study we
address the question about a possibility to identify the edges between existing
concepts where the innovations may emerge. To this end, we use a
well-documented scientific knowledge landscape of 1.2M arXiv.org manuscripts
dated starting from April 2007 and until September 2019. We extract relevant
concepts for them using the ScienceWISE.info platform. Combining approaches
developed in complex networks science and graph embedding, we discuss the
predictability of edges (links) on the scientific knowledge landscape where the
innovations may appear.

\\
  Quantifying the interdisciplinarity of a research is a relevant problem in
the evaluative bibliometrics. The concept of interdisciplinarity is ambiguous
and multidimensional. Thus, different measures of interdisciplinarity have been
propose in the literature. However, few studies have proposed interdisciplinary
metrics without previously defining classification sets, and no one use the
co-citation network for this purpose. In this study we propose an
interdisciplinary metric based on the co-citation network. This is a way to
define the publication's field without resorting to pre-defined classification
sets. We present a characterization of a publication's field and then we use
this definition to propose a new metric of the interdisciplinarity degree for
publications (papers) and journals as units of analysis. The proposed measure
has an aggregative property that makes it scalable from a paper individually to
a set of them (journal) without more than adding the numerators and
denominators in the proportions that define this new indicator. Moreover, the
aggregated value of two or more units is strictly among all the individual
values.

Title: An Online Framework to Interact and Efficiently Compute Linear Layouts
  of Graphs
Authors: Michael A. Bekos, Mirco Haug, Michael Kaufmann, Julia M\"annecke
Categories: cs.DM cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  We present a prototype online system to automate the procedure of computing
different types of linear layouts of graphs under different user-specific
constraints. The system consists of two main components; the client and the
server sides. The client side is built upon an easy-to-use editor, which
supports basic interaction with graphs, enriched with several additional
features to allow the user to define and further constraint the linear layout
to be computed.
  The server side, which is available to multiple clients through a
well-documented API, is responsible for the actual computation of the linear
layout. Its algorithmic core is an extension of a SAT formulation that is known
to be robust enough to solve non-trivial instances in reasonable amount of
time. However, it has also several known limitations and potential improvements
that~we address in this work (e.g., limited applicability to a particular type
of linear layouts, no support for additional constraints, limited extendability
e.t.c.).
  As a proof of concept, we present our findings for a sketch of a proof of an
important result in the field that was proposed by Yannakakis back in 1986
(whose details, however, have not been published so far).

Title: On the diameter of the polytope of the stable marriage with ties
Authors: Felix Bauckholt and Laura Sanit\`a
Categories: cs.DM math.CO math.OC
\\
  The stable marriage problem with ties is a well-studied and interesting
problem in game theory. We are given a set of men and a set of women. Each
individual has a preference ordering on the opposite group, which can possibly
contain ties. A stable marriage is given by a matching between men and women
for which there is no blocking pair, i.e., a men and a women who strictly
prefer each other to their current partner in the matching.
  In this paper, we study the diameter of the polytope given by the convex hull
of characteristic vectors of stable marriages, in the setting with ties. We
prove an upper bound of $\lfloor \frac{n}{3}\rfloor$ on the diameter, where $n$
is the total number of men and women, and give a family of instances for which
the bound holds tight. Our result generalizes the bound on the diameter of the
standard stable marriage polytope (i.e., the well-known polytope that describes
the setting without ties), developed previously in the literature.

Title: Kac meets Johnson and Lindenstrauss: a memory-optimal, fast
  Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform
Authors: Vishesh Jain, Natesh S. Pillai, Aaron Smith
Categories: cs.DS math.PR
Comments: 15 pages, comments welcome!
\\
  Based on the Kac random walk on the orthogonal group, we present a fast
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform: given a set $X$ of $n$ point sets in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and an error parameter $\epsilon$, this is a linear
transformation $\Psi: \mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R}^{O(\epsilon^{-2}\log{n})}$
such that $\|\Psi x\|_{2} \in (1- \epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\cdot \|x\|_{2}$ for all
$x\in X$, and such that for each $x\in X$, $\Psi x$ can be computed in time
$O(d\log{d} + \min\{d\log{n} +
\epsilon^{-2}\log^{3}{n}\log^{3}(\epsilon^{-1}\log{n})\})$ with only a constant
amount of memory overhead. In some parameter regimes, our algorithm is best
known, and essentially confirms a conjecture of Ailon and Chazelle.

potential misalignment between user-emitted waves and the active PWE
configuration, and can constitute the basis for studying queuing problems in
PWEs. Subsequently, a novel, beam steering approach is proposed which can
effectively mitigate the misalignment effects. Ray-tracing-based simulations

Title: Rig-space Neural Rendering
Authors: Dominik Borer, Lu Yuhang, Laura Wuelfroth, Jakob Buhmann, Martin Guay
Categories: cs.GR
\\
  Movie productions use high resolution 3d characters with complex proprietary
rigs to create the highest quality images possible for large displays.
Unfortunately, these 3d assets are typically not compatible with real-time
graphics engines used for games, mixed reality and real-time pre-visualization.
Consequently, the 3d characters need to be re-modeled and re-rigged for these
new applications, requiring weeks of work and artistic approval. Our solution
to this problem is to learn a compact image-based rendering of the original 3d
character, conditioned directly on the rig parameters. Our idea is to render
the character in many different poses and views, and to train a deep neural
network to render high resolution images, from the rig parameters directly.
Many neural rendering techniques have been proposed to render from 2d
skeletons, or geometry and UV maps. However these require manual work, and to
do not remain compatible with the animator workflow of manipulating rig
widgets, as well as the real-time game engine pipeline of interpolating rig
parameters. We extend our architecture to support dynamic re-lighting and
composition with other 3d objects in the scene. We designed a network that
efficiently generates multiple scene feature maps such as normals, depth,
albedo and mask, which are composed with other scene objects to form the final
image.

Title: A Stackelberg Game Theoretic Model of Lane-Merging
Authors: Jehong Yoo and Reza Langari
Categories: cs.GT cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 12 page, 17 figures
\\
  Merging in the form of a mandatory lane-change is an important issue in
transportation research. Even when safely completed, merging may disturb the
mainline traffic and reduce the efficiency or capacity of the roadway. In this
paper, we consider a Stackelberg game-theoretic driver behavior model where the
so-called utilities or payoffs reflect the merging vehicle's aggressiveness as
it pertains the decision to merge as the situation stands or to accelerate,
decelerate prior to the actual lane-change maneuver. The interaction of the
merging vehicle with the mainline traffic is also considered whereby the
combination of aggressiveness of the respective vehicles leads to both
longitudinal and lateral disturbances to the mainline flow as well as
subsequent reduction in the roadway throughput. The present study shows in
semi-quantitative form that this impact depends on the level of aggressiveness
of the merging and mainline vehicles, leading to the potential use of this
model in traffic flow analysis and autonomous driving.

Title: Hypothesis Testing Approach to Detecting Collusion in Competitive
  Environments
Authors: Pedro Hespanhol, Anil Aswani
Categories: cs.GT math.OC stat.AP
\\
  There is growing concern about the possibility for tacit collusion using
algorithmic pricing, and regulators need tools to help detect the possibility
of such collusion. This paper studies how to design a hypothesis testing
framework in order to decide whether agents are behaving competitively or not.
In our setting, agents are utility-maximizing and compete over prices of items.
A regulator, with no knowledge of the agent's utility function, has access only
to the agents' strategies (i.e., pricing decisions) and external shock values
in order to decide if agents are behaving in competition according to some
equilibrium problem. We leverage the formulation of such a problem as an
inverse variational inequality and design a hypothesis test under a minimal set
of assumptions. We demonstrate our method with computational experiments of the
famous Bertrand competition game (with and without collusion) and show how our
method performs in this environment.

Title: Egalitarian solution for games with discrete side payment
Authors: Takafumi Otsuka
Categories: cs.GT econ.TH
Comments: 31 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables
MSC-class: 91A12
\\
  In this paper, we study the egalitarian solution for games with discrete side
payment, where the characteristic function is integer-valued and payoffs of
players are integral vectors. The egalitarian solution, introduced by Dutta and
Ray in 1989, is a solution concept for transferable utility cooperative games
in characteristic form, which combines commitment for egalitarianism and
promotion of indivisual interests in a consistent manner. We first point out
that the nice properties of the egalitarian solution (in the continuous case)
do not extend to games with discrete side payment. Then we show that the Lorenz
stable set, which may be regarded a variant of the egalitarian solution, has
nice properties such as the Davis and Maschler reduced game property and the
converse reduced game property. For the proofs we utilize recent results in
discrete convex analysis on decreasing minimization on an M-convex set
investigated by Frank and Murota.

Title: Hazard recognition in an immersive virtual environment: Framework for

Authors: Mojtaba Noghabaei, and Kevin Han
Categories: cs.HC cs.CY eess.SP
\\
  Unmanaged hazards in dangerous construction environments proved to be one of
the main sources of injuries and accidents. Hazard recognition is crucial to
achieve effective safety management and reduce injuries and fatalities in
hazardous job sites. Still, there has been lack of effort that can efficiently
assist workers in improving their hazard recognition skills. This study
presents virtual safety training in an Immersive Virtual Environment (IVE) to
enhance worker's hazard recognition skills. A worker wearing a Virtual Reality
(VR) device, that is equipped with an eye-tracker, virtually recognizes hazards
on simulated construction sites while a brainwave-sensing device records brain
activities. This platform can analyze the overall performance of the workers in
a visual hazard recognition task and identify hazards that need additional
intervention for each worker. This study provides novel insights on how a
worker's brain and eye act simultaneously during a visual hazard recognition
process. The presented method can take current safety training programs into
another level by providing personalized feedback to the workers.

Title: Reward-Mediated Individual and Altruistic Behavior
Authors: Samuel Gomes, Tom\'as Alves, Jo\~ao Dias, Carlos Martinho
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Recent research has taken particular interest in observing the dynamics
between altruistic and individual behavior. This is a commonly approached
problem when reasoning about social dilemmas, which have a plethora of real
world counterparts in the fields of education, health and economics. Weighing
how incentives influence in-game behavior, our study examines individual and
altruistic interactions, by analyzing the players' strategies and interaction
motives when facing different reward attribution strategies. Consequently, a
model for interaction motives is also proposed, with the premise that the
motives for interactions can be defined as a continuous space, ranging from
self-oriented (associated to self-improvement behaviors) to others-oriented
(associated to extreme altruism behaviors) motives. To evaluate the promotion
of individual and altruistic behavior, we leverage Message Across, an in-loco
two-player videogame with adaptable reward attribution systems. We conducted
several user tests (N = 66) to verify to what extent individual and altruistic
reward attribution systems led players to vary their strategies and motives
orientation. Our results indicate that players' strategies and self-reported
orientation of interaction motives varied highly significantly upon the
deployment of individual and altruistic reward systems, which leads us to
believe on the suitability of applying an incentive-based strategy to moderate
the emergence of individual and altruistic behavior in games.

Title: Analysis and Prediction of Pedestrian Crosswalk Behavior during
  Automated Vehicle Interactions

\\
  For safe navigation around pedestrians, automated vehicles (AVs) need to plan
their motion by accurately predicting pedestrians trajectories over long time
horizons. Current approaches to AV motion planning around crosswalks predict
only for short time horizons (1-2 s) and are based on data from pedestrian
interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). In this paper, we develop a
hybrid systems model that uses pedestrians gap acceptance behavior and constant
velocity dynamics for long-term pedestrian trajectory prediction when
interacting with AVs. Results demonstrate the applicability of the model for
long-term (> 5 s) pedestrian trajectory prediction at crosswalks. Further we
compared measures of pedestrian crossing behaviors in the immersive virtual
environment (when interacting with AVs) to that in the real world (results of
published studies of pedestrians interacting with HDVs), and found similarities
between the two. These similarities demonstrate the applicability of the hybrid
model of AV interactions developed from an immersive virtual environment (IVE)
for real-world scenarios for both AVs and HDVs.

  Deep Models and Artificial Intelligence for Defense Applications: Potentials,

\\
  In order to increase productivity, capability, and data exploitation,
numerous defense applications are experiencing an integration of
state-of-the-art machine learning and AI into their architectures. Especially
for defense applications, having a human analyst in the loop is of high
interest due to quality control, accountability, and complex subject matter
expertise not readily automated or replicated by AI. However, many applications
are suffering from a very slow transition. This may be in large part due to
lack of trust, usability, and productivity, especially when adapting to
unforeseen classes and changes in mission context. Interactive machine learning
is a newly emerging field in which machine learning implementations are
trained, optimized, evaluated, and exploited through an intuitive
human-computer interface. In this paper, we introduce interactive machine
learning and explain its advantages and limitations within the context of
defense applications. Furthermore, we address several of the shortcomings of
interactive machine learning by discussing how cognitive feedback may inform
features, data, and results in the state of the art. We define the three
techniques by which cognitive feedback may be employed: self reporting,
implicit cognitive feedback, and modeled cognitive feedback. The advantages and
disadvantages of each technique are discussed.

Title: Privacy-Preserving News Recommendation Model Training via Federated
  Learning
Authors: Tao Qi, Fangzhao Wu, Chuhan Wu, Yongfeng Huang, Xing Xie
Categories: cs.IR
Comments: 8pages,
\\
  News recommendation aims to display news articles to users based on their
personal interest. Existing news recommendation methods rely on centralized
storage of user behavior data for model training, which may lead to privacy
concerns and risks due to the privacy-sensitive nature of user behaviors. In
this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving method for news recommendation
model training based on federated learning, where the user behavior data is
locally stored on user devices. Our method can leverage the useful information
in the behaviors of massive users to train accurate news recommendation models
and meanwhile remove the need to centralized storage of them. More
specifically, on each user device we keep a local copy of the news
recommendation model, and compute gradients of the local model based on the
user behaviors in this device. The local gradients from a group of randomly
selected users are uploaded to server, which are further aggregated to update
the global model in the server. Since the model gradients may contain some
implicit private information, we apply local differential privacy (LDP) to them
before uploading for better privacy protection. The updated global model is
then distributed to each user device for local model update. We repeat this
process for multiple rounds. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show
the effectiveness of our method in news recommendation model training with
privacy protection.

Title: 365 Dots in 2019: Quantifying Attention of News Sources
Authors: Alexander C. Nwala, Michele C. Weigle, Michael L. Nelson
Categories: cs.IR
Comments: This is an extended version of the paper accepted at Computation +
  Journalism Symposium 2020, which has been postponed because of COVID-19
\\
  We investigate the overlap of topics of online news articles from a variety
of sources. To do this, we provide a platform for studying the news by
measuring this overlap and scoring news stories according to the degree of
attention in near-real time. This can enable multiple studies, including
identifying topics that receive the most attention from news organizations and
identifying slow news days versus major news days. Our application, StoryGraph,
periodically (10-minute intervals) extracts the first five news articles from
the RSS feeds of 17 US news media organizations across the partisanship
spectrum (left, center, and right). From these articles, StoryGraph extracts
named entities (PEOPLE, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS, etc.) and then represents
each news article with its set of extracted named entities. Finally, StoryGraph
generates a news similarity graph where the nodes represent news articles, and
an edge between a pair of nodes represents a high degree of similarity between
the nodes (similar news stories). Each news story within the news similarity
graph is assigned an attention score which quantifies the amount of attention
the topics in the news story receive collectively from the news media
organizations. The StoryGraph service has been running since August 2017, and
using this method, we determined that the top news story of 2018 was the
"Kavanaugh hearings" with attention score of 25.85 on September 27, 2018.
Similarly, the top news story for 2019 so far (2019-12-12) is "AG William
Barr's release of his principal conclusions of the Mueller Report," with an
attention score of 22.93 on March 24, 2019.

Title: Modelling High-Order Social Relations for Item Recommendation
Authors: Yang Liu, Liang Chen, Xiangnan He, Jiaying Peng, Zibin Zheng, Jie Tang
Categories: cs.IR
Comments: 11 pages, 8 figurs, 4 tables
\\
  The prevalence of online social network makes it compulsory to study how
social relations affect user choice. However, most existing methods leverage
only first-order social relations, that is, the direct neighbors that are
connected to the target user. The high-order social relations, e.g., the
friends of friends, which very informative to reveal user preference, have been
largely ignored. In this work, we focus on modeling the indirect influence from
the high-order neighbors in social networks to improve the performance of item
recommendation. Distinct from mainstream social recommenders that regularize
the model learning with social relations, we instead propose to directly factor
social relations in the predictive model, aiming at learning better user
embeddings to improve recommendation. To address the challenge that high-order
neighbors increase dramatically with the order size, we propose to recursively
"propagate" embeddings along the social network, effectively injecting the
influence of high-order neighbors into user representation. We conduct
experiments on two real datasets of Yelp and Douban to verify our High-Order
Social Recommender (HOSR) model. Empirical results show that our HOSR
significantly outperforms recent graph regularization-based recommenders NSCR
and IF-BPR+, and graph convolutional network-based social influence prediction
model DeepInf, achieving new state-of-the-arts of the task.

Title: What is the optimal depth for deep-unfolding architectures at
  deployment?
Authors: Nancy Nayak, Thulasi Tholeti, Muralikrishnan Srinivasan, Sheetal
  Kalyani
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Recently, many iterative algorithms proposed for various applications such as
compressed sensing, MIMO Detection, etc. have been unfolded and presented as
deep networks; these networks are shown to produce better results than the
algorithms in their iterative forms. However, deep networks are highly
sensitive to the hyperparameters chosen. Especially for a deep unfolded
network, using more layers may lead to redundancy and hence, excessive
computation during deployment. In this work, we consider the problem of
determining the optimal number of layers required for such unfolded
architectures. We propose a method that treats the networks as experts and
measures the relative importance of the expertise provided by layers using a
variant of the popular Hedge algorithm. Based on the importance of the
different layers, we determine the optimal layers required for deployment. We
study the effectiveness of this method by applying it to two recent and popular
deep-unfolding architectures, namely DetNet and TISTANet.

Title: Tracking an Auto-Regressive Process with Limited Communication per Unit
  Time
Authors: Rooji Jinan, Parimal Parag, Himanshu Tyagi
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Samples from a high-dimensional AR[1] process are observed by a sender which
can communicate only finitely many bits per unit time to a receiver. The
receiver seeks to form an estimate of the process value at every time instant
in real-time. We consider a time-slotted communication model in a slow-sampling
regime where multiple communication slots occur between two sampling instants.
We propose a successive update scheme which uses communication between sampling
instants to refine estimates of the latest sample and study the following
question: Is it better to collect communication of multiple slots to send
better refined estimates, making the receiver wait more for every refinement,
or to be fast but loose and send new information in every communication
opportunity? We show that the fast but loose successive update scheme with
ideal spherical codes is universally optimal asymptotically for a large
dimension. However, most practical quantization codes for fixed dimensions do
not meet the ideal performance required for this optimality, and they typically
will have a bias in the form of a fixed additive error. Interestingly, our
analysis shows that the fast but loose scheme is not an optimal choice in the
presence of such errors, and a judiciously chosen frequency of updates
outperforms it.

Title: Private Function Computation for Noncolluding Coded Databases

\\
  Private computation in a distributed storage system (DSS) is a generalization
of the private information retrieval (PIR) problem. In such setting a user
wishes to compute a function of $f$ messages stored in noncolluding coded
databases while revealing no information about the desired function to the
databases. We consider the problem of private polynomial computation (PPC). In
PPC, a user wishes to compute a multivariate polynomial of degree at most $g$
over $f$ variables (or messages) stored in multiple databases. First, we
consider the private computation of polynomials of degree $g=1$, i.e., private
linear computation (PLC) for coded databases. In PLC, a user wishes to compute
a linear combination over the $f$ messages while keeping the coefficients of
the desired linear combination hidden from the database. For a linearly encoded
DSS, we present a capacity-achieving PLC scheme and show that the PLC capacity,
which is the ratio of the desired amount of information and the total amount of
downloaded information, matches the maximum distance separable coded capacity
of PIR for a large class of linear storage codes. Then, we consider private
computation of higher degree polynomials, i.e., $g>1$. For this setup, we
construct two novel PPC schemes. In the first scheme we consider Reed-Solomon
coded databases with Lagrange encoding, which leverages ideas from recently
proposed star-product PIR and Lagrange coded computation. The second scheme
considers the special case of coded databases with systematic Lagrange
encoding. Both schemes yield improved rates compared to the best known schemes
from the literature for a small number of messages, while asymptotically, as
$f\rightarrow \infty$, the systematic scheme gives a significantly better
computation rate compared to all known schemes up to some storage code rate
that depends on the maximum degree of the candidate polynomials.

Title: Compressive Sensing Based Massive Access for IoT Relying on Media
  Modulation Aided Machine Type Communications
Authors: Li Qiao, Jun Zhang, Zhen Gao, Sheng Chen, and Lajos Hanzo
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology [Major
  Revision]
\\
  A fundamental challenge of the large-scale Internet-of-Things lies in how to
support massive machine-type communications (mMTC). This letter proposes a
media modulation based mMTC solution for increasing the throughput, where a
massive multi-input multi-output based base station (BS) is used for enhancing
the detection performance. For such a mMTC scenario, the reliable active device
detection and data decoding pose a serious challenge. By leveraging the
sparsity of the uplink access signals of mMTC received at the BS, a compressive
sensing based massive access solution is proposed for tackling this challenge.
Specifically, we propose a block sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm
for detecting the active devices, whereby the block-sparsity of the uplink
access signals exhibited across the successive time slots and the structured
sparsity of media modulated symbols are exploited for enhancing the detection
performance. Moreover, a successive interference cancellation based structured
subspace pursuit algorithm is conceived for data demodulation of the active
devices, whereby the structured sparsity of media modulation based symbols
found in each time slot is exploited for improving the detection performance.
Finally, our simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed scheme
over state-of-the-art solutions.

\\
  The proliferating number of devices with short payloads as well as low power
budget has already driven researchers away from classical grant-based access
schemes that are notorious for their large signalling overhead as well as
power-consuming retransmissions. Instead, light-weight random access protocols
have been re-investigated and their throughput has been improved in orders of
magnitude with sophisticated yet still low-complex transceiver algorithms. In
fact, grant-free access has been identified as a key medium access control
technique for providing massive connectivity in machine type communications in
cellular networks. In this paper, we show that grant-free access combined with
non-orthogonal transmission schemes is a promising solution for 6G Internet of
Things (IoT). We present novel and promising results for deep learning
(DL)-based techniques for joint user detection and decoding. Then, we propose a
multi-layered model for GF-NOMA for power-efficient communications. We also
discuss resource allocation issues to enable the co-existence of GF-NOMA with
other orthogonal or even grant-based schemes. Finally, we conclude with
proposed research directions for medium access towards enabling 6G-IoT.

Title: Performance Analysis of Millimeter Wave Wireless Power Transfer With
  Imperfect Beam Alignment
Authors: Man Wang, Chao Zhang, Xiaoming Chen, Suhua Tang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted to IEEE TVT for possible publication
\\
  In this paper, the impact of imperfect beam alignment (IBA) on millimeter
wave (mmWave) wireless power transfer (WPT) is investigated. We consider a
mmWave WPT network, where the location of the energy transmitters follows a
Poisson point process. Instead of the mostly used flat-top antenna model, we
adopt the Gaussian antenna model suggested by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) for better accuracy. Two beam alignment error (BAE) models,
i.e., truncated Gaussian and uniform models, are introduced to represent
different BAE sources. We derive the probability density functions (PDFs) of
the cascaded antenna gain with both BAE models and then provide the
approximated PDFs for tractability. With the help of Fox's H function, the
analytic expression for the energy coverage probability with nonlinear energy
harvesting model is derived. Besides, we deduce a closed-form expression of the
average harvested radio frequency (RF) energy. The simulation results verify
our theoretical results and demonstrate the performance degradation incurred by
BAE. It also shows that the flat-top antenna model cannot always provide
accurate performance evaluation in the presence of BAE.

gated-attention mechanisms. In a 2D procedurally-generated world where agents
targeting goals in natural language navigate and interact with objects, we show
that these architectures demonstrate strong generalization capacities to
out-of-distribution goals. We study the generalization to varying numbers of
objects at test time and further extend the object-centered architectures to
goals involving relational reasoning.

Title: Adversarial Robustness on In- and Out-Distribution Improves

  Neural networks have led to major improvements in image classification but

via Adversarial Training on In- and Out-distribution, which leads to robust
models with reliable and robust confidence estimates on the out-distribution.
RATIO has similar generative properties to adversarial training so that visual
counterfactuals produce class specific features. While adversarial training
comes at the price of lower clean accuracy, RATIO achieves state-of-the-art
$l_2$-adversarial robustness on CIFAR10 and maintains better clean accuracy.

Title: Locally Interpretable Predictions of Parkinson's Disease Progression
Authors: Qiaomei Li and Rachel Cummings and Yonatan Mintz
Categories: cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML
\\
  In precision medicine, machine learning techniques have been commonly
proposed to aid physicians in early screening of chronic diseases such as
Parkinson's Disease. These automated screening procedures should be
interpretable by a clinician who must explain the decision-making process to
patients for informed consent. However, the methods which typically achieve the
highest level of accuracy given early screening data are complex black box
models. In this paper, we provide a novel approach for explaining black box
model predictions of Parkinson's Disease progression that can give high
fidelity explanations with lower model complexity. Specifically, we use the
Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) data set to cluster patients
based on the trajectory of their disease progression. This can be used to
predict how a patient's symptoms are likely to develop based on initial
screening data. We then develop a black box (random forest) model for
predicting which cluster a patient belongs in, along with a method for
generating local explainers for these predictions. Our local explainer
methodology uses a computationally efficient information filter to include only
the most relevant features. We also develop a global explainer methodology and
empirically validate its performance on the PPMI data set, showing that our
approach may Pareto-dominate existing techniques on the trade-off between
fidelity and coverage. Such tools should prove useful for implementing medical
screening tools in practice by providing explainer models with high fidelity
and significantly less functional complexity.

Title: Safe Reinforcement Learning of Control-Affine Systems with Vertex
  Networks
Authors: Liyuan Zheng, Yuanyuan Shi, Lillian J. Ratliff, Baosen Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
\\
  This paper focuses on finding reinforcement learning policies for control
systems with hard state and action constraints. Despite its success in many
domains, reinforcement learning is challenging to apply to problems with hard
constraints, especially if both the state variables and actions are
constrained. Previous works seeking to ensure constraint satisfaction, or
safety, have focused on adding a projection step to a learned policy. Yet, this
approach requires solving an optimization problem at every policy execution
step, which can lead to significant computational costs.
  To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a new approach, termed Vertex
Networks (VNs), with guarantees on safety during exploration and on learned
control policies by incorporating the safety constraints into the policy
network architecture. Leveraging the geometric property that all points within
a convex set can be represented as the convex combination of its vertices, the
proposed algorithm first learns the convex combination weights and then uses
these weights along with the pre-calculated vertices to output an action. The
output action is guaranteed to be safe by construction. Numerical examples
illustrate that the proposed VN algorithm outperforms vanilla reinforcement
learning in a variety of benchmark control tasks.

Authors: Zilong Zhao, Sophie Cerf, Bogdan Robu, Nicolas Marchand
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
DOI: 10.1109/LCSYS.2020.2981984
\\
  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has become the most used method for image
classification tasks. During its training the learning rate and the gradient
are two key factors to tune for influencing the convergence speed of the model.
Usual learning rate strategies are time-based i.e. monotonous decay over time.
Recent state-of-the-art techniques focus on adaptive gradient algorithms i.e.
Adam and its versions. In this paper we consider an online learning scenario
and we propose two Event-Based control loops to adjust the learning rate of a
classical algorithm E (Exponential)/PD (Proportional Derivative)-Control. The
first Event-Based control loop will be implemented to prevent sudden drop of
the learning rate when the model is approaching the optimum. The second
Event-Based control loop will decide, based on the learning speed, when to
switch to the next data batch. Experimental evaluationis provided using two
state-of-the-art machine learning image datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100).
Results show the Event-Based E/PD is better than the original algorithm (higher
final accuracy, lower final loss value), and the Double-Event-BasedE/PD can
accelerate the training process, save up to 67% training time compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms and even result in better performance.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel method for transforming data into a
low-dimensional space optimized for one-class classification. The proposed
method iteratively transforms data into a new subspace optimized for
ellipsoidal encapsulation of target class data. We provide both linear and
non-linear formulations for the proposed method. The method takes into account
the covariance of the data in the subspace; hence, it yields a more generalized
solution as compared to Subspace Support Vector Data Description for a
hypersphere. We propose different regularization terms expressing the class
variance in the projected space. We compare the results with classic and
recently proposed one-class classification methods and achieve better results
in the majority of cases. The proposed method is also noticed to converge much
faster than recently proposed Subspace Support Vector Data Description.

fewer workers' compensation claims and missed time for the employer. However,
recognizing lifting risk provides a challenge due to typically small datasets
and subtle underlying features in accelerometer and gyroscope data. A novel
method to classify a lifting dataset using a 2D convolutional neural network
(CNN) and no manual feature extraction is proposed in this paper; the dataset
consisted of 10 subjects lifting at various relative distances from the body
with 720 total trials. The proposed deep CNN displayed greater accuracy (90.6%)
compared to an alternative CNN and multilayer perceptron (MLP). A deep CNN
could be adapted to classify many other activities that traditionally pose
greater challenges in industrial environments due to their size and complexity.

Title: Predicting Real-Time Locational Marginal Prices: A GAN-Based Video
  Prediction Approach
Authors: Zhongxia Zhang, Meng Wu
Categories: cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we propose an unsupervised data-driven approach to predict
real-time locational marginal prices (RTLMPs). The proposed approach is built
upon a general data structure for organizing system-wide heterogeneous market
data streams into the format of market data images and videos. Leveraging this
general data structure, the system-wide RTLMP prediction problem is formulated
as a video prediction problem. A video prediction model based on generative
adversarial networks (GAN) is proposed to learn the spatio-temporal
correlations among historical RTLMPs and predict system-wide RTLMPs for the
next hour. An autoregressive moving average (ARMA) calibration method is
adopted to improve the prediction accuracy. The proposed RTLMP prediction
method takes public market data as inputs, without requiring any confidential
information on system topology, model parameters, or market operating details.
Case studies using public market data from ISO New England (ISO-NE) and
Southwest Power Pool (SPP) demonstrate that the proposed method is able to
learn spatio-temporal correlations among RTLMPs and perform accurate RTLMP
prediction.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning with Smooth Policy
Authors: Qianli Shen, Yan Li, Haoming Jiang, Zhaoran Wang, Tuo Zhao
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in modern reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms with great empirical successes in various domains.
However, the large search space of training a neural network requires a
significant amount of data, which makes the current RL algorithms not sample
efficient. Motivated by the fact that many environments with continuous state
space have smooth transitions, we propose to learn a smooth policy that behaves
smoothly with respect to states. In contrast to policies parameterized by
linear/reproducing kernel functions, where simple regularization techniques
suffice to control smoothness, for neural network based reinforcement learning
algorithms, there is no readily available solution to learn a smooth policy. In
this paper, we develop a new training framework --- $\textbf{S}$mooth
$\textbf{R}$egularized $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning
($\textbf{SR}^2\textbf{L}$), where the policy is trained with
smoothness-inducing regularization. Such regularization effectively constrains
the search space of the learning algorithms and enforces smoothness in the
learned policy. We apply the proposed framework to both on-policy (TRPO) and
off-policy algorithm (DDPG). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
our method achieves improved sample efficiency.

Title: Adversarial Continual Learning

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Continual learning aims to learn new tasks without forgetting previously
learned ones. We hypothesize that representations learned to solve each task in
a sequence have a shared structure while containing some task-specific
properties. We show that shared features are significantly less prone to
forgetting and propose a novel hybrid continual learning framework that learns
a disjoint representation for task-invariant and task-specific features
required to solve a sequence of tasks. Our model combines architecture growth
to prevent forgetting of task-specific skills and an experience replay approach
to preserve shared skills. We demonstrate our hybrid approach is effective in
avoiding forgetting and show it is superior to both architecture-based and
memory-based approaches on class incrementally learning of a single dataset as
well as a sequence of multiple datasets in image classification. Our code is
available at

Title: Black-box Methods for Restoring Monotonicity
Authors: Evangelia Gergatsouli, Brendan Lucier, Christos Tzamos
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In many practical applications, heuristic or approximation algorithms are
used to efficiently solve the task at hand. However their solutions frequently
do not satisfy natural monotonicity properties of optimal solutions. In this
work we develop algorithms that are able to restore monotonicity in the
parameters of interest. Specifically, given oracle access to a (possibly
non-monotone) multi-dimensional real-valued function $f$, we provide an
algorithm that restores monotonicity while degrading the expected value of the
function by at most $\varepsilon$. The number of queries required is at most
logarithmic in $1/\varepsilon$ and exponential in the number of parameters. We
also give a lower bound showing that this exponential dependence is necessary.
Finally, we obtain improved query complexity bounds for restoring the weaker
property of $k$-marginal monotonicity. Under this property, every
$k$-dimensional projection of the function $f$ is required to be monotone. The
query complexity we obtain only scales exponentially with $k$.

\\
  We design adaptive controller (learning rule) for a networked control system
(NCS) in which data packets containing control information are transmitted
across a lossy wireless channel. We propose Upper Confidence Bounds for
Networked Control Systems (UCB-NCS), a learning rule that maintains confidence
intervals for the estimates of plant parameters $(A_{(\star)},B_{(\star)})$,
and channel reliability $p_{(\star)}$, and utilizes the principle of optimism
in the face of uncertainty while making control decisions. We provide
non-asymptotic performance guarantees for UCB-NCS by analyzing its "regret",
i.e., performance gap from the scenario when
$(A_{(\star)},B_{(\star)},p_{(\star)})$ are known to the controller. We show
that with a high probability the regret can be upper-bounded as
$\tilde{O}\left(C\sqrt{T}\right)$\footnote{Here $\tilde{O}$ hides logarithmic
factors.}, where $T$ is the operating time horizon of the system, and $C$ is a
problem dependent constant.

Title: Dynamic Sampling and Selective Masking for Communication-Efficient
  Federated Learning
Authors: Shaoxiong Ji and Wenqi Jiang and Anwar Walid and Xue Li
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 15 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Federated learning (FL) is a novel machine learning setting which enables
on-device intelligence via decentralized training and federated optimization.
The rapid development of deep neural networks facilitates the learning
techniques for modeling complex problems and emerges into federated deep
learning under the federated setting. However, the tremendous amount of model
parameters burdens the communication network with a high load of
transportation. This paper introduces two approaches for improving
communication efficiency by dynamic sampling and top-$k$ selective masking. The
former controls the fraction of selected client models dynamically, while the
latter selects parameters with top-$k$ largest values of difference for
federated updating. Experiments on convolutional image classification and
recurrent language modeling are conducted on three public datasets to show the
effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Authors: Dingcheng Yang, Wenjian Yu, Ao Zhou, Haoyuan Mu, Gary Yao, Xiaoyi Wang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 7pages, 4 figures
\\
  In this work, we propose an effective scheme (called DP-Net) for compressing
the deep neural networks (DNNs). It includes a novel dynamic programming (DP)
based algorithm to obtain the optimal solution of weight quantization and an
optimization process to train a clustering-friendly DNN. Experiments showed
that the DP-Net allows larger compression than the state-of-the-art
counterparts while preserving accuracy. The largest 77X compression ratio on
Wide ResNet is achieved by combining DP-Net with other compression techniques.
Furthermore, the DP-Net is extended for compressing a robust DNN model with
negligible accuracy loss. At last, a custom accelerator is designed on FPGA to
speed up the inference computation with DP-Net.

Title: A Flexible Framework for Large Graph Learning
Authors: Dalong Yang, Chuan Chen, Youhao Zheng and Zibin Zheng
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has shown strong effectiveness in graph
learning tasks. However, GCN faces challenges in flexibility due to the fact of
requiring the full graph Laplacian available in the training phase. Moreover,
with the depth of layers increases, the computational and memory cost of GCN
grows explosively on account of the recursive neighborhood expansion, which
leads to a limitation in processing large graphs. To tackle these issues, we
take advantage of image processing in agility and present Node2Img, a flexible
architecture for large-scale graph learning. Node2Img maps the nodes to
"images" (i.e. grid-like data in Euclidean space) which can be the inputs of
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Instead of leveraging the fixed whole
network as a batch to train the model, Node2Img supports a more efficacious
framework in practice, where the batch size can be set elastically and the data
in the same batch can be calculated parallelly. Specifically, by ranking each
node's influence through degree, Node2Img selects the most influential
first-order as well as second-order neighbors with central node fusion
information to construct the grid-like data. For further improving the
efficiency of downstream tasks, a simple CNN-based neural network is employed
to capture the significant information from the Euclidean grids. Additionally,
the attention mechanism is implemented, which enables implicitly specifying the
different weights for neighboring nodes with different influences. Extensive
experiments on real graphs' transductive and inductive learning tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Node2Img model against the
state-of-the-art GCN-based approaches.

Title: NeuCrowd: Neural Sampling Network for Representation Learning with
  Crowdsourced Labels
Authors: Yang Hao, Wenbiao Ding, Zitao Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Representation learning approaches require a massive amount of discriminative
training data, which is unavailable in many scenarios, such as healthcare,
small city, education, etc. In practice, people refer to crowdsourcing to get
annotated labels. However, due to issues like data privacy, budget limitation,
shortage of domain-specific annotators, the number of crowdsourced labels are
still very limited. Moreover, because of annotators' diverse expertises,
crowdsourced labels are often inconsistent. Thus, directly applying existing
representation learning algorithms may easily get the overfitting problem and
yield suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \emph{NeuCrowd}, a
unified framework for representation learning from crowdsourced labels. The
proposed framework (1) creates a sufficient number of high-quality
\emph{n}-tuplet training samples by utilizing safety-aware sampling and robust
anchor generation; and (2) automatically learns a neural sampling network that
adaptively learns to select effective samples for representation learning
network. The proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world
data sets. The results show that our approach outperforms a wide range of
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and AUC\footnote{To
encourage the reproducible results, we make our code public on a github

  We review the current literature concerned with information plane analyses of

and the claim that information-theoretic compression is causally linked to
generalization are plausible, empirical evidence was found to be both
supporting and conflicting. We review this evidence together with a detailed
analysis how the respective information quantities were estimated. Our analysis
suggests that compression visualized in information planes is not
information-theoretic, but is rather compatible with geometric compression of
the activations.

Title: Accelerating Deep Reinforcement Learning With the Aid of a Partial
  Model: Power-Efficient Predictive Video Streaming
Authors: Dong Liu, Jianyu Zhao, Chenyang Yang, Lajos Hanzo
Categories: cs.LG cs.NI eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  Predictive power allocation is conceived for power-efficient video streaming
over mobile networks using deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to minimize
the accumulated energy consumption over a complete video streaming session for
a mobile user under the quality of service constraint that avoids video
playback interruptions. To handle the continuous state and action spaces, we
resort to deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for solving the
formulated problem. In contrast to previous predictive resource policies that
first predict future information with historical data and then optimize the
policy based on the predicted information, the proposed policy operates in an
on-line and end-to-end manner. By judiciously designing the action and state
that only depend on slowly-varying average channel gains, the signaling
overhead between the edge server and the base stations can be reduced, and the
dynamics of the system can be learned effortlessly. To improve the robustness
of streaming and accelerate learning, we further exploit the partially known
dynamics of the system by integrating the concepts of safer layer,
post-decision state, and virtual experience into the basic DDPG algorithm. Our
simulation results show that the proposed policies converge to the optimal
policy derived based on perfect prediction of the future large-scale channel
gains and outperforms the first-predict-then-optimize policy in the presence of
prediction errors. By harnessing the partially known model of the system
dynamics, the convergence speed can be dramatically improved.

Title: Robust Out-of-distribution Detection in Neural Networks
Authors: Jiefeng Chen, Yixuan (Sharon) Li, Xi Wu, Yingyu Liang, Somesh Jha
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Detecting anomalous inputs is critical for safely deploying deep learning
models in the real world. Existing approaches for detecting out-of-distribution
(OOD) examples work well when evaluated on natural samples drawn from a
sufficiently different distribution than the training data distribution.
However, in this paper, we show that existing detection mechanisms can be
extremely brittle when evaluating on inputs with minimal adversarial
perturbations which don't change their semantics. Formally, we introduce a
novel and challenging problem, Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection, and
propose an algorithm that can fool existing OOD detectors by adding small
perturbations to the inputs while preserving their semantics and thus the
distributional membership. We take a first step to solve this challenge, and
propose an effective algorithm called ALOE, which performs robust training by
exposing the model to both adversarially crafted inlier and outlier examples.
Our method can be flexibly combined with, and render existing methods robust.
On common benchmark datasets, we show that ALOE substantially improves the
robustness of state-of-the-art OOD detection, with 58.4% AUROC improvement on
CIFAR-10 and 46.59% improvement on CIFAR-100. Finally, we provide theoretical
analysis for our method, underpinning the empirical results above.

Title: Understanding the Power and Limitations of Teaching with Imperfect
  Knowledge
Authors: Rati Devidze, Farnam Mansouri, Luis Haug, Yuxin Chen, Adish Singla
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Machine teaching studies the interaction between a teacher and a
student/learner where the teacher selects training examples for the learner to
learn a specific task. The typical assumption is that the teacher has perfect
knowledge of the task---this knowledge comprises knowing the desired learning
target, having the exact task representation used by the learner, and knowing
the parameters capturing the learning dynamics of the learner. Inspired by
real-world applications of machine teaching in education, we consider the
setting where teacher's knowledge is limited and noisy, and the key research
question we study is the following: When does a teacher succeed or fail in
effectively teaching a learner using its imperfect knowledge? We answer this
question by showing connections to how imperfect knowledge affects the
teacher's solution of the corresponding machine teaching problem when
constructing optimal teaching sets. Our results have important implications for
designing robust teaching algorithms for real-world applications.

Title: BoostTree and BoostForest for Ensemble Learning
Authors: Changming Zhao, Dongrui Wu, Jian Huang, Ye Yuan, and Hai-Tao Zhang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Bootstrap aggregation (Bagging) and boosting are two popular ensemble
learning approaches, which combine multiple base learners to generate a
composite learner. This article proposes BoostForest, which is an ensemble
learning approach using BoostTree as base learners and can be used for both
classification and regression. BoostTree constructs a tree by gradient
boosting, which trains a linear or nonlinear model at each node. When a new
sample comes in, BoostTree first sorts it down to a leaf, then computes the
final prediction by summing up the outputs of all models along the path from
the root node to that leaf. BoostTree achieves high randomness (diversity) by
sampling its parameters randomly from a parameter pool, and selecting a subset
of features randomly at node splitting. BoostForest further increases the
randomness by bootstrapping the training data in constructing different
BoostTrees. BoostForest is compared with four classical ensemble learning
approaches on 30 classification and regression datasets, demonstrating that it
can generate more accurate and more robust composite learners.

\\
  Automatic machine learning (\AML) is a family of techniques to automate the
process of training predictive models, aiming to both improve performance and
make machine learning more accessible. While many recent works have focused on
aspects of the machine learning pipeline like model selection, hyperparameter
tuning, and feature selection, relatively few works have focused on automatic
data augmentation. Automatic data augmentation involves finding new features
relevant to the user's predictive task with minimal ``human-in-the-loop''
involvement.
  We present \system, an end-to-end system that takes as input a dataset and a
data repository, and outputs an augmented data set such that training a
predictive model on this augmented dataset results in improved performance. Our
system has two distinct components: (1) a framework to search and join data
with the input data, based on various attributes of the input, and (2) an
efficient feature selection algorithm that prunes out noisy or irrelevant
features from the resulting join. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation
of different system components and benchmark our feature selection algorithm on
real-world datasets.

Title: Invariant Rationalization
Authors: Shiyu Chang, Yang Zhang, Mo Yu, Tommi S. Jaakkola
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Selective rationalization improves neural network interpretability by
identifying a small subset of input features -- the rationale -- that best
explains or supports the prediction. A typical rationalization criterion, i.e.
maximum mutual information (MMI), finds the rationale that maximizes the
prediction performance based only on the rationale. However, MMI can be
problematic because it picks up spurious correlations between the input
features and the output. Instead, we introduce a game-theoretic invariant
rationalization criterion where the rationales are constrained to enable the
same predictor to be optimal across different environments. We show both
theoretically and empirically that the proposed rationales can rule out
spurious correlations, generalize better to different test scenarios, and align
better with human judgments. Our data and code are available.

  We introduce deep Markov spatio-temporal factorization (DMSTF), a deep
generative model for spatio-temporal data. Like other factor analysis methods,
DMSTF approximates high-dimensional data by a product between time-dependent
weights and spatially dependent factors. These weights and factors are in turn
represented in terms of lower-dimensional latent variables that we infer using
stochastic variational inference. The innovation in DMSTF is that we
parameterize weights in terms of a deep Markovian prior, which is able to
characterize nonlinear temporal dynamics. We parameterize the corresponding
variational distribution using a bidirectional recurrent network. This results
in a flexible family of hierarchical deep generative factor analysis models
that can be extended to perform time series clustering, or perform factor
analysis in the presence of a control signal. Our experiments, which consider
simulated data, fMRI data, and traffic data, demonstrate that DMSTF outperforms
related methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and can perform forecasting
in a variety domains with nonlinear temporal transitions.

Title: Deep Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique
Authors: Hadi Mansourifar, Weidong Shi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is the most popular
over-sampling method. However, its random nature makes the synthesized data and
even imbalanced classification results unstable. It means that in case of
running SMOTE n different times, n different synthesized in-stances are
obtained with n different classification results. To address this problem, we
adapt the SMOTE idea in deep learning architecture. In this method, a deep
neural network regression model is used to train the inputs and outputs of
traditional SMOTE. Inputs of the proposed deep regression model are two
randomly chosen data points which are concatenated to form a double size
vector. The outputs of this model are corresponding randomly interpolated data
points between two randomly chosen vectors with original dimension. The
experimental results show that, Deep SMOTE can outperform traditional SMOTE in
terms of precision, F1 score and Area Under Curve (AUC) in majority of test
cases.

Title: Optimal No-regret Learning in Repeated First-price Auctions
Authors: Yanjun Han, Zhengyuan Zhou, Tsachy Weissman
Categories: cs.LG cs.GT cs.IT math.IT stat.ME stat.ML
\\
  We study online learning in repeated first-price auctions with censored
feedback, where a bidder, only observing the winning bid at the end of each
auction, learns to adaptively bid in order to maximize her cumulative payoff.
To achieve this goal, the bidder faces a challenging dilemma: if she wins the
bid--the only way to achieve positive payoffs--then she is not able to observe
the highest bid of the other bidders, which we assume is iid drawn from an
unknown distribution. This dilemma, despite being reminiscent of the
exploration-exploitation trade-off in contextual bandits, cannot directly be
addressed by the existing UCB or Thompson sampling algorithms in that
literature, mainly because contrary to the standard bandits setting, when a
positive reward is obtained here, nothing about the environment can be learned.
  In this paper, by exploiting the structural properties of first-price
auctions, we develop the first learning algorithm that achieves
$O(\sqrt{T}\log^2 T)$ regret bound when the bidder's private values are
stochastically generated. We do so by providing an algorithm on a general class
of problems, which we call monotone group contextual bandits, where the same
regret bound is established under stochastically generated contexts. Further,
by a novel lower bound argument, we characterize an $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower
bound for the case where the contexts are adversarially generated, thus
highlighting the impact of the contexts generation mechanism on the fundamental
learning limit. Despite this, we further exploit the structure of first-price
auctions and develop a learning algorithm that operates sample-efficiently (and
computationally efficiently) in the presence of adversarially generated private
values. We establish an $O(\sqrt{T}\log^5 T)$ regret bound for this algorithm,
hence providing a complete characterization of optimal learning guarantees for
this problem.

\\
  One-Shot methods have evolved into one of the most popular methods in Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) due to weight sharing and single training of a
supernet. However, existing methods generally suffer from two issues:
predetermined number of channels in each layer which is suboptimal; and model
averaging effects and poor ranking correlation caused by weight coupling and
continuously expanding search space. To explicitly address these issues, in
this paper, a Broadening-and-Shrinking One-Shot NAS (BS-NAS) framework is
proposed, in which `broadening' refers to broadening the search space with a
spring block enabling search for numbers of channels during training of the
supernet; while `shrinking' refers to a novel shrinking strategy gradually
turning off those underperforming operations. The above innovations broaden the
search space for wider representation and then shrink it by gradually removing
underperforming operations, followed by an evolutionary algorithm to
efficiently search for the optimal architecture. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed BS-NAS as well as the
state-of-the-art performance.

Title: Tune smarter not harder: A principled approach to tuning learning rates
  for shallow nets
Authors: Thulasi Tholeti, Sheetal Kalyani
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  Effective hyper-parameter tuning is essential to guarantee the performance
that neural networks have come to be known for. In this work, a principled
approach to choosing the learning rate is proposed for shallow feedforward
neural networks. We associate the learning rate with the gradient Lipschitz
constant of the objective to be minimized while training. An upper bound on the
mentioned constant is derived and a search algorithm, which always results in
non-divergent traces, is proposed to exploit the derived bound. It is shown
through simulations that the proposed search method significantly outperforms
the existing tuning methods such as Tree Parzen Estimators (TPE). The proposed
method is applied to two different existing applications, namely, channel
estimation in a wireless communication system and prediction of the exchange
currency rates, and it is shown to pick better learning rates than the existing
methods using the same or lesser compute power.

Title: TanhExp: A Smooth Activation Function with High Convergence Speed for
  Lightweight Neural Networks
Authors: Xinyu Liu, Xiaoguang Di
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE
Comments: 7 pages, 14 figures, submitted to IET Computer Vision
\\
  Lightweight or mobile neural networks used for real-time computer vision
tasks contain fewer parameters than normal networks, which lead to a
constrained performance. In this work, we proposed a novel activation function
named Tanh Exponential Activation Function (TanhExp) which can improve the
performance for these networks on image classification task significantly. The
definition of TanhExp is f(x) = xtanh(e^x). We demonstrate the simplicity,
efficiency, and robustness of TanhExp on various datasets and network models
and TanhExp outperforms its counterparts in both convergence speed and
accuracy. Its behaviour also remains stable even with noise added and dataset
altered. We show that without increasing the size of the network, the capacity
of lightweight neural networks can be enhanced by TanhExp with only a few
training epochs and no extra parameters added.

Title: Multi-target regression via output space quantization

\\
  Multi-target regression is concerned with the prediction of multiple
continuous target variables using a shared set of predictors. Two key
challenges in multi-target regression are: (a) modelling target dependencies
and (b) scalability to large output spaces. In this paper, a new multi-target
regression method is proposed that tries to jointly address these challenges
via a novel problem transformation approach. The proposed method, called MRQ,
is based on the idea of quantizing the output space in order to transform the
multiple continuous targets into one or more discrete ones. Learning on the
transformed output space naturally enables modeling of target dependencies
while the quantization strategy can be flexibly parameterized to control the
trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments
on a large collection of benchmark datasets show that MRQ is both highly
scalable and also competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy.
In particular, an ensemble version of MRQ obtains the best overall accuracy,
while being an order of magnitude faster than the runner up method.

Title: Continual Graph Learning

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently received significant research
attention due to their prominent performance on a variety of graph-related
learning tasks. Most of the existing works focus on either static or dynamic
graph settings, addressing a particular task, e.g., node/graph classification,
link prediction. In this work, we investigate the question: can GNNs be applied
to continuously learning a sequence of tasks? Towards that, we explore the
Continual Graph Learning (CGL) paradigm and we present the Experience Replay
based framework ER-GNN for CGL to address the catastrophic forgetting problem
in existing GNNs. ER-GNN stores knowledge from previous tasks as experiences
and replays them when learning new tasks to mitigate the forgetting issue. We
propose three experience node selection strategies: mean of features, coverage
maximization and influence maximization, to guide the process of selecting
experience nodes. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of ER-GNN and shed light on the incremental (non-Euclidean)
graph structure learning.

  Generalized from image and language translation, graph translation aims to
generate a graph in the target domain by conditioning an input graph in the
source domain. This promising topic has attracted fast-increasing attention
recently. Existing works are limited to either merely predicting the node
attributes of graphs with fixed topology or predicting only the graph topology
without considering node attributes, but cannot simultaneously predict both of
them, due to substantial challenges: 1) difficulty in characterizing the
interactive, iterative, and asynchronous translation process of both nodes and
edges and 2) difficulty in discovering and maintaining the inherent consistency
between the node and edge in predicted graphs. These challenges prevent a
generic, end-to-end framework for joint node and edge attributes prediction,
which is a need for real-world applications such as malware confinement in IoT
networks and structural-to-functional network translation. These real-world
applications highly depend on hand-crafting and ad-hoc heuristic models, but
cannot sufficiently utilize massive historical data. In this paper, we termed
this generic problem "multi-attributed graph translation" and developed a novel
framework integrating both node and edge translations seamlessly. The novel
edge translation path is generic, which is proven to be a generalization of the
existing topology translation models. Then, a spectral graph regularization
based on our non-parametric graph Laplacian is proposed in order to learn and
maintain the consistency of the predicted nodes and edges. Finally, extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world application data demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Improving Calibration in Mixup-trained Deep Neural Networks through
  Confidence-Based Loss Functions
Authors: Juan Maro\~nas and Daniel Ramos and Roberto Paredes
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Deep Neural Networks (DNN) represent the state of the art in many tasks.
However, due to their overparameterization, their generalization capabilities
are in doubt and are still under study. Consequently, DNN can overfit and
assign overconfident predictions, as they tend to learn highly oscillating
decision thresholds. This has been shown to affect the calibration of the
confidences assigned to unseen data. Data Augmentation (DA) strategies have
been proposed to overcome some of these limitations. One of the most popular is
Mixup, which has shown a great ability to improve the accuracy of these models.
Recent work has provided evidence that Mixup also improves the uncertainty
quantification and calibration of DNN. In this work, we argue and provide
empirical evidence that, due to its fundamentals, Mixup does not necessarily
improve calibration. Based on our observations we propose a new loss function
that improves the calibration, and also sometimes the accuracy. Our loss is
inspired by Bayes decision theory and introduces a new training framework for
designing losses for probabilistic modelling. We provide state-of-the-art
accuracy with consistent improvements in calibration performance.

\\
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) show promise in breast cancer screening, but
their robustness to input perturbations must be better understood before they
can be clinically implemented. There exists extensive literature on this
subject in the context of natural images that can potentially be built upon.
However, it cannot be assumed that conclusions about robustness will transfer
from natural images to mammogram images, due to significant differences between
the two image modalities. In order to determine whether conclusions will
transfer, we measure the sensitivity of a radiologist-level screening mammogram
image classifier to four commonly studied input perturbations that natural
image classifiers are sensitive to. We find that mammogram image classifiers
are also sensitive to these perturbations, which suggests that we can build on
the existing literature. We also perform a detailed analysis on the effects of
low-pass filtering, and find that it degrades the visibility of clinically
meaningful features called microcalcifications. Since low-pass filtering
removes semantically meaningful information that is predictive of breast
cancer, we argue that it is undesirable for mammogram image classifiers to be
invariant to it. This is in contrast to natural images, where we do not want
DNNs to be sensitive to low-pass filtering due to its tendency to remove
information that is human-incomprehensible.

Title: Absolute Shapley Value
Authors: Jinfei Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.DB stat.ML
\\
  Shapley value is a concept in cooperative game theory for measuring the
contribution of each participant, which was named in honor of Lloyd Shapley.
Shapley value has been recently applied in data marketplaces for compensation
allocation based on their contribution to the models. Shapley value is the only
value division scheme used for compensation allocation that meets three
desirable criteria: group rationality, fairness, and additivity. In cooperative
game theory, the marginal contribution of each contributor to each coalition is
a nonnegative value. However, in machine learning model training, the marginal
contribution of each contributor (data tuple) to each coalition (a set of data
tuples) can be a negative value, i.e., the accuracy of the model trained by a
dataset with an additional data tuple can be lower than the accuracy of the
model trained by the dataset only.
  In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to handle the negative
marginal contribution when computing Shapley value. We explore three
philosophies: 1) taking the original value (Original Shapley Value); 2) taking
the larger of the original value and zero (Zero Shapley Value); and 3) taking
the absolute value of the original value (Absolute Shapley Value). Experiments
on Iris dataset demonstrate that the definition of Absolute Shapley Value
significantly outperforms the other two definitions in terms of evaluating data
importance (the contribution of each data tuple to the trained model).

Title: Algorithms for Non-Stationary Generalized Linear Bandits
Authors: Yoan Russac (DI-ENS), Olivier Capp\'e (DI-ENS), Aur\'elien Garivier
  (UMPA-ENSL)
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The statistical framework of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) can be applied
to sequential problems involving categorical or ordinal rewards associated, for
instance, with clicks, likes or ratings. In the example of binary rewards,
logistic regression is well-known to be preferable to the use of standard
linear modeling. Previous works have shown how to deal with GLMs in contextual
online learning with bandit feedback when the environment is assumed to be
stationary. In this paper, we relax this latter assumption and propose two
upper confidence bound based algorithms that make use of either a sliding
window or a discounted maximum-likelihood estimator. We provide theoretical
guarantees on the behavior of these algorithms for general context sequences
and in the presence of abrupt changes. These results take the form of high
probability upper bounds for the dynamic regret that are of order d^2/3 G^1/3
T^2/3 , where d, T and G are respectively the dimension of the unknown
parameter, the number of rounds and the number of breakpoints up to time T. The
empirical performance of the algorithms is illustrated in simulated
environments.

Title: RobustGCNs: Robust Norm Graph Convolutional Networks in the Presence of
  Node Missing Data and Large Noises
Authors: Bo Jiang and Ziyan Zhang
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely studied for attribute
graph data representation and learning. In many applications, graph node
attribute/feature may contain various kinds of noises, such as gross
corruption, outliers and missing values. Existing graph convolutions (GCs)
generally focus on feature propagation on structured graph which i) fail to
address the graph data with missing values and ii) often perform susceptibility
to the large feature errors/noises and outliers. To address this issue, in this
paper, we propose to incorporate robust norm feature learning mechanism into
graph convolution and present Robust Graph Convolutions (RGCs) for graph data
in the presence of feature noises and missing values. Our RGCs is proposed
based on the interpretation of GCs from a propagation function aspect of 'data
reconstruction on graph'. Based on it, we then derive our RGCs by exploiting
robust norm based propagation functions into GCs. Finally, we incorporate the
derived RGCs into an end-to-end network architecture and propose a kind of
RobustGCNs for graph data learning. Experimental results on several noisy
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
RobustGCNs.

  Machine learning is driving development across many fields in science and
engineering. A simple and efficient programming language could accelerate
applications of machine learning in various fields. Currently, the programming
languages most commonly used to develop machine learning algorithms include
Python, MATLAB, and C/C ++. However, none of these languages well balance both
efficiency and simplicity. The Julia language is a fast, easy-to-use, and
open-source programming language that was originally designed for
high-performance computing, which can well balance the efficiency and
simplicity. This paper summarizes the related research work and developments in
the application of the Julia language in machine learning. It first surveys the
popular machine learning algorithms that are developed in the Julia language.
Then, it investigates applications of the machine learning algorithms
implemented with the Julia language. Finally, it discusses the open issues and
the potential future directions that arise in the use of the Julia language in
machine learning.

Title: Learned Weight Sharing for Deep Multi-Task Learning by Natural Evolution
  Strategy and Stochastic Gradient Descent
Authors: Jonas Prellberg, Oliver Kramer
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted at IJCNN 2020
\\
  In deep multi-task learning, weights of task-specific networks are shared
between tasks to improve performance on each single one. Since the question,
which weights to share between layers, is difficult to answer, human-designed
architectures often share everything but a last task-specific layer. In many
cases, this simplistic approach severely limits performance. Instead, we
propose an algorithm to learn the assignment between a shared set of weights
and task-specific layers. To optimize the non-differentiable assignment and at
the same time train the differentiable weights, learning takes place via a
combination of natural evolution strategy and stochastic gradient descent. The
end result are task-specific networks that share weights but allow independent
inference. They achieve lower test errors than baselines and methods from
literature on three multi-task learning datasets.

Title: Depth Enables Long-Term Memory for Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Alon Ziv
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: This document is an extension of arXiv:1710.09431 in the form of a
  Master's thesis
\\
  A key attribute that drives the unprecedented success of modern Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) on learning tasks which involve sequential data, is
their ability to model intricate long-term temporal dependencies. However, a
well established measure of RNNs long-term memory capacity is lacking, and thus
formal understanding of the effect of depth on their ability to correlate data
throughout time is limited. Specifically, existing depth efficiency results on
convolutional networks do not suffice in order to account for the success of
deep RNNs on data of varying lengths. In order to address this, we introduce a
measure of the network's ability to support information flow across time,
referred to as the Start-End separation rank, which reflects the distance of
the function realized by the recurrent network from modeling no dependency
between the beginning and end of the input sequence. We prove that deep
recurrent networks support Start-End separation ranks which are combinatorially
higher than those supported by their shallow counterparts. Thus, we establish
that depth brings forth an overwhelming advantage in the ability of recurrent
networks to model long-term dependencies, and provide an exemplar of
quantifying this key attribute. We empirically demonstrate the discussed
phenomena on common RNNs through extensive experimental evaluation using the
optimization technique of restricting the hidden-to-hidden matrix to being
orthogonal. Finally, we employ the tool of quantum Tensor Networks to gain
additional graphic insights regarding the complexity brought forth by depth in
recurrent networks.

\\
  One major impediment to the wider use of deep learning for clinical decision
making is the difficulty of assigning a level of confidence to model
predictions. Currently, deep Bayesian neural networks and sparse Gaussian
processes are the main two scalable uncertainty estimation methods. However,
deep Bayesian neural network suffers from lack of expressiveness, and more
expressive models such as deep kernel learning, which is an extension of sparse
Gaussian process, captures only the uncertainty from the higher level latent
space. Therefore, the deep learning model under it lacks interpretability and
ignores uncertainty from the raw data. In this paper, we merge features of the
deep Bayesian learning framework with deep kernel learning to leverage the
strengths of both methods for more comprehensive uncertainty estimation.
Through a series of experiments on predicting the first incidence of heart
failure, diabetes and depression applied to large-scale electronic medical
records, we demonstrate that our method is better at capturing uncertainty than
both Gaussian processes and deep Bayesian neural networks in terms of
indicating data insufficiency and distinguishing true positive and false
positive predictions, with a comparable generalisation performance.
Furthermore, by assessing the accuracy and area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve over the predictive probability, we show that our method
is less susceptible to making overconfident predictions, especially for the
minority class in imbalanced datasets. Finally, we demonstrate how uncertainty
information derived by the model can inform risk factor analysis towards model
interpretability.

Title: Do recent advancements in model-based deep reinforcement learning really

\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen great advancements in the past few
years. Nevertheless, the consensus among the RL community is that currently
used model-free methods, despite all their benefits, suffer from extreme data
inefficiency. To circumvent this problem, novel model-based approaches were
introduced that often claim to be much more efficient than their model-free
counterparts. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art
model-free Rainbow DQN algorithm can be trained using a much smaller number of
samples than it is commonly reported. By simply allowing the algorithm to
execute network updates more frequently we manage to reach similar or better
results than existing model-based techniques, at a fraction of complexity and
computational costs. Furthermore, based on the outcomes of the study, we argue
that the agent similar to the modified Rainbow DQN that is presented in this
paper should be used as a baseline for any future work aimed at improving
sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning.

Comments: 34 pages, 14 figures
\\
  For a linear system, the response to a stimulus is often superposed by its
responses to other decomposed stimuli. In quantum mechanics, a state is the
superposition of multiple eigenstates. Here, we propose eigen component
analysis (ECA), an interpretable linear learning model that incorporates the
principle of quantum mechanics into the design of algorithms capable of feature
extraction, classification, dictionary and deep learning, and adversarial
generation, etc. The simulation of ECA, possessing a measurable
$class\text{-}label$ $\mathcal{H}$, on a classical computer outperforms the
existing classical linear models. An enhanced eigen component analysis network
(ECAN), a network of concatenated ECA models, gains the potential to be not
only integrated with nonlinear models, but also an interface for deep neural
networks to implement on a quantum computer, by analogizing a data set as
recordings of quantum states. Therefore, ECA and its derivatives contribute to
expanding the feasibility of linear learning models, by adopting the strategy
of quantum machine learning to replace heavy nonlinear models with succinct
linear operations in tackling complexity.

  For many applications, such as computing the expected value of different
magnitudes, sampling from a known probability density function, the target
density, is crucial but challenging through the inverse transform. In these
cases, rejection and importance sampling require suitable proposal densities,
which can be evaluated and sampled from efficiently. We will present a method
based on normalizing flows, proposing a solution for the common problem of
exploding reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence due to the target density having
values of 0 in regions of the flow transformation. The performance of the

of the most critical steps for trajectory data mining is segmentation. This
task can be seen as a pre-processing step in which a trajectory is divided into
several meaningful consecutive sub-sequences. This process is necessary because
trajectory patterns may not hold in the entire trajectory but on trajectory
parts. In this work, we propose a supervised trajectory segmentation algorithm,
called Wise Sliding Window Segmentation (WS-II). It processes the trajectory
coordinates to find behavioral changes in space and time, generating an error
signal that is further used to train a binary classifier for segmenting
trajectory data. This algorithm is flexible and can be used in different
domains. We evaluate our method over three real datasets from different domains
(meteorology, fishing, and individuals movements), and compare it with four
other trajectory segmentation algorithms: OWS, GRASP-UTS, CB-SMoT, and SPD. We
observed that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest performance for all
datasets with statistically significant differences in terms of the harmonic
mean of purity and coverage.

Title: Using Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods for Autonomous Vessels in 2D
  Environments

\\
  Unmanned Surface Vehicles technology (USVs) is an exciting topic that
essentially deploys an algorithm to safely and efficiently performs a mission.
Although reinforcement learning is a well-known approach to modeling such a
task, instability and divergence may occur when combining off-policy and
function approximation. In this work, we used deep reinforcement learning
combining Q-learning with a neural representation to avoid instability. Our
methodology uses deep q-learning and combines it with a rolling wave planning
approach on agile methodology. Our method contains two critical parts in order
to perform missions in an unknown environment. The first is a path planner that
is responsible for generating a potential effective path to a destination
without considering the details of the root. The latter is a decision-making
module that is responsible for short-term decisions on avoiding obstacles
during the near future steps of USV exploitation within the context of the
value function. Simulations were performed using two algorithms: a basic
vanilla vessel navigator (VVN) as a baseline and an improved one for the vessel
navigator with a planner and local view (VNPLV). Experimental results show that
the proposed method enhanced the performance of VVN by 55.31 on average for
long-distance missions. Our model successfully demonstrated obstacle avoidance
by means of deep reinforcement learning using planning adaptive paths in
unknown environments.

Title: Graph Neural Networks for Decentralized Controllers
Authors: Fernando Gama, Ekaterina Tolstaya, Alejandro Ribeiro
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML
\\
  Dynamical systems comprised of autonomous agents arise in many relevant
problems such as multi-agent robotics, smart grids, or smart cities.
Controlling these systems is of paramount importance to guarantee a successful
deployment. Optimal centralized controllers are readily available but face
limitations in terms of scalability and practical implementation. Optimal
decentralized controllers, on the other hand, are difficult to find. In this
paper, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn decentralized controllers
from data. GNNs are well-suited for the task since they are naturally
distributed architectures. Furthermore, they are equivariant and stable,
leading to good scalability and transferability properties. The problem of
flocking is explored to illustrate the power of GNNs in learning decentralized
controllers.

Title: Diffusion-based Deep Active Learning
Authors: Dan Kushnir, Luca Venturi
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The remarkable performance of deep neural networks depends on the
availability of massive labeled data. To alleviate the load of data annotation,
active deep learning aims to select a minimal set of training points to be
labelled which yields maximal model accuracy. Most existing approaches
implement either an `exploration'-type selection criterion, which aims at
exploring the joint distribution of data and labels, or a `refinement'-type
criterion which aims at localizing the detected decision boundaries. We propose
a versatile and efficient criterion that automatically switches from
exploration to refinement when the distribution has been sufficiently mapped.
Our criterion relies on a process of diffusing the existing label information
over a graph constructed from the hidden representation of the data set as
provided by the neural network. This graph representation captures the
intrinsic geometry of the approximated labeling function. The diffusion-based
criterion is shown to be advantageous as it outperforms existing criteria for
deep active learning.

Title: Incorporating Relational Background Knowledge into Reinforcement
  Learning via Differentiable Inductive Logic Programming
Authors: Ali Payani and Faramarz Fekri
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Relational Reinforcement Learning (RRL) can offers various desirable
features. Most importantly, it allows for incorporating expert knowledge into
the learning, and hence leading to much faster learning and better
generalization compared to the standard deep reinforcement learning. However,
most of the existing RRL approaches are either incapable of incorporating
expert background knowledge (e.g., in the form of explicit predicate language)
or are not able to learn directly from non-relational data such as image. In
this paper, we propose a novel deep RRL based on a differentiable Inductive
Logic Programming (ILP) that can effectively learn relational information from
image and present the state of the environment as first order logic predicates.
Additionally, it can take the expert background knowledge and incorporate it
into the learning problem using appropriate predicates. The differentiable ILP
allows an end to end optimization of the entire framework for learning the
policy in RRL. We show the efficacy of this novel RRL framework using
environments such as BoxWorld, GridWorld as well as relational reasoning for
the Sort-of-CLEVR dataset.

Title: Steepest Descent Neural Architecture Optimization: Escaping Local
  Optimum with Signed Neural Splitting
Authors: Lemeng Wu, Mao Ye, Qi Lei, Jason D. Lee, Qiang Liu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose signed splitting steepest descent (S3D), which progressively grows
neural architectures by splitting critical neurons into multiple copies,
following a theoretically-derived optimal scheme. Our algorithm is a
generalization of the splitting steepest descent (S2D) of Liu et al. (2019b),
but significantly improves over it by incorporating a rich set of new splitting
schemes that allow negative output weights. By doing so, we can escape local
optima that the original S2D can not escape. Theoretically, we show that our
method provably learns neural networks with much smaller sizes than these
needed for standard gradient descent in overparameterized regimes. Empirically,
our method outperforms S2D and prior arts on various challenging benchmarks,
including CIFAR-100, ImageNet and ModelNet40.

\\
  Despite the fact that the loss functions of deep neural networks are highly
non-convex, gradient-based optimization algorithms converge to approximately
the same performance from many random initial points. One thread of work has
focused on explaining this phenomenon by characterizing the local curvature
near critical points of the loss function, where the gradients are near zero,
and demonstrating that neural network losses enjoy a no-bad-local-minima
property and an abundance of saddle points. We report here that the methods
used to find these putative critical points suffer from a bad local minima
problem of their own: they often converge to or pass through regions where the
gradient norm has a stationary point. We call these gradient-flat regions,
since they arise when the gradient is approximately in the kernel of the
Hessian, such that the loss is locally approximately linear, or flat, in the
direction of the gradient. We describe how the presence of these regions
necessitates care in both interpreting past results that claimed to find
critical points of neural network losses and in designing second-order methods
for optimizing neural networks.

\\
  Decentralized stochastic optimization methods have gained a lot of attention
recently, mainly because of their cheap per iteration cost, data locality, and
their communication-efficiency. In this paper we introduce a unified
convergence analysis that covers a large variety of decentralized SGD methods
which so far have required different intuitions, have different applications,
and which have been developed separately in various communities.
  Our algorithmic framework covers local SGD updates and synchronous and
pairwise gossip updates on adaptive network topology. We derive universal
convergence rates for smooth (convex and non-convex) problems and the rates
interpolate between the heterogeneous (non-identically distributed data) and
iid-data settings, recovering linear convergence rates in many special cases,
for instance for over-parametrized models. Our proofs rely on weak assumptions
(typically improving over prior work in several aspects) and recover (and
improve) the best known complexity results for a host of important scenarios,
such as for instance coorperative SGD and federated averaging (local SGD).

\\
  In multi-agent games, the complexity of the environment can grow
exponentially as the number of agents increases, so it is particularly
challenging to learn good policies when the agent population is large. In this
paper, we introduce Evolutionary Population Curriculum (EPC), a curriculum
learning paradigm that scales up Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by
progressively increasing the population of training agents in a stage-wise
manner. Furthermore, EPC uses an evolutionary approach to fix an objective
misalignment issue throughout the curriculum: agents successfully trained in an
early stage with a small population are not necessarily the best candidates for
adapting to later stages with scaled populations. Concretely, EPC maintains
multiple sets of agents in each stage, performs mix-and-match and fine-tuning
over these sets and promotes the sets of agents with the best adaptability to
the next stage. We implement EPC on a popular MARL algorithm, MADDPG, and
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines by a
large margin as the number of agents grows exponentially.

  Relational structures are emerging as ubiquitous mathematical machinery in
the semantics of open systems of various kinds. Cartesian bicategories are a
well-known categorical algebra of relations that has proved especially useful
in recent applications. The passage between a category and its bicategory of
relations is an important question that has been widely studied for decades. We
study an alternative construction that yields a cartesian bicategory of
relations. Its behaviour is closely related to the axiom of choice, which
itself can be expressed in the language of cartesian bicategories.

Title: Temporal Conjunctive Query Answering in the Extended DL-Lite Family
Authors: Stefan Borgwardt, Veronika Thost
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  Ontology-based query answering (OBQA) augments classical query answering in
databases by domain knowledge encoded in an ontology. Systems for OBQA use the
ontological knowledge to infer new information that is not explicitly given in
the data. Moreover, they usually employ the open-world assumption, which means
that knowledge that is not stated explicitly in the data and that is not
inferred is not assumed to be true or false. Classical OBQA however considers
only a snapshot of the data, which means that information about the temporal
evolution of the data is not used for reasoning and hence lost. We investigate
temporal conjunctive queries (TCQs) that allow to access temporal data through
classical ontologies. In particular, we study combined and data complexity of
TCQ entailment for ontologies written in description logics from the extended
DL-Lite family. Many of these logics allow for efficient reasoning in the
atemporal setting and are successfully applied in practice. We show
comprehensive complexity results for temporal reasoning with these logics.

Title: Partial Quantifier Elimination By Certificate Clauses
Authors: Eugene Goldberg
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  We study a modification of the Quantifier Elimination (QE) problem called
Partial QE (PQE) for propositional CNF formulas. In PQE, only a small subset of
target clauses is taken out of the scope of quantifiers. The appeal of PQE is
that many verification problems, e.g. equivalence checking and model checking,
reduce to PQE and, intuitively, the latter should be much easier than QE. One
can perform PQE by adding a set of clauses depending only on free variables
that make the target clauses redundant. Proving redundancy of a target clause
is done by derivation of a "certificate" clause implying the former. This idea
is implemented in our PQE algorithm called START. It bears some similarity to a
SAT-solver with conflict driven learning. A major difference here is that START
backtracks when a target clause is proved redundant in the current subspace (a
conflict being just one of backtracking conditions). We experimentally evaluate
START on a practical problem. We use this problem to show that PQE can be much
easier than QE.

\\
  The algebraic properties of the combination of probabilistic choice and
nondeterministic choice have long been a research topic in program semantics.
This paper explains a formalization (the first one to the best of our
knowledge) in the Coq proof assistant of a monad equipped with both choices:
the geometrically convex monad. This formalization has an immediate
application: it provides a model for a monad that implements a non-trivial
interface which allows for proofs by equational reasoning using probabilistic
and nondeterministic effects. We explain the technical choices we made to go
from the literature to a complete Coq formalization, from which we identify
reusable theories about mathematical structures such as convex spaces and
concrete categories.

Title: Edge-assisted Viewport Adaptive Scheme for real-time Omnidirectional
  Video transmission
Authors: Tao Guo, Xikang Jiang, Bin Xiang, Lin Zhang
Categories: cs.MM
\\
  Omnidirectional applications are immersive and highly interactive, which can
improve the efficiency of remote collaborative work among factory workers. The
transmission of omnidirectional video (OV) is the most important step in
implementing virtual remote collaboration. Compared with the ordinary video
transmission, OV transmission requires more bandwidth, which is still a huge
burden even under 5G networks. The tile-based scheme can reduce bandwidth
consumption. However, it neither accurately obtain the field of view(FOV) area,
nor difficult to support real-time OV streaming. In this paper, we propose an
edge-assisted viewport adaptive scheme (EVAS-OV) to reduce bandwidth
consumption during real-time OV transmission. First, EVAS-OV uses a Gated
Recurrent Unit(GRU) model to predict users' viewport. Then, users were divided
into multicast clusters thereby further reducing the consumption of computing
resources. EVAS-OV reprojects OV frames to accurately obtain users' FOV area
from pixel level and adopt a redundant strategy to reduce the impact of
viewport prediction errors. All computing tasks were offloaded to edge servers
to reduce the transmission delay and improve bandwidth utilization.
Experimental results show that EVAS-OV can save more than 60\% of bandwidth
compared with the non-viewport adaptive scheme. Compared to a two-layer scheme
with viewport adaptive, EVAS-OV still saves 30\% of bandwidth.

MSC-class: 68U10
ACM-class: I.4.1
\\
  This short paper proposes to use the statistical analysis of the correlation
between DCT coefficients to design a new synchronization strategy that can be
used for cost-based steganographic schemes in the JPEG domain. First, an
analysis is performed on the covariance matrix of DCT coefficients of
neighboring blocks after a development similar to the one used to generate
BossBase. This analysis exhibits groups of uncorrelated coefficients: 4 groups
per block and 2 groups of uncorrelated diagonal neighbors together with groups
of mutually correlated coefficients groups of 6 coefficients per blocs and 8
coefficients between 2 adjacent blocks. Using the uncorrelated groups, an
embedding scheme can be designed using only 8 disjoint lattices. The cost map
for each lattice is updated firstly by using an implicit underlying Gaussian
distribution with a variance directly computed from the embedding costs, and
secondly by deriving conditional distributions from multivariate distributions.
The covariance matrix of these distributions takes into account both the
correlations exhibited by the analysis of the covariance matrix and the
variance derived from the cost. This synchronization scheme enables to obtain a
gain of PE of 5% at QF 95 for an embedding rate close to 0.3 bnzac coefficient
using DCTR feature sets.

\\
  The World Wide Web has become a popular source for gathering information and
news. Multimodal information, e.g., enriching text with photos, is typically
used to convey the news more effectively or to attract attention. Photo content
can range from decorative, depict additional important information, or can even
contain misleading information. Therefore, automatic approaches to quantify
cross-modal consistency of entity representation can support human assessors to
evaluate the overall multimodal message, for instance, with regard to bias or
sentiment. In some cases such measures could give hints to detect fake news,
which is an increasingly important topic in today's society. In this paper, we
introduce a novel task of cross-modal consistency verification in real-world
news and present a multimodal approach to quantify the entity coherence between
image and text. Named entity linking is applied to extract persons, locations,
and events from news texts. Several measures are suggested to calculate
cross-modal similarity for these entities using state of the art approaches. In
contrast to previous work, our system automatically gathers example data from
the Web and is applicable to real-world news. Results on two novel datasets
that cover different languages, topics, and domains demonstrate the feasibility
of our approach. Datasets and code are publicly available to foster research
towards this new direction.

  In this paper, a scalable iterative projection-type algorithm for solving
non-stationary sys-tems of linear inequalities is considered. A non-stationary
system is understood as a large-scale system of inequalities in which
coefficients and constant terms can change during the calculation process. The
proposed parallel algorithm uses the concept of pseudo-projection which
generalizes the notion of orthogonal projection. The parallel pseudo-projection
algorithm is implemented using the parallel BSF-skeleton. An analytical
esti-mation of the algorithm scalability boundary is obtained on the base of
the BSF cost met-ric. The large-scale computational experiments were performed
on a cluster computing system. The obtained results confirm the efficiency of
the proposed approach.

Title: Adaptive Numerical Simulation of a Phase-field Fracture Model in Mixed
  Form tested on an L-shaped Specimen with High Poisson Ratios
Authors: Katrin Mang, Mirjam Walloth, Thomas Wick, Winnifried Wollner
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This work presents a new adaptive approach for the numerical simulation of a
phase-field model for fractures in nearly incompressible solids. In order to
cope with locking effects, we use a recently proposed mixed form where we have
a hydro-static pressure as additional unknown besides the displacement field
and the phase-field variable. To fulfill the fracture irreversibility
constraint, we consider a formulation as a variational inequality in the
phase-field variable. For adaptive mesh refinement, we use a recently developed
residual-type a posteriori error estimator for the phase-field variational
inequality which is efficient and reliable, and robust with respect to the
phase-field regularization parameter. The proposed model and the adaptive
error-based refinement strategy are demonstrated by means of numerical tests
derived from the L-shaped panel test, originally developed for concrete. Here,
the Poisson's ratio is changed from the standard setting towards the
incompressible limit $\nu \to 0.5$.

Title: Dimensionally Consistent Preconditioning for Saddle-Point Problems
Authors: Roland Herzog
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  The preconditioned iterative solution of large-scale saddle-point systems is
of great importance in numerous application areas, many of them involving
partial differential equations. Robustness with respect to certain problem
parameters is often a concern, and it can be addressed by identifying proper
scalings of preconditioner building blocks. In this paper, we consider a new
perspective to finding effective and robust preconditioners. Our approach is
based on the consideration of the natural physical units underlying the
respective saddle-point problem. This point of view, which we refer to as
dimensional consistency, suggests a natural combination of the parameters
intrinsic to the problem. It turns out that the scaling obtained in this way
leads to robustness with respect to problem parameters in many relevant cases.
As a consequence, we advertise dimensional consistency based preconditioning as
a new and systematic way to designing parameter robust preconditoners for
saddle-point systems arising from models for physical phenomena.

shows good generalization in unmeasured regions. DEM could be easily combined

better solutions. Furthermore, the error bound and stability of DEM is

\\
  We analyze different measures for the backward error of a set of numerical
approximations for the roots of a polynomial. We focus mainly on the
element-wise mixed backward error introduced by Mastronardi and Van Dooren, and
the tropical backward error introduced by Tisseur and Van Barel. We show that
these measures are equivalent under suitable assumptions. We also show
relations between these measures and the classical element-wise and norm-wise
backward error measures.

Title: Parameter robust preconditioning for multi-compartmental Darcy equations

\\
  In this paper, we propose a new finite element solution approach to the
multi-compartmental Darcy equations describing flow and interactions in a
porous medium with multiple fluid compartments. We introduce a new numerical
formulation and a block-diagonal preconditioner. The robustness with respect to
variations in material parameters is demonstrated by theoretical considerations
and numerical examples.

Title: Parameter robust preconditioning by congruence for multiple-network

\\
  The mechanical behaviour of a poroelastic medium permeated by multiple
interacting fluid networks can be described by a system of time-dependent
partial differential equations known as the multiple-network poroelasticity
(MPET) equations or multi-porosity/multi-permeability systems. These equations
generalize Biot's equations, which describe the mechanics of the one-network
case. The efficient numerical solution of the MPET equations is challenging, in
part due to the complexity of the system and in part due to the presence of
interacting parameter regimes. In this paper, we present a new strategy for
efficiently and robustly solving the MPET equations numerically. In particular,
we introduce a new approach to formulating finite element methods and
associated preconditioners for the MPET equations. The approach is based on
designing transformations of variables that simultaneously diagonalize (by
congruence) the equations' key operators and subsequently constructing
parameter-robust block-diagonal preconditioners for the transformed system. Our
methodology is supported by theoretical considerations as well as by numerical
results.

Title: POD-Galerkin Model Order Reduction for Parametrized Nonlinear Time
  Dependent Optimal Flow Control: an Application to Shallow Water Equations
Authors: Maria Strazzullo, Francesco Ballarin, Gianluigi Rozza
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  In this work we propose reduced order methods as a reliable strategy to
efficiently solve parametrized optimal control problems governed by shallow
waters equations in a solution tracking setting. The physical parametrized
model we deal with is nonlinear and time dependent: this leads to very time
consuming simulations which can be unbearable e.g. in a marine environmental
monitoring plan application. Our aim is to show how reduced order modelling
could help in studying different configurations and phenomena in a fast way.
After building the optimality system, we rely on a POD-Galerkin reduction in
order to solve the optimal control problem in a low dimensional reduced space.
The presented theoretical framework is actually suited to general nonlinear
time dependent optimal control problems. The proposed methodology is finally
tested with a numerical experiment: the reduced optimal control problem
governed by shallow waters equations reproduces the desired velocity and height
profiles faster than the standard model, still remaining accurate.

Title: Volumetric density-equalizing reference map with applications
Authors: Gary P. T. Choi, Chris H. Rycroft
Categories: math.NA cs.CG cs.GR cs.NA
MSC-class: 68U05, 65D18, 76R50
\\
  The density-equalizing map, a technique developed for cartogram creation, has
been widely applied to data visualization but only for 2D applications. In this
work, we propose a novel method called the volumetric density-equalizing
reference map (VDERM) for computing density-equalizing map for volumetric
domains. Given a prescribed density distribution in a volumetric domain in
$\mathbb{R}^3$, the proposed method continuously deforms the domain, with
different volume elements enlarged or shrunk according to the density
distribution. With the aid of the proposed method, medical and sociological
data can be visualized via deformations of 3D objects. The method can also be
applied to adaptive remeshing and shape modeling. Furthermore, by exploiting
the time-dependent nature of the proposed method, applications to shape
morphing can be easily achieved. Experimental results are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: A Preconditioning Technique for Computing Functions of Triangular
  Matrices
Authors: Jo\~ao R. Cardoso and Amir Sadeghi
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 15A16, 65F35, 65F60
\\
  We propose a simple preconditioning technique that, if incorporated into
algorithms for computing functions of triangular matrices, can make them more
efficient. Basically, such a technique consists in a similarity transformation
that reduces the departure from normality of a triangular matrix, thus
decreasing its norm and in general its function condition number. It can easily
be extended to non triangular matrices, provided that it is combined with
algorithms involving a prior Schur decomposition. Special attention is devoted
to particular algorithms like the inverse scaling and squaring to the matrix
logarithm and the scaling and squaring to the matrix exponential. The
advantages of our proposal are supported by theoretical results and illustrated
with numerical experiments.

Title: A Deterministic Algorithm for Constructing Multiple Rank-1 Lattices of
  Near-Optimal Size
Authors: Craig Gross, Mark A. Iwen, Lutz K\"ammerer, Toni Volkmer
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 65T40, 42B05, 68Q17, 68Q25, 42B35, 65T50, 65Y20, 65D30, 65D32
\\
  In this paper we present the first known deterministic algorithm for the
construction of multiple rank-1 lattices for the approximation of periodic
functions of many variables. The algorithm works by converting a potentially
large reconstructing single rank-1 lattice for some $ d $-dimensional frequency
set $ I \subset [N]^d $ into a collection of much smaller rank-1 lattices which
allow for accurate and efficient reconstruction of trigonometric polynomials
with coefficients in $ I $ (and, therefore, for the approximation of
multivariate periodic functions). The total number of sampling points in the
resulting multiple rank-1 lattices is theoretically shown to be less than $
\mathcal{O}\left( |I| \log^{ 2 }(N |I|) \right) $ with constants independent of
$d$, and by performing one-dimensional fast Fourier transforms on samples of
trigonometric polynomials with Fourier support in $ I $ at these points, we
obtain exact reconstruction of all Fourier coefficients in fewer than $
\mathcal{O}\left(d\,|I|\log^4 (N|I|)\right) $ total operations.
  Additionally, we present a second multiple rank-1 lattice construction
algorithm which constructs lattices with even fewer sampling points at the cost
of only being able to reconstruct exact trigonometric polynomials rather than
having additional theoretical approximation. Both algorithms are tested
numerically and surpass the theoretical bounds. Notably, we observe that the
oversampling factors #samples$/|I|$ appear to grow only logarithmically in $
|I| $ for the first algorithm and appear near-optimally bounded by four in the
second algorithm.

Title: Generalization of partitioned Runge--Kutta methods for adjoint systems
Authors: Takeru Matsuda, Yuto Miyatake
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  This study computes the gradient of a function of numerical solutions of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to the initial condition.
The adjoint method computes the gradient approximately by solving the
corresponding adjoint system numerically. In this context, Sanz-Serna [SIAM
Rev., 58 (2016), pp. 3--33] showed that when the initial value problem is
solved by a Runge--Kutta (RK) method, the gradient can be exactly computed by
applying an appropriate RK method to the adjoint system. Focusing on the case
where the initial value problem is solved by a partitioned RK (PRK) method,
this paper presents a numerical method, which can be seen as a generalization
of PRK methods, for the adjoint system that gives the exact gradient.

Comments: 31 pages, 7 figures
MSC-class: 65M60
\\
  The discontinuous Galerkin dG method provides a robust and flexible technique
for the time integration of fractional diffusion problems. However, a practical
implementation uses coefficients defined by integrals that are not easily
evaluated. We describe specialised quadrature techniques that efficiently
maintain the overall accuracy of the dG method. In addition, we observe in
numerical experiments that known superconvergence properties of dG time
stepping for classical diffusion problems carry over in a modified form to the
fractional-order setting.

Title: Efficient and Stable Finite Difference Modelling of Acoustic Wave

  University of Calgary)
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 21 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Computers and Mathematics with
  Applications
\\
  In this paper, we consider the development and analysis of a new explicit
compact high-order finite difference scheme for acoustic wave equation
formulated in divergence form, which is widely used to describe seismic wave
propagation through a heterogeneous media with variable media density and
acoustic velocity. The new scheme is compact and of fourth-order accuracy in
space and second-order accuracy in time. The compactness of the scheme is
obtained by the so-called combined finite difference method, which utilizes the
boundary values of the spatial derivatives and those boundary values are
obtained by one-sided finite difference approximation. An empirical stability
analysis has been conducted to obtain the Currant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)
condition, which confirmed the conditional stability of the new scheme. Four
numerical examples have been conducted to validate the convergence and
effectiveness of the new scheme. The application of the new scheme to a
realistic wave propagation problem with Perfect Matched Layer boundary
condition is also validated in this paper as well.

Title: Symmetric Tensor Decompositions On Varieties
Authors: Jiawang Nie, Ke Ye and Lihong Zhi
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.AG
\\
  This paper discusses the problem of symmetric tensor decomposition on a given
variety $X$: decomposing a symmetric tensor into the sum of tensor powers of
vectors contained in $X$. In this paper, we first study geometric and algebraic
properties of such decomposable tensors, which are crucial to the practical
computations of such decompositions. For a given tensor, we also develop a
criterion for the existence of a symmetric decomposition on $X$. Secondly and
most importantly, we propose a method for computing symmetric tensor
decompositions on an arbitrary $X$. As a specific application, Vandermonde
decompositions for nonsymmetric tensors can be computed by the proposed
algorithm.

  We establish an information complexity lower bound of randomized algorithms

the worst $L^2$ strong error is of order $\Omega(\sqrt{d}\, N^{-3/2})$, for
solving a family of $d$-dimensional underdamped Langevin dynamics, by any
randomized algorithm with only $N$ queries to $\nabla U$, the driving Brownian
motion and its weighted integration, respectively. The lower bound we establish
matches the upper bound for the randomized midpoint method recently proposed by
Shen and Lee [NIPS 2019], in terms of both parameters $N$ and $d$.

  The Yang-Mills equations generalize Maxwell's equations to nonabelian gauge
groups, and a quantity analogous to charge is locally conserved by the
nonlinear time evolution. Christiansen and Winther observed that, in the
nonabelian case, the Galerkin method with Lie algebra-valued finite element
differential forms appears to conserve charge globally but not locally, not
even in a weak sense. We introduce a new hybridization of this method, give an
alternative expression for the numerical charge in terms of the hybrid
variables, and show that a local, per-element charge conservation law
automatically holds.

Title: High-order accurate entropy stable finite difference schemes for the
  shallow water magnetohydrodynamics
Authors: Junming Duan, Huazhong Tang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 40 pages, 10 figures
\\
  This paper develops the high-order accurate entropy stable (ES) finite
difference schemes for the shallow water magnetohydrodynamic (SWMHD) equations.
They are built on the numerical approximation of the modified symmetrizable
SWMHD equations with a particularly adding source term. First, the second-order
accurate well-balanced semi-discrete entropy conservative (EC) schemes are
constructed, satisfying the entropy identity for the given convex entropy
function and preserving the steady states of the lake at rest (with zero
magnetic field). The key is to match both discretizations for the fluxes and
the source terms (related to the non-flat river bed bottom and symmetrization),
and to find the affordable EC fluxes of the second-order EC schemes. Next, by
using the second-order EC schemes as building block, high-order accurate
well-balanced semi-discrete EC schemes are proposed. Then, the high-order
accurate well-balanced semi-discrete ES schemes are derived by adding a
suitable dissipation term to the EC scheme with the WENO reconstruction of the
scaled entropy variables in order to suppress the numerical oscillations of the
EC schemes. After that, the semi-discrete schemes are integrated in time by
using the high-order strong stability-preserving explicit Runge-Kutta schemes
to obtain the fully-discrete high-order well-balanced schemes. The ES property
of the Lax-Friedrichs flux is also proved and then the positivity preserving ES
schemes are studied by using the positivity-preserving flux limiter. Finally,
extensive numerical tests are conducted to validate the accuracy, the
well-balance, ES and positivity properties, and the ability to capture
discontinuities of our schemes.

\\
  Hessian operators arising in inverse problems governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs) play a critical role in delivering efficient,
dimension-independent convergence for both Newton solution of deterministic
inverse problems, as well as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of posteriors in
the Bayesian setting. These methods require the ability to repeatedly perform
such operations on the Hessian as multiplication with arbitrary vectors,
solving linear systems, inversion, and (inverse) square root. Unfortunately,
the Hessian is a (formally) dense, implicitly-defined operator that is
intractable to form explicitly for practical inverse problems, requiring as
many PDE solves as inversion parameters. Low rank approximations are effective
when the data contain limited information about the parameters, but become
prohibitive as the data become more informative. However, the Hessians for many
inverse problems arising in practical applications can be well approximated by
matrices that have hierarchically low rank structure. Hierarchical matrix
representations promise to overcome the high complexity of dense
representations and provide effective data structures and matrix operations
that have only log-linear complexity. In this work, we describe algorithms for
constructing and updating hierarchical matrix approximations of Hessians, and
illustrate them on a number of representative inverse problems involving
time-dependent diffusion, advection-dominated transport, frequency domain
acoustic wave propagation, and low frequency Maxwell equations, demonstrating
up to an order of magnitude speedup compared to globally low rank
approximations.

  In this paper, we consider separating the discretisation of the diffusive and

several discretisation methods for the homogeneous flux with the complete flux
(CF) method. In particular, we explore the combination of the hybrid mimetic
mixed (HMM) method and the CF method, in order to utilize the advantages of
each of these methods. The usage of HMM allows us to handle anisotropic
diffusion tensors on generic polygonal (polytopal) grids; whereas the CF method
provides a framework for the construction of a uniformly second order method,
even when the problem is advection dominated.

\\
  We introduce the inhomogeneous geometric Brownian motion (IGBM) as a test
equation for analysing qualitative features of numerical methods applied to
multiplicative noise stochastic ordinary differential equations of Ito type
with an inhomogeneous drift. The usual linear stability analysis of a constant
equilibrium (in the mean-square or almost-sure sense) cannot be carried out for
these equations as they do not have one. However, the conditional and
asymptotic mean and variance of the IGBM are explicitly known and the process
can be characterised according to Feller's boundary classification. We compare
four splitting schemes, two based on the Lie-Trotter composition and two based
on the Strang approach, with the frequently used Euler-Maruyama and Milstein
methods. First, we derive closed-form expressions for the conditional and
asymptotic means and variances of all considered numerical schemes and analyse
the resulting errors with respect to the true quantities. In contrast to the
frequently applied methods, the splitting schemes do not require extra
conditions for the existence of the asymptotic moments and outperform them in
terms of the variance. Second, we prove that the constructed splitting schemes
preserve the boundary properties of the process, independently of the choice of
the discretisation step, whereas the Euler-Maruyama and Milstein methods do
not.

  Numerical simulation is indispensable in industrial design processes. It can
replace expensive experiments and even reduce the need for prototypes. While
products designed with the aid of numerical simulation undergo continuous
improvement, this must also be true for numerical simulation itself. Up to
date, no general purpose numerical method is available which can accurately
resolve a variety of physics ranging from fluid to solid mechanics including
large deformations and free surface flow phenomena. These complex multi-physics
problems occur for example in Additive Manufacturing processes. In this sense,
the recent developments in Machine Learning display chances for numerical
simulation. It has been shown recently that instead of solving a system of
equations as in standard numerical methods, a neural network can be trained
solely based on initial and boundary conditions. Neural networks are smooth,
differentiable functions that can be used as a global ansatz for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). While this idea dates back to more than 20 years
ago [Lagaris et al., 1998], it is only recent that an approach for the solution
of time dependent problems has been developed [Raissi et al., 2019]. With the
latter, implicit Runge Kutta schemes with unprecedented high order have been
constructed to solve scalar-valued PDEs. We build on the aforementioned work in
order to develop an Updated Lagrangian method for the solution of
incompressible free surface flow subject to the inviscid Euler equations. The
method is easy to implement and gets along without any specific algorithmic
treatment which is usually necessary to accurately resolve the
incompressibility constraint. Due to its meshfree character, we will name it
the Neural Particle Method (NPM). It will be demonstrated that the NPM remains
stable and accurate even if the location of discretization points is highly
irregular.

Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.FA math.OC
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  We mathematically derive the sensitivity of data assimilation results for
tsunami modelling, to perturbations in the observation operator. We consider
results of variational data assimilation schemes on the one dimensional shallow
water equations for (i) initial condition reconstruction, and (ii) bathymetry
detection as presented in Kevlahan et al. (2019, 2020). We use variational
methods to derive the Hessian of a cost function J representing the error
between forecast solutions and observations. Using this Hessian representation
and methods outlined by Shutyaev et al. (2017, 2018), we mathematically derive
the sensitivity of arbitrary response functions to perturbations in
observations for case (i) and (ii) respectively. Such analyses potentially
substantiate results from earlier work, on sufficient conditions for
convergence, and sensitivity of the propagating surface wave to errors in
bathymetry reconstruction. Such sensitivity analyses would illustrate whether
particular elements of the observation network are more critical than others,
and help minimise extraneous costs for observation collection, and efficiency
of predictive models.

\\
  As another critical implementation of moving frames for partial differential
equations, this paper proposes a novel numerical scheme by aligning one of
three orthogonal unit vectors at each grid point along the direction of a wave
propagation to construct an organized set of frames, called a connection. This
connection characterizes the geometry of wave propagation depending on (1) the
initial point, (2) type of wave, and (3) shape of the domain with conduction
properties. The constructed connection is differentiated again to derive the
Riemann curvature tensor of orthonormal bases corresponding to important
physical and biological meanings in wave propagation. As a practical
application, the proposed scheme is applied to diffusion-reaction equations to
obtain the Atlas, or a geometric map with connections, of an atrium with
cardiac fibers, for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of cardiac action
potential propagation, which could contribute to the clinical and surgical
planning of atrial fibrillation.

  This study presents both the theoretical framework and the finite element
solution to the fractional-order nonlocal thermoelastic response of beams. The
constitutive relations of the fractional-order medium are developed based on
thermodynamic principles. Remarkably, it is shown that the fractional model
allows the rigorous application of thermodynamic balance principles at every
point within the domain. The theory is applied to the analysis of the nonlocal
response of Euler-Bernoulli beams under combined thermo-mechanical loads. The
governing fractional-differential equations and the associated boundary
conditions for the elastic field variables are derived using variational
principles. The fractional finite element method (f-FEM) is used to numerically
solve the linear and nonlinear fractional-order system of equations. Further,
the numerical model is used to study the thermoelastic response of the nonlocal
beam subject to various thermo-mechanical loads and boundary conditions. The
fractional thermoelasticity framework is expected to provide consistent models
for nonlocal interactions in complex nonlocal structures exposed to a
thermo-mechanical environment.

Title: Efficient simulation of inclusions and reinforcement bars with the
  isogeometric Boundary Element method
Authors: Gernot Beer and Eugenio Ruocco and Christian Duenser and Vincenzo
  Mallardo
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  The paper is concerned with the development of efficient and accurate
solution procedures for the isogeometric boundary element method (BEM) when
applied to problems that contain inclusions that have elastic properties
different to the computed domain. This topic has been addressed in previous
papers but the approach presented here is a considerable improvement in terms
of efficiency and accuracy.
  One innovation is that initial stresses instead of body forces are used. This
then allows a one step solution without iteration. In addition, a novel
approach is used for the computation of strains, that avoids the use of highly
singular fundamental solutions. Finally, a new type of inclusion is presented
that can be used to model reinforcement bars or rock bolts and where analytical
integration can be used. Test examples, where results are compared with Finite
Element simulations, show that the proposed approach is sound.

Title: Optimal order of uniform convergence for finite element method on

Authors: Jin Zhang and Xiaowei Liu
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 12pages
MSC-class: 65N12, 65N30, 65N50
\\
  We propose a new analysis of convergence for a $k$th order ($k\ge 1$) finite
element method, which is applied on Bakhvalov-type meshes to a singularly
perturbed two-point boundary value problem. A novel interpolant is introduced,
which has a simple structure and is easy to generalize. By means of this
interpolant, we prove an optimal order of uniform convergence with respect to
the perturbation parameter.
  Numerical experiments illustrate these theoretical results.

Title: Fast Alternating Projections on Manifolds Based on Tangent Spaces
Authors: Guangjing Song, Michael K. Ng
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  In this paper, we study alternating projections on nontangential manifolds
based on the tangent spaces. The main motivation is that the projection of a
point onto a manifold can be computational expensive. We propose to use the
tangent space of the point in the manifold to approximate the projection onto
the manifold in order to reduce the computational cost. We show that the
sequence generated by alternating projections on two nontangential manifolds
based on tangent spaces, converges linearly to a point in the intersection of
the two manifolds where the convergent point is close to the optimal solution.
Numerical examples for nonnegative low rank matrix approximation and low rank
image quaternion matrix (color image) approximation, are given to demonstrate
that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the
classical alternating projection method in terms of computational time.

  Iron loss determination in the magnetic core of an electrical machine, such

The sensor positions inside the object are optimized in order to minimize the

Title: A Variational Lagrangian Scheme for a Phase Field Model: A Discrete
  Energetic Variational Approach
Authors: Chun Liu and Yiwei Wang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 25 pages, 6 figures
\\
  In this paper, we propose a variational Lagrangian scheme for a modified
phase-field model, which has same equilibria states with the phase-field model
of Allen-Cahn type. Our discretization is based on an energy-dissipation law in
terms of the flow map. By employing a discrete energetic variational approach,
this scheme preserves the variational structure of the original
energy-dissipation law and is energy stable. Plentiful numerical tests show
that, by choosing the initial value properly, our methods can produce the
desired equilibrium and capture the thin diffuse interface with some number of
mesh points.

Title: Optimisation of Large Wave Farms using a Multi-strategy Evolutionary
  Framework
Authors: Mehdi Neshat, Bradley Alexander, Nataliia Y. Sergiienko, Markus Wagner
Categories: cs.NE cs.AI
\\
  Wave energy is a fast-developing and promising renewable energy resource. The
primary goal of this research is to maximise the total harnessed power of a
large wave farm consisting of fully-submerged three-tether wave energy
converters (WECs). Energy maximisation for large farms is a challenging search
problem due to the costly calculations of the hydrodynamic interactions between
WECs in a large wave farm and the high dimensionality of the search space. To
address this problem, we propose a new hybrid multi-strategy evolutionary
framework combining smart initialisation, binary population-based evolutionary
algorithm, discrete local search and continuous global optimisation. For
assessing the performance of the proposed hybrid method, we compare it with a
wide variety of state-of-the-art optimisation approaches, including six
continuous evolutionary algorithms, four discrete search techniques and three
hybrid optimisation methods. The results show that the proposed method performs
considerably better in terms of convergence speed and farm output.

  Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2020
\\
  We present PyCARL, a PyNN-based common Python programming interface for
hardware-software co-simulation of spiking neural network (SNN). Through
PyCARL, we make the following two key contributions. First, we provide an
interface of PyNN to CARLsim, a computationally-efficient, GPU-accelerated and
biophysically-detailed SNN simulator. PyCARL facilitates joint development of
machine learning models and code sharing between CARLsim and PyNN users,
promoting an integrated and larger neuromorphic community. Second, we integrate
cycle-accurate models of state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware such as
TrueNorth, Loihi, and DynapSE in PyCARL, to accurately model hardware latencies
that delay spikes between communicating neurons and degrade performance. PyCARL
allows users to analyze and optimize the performance difference between
software-only simulation and hardware-software co-simulation of their machine
learning models. We show that system designers can also use PyCARL to perform
design-space exploration early in the product development stage, facilitating
faster time-to-deployment of neuromorphic products. We evaluate the memory
usage and simulation time of PyCARL using functionality tests, synthetic SNNs,
and realistic applications. Our results demonstrate that for large SNNs, PyCARL
does not lead to any significant overhead compared to CARLsim. We also use
PyCARL to analyze these SNNs for a state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware and
demonstrate a significant performance deviation from software-only simulations.
PyCARL allows to evaluate and minimize such differences early during model
development.

  Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is the third generation of Neural Network (NN)
mimicking the natural behavior of the brain. By processing based on binary

consumption. This work presents an efficient software-hardware design framework

neurosynaptic core is presented based on packet-switching communication
approach. The evaluation results show that the ANN to SNN conversion method

unsupervised STDP archives 89% with the size 784:400 with recurrent

Title: Effects of Discretization of Decision and Objective Spaces on the
  Performance of Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Algorithms
Authors: Weiyu Chen, Hisao Ishibuchi, Ke Shang
Categories: cs.NE
Comments: 2019 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)
\\
  Recently, the discretization of decision and objective spaces has been
discussed in the literature. In some studies, it is shown that the decision
space discretization improves the performance of evolutionary multi-objective
optimization (EMO) algorithms on continuous multi-objective test problems. In
other studies, it is shown that the objective space discretization improves the
performance on combinatorial multi-objective problems. However, the effect of
the simultaneous discretization of both spaces has not been examined in the
literature. In this paper, we examine the effects of the decision space
discretization, objective space discretization and simultaneous discretization
on the performance of NSGA-II through computational experiments on the DTLZ and
WFG problems. Using various settings about the number of decision variables and
the number of objectives, our experiments are performed on four types of
problems: standard problems, large-scale problems, many-objective problems, and
large-scale many-objective problems. We show that the decision space
discretization has a positive effect for large-scale problems and the objective
space discretization has a positive effect for many-objective problems. We also
show the discretization of both spaces is useful for large-scale many-objective
problems.

\\
  Learning to walk -- i.e., learning locomotion under performance and energy
constraints continues to be a challenge in legged robotics. Methods such as
stochastic gradient, deep reinforcement learning (RL) have been explored for
bipeds, quadrupeds and hexapods. These techniques are computationally intensive
and often prohibitive for edge applications. These methods rely on complex
sensors and pre-processing of data, which further increases energy and latency.
Recent advances in spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise a significant
reduction in computing owing to the sparse firing of neuros and has been shown
to integrate reinforcement learning mechanisms with biologically observed spike
time dependent plasticity (STDP). However, training a legged robot to walk by
learning the synchronization patterns of central pattern generators (CPG) in an
SNN framework has not been shown. This can marry the efficiency of SNNs with
synchronized locomotion of CPG based systems providing breakthrough end-to-end
learning in mobile robotics. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement based
stochastic weight update technique for training a spiking CPG. The whole system
is implemented on a lightweight raspberry pi platform with integrated sensors,
thus opening up exciting new possibilities.

Title: Safe Crossover of Neural Networks Through Neuron Alignment
Authors: Thomas Uriot and Dario Izzo
Categories: cs.NE cs.LG
Comments: To appear in GECCO 2020 Proceedings
\\
  One of the main and largely unexplored challenges in evolvingthe weights of
neural networks using genetic algorithms is to finda sensible crossover
operation between parent networks. Indeed,naive crossover leads to functionally
damaged offspring that donot retain information from the parents. This is
because neuralnetworks are invariant to permutations of neurons, giving riseto
multiple ways of representing the same solution. This is oftenreferred to as
the competing conventions problem. In this paper, wepropose a two-stepsafe
crossover(SC) operator. First, the neuronsof the parents are functionally
aligned by computing how well theycorrelate, and only then are the parents
recombined. We comparetwo ways of measuring relationships between neurons:
PairwiseCorrelation (PwC) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Wetest our
safe crossover operators (SC-PwC and SC-CCA) on MNISTand CIFAR-10 by performing
arithmetic crossover on the weightsof feed-forward neural network pairs. We
show that it effectivelytransmits information from parents to offspring and
significantlyimproves upon naive crossover. Our method is computationally
fast,can serve as a way to explore the fitness landscape more efficientlyand
makes safe crossover a potentially promising operator in futureneuroevolution
research and applications.

complexity in the face of potential disturbance. In this work, we use realistic

networks are unexpectedly susceptible to collapse from multiple system
disturbances. Our work proposes a middle path towards high performance and
strong resilience utilizing the Mosaics framework, and specifically by re-using
synaptic connections in a recurrent neural network implementation that

Title: Co-channel Coexistence: Let ITS-G5 and Sidelink C-V2X Make Peace
Authors: Alessandro Bazzi and Alberto Zanella and Ioannis Sarris and Vincent
  Martinez
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  In the last few years, two technologies have been developed to enable direct
exchange of information between vehicles. These technologies, currently seen as
alternatives, are ITS-G5, as commonly referred in Europe, and sidelink
LTE-vehicle-to-everything (LTE-V2X) (one of the solutions of the so-called
cellular-V2X, C-V2X). For this reason, the attention has been mostly
concentrated on comparing them and remarking their strengths and weaknesses to
motivate a choice. Differently, in this work we focus on a scenario where both
are used in the same area and using the same frequency channels, without the
assistance from any infrastructure. Our results show that under co-channel
coexistence the range of ITS-G5 is severely degraded, while impact on LTE-V2X
is marginal. Additionally, a mitigation method where the CAM data generation is
constrained to periodical intervals is shown to reduce the impact of co-channel
coexistence, with less degradation on ITS-G5 performance and even improvement
for LTE-V2X.

Title: Multi-Robot Association-Path Planning in Millimeter-Wave Industrial
  Scenarios
Authors: Cristian Tatino, Nikolaos Pappas, and Di Yuan
Categories: cs.NI cs.RO
\\
  The massive exploitation of robots for industry 4.0 needs advanced wireless
solutions that replace less flexible and more costly wired networks. In this
regard, millimeter-waves (mm-waves) can provide high data rates, but they are
characterized by a spotty coverage requiring dense radio deployments. In such
scenarios, coverage holes and numerous handovers may decrease the communication
throughput and reliability. In contrast to conventional multi-robot path
planning (MPP), we define a type of multi-robot association-path planning
(MAPP) problems aiming to jointly optimize the robots' paths and the
robots-access points (APs) associations. In MAPP, we focus on minimizing the
path lengths as well as the number of handovers while sustaining connectivity.
We propose an algorithm that can solve MAPP in polynomial time and it is able
to numerically approach the global optimum. We show that the proposed solution
is able to guarantee network connectivity and to dramatically reduce the number
of handovers in comparison to minimizing only the path lengths.

Title: Prioritization of Basic Safety Message in DSRC Based on Distance to
  Danger
Authors: Seungmo Kim and Byung-Jun Kim
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: This manuscript will be submitted to IEEE Access
\\
  Many parties claim the technical significance of Dedicated Short-Range
Communications (DSRC) in intelligent transportation system (ITS) for promotion
of transportation safety. The main challenge in this key vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) standard is high odds of network congestion. Furthermore, in accordance
with a V2X network being inherently dynamic in key parameters such as vehicle
density and velocity, the networking behavior of a DSRC system is usually
highly complicated to analyze. In addition, the United States Federal
Communications Commission (US FCC) recently announced the "5.9 GHz band
reform," which reduced the dedicated bandwidth for DSRC to 10 MHz from 75 MHz.
Motivated from these, the necessity of "lightening" the networking load of a
DSRC network has become essential to keep safety-related operations without
performance deterioration. To this end, this paper proposes a protocol that
prioritizes transmission of a basic safety message (BSM) at a vehicle according
to the level of danger that the vehicle experiences. The proposed protocol uses
the distance between a danger source and a vehicle as the metric to determine
the priority for transmission. Our results show that this protocol prioritizes
the transmission opportunity to dangerous vehicles, and hence results in higher
performance in terms of key metrics--i.e., average delay, throughput, and
inter-reception time ($\mathsf{IRT}$).

  The network management community has explored and exploited light, copper,

control or data traffic. Meanwhile, haptic technologies are being explored in
end-user (wearable) devices, and Tactile Internet is being used merely as a
metaphor. However, with rare exceptions and for smaller scoped projects, to our
knowledge, vibration has been largely untouched as networking communication
media. In this paper, we share the lessons learned while creating and
optimizing a pilot testbed that serves as an inexpensive starting point for the
exploration of vibration-defined networking. We demonstrated the feasibility
(but not yet the scalability) of vibrations as a tool for a few network
management mechanisms, such as resiliency, physical layer security, and as an
innovative method for teaching networking concepts to individuals with visual
impairments (VI). By demonstrating how vibrations could be programmable, we
propose to the community a few open problems that could generate several
applications.

Title: The Channel as a Traffic Sensor: Vehicle Detection and Classification

Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
\\
  Ubiquitously deployed Internet of Things (IoT)- based automatic vehicle
classification systems will catalyze data-driven traffic flow optimization in
future smart cities and will transform the road infrastructure itself into a
dynamically sensing Cyber-physical System (CPS). Although a wide range of
different traffic sensing systems has been proposed, the existing solutions are
not yet able to simultaneously satisfy the multitude of requirements, e.g.,
accuracy, robustness, cost-efficiency, and privacy preservation. In this paper,
we present a novel approach, which exploits radio fingerprints -
multidimensional attenuation patterns of wireless signals - for accurate and
robust vehicle detection and classification. The proposed system can be
deployed in a highly cost-efficient manner as it relies on off-the-shelf
embedded devices which are installed into existing delineator posts. In a
comprehensive field evaluation campaign, the performance of the radio
fingerprinting-based approach is analyzed within an experimental live
deployment on a German highway, where it is able to achieve a binary
classification success ratio of more than 99% and an overall accuracy of 93.83%
for a classification task with seven different classes.

  Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into future Intelligent

simulating hybrid vehicular networks within Network Simulator 3 (ns-3). LIMoSim
implements a shared codebase coupling approach which integrates all required
components in a single simulation process. The low-level mobility behaviors

Title: HierTrain: Fast Hierarchical Edge AI Learning with Hybrid Parallelism in
  Mobile-Edge-Cloud Computing
Authors: Deyin Liu and Xu Chen and Zhi Zhou and Qing Ling
Categories: cs.NI cs.AI cs.CV cs.DC cs.LG
Comments: Submitted for review
\\
  Nowadays, deep neural networks (DNNs) are the core enablers for many emerging
edge AI applications. Conventional approaches to training DNNs are generally
implemented at central servers or cloud centers for centralized learning, which
is typically time-consuming and resource-demanding due to the transmission of a
large amount of data samples from the device to the remote cloud. To overcome
these disadvantages, we consider accelerating the learning process of DNNs on
the Mobile-Edge-Cloud Computing (MECC) paradigm. In this paper, we propose
HierTrain, a hierarchical edge AI learning framework, which efficiently deploys
the DNN training task over the hierarchical MECC architecture. We develop a
novel \textit{hybrid parallelism} method, which is the key to HierTrain, to
adaptively assign the DNN model layers and the data samples across the three
levels of edge device, edge server and cloud center. We then formulate the
problem of scheduling the DNN training tasks at both layer-granularity and
sample-granularity. Solving this optimization problem enables us to achieve the
minimum training time. We further implement a hardware prototype consisting of
an edge device, an edge server and a cloud server, and conduct extensive

Title: A Comprehensive Survey on Moving Networks
Authors: Shan Jaffry, Rasheed Hussain, Xiang Gui, Syed Faraz Hasan
Categories: cs.NI cs.IT math.IT
Comments: This survey has been submitted to IEEE Communications Surveys &
  Tutorials
\\
  The unprecedented increase in the demand for mobile data, fuelled by new
emerging applications such as HD video streaming and heightened online
activities has caused massive strain on the existing cellular networks. As a
solution, the 5G technology has been introduced to improve network performance
through various innovative features such as mmWave spectrum and HetNets. In
essence, HetNets include several small cells underlaid within macro-cell to
serve densely populated regions. Recently, a mobile layer of HetNet has been
under consideration by the researchers and is often referred to as moving
networks. Moving networks comprise of mobile cells that are primarily
introduced to improve QoS for commuting users inside public transport because
the QoS is deteriorated due to vehicular penetration losses. Furthermore, the
users inside fast moving public transport also exert excessive load on the core
network due to large group handovers. To this end, mobile cells will play a
crucial role in reducing overall handover count and will help in alleviating
these problems by decoupling in-vehicle users from the core network.
  To date, remarkable research results have been achieved by the research
community in addressing challenges linked to moving networks. However, to the
best of our knowledge, a discussion on moving networks in a holistic way is
missing in the current literature. To fill the gap, in this paper, we
comprehensively survey moving networks. We cover the technological aspects and
their applications in the futuristic applications. We also discuss the
use-cases and value additions that moving networks may bring to future cellular
architecture and identify the challenges associated with them. Based on the
identified challenges we discuss the future research directions.

Title: Internet of Mobile Energy: Towards seamless energy trading across the
  transport and energy sectors
Authors: Raja Jurdak, Ali Dorri, Mahinda Vilathgamuwa
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  The rapid growth in distributed energy sources on power grids is leading to
more decentralised energy management systems for the prediction of power supply
and demand and the dynamic setting of an energy price signal. Within this
emerging smart grid, electric vehicles can serve as consumers, transporters,
and providers of energy through two-way charging stations, which highlights the
importance of predicting vehicle mobility and battery state of health to the
effectiveness of decentralised energy management. This paper proposes a vision
for an Internet of Mobile Energy (IoME), where energy and information flow
seamlessly across the power and transport sectors to enhance the grid stability
and end user welfare. Energy predictions that drive the price signals are used
to guide electric vehicle mobility decisions, which in turn underpin the
prediction of mobility patterns and future energy predictions. We propose an
information architecture for IoME that incorporates data observations across
all participants, a blockchain framework for data transmissions, and machine
learning for energy and mobility predictions. We present an example scenario
that details the seamless and closed loop information flow across the energy
and transport sectors, along with a blockchain design and transaction
vocabulary for trusted decentralised transactions. We finally discuss the open
challenges presented by IoME that can unlock signifcant benefits to grid
stability, innovation, and end user welfare.

Title: Contextual Bandit-Based Channel Selection for Wireless LANs with
  Interference-Driven Feature Extraction
Authors: Kota Yamashita, Shotaro Kamiya, Koji Yamamoto, Takayuki Nishio,
  Masahiro Morikura
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures
\\
  This paper proposes a radio channel selection algorithm based on a contextual
multi-armed bandit (CMAB) for a wireless local area network (WLAN) environment,
in which the access probability of each access point (AP) and the throughput
model are not given in advance. The problem to be considered inherently
involves the exploration to obtain the knowledge of the throughput
distribution, in which a realized value is observed only after attempting to
select each channel. This can be formulated as a multi-armed bandit (MAB)
problem; particularly, we focus on the usefulness of the surrounding channel
allocation information as the side information and determine that CMAB is
appropriate. However, directly applying common CMAB algorithms to the such
problems can lead to the lack of learning efficiency when the number of
contexts is large. To reduce the computational complexity of the CMAB
algorithms, feature extraction is designed by focusing on interference with
neighboring and same-channel APs after channel selection of a target AP, which
also contributes to the learning efficiency. To learn the optimal channel
efficiently, this study investigates the most efficient method among the
typical CMAB algorithms, including epoch-greedy, LinUCB, and Thompson sampling.
The simulation results reveal that the algorithm based on JointLinUCB learns
most efficiently under the environment where the access probabilities of the
APs are extremely different.

Title: High-Performance Industrial Wireless: Achieving Reliable and
  Deterministic Connectivity over IEEE 802.11 WLANs
Authors: Adnan Aijaz
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: accepted for IEEE journal publication
\\
  Communication for control-centric industrial applications is characterized by
the requirements of very high reliability, very low and deterministic latency
and high scalability. Typically, IEEE 802.11-based wireless local area networks
(WLANs), also known as Wi-Fi networks, are deemed ineligible for industrial
control applications owing to insufficient reliability and non-deterministic
latency. This paper proposes a novel solution for providing reliable and
deterministic communication, through Wi-Fi, in industrial environments. The
proposed solution, termed as \textsf{HAR\(^\text{2}\)D-Fi} (\underline{H}ybrid
channel \underline{A}ccess with \underline{R}edundancy for \underline{R}eliable
and \underline{D}eterministic Wi-\underline{Fi}), adopts hybrid channel access
mechanisms for achieving deterministic communication. It also provides temporal
redundancy for enhanced reliability. \textsf{HAR\(^\text{2}\)D-Fi} implements
different medium access control (MAC) designs that build on the standard
physical (PHY) layer. Such designs can be classified into two categories: (a)
MAC designs with pre-defined (physical) time-slotted schedule, and (b) MAC
designs with virtual time-slotted schedule. Performance evaluation, based on
analysis and system-level simulations, demonstrates the viability of
\textsf{HAR\(^\text{2}\)D-Fi} for control-centric industrial applications.

Authors: Roberto Morabito, Jaime Jim\'enez
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: The paper has been submitted for publication to IEEE Communications
  Standards Magazine and is currently under review
\\
  Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing technological domain and the
effort that many Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) and alliances are
dedicating to it is constantly increasing. The Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) is certainly one of the most active SDOs operating in this broad domain.
With the aim of building a comprehensive, interoperable and streamlined IoT
stack, several IETF working groups are developing protocols, in multiple
technological domains, which are already nowadays very relevant to the IoT.
This article gives a concise but comprehensive survey of the IETF efforts in
the IoT. We discuss mainstream standardization and research activities, as well
as other IETF-connected supporting initiatives provided still in the context of
IoT.

  Humans are considered as integral components of Human-Robot Collaboration
(HRC) systems, not only as object (e.g. in health care), but also as operators
and service providers in manufacturing. Sophisticated and complex tasks are to
be collaboratively executed by devices (robots) and humans. We introduce a
generic ontology for HRC systems. Description of humans is a part of the
ontology. Critical and hazardous (for humans) situations, as well as
corresponding safeguards are defined on the basis of the ontology. The ontology
is an extension of the ontology introduced in Skarzynski et al. (2018)
arXiv:1709.03300. The architecture of SO-MRS (see arXiv:1709.03300), a software
platform for automatic task accomplishment, is extended to HRC systems. Ongoing
experiments, carried out in a simulated HRC system, are to verify the ontology
and the architecture.

Title: Design and optimal control of a tiltrotor micro aerial vehicle for
  efficient omnidirectional flight

\\
  Omnidirectional micro aerial vehicles are a growing field of research, with
demonstrated advantages for aerial interaction and uninhibited observation.
While systems with complete pose omnidirectionality and high hover efficiency
have been developed independently, a robust system that combines the two has
not been demonstrated to date. This paper presents the design and optimal
control of a novel omnidirectional vehicle that can exert a wrench in any
orientation while maintaining efficient flight configurations. The system
design is motivated by the result of a morphology design optimization. A six
degrees of freedom optimal controller is derived, with an actuator allocation
approach that implements task prioritization, and is robust to singularities.
Flight experiments demonstrate and verify the system's capabilities.

\\
  This paper presents and validates two approaches for active interaction force
control and planning for omnidirectional aerial manipulation platforms, with
the goal of aerial contact inspection in unstructured environments. We extend
upon an axis-selective impedance controller to present a variable
axis-selective impedance control which integrates direct force control for
intentional interaction, using feedback from an on-board force sensor. The
control approaches aim to reject disturbances in free flight, while handling
unintentional interaction, and actively controlling desired interaction forces.
A fully actuated and omnidirectional tilt-rotor aerial system is used to show
capabilities of the control and planning methods. Experiments demonstrate
disturbance rejection, push-and-slide interaction, and force controlled
interaction in different flight orientations. The system is validated as a tool
for non-destructive testing of concrete infrastructure, and statistical results
of interaction control performance are presented and discussed.

  We consider solving a cooperative multi-robot object manipulation task using
reinforcement learning (RL). We propose two distributed multi-agent RL
approaches: distributed approximate RL (DA-RL), where each agent applies
Q-learning with individual reward functions; and game-theoretic RL (GT-RL),
where the agents update their Q-values based on the Nash equilibrium of a
bimatrix Q-value game. We validate the proposed approaches in the setting of
cooperative object manipulation with two simulated robot arms. Although we
focus on a small system of two agents in this paper, both DA-RL and GT-RL apply
to general multi-agent systems, and are expected to scale well to large
systems.

Title: PointNet++ Grasping: Learning An End-to-end Spatial Grasp Generation
  Algorithm from Sparse Point Clouds
Authors: Peiyuan Ni, Wenguang Zhang, Xiaoxiao Zhu, Qixin Cao
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: Accepted at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation
  (ICRA) 2020
\\
  Grasping for novel objects is important for robot manipulation in
unstructured environments. Most of current works require a grasp sampling
process to obtain grasp candidates, combined with local feature extractor using
deep learning. This pipeline is time-costly, expecially when grasp points are
sparse such as at the edge of a bowl. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
approach to directly predict the poses, categories and scores (qualities) of
all the grasps. It takes the whole sparse point clouds as the input and
requires no sampling or search process. Moreover, to generate training data of
multi-object scene, we propose a fast multi-object grasp detection algorithm
based on Ferrari Canny metrics. A single-object dataset (79 objects from YCB
object set, 23.7k grasps) and a multi-object dataset (20k point clouds with
annotations and masks) are generated. A PointNet++ based network combined with
multi-mask loss is introduced to deal with different training points. The whole
weight size of our network is only about 11.6M, which takes about 102ms for a
whole prediction process using a GeForce 840M GPU. Our experiment shows our
work get 71.43% success rate and 91.60% completion rate, which performs better
than current state-of-art works.

  A customizable multi-rotor UAVs simulation platform based on ROS, Gazebo and
PX4 is presented. The platform, which is called XTDrone, integrates dynamic
models, sensor models, control algorithm, state estimation algorithm, and 3D
scenes. The platform supports multi UAVs and other robots. The platform is
modular and each module can be modified, which means that users can test its
own algorithm, such as SLAM, object detection, motion planning, attitude
control, multi-UAV cooperation, and cooperation with other robots on the
platform. The platform runs in lockstep, so the simulation speed can be
adjusted according to the computer performance. In this paper, two cases,
evaluating different visual SLAM algorithm and realizing UAV formation, are
shown to demonstrate how the platform works.

Title: Variational Inference with Parameter Learning Applied to Vehicle
  Trajectory Estimation
Authors: Jeremy N. Wong, David J. Yoon, Angela P. Schoellig, Timothy D. Barfoot
Categories: cs.RO stat.ML
Comments: Submitted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters on February 24,
  2020; 8 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We present parameter learning in a Gaussian variational inference setting
using only noisy measurements (i.e., no groundtruth). This is demonstrated in
the context of vehicle trajectory estimation, although the method we propose is
general. The paper extends the Exactly Sparse Gaussian Variational Inference
(ESGVI) framework, which has previously been used for large-scale nonlinear
batch state estimation. Our contribution is to additionally learn parameters of
our system models (which may be difficult to choose in practice) within the
ESGVI framework. In this paper, we learn the covariances for the motion and
sensor models used within vehicle trajectory estimation. Specifically, we learn
the parameters of a white-noise-on-acceleration motion model and the parameters
of an Inverse-Wishart prior over measurement covariances for our sensor model.
We demonstrate our technique using a 36 km dataset consisting of a car using
lidar to localize against a high-definition map; we learn the parameters on a
training section of the data and then show that we achieve high-quality state
estimates on a test section, even in the presence of outliers.

Title: Monocular visual-inertial SLAM algorithm combined with wheel speed
  anomaly detection
Authors: Peng Gang, Lu Zezao, Chen Shanliang, Chen Bocheng, He Dingxin
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  To address the weak observability of monocular visual-inertial odometers on
ground-based mobile robots, this paper proposes a monocular inertial SLAM
algorithm combined with wheel speed anomaly detection. The algorithm uses a
wheel speed odometer pre-integration method to add the wheel speed measurement
to the least-squares problem in a tightly coupled manner. For abnormal motion
situations, such as skidding and abduction, this paper adopts the Mecanum
mobile chassis control method, based on torque control. This method uses the
motion constraint error to estimate the reliability of the wheel speed
measurement. At the same time, in order to prevent incorrect chassis speed
measurements from negatively influencing robot pose estimation, this paper uses
three methods to detect abnormal chassis movement and analyze chassis movement
status in real time. When the chassis movement is determined to be abnormal,
the wheel odometer pre-integration measurement of the current frame is removed
from the state estimation equation, thereby ensuring the accuracy and
robustness of the state estimation. Experimental results show that the accuracy
and robustness of the method in this paper are better than those of a monocular
visual-inertial odometer.

Categories: cs.RO cs.CY cs.HC
Comments: 7 pages, 9 figures
\\
  For automated vehicles (AVs) to reliably navigate through crosswalks, they
need to understand pedestrians crossing behaviors. Simple and reliable
pedestrian behavior models aid in real-time AV control by allowing the AVs to
predict future pedestrian behaviors. In this paper, we present a Behavior aware
Model Predictive Controller (B-MPC) for AVs that incorporates long-term
predictions of pedestrian crossing behavior using a previously developed
pedestrian crossing model. The model incorporates pedestrians gap acceptance
behavior and utilizes minimal pedestrian information, namely their position and
speed, to predict pedestrians crossing behaviors. The BMPC controller is
validated through simulations and compared to a rule-based controller. By
incorporating predictions of pedestrian behavior, the B-MPC controller is able
to efficiently plan for longer horizons and handle a wider range of pedestrian
interaction scenarios than the rule-based controller. Results demonstrate the
applicability of the controller for safe and efficient navigation at crossing
scenarios.

\\
  We consider the task of underwater robot navigation for the purpose of
collecting scientifically-relevant video data for environmental monitoring. The
majority of field robots that currently perform monitoring tasks in
unstructured natural environments navigate via path-tracking a pre-specified
sequence of waypoints. Although this navigation method is often necessary, it
is limiting because the robot does not have a model of what the scientist deems
to be relevant visual observations. Thus, the robot can neither visually search
for particular types of objects, nor focus its attention on parts of the scene
that might be more relevant than the pre-specified waypoints and viewpoints. In
this paper we propose a method that enables informed visual navigation via a
learned visual similarity operator that guides the robot's visual search
towards parts of the scene that look like an exemplar image, which is given by
the user as a high-level specification for data collection. We propose and
evaluate a weakly-supervised video representation learning method that
outperforms ImageNet embeddings for similarity tasks in the underwater domain.
We also demonstrate the deployment of this similarity operator during informed
visual navigation in collaborative environmental monitoring scenarios, in
large-scale field trials, where the robot and a human scientist jointly search
for relevant visual content.

Title: Performance Evaluation of Low-Cost Machine Vision Cameras for
  Image-Based Grasp Verification
Authors: Deebul Nair, Amirhossein Pakdaman and Paul G. Pl\"oger
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
Comments: 6 pages, 9 Figure, IROS 2020 conference
\\
  Grasp verification is advantageous for autonomous manipulation robots as they
provide the feedback required for higher level planning components about
successful task completion. However, a major obstacle in doing grasp
verification is sensor selection. In this paper, we propose a vision based
grasp verification system using machine vision cameras, with the verification
problem formulated as an image classification task. Machine vision cameras
consist of a camera and a processing unit capable of on-board deep learning
inference. The inference in these low-power hardware are done near the data
source, reducing the robot's dependence on a centralized server, leading to
reduced latency, and improved reliability. Machine vision cameras provide the
deep learning inference capabilities using different neural accelerators.
Although, it is not clear from the documentation of these cameras what is the
effect of these neural accelerators on performance metrics such as latency and
throughput. To systematically benchmark these machine vision cameras, we
propose a parameterized model generator that generates end to end models of
Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). Using these generated models we benchmark
latency and throughput of two machine vision cameras, JeVois A33 and Sipeed
Maix Bit. Our experiments demonstrate that the selected machine vision camera
and the deep learning models can robustly verify grasp with 97% per frame
accuracy.

Title: Connectivity Maintenance: Global and Optimized approach through Control
  Barrier Functions
Authors: Beatrice Capelli, Lorenzo Sabattini
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: To be published in Proceedings of International Conference on
  Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2020
\\
  Connectivity maintenance is an essential aspect to consider while controlling
a multi-robot system. In general, a multi-robot system should be connected to
obtain a certain common objective. Connectivity must be kept regardless of the
control strategy or the objective of the multi-robot system. Two main methods
exist for connectivity maintenance: keep the initial connections (local
connectivity) or allow modifications to the initial connections, but always
keeping the overall system connected (global connectivity). In this paper we
present a method that allows, at the same time, to maintain global connectivity
and to implement the desired control strategy (e.g., consensus, formation
control, coverage), all in an optimized fashion. For this purpose, we defined
and implemented a Control Barrier Function that can incorporate constraints and
objectives. We provide a mathematical proof of the method, and we demonstrate
its versatility with simulations of different applications.

Title: Linear Time-Varying MPC for Nonprehensile Object Manipulation with a
  Nonholonomic Mobile Robot
Authors: Filippo Bertoncelli, Fabio Ruggiero, Lorenzo Sabattini
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  This paper proposes a technique to manipulate an object with a nonholonomic
mobile robot by pushing, which is a nonprehensile manipulation motion
primitive. Such a primitive involves unilateral constraints associated with the
friction between the robot and the manipulated object. Violating this
constraint produces the slippage of the object during the manipulation,
preventing the correct achievement of the task. A linear time-varying model
predictive control is designed to include the unilateral constraint within the
control action properly. The approach is verified in a dynamic simulation

Title: A Developmental Neuro-Robotics Approach for Boosting the Recognition of
  Handwritten Digits
Authors: Alessandro Di Nuovo
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: Accepted for presentation at IJCNN 2020
\\
  Developmental psychology and neuroimaging research identified a close link
between numbers and fingers, which can boost the initial number knowledge in
children. Recent evidence shows that a simulation of the children's embodied
strategies can improve the machine intelligence too. This article explores the
application of embodied strategies to convolutional neural network models in
the context of developmental neuro-robotics, where the training information is
likely to be gradually acquired while operating rather than being abundant and
fully available as the classical machine learning scenarios. The experimental
analyses show that the proprioceptive information from the robot fingers can
improve network accuracy in the recognition of handwritten Arabic digits when
training examples and epochs are few. This result is comparable to brain
imaging and longitudinal studies with young children. In conclusion, these
findings also support the relevance of the embodiment in the case of artificial
agents' training and show a possible way for the humanization of the learning
process, where the robotic body can express the internal processes of
artificial intelligence making it more understandable for humans.

Title: Extended Existence Probability Using Digital Maps for Object
  Verification
Authors: Fabian Gies and Joachim Posselt and Michael Buchholz and Klaus

Categories: cs.RO
\\
  A main task for automated vehicles is a complete and robust environment
perception. Especially, an error-free detection and modeling of other traffic
participants is of great importance to drive safely in any situation.
Therefore, multi-object tracking approaches, based on object detections from
raw sensor measurements, are commonly used. However, false object hypothesis
can occur due to complex, arbitrary scenarios with a high density of different
traffic participants. For that reason, the presented approach introduces a
probabilistic model to verify the existence of a track. Therefore, an object
verification module is introduced, where the influences of multiple digital map
elements on a track's existence are evaluated. Finally, a probabilistic model
fuses the various influences and estimates an extended existence probability
for every track. In addition, a Bayes Net is implemented as directed graphical
model to highlight this work's expandability. The presented approach, reduces
the number of false positives, while retaining true positives. Real world data
is used to evaluate and highlight benefits of the presented approach,
especially in urban scenarios.

\\
  Quality in software is often understood as "execution according to design
purpose" whereas security means that "software will not put data or computing
systems at risk of unauthorized access." There seems to be a connection between
these two aspects but, how do we integrate both of them in the robotics
development cycle? In this article we introduce DevSecOps in Robotics, a set of
best practices designed to help roboticists implant security deep in the heart
of their development and operations processes. First, we briefly describe
DevOps, introduce the value added with DevSecOps and describe and illustrate
how these practices may be implemented in the robotics field. We finalize with
a discussion on the relationship between security, quality and safety, open
problems and future research questions.

Title: A Quantum Vocal Theory of Sound
Authors: Davide Rocchesso and Maria Mannone
Categories: cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: 32 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Concepts and formalism from acoustics are often used to exemplify quantum
mechanics. Conversely, quantum mechanics could be used to achieve a new
perspective on acoustics, as shown by Gabor studies. Here, we focus in
particular on the study of human voice, considered as a probe to investigate
the world of sounds. We present a theoretical framework that is based on
observables of vocal production, and on some measurement apparati that can be
used both for analysis and synthesis. In analogy to the description of spin
states of a particle, the quantum-mechanical formalism is used to describe the
relations between the fundamental states associated with phonetic labels such
as phonation, turbulence, and supraglottal myoelastic vibrations. The
intermingling of these states, and their temporal evolution, can still be
interpreted in the Fourier/Gabor plane, and effective extractors can be
implemented. The bases for a Quantum Vocal Theory of Sound, with implications
in sound analysis and design, are presented.

Title: Monaural Speech Enhancement with Recursive Learning in the Time Domain
Authors: Andong Li, Chengshi Zheng, Linjuan Cheng, Renhua Peng, Xiaodong Li
Categories: cs.SD
Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures
\\
  In this paper, we propose a type of neural network with recursive learning in
the time domain called RTNet for monaural speech enhancement, where the
proposed network consists of three principal components. The first part is
called stage recurrent neural network, which is proposed to effectively
aggregate the deep feature dependencies across different stages with a memory
mechanism and also remove the interference stageby-stage. The second part is
the convolutional auto-encoder. The third part consists of a series of
concatenated gated linear units, which are capable of facilitating the
information flow and gradually increasing the receptive fields. Recursive
learning is adopted to significantly improve the parameter efficiency and
therefore, the number of trainable parameters is effectively reduced without
sacrificing its performance. The experiments are conducted on TIMIT corpus.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network achieves
consistently better performance in both PESQ and STOI scores than two advanced
time domain-based baselines in different conditions. The code is provided at
https://github.com/Andong-Li-speech/RTNet.

Title: Multi-task U-Net for Music Source Separation
Authors: Venkatesh S. Kadandale, Juan F. Montesinos, Gloria Haro, Emilia
  G\'omez
Categories: cs.SD cs.IR cs.LG cs.MM
\\
  A fairly straightforward approach for music source separation is to train
independent models, wherein each model is dedicated for estimating only a
specific source. Training a single model to estimate multiple sources generally
does not perform as well as the independent dedicated models. However,
Conditioned U-Net (C-U-Net) uses a control mechanism to train a single model
for multi-source separation and attempts to achieve a performance comparable to
that of the dedicated models. We propose a multi-task U-Net (M-U-Net) trained
using a weighted multi-task loss as an alternative to the C-U-Net. We
investigate two weighting strategies for our multi-task loss: 1) Dynamic
Weighted Average (DWA), and 2) Energy Based Weighting (EBW). DWA determines the
weights by tracking the rate of change of loss of each task during training.
EBW aims to neutralize the effect of the training bias arising from the
difference in energy levels of each of the sources in a mixture. Our methods
provide two-fold advantages compared to the C-U-Net: 1) Fewer effective
training iterations with no conditioning, and 2) Fewer trainable network
parameters (no control parameters). Our methods achieve performance comparable
to that of C-U-Net and the dedicated U-Nets at a much lower training cost.

Title: Software Effort Estimation from Use Case Diagrams Using Nonlinear
  Regression Analysis
Authors: Ali Bou Nassif, Manar AbuTaleb, Luiz Fernando Capretz
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: Accepted at CCECE 2020 conference
\\
  Software effort estimation in the early stages of the software life cycle is
one of the most essential and daunting tasks for project managers. In this
research, a new model based on non-linear regression analysis is proposed to
predict software effort from use case diagrams. It is concluded that, where
software size is classified from small to very large, one linear or non-linear
equation for effort estimation cannot be applied. Our model with three
different non-linear regression equations can incorporate the different ranges
in software size.

  This paper elaborates the use of static source code analysis in the context
of data protection. The topic is important for software engineering in order
for software developers to improve the protection of personal data during
software development. To this end, the paper proposes a design of annotating
classes and functions that process personal data. The design serves two primary
purposes: on one hand, it provides means for software developers to document
their intent; on the other hand, it furnishes tools for automatic detection of
potential violations. This dual rationale facilitates compliance with the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other emerging data protection
and privacy regulations. In addition to a brief review of the state-of-the-art
of static analysis in the data protection context and the design of the
proposed analysis method, a concrete tool is presented to demonstrate a
practical implementation for the Java programming language.

Title: Rapid Reviews in Software Engineering
Authors: Bruno Cartaxo, Gustavo Pinto, and Sergio Soares
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: 27 pages
\\
  Integrating research evidence into practice is one of the main goals of
Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE). Secondary studies, one of the main
EBSE products, are intended to summarize the best research evidence and make
them easily consumable by practitioners. However, recent studies show that some
secondary studies lack connections with software engineering practice. In this
chapter, we present the concept of Rapid Reviews, which are lightweight
secondary studies focused on delivering evidence to practitioners in a timely
manner. Rapid reviews support practitioners in their decision-making, and
should be conducted bounded to a practical problem, inserted into a practical
context. Thus, Rapid Reviews can be easily integrated in a knowledge/technology
transfer initiative. After describing the basic concepts, we present the
results and experiences of conducting two Rapid Reviews. We also provide
guidelines to help researchers and practitioners who want to conduct Rapid
Reviews, and we finally discuss topics that my concern the research community
about the feasibility of Rapid Reviews as an Evidence-Based method. In
conclusion, we believe Rapid Reviews might interest researchers and
practitioners working in the intersection between software engineering research
and practice.

Title: Fairway: SE Principles for Building Fairer Software
Authors: Joymallya Chakraborty, Suvodeep Majumdar, Zhe Wu, Tim Menziess
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Machine learning software is increasingly being used to make decisions that
affect people's lives. But sometimes, the core part of this software (the
learned model), behaves in a biased manner that gives undue advantages to a
specific group of people (where those groups are determined by sex, race,
etc.). This "algorithmic discrimination" in the AI software systems has become
a matter of serious concern in the machine learning and software engineering
community. There have been works done to find "algorithmic bias" or "ethical
bias" in the software system. Once the bias is detected in the AI software
system, the mitigation of bias is extremely important. In this work, we
a)explain how ground-truth bias in training data affects machine learning model
fairness and how to find that bias in AI software,b)propose a
methodFairwaywhich combines pre-processing and in-processing approach to remove
ethical bias from training data and trained model. Our results show that we can
find bias and mitigate bias in a learned model, without much damaging the
predictive performance of that model. We propose that (1) test-ing for bias and
(2) bias mitigation should be a routine part of the machine learning software
development life cycle. Fairway offers much support for these two purposes.

  Trust can be defined as a measure to determine which source of information is
reliable and with whom we should share or from whom we should accept
information. There are several applications for trust in Online Social Networks
(OSNs), including social spammer detection, fake news detection, retweet
behaviour detection and recommender systems. Trust prediction is the process of
predicting a new trust relation between two users who are not currently
connected. In applications of trust, trust relations among users need to be
predicted. This process faces many challenges, such as the sparsity of
user-specified trust relations, the context-awareness of trust and changes in
trust values over time. In this dissertation, we analyse the state-of-the-art
in pair-wise trust prediction models in OSNs. We discuss three main challenges
in this domain and present novel trust prediction approaches to address them.
We first focus on proposing a low-rank representation of users that
incorporates users' personality traits as additional information. Then, we
propose a set of context-aware trust prediction models. Finally, by considering
the time-dependency of trust relations, we propose a dynamic deep trust
prediction approach. We design and implement five pair-wise trust prediction
approaches and evaluate them with real-world datasets collected from OSNs. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches compared
to other state-of-the-art pair-wise trust prediction models.

Title: Variation across Scales: Measurement Fidelity under Twitter Data

\\
  A comprehensive understanding of data bias is the cornerstone of mitigating
biases in social media research. This paper presents in-depth measurements of
the effects of Twitter data sampling across different timescales and different
subjects (entities, networks, and cascades). By constructing two complete tweet
streams, we show that Twitter rate limit message is an accurate measure for the
volume of missing tweets. Despite sampling rates having clear temporal
variations, we find that the Bernoulli process with a uniform rate well
approximates Twitter data sampling, and it allows to estimate the ground-truth
entity frequency and ranking with the observed sample data. In terms of network
analysis, we observe significant structure changes in both the user-hashtag
bipartite graph and the retweet network. Finally, we measure the retweet
cascades. We identify risks for information diffusion models that rely on tweet
inter-arrival times and user influence. This work calls attention to the social
data bias caused by data collection, and proposes methods to measure the
systematic biases introduced by sampling.

Title: The Solution Distribution of Influence Maximization: A High-level
  Experimental Study on Three Algorithmic Approaches
Authors: Naoto Ohsaka

Comments: To appear in SIGMOD 2020
DOI: 10.1145/3318464.3380564
\\
  Influence maximization is among the most fundamental algorithmic problems in
social influence analysis. Over the last decade, a great effort has been
devoted to developing efficient algorithms for influence maximization, so that
identifying the ``best'' algorithm has become a demanding task. In SIGMOD'17,
Arora, Galhotra, and Ranu reported benchmark results on eleven existing
algorithms and demonstrated that there is no single state-of-the-art offering
the best trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality.
  In this paper, we report a high-level experimental study on three
well-established algorithmic approaches for influence maximization, referred to
as Oneshot, Snapshot, and Reverse Influence Sampling (RIS). Different from
Arora et al., our experimental methodology is so designed that we examine the
distribution of random solutions, characterize the relation between the sample
number and the actual solution quality, and avoid implementation dependencies.
Our main findings are as follows: 1. For a sufficiently large sample number, we
obtain a unique solution regardless of algorithms. 2. The average solution
quality of Oneshot, Snapshot, and RIS improves at the same rate up to scaling
of sample number. 3. Oneshot requires more samples than Snapshot, and Snapshot
requires fewer but larger samples than RIS. We discuss the time efficiency when
conditioning Oneshot, Snapshot, and RIS to be of identical accuracy. Our
conclusion is that Oneshot is suitable only if the size of available memory is
limited, and RIS is more efficient than Snapshot for large networks; Snapshot
is preferable for small, low-probability networks.

  The objective of this work is to explore popular discourse about the COVID-19
pandemic and policies implemented to manage it. Using Natural Language
Processing, Text Mining, and Network Analysis to analyze corpus of tweets that
relate to the COVID-19 pandemic, we identify common responses to the pandemic

information and misinformation were transmitted via Twitter, starting at the
early stages of this pandemic, are presented. Finally, this work introduces a
dataset of tweets collected from all over the world, in multiple languages,
dating back to January 22nd, when the total cases of reported COVID-19 were
below 600 worldwide. The insights presented in this work could help inform
decision makers in the face of future pandemics, and the dataset introduced can
be used to acquire valuable knowledge to help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.

  We study the $r$-complex contagion influence maximization problem. In the
influence maximization problem, one chooses a fixed number of initial seeds in
a social network to maximize the spread of their influence. In the $r$-complex
contagion model, each uninfected vertex in the network becomes infected if it
has at least $r$ infected neighbors. In this paper, we focus on a random graph
model named the stochastic hierarchical blockmodel, which is a special case of
the well-studied stochastic blockmodel. When the graph is not exceptionally
sparse, in particular, when each edge appears with probability
$\omega(n^{-(1+1/r)})$, under certain mild assumptions, we prove that the
optimal seeding strategy is to put all the seeds in a single community. This
matches the intuition that in a nonsubmodular cascade model placing seeds near
each other creates synergy. However, it sharply contrasts with the intuition
for submodular cascade models (e.g., the independent cascade model and the
linear threshold model) in which nearby seeds tend to erode each others'
effects. Our key technique is a novel time-asynchronized coupling of four
cascade processes. Finally, we show that this observation yields a polynomial
time dynamic programming algorithm which outputs optimal seeds if each edge
appears with a probability either in $\omega(n^{-(1+1/r)})$ or in $o(n^{-2})$.

  Connected vehicles (CVs) have situational awareness that can be exploited for
control and optimization of the powertrain system. While extensive studies have
been carried out for energy efficiency improvement of CVs via eco-driving and
planning, the implication of such technologies on the thermal responses of CVs
has not been fully investigated. One of the key challenges in leveraging
connectivity for optimization-based thermal management of CVs is the relatively
slow thermal dynamics, which necessitate the use of a long prediction horizon
to achieve the best performance. Long-term prediction of the CV speed, unlike
the V2V/V2I-based short-range prediction, is difficult and error-prone. The
multiple timescales inherent to power and thermal systems call for a variable
timescale optimization framework with access to short- and long-term vehicle
speed preview. To this end, a model predictive controller (MPC) with a
multi-range speed preview for integrated power and thermal management (iPTM) of
connected hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is presented in this paper. The MPC
is formulated to manage the power-split between the engine and the battery
while enforcing the power and thermal (engine coolant and catalytic converter
temperatures) constraints. The MPC exploits prediction and optimization over a
shorter receding horizon and longer shrinking horizon. Over the longer
shrinking horizon, the vehicle speed estimation is based on the data collected
from the connected vehicles traveling on the same route as the ego-vehicle.
Simulation results of applying the MPC over real-world urban driving cycles in
Ann Arbor, MI are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and fuel-saving
potentials of the proposed iPTM strategy under the uncertainty associated with
long-term predictions of the CV's speed.

Title: A Reliability-aware Multi-armed Bandit Approach to Learn and Select
  Users in Demand Response
Authors: Yingying Li, Qinran Hu, Na Li
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  One challenge in the optimization and control of societal systems is to
handle the unknown and uncertain user behavior. This paper focuses on
residential demand response (DR) and proposes a closed-loop learning scheme to
address these issues. In particular, we consider DR programs where an
aggregator calls upon residential users to change their demand so that the
total load adjustment is close to a target value. To learn and select the right
users, we formulate the DR problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB)
problem with a reliability objective. We propose a learning algorithm: CUCB-Avg
(Combinatorial Upper Confidence Bound-Average), which utilizes both upper
confidence bounds and sample averages to balance the tradeoff between
exploration (learning) and exploitation (selecting). We consider both a fixed
time-invariant target and time-varying targets, and show that CUCB-Avg achieves
$O(\log T)$ and $O(\sqrt{T
  \log(T)})$ regrets respectively. Finally, we numerically test our algorithms
using synthetic and real data, and demonstrate that our CUCB-Avg performs
significantly better than the classic CUCB and also better than Thompson
Sampling.

Title: Extended Prony Analysis on Power System Oscillation Under a
  Near-Resonance Condition
Authors: Tianwei Xia, Zhe Yu, Kai Sun, Di Shi, Zhiwei Wang
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: To be presented at the IEEE PES General Meeting in 2020
\\
  Power system oscillations under a large disturbance often exhibit distorted
waveforms as captured by increasingly deployed phasor measurement units. One
cause is the occurrence of a near-resonance condition among several dominant
modes that are influenced by nonlinear transient dynamics of generators. This
paper proposes an Extended Prony Analysis method for measurement-based modal
analysis. Based on the normal form theory, it compares analyses on transient
and post-transient waveforms to distinguish a resonance mode caused by a
near-resonance condition from natural modes so that the method can give more
accurate modal properties than a traditional Prony Analysis method, especially
for large disturbances. The new method is first demonstrated in detail on
Kundur's two-area system and then tested on the IEEE 39-bus system to show its
performance under a near-resonance condition.

  Experience shows that semiconductor switches in power electronics systems are
the most vulnerable components. One of the most common ways to solve this
reliability challenge is component-level redundant design. There are four
possible configurations for the redundant design in component-level. This paper
presents a comparative reliability analysis between different component-level
redundant designs for solid state fault current limiter (SSFCL). The aim of the
proposed analysis is to determine the more reliable component-level redundant
configuration. The mean time to failure (MTTF) is used as the reliability
parameter. Considering both fault types (open circuit and short circuit), the
MTTFs of different configurations are calculated. It is demonstrated that more
reliable configuration depends on the junction temperature of the semiconductor
switches in the steady state. That junction temperature is a function of i)
ambient temperature, ii) power loss of the semiconductor switch and iii)
thermal resistance of heat sink. Also, results sensitivity to each parameter is
investigated. The results show that in different conditions, various
configurations have higher reliability. The experimental results are presented
to clarify the theory and feasibility of the proposed approaches. At last,
levelized costs of different configurations are analyzed for a fair comparison.

Title: A New Update Rule of RLSEKF-based Joint-estimation Filters for Real-time
  SOH SOC Identification

\\
  In order to accurately estimate the SOC and SOH of a lithium-ion battery used
in an electric vehicle (EV), we propose an Adaptive Diagonal Forgetting Factor
Recursive Least Square (ADFF-RLS) for accurate battery parameter estimation.
ADFFRLS includes two new proposals in the existing DFF-RLS; The first is an
excitation tag that changes the behavior of the DFFRLS and the EKF according to
the dynamics of the input data. The second is auto-tuning that automatically
finds the optimal value of RLS forgetting factor based on condition number
(CN). Based on this, we proposed a joint estimation algorithm of ADFF-RLS and
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). To verify the accuracy of the proposed algorithm,
we used experimental data of hybrid pattern battery cells mixed with dynamic
and static patterns. In addition, we added a current measurement error that
occurs when measuring at EV, and realized data that is closer to actual
environment. This data was applied to two conventional estimation algorithms
(Coulomb counting, Single EKF), two joint estimation algorithms (RLS & EKF,
DFF-RLS & EKF) and ADFF-RLS & EKF. As a result, the proposed algorithm showed
higher SOC and SOH estimation accuracy in various driving patterns and actual
EV driving environment than previous studies.

Title: NSM Converges to a k-NN Regressor Under Loose Lipschitz Estimates
Authors: Emilio T. Maddalena and Colin N. Jones
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Although it is known that having accurate Lipschitz estimates is essential
for certain models to deliver good predictive performance, refining this
constant in practice can be a difficult task especially when the input
dimension is high. In this work, we shed light on the consequences of employing
loose Lipschitz bounds in the Nonlinear Set Membership (NSM) framework, showing
that the model converges to a nearest neighbor regressor (k-NN with k=1). This
convergence process is moreover not uniform, and is monotonic in the univariate
case. An intuitive geometrical interpretation of the result is then given and
its practical implications are discussed.

Title: Mobile Robot Path Following Control in 2D Using a 3D Guiding Vector
  Field: Singularity Elimination and Global Convergence
Authors: Weijia Yao, Hector Garcia de Marina, Ming Cao
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  In vector-field-based path following (VF-PF), a vector field is designed and
utilized to guide a robot to follow a desired path. VF-PF algorithms have been
shown to achieve high path-following precision under small control effort
compared with many other path following algorithms. However, due to the
existence of singular points where the vector field vanishes, the global
convergence of VF-PF algorithms to the desired path cannot be guaranteed.
Moreover, as it holds for most of the existing path following algorithms, VF-PF
algorithms may fail to enable following a self-intersected desired path. In
this paper, we propose a method to assist generic VF-PF algorithms in their
global convergence. In particular, our method creates vector fields free of
singular points in a higher-dimensional space containing the lower-dimensional
desired path. Subsequently, the projection of our vector fields on the
lower-dimensional space of the desired path can be exploited to guarantee the
global convergence of the robot to the desired path, including those
self-intersected. Finally, we show that our algorithm combines and fairly
extends features from existing path following algorithms and a nonlinear
trajectory tracking algorithm. The theoretical results have been validated by
experiments and simulations.

Title: Adaptive Safety for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems with Control Barrier
  Functions and Contraction Metrics
Authors: Brett T. Lopez, Jean-Jacques E. Slotine, and Jonathan P. How
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  We present a framework for control of constrained nonlinear systems subject
to structured parametric uncertainty. The approach extends the notion of
adaptive safety to achieve forward invariance of a desired safe set through
online parameter adaptation and data-driven model estimation. This adaptive
safety paradigm is merged with a recent direct adaptive control algorithm for
systems nominally contracting in closed-loop. Because the existence of a
closed-loop contraction metric only requires stabilizability, the proposed
unification is considerably more general than what currently exists, e.g., it
can be applied to underactuated systems. Additionally, our framework is less
expensive than nonlinear model predictive control as it does not require a full
desired trajectory, but rather only a desired terminal state. The approach is
illustrated on the pitch dynamics of an aircraft with uncertain aerodynamics.

Title: Coprime Inner/Outer Factorization of SISO Time-Delay Systems and FIR

\\
  The approach in Foias et al. (1996) is one of the well-developed methods to
design H-infinity controllers for general infinite dimensional systems. This
approach is applicable if the plant admits a special coprime inner/outer
factorization. We give the largest class of single-input-single-output (SISO)
time delay systems for which this factorization is possible and factorize the
admissible plants. Based on this factorization, we compute the optimal
H-infinity performance and eliminate unstable pole-zero cancellations in the
optimal H-infinity controller. We extend the results on the finite impulse
response (FIR) structure of optimal H-infinity controllers by showing that this
structure appears not only for plants with input/output (I/O) delays, but also
for general SISO time-delay plants.

Title: Computation of Extremum Singular Values and the Strong H-infinity Norm
  of SISO Time-Delay Systems
Authors: Suat Gumussoy, Wim Michiels
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Journal-ref: Automatica, volume 54, pages 266-271, 2015
DOI: 10.1016/j.automatica.2015.02.003
\\
  We consider the computation of H-infinity norms for
Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) time-delay systems, which are described by
delay differential algebraic equations. Unlike the iterative level set methods
in the literature, we present a novel numerical method to compute the
H-infinity norm. This method requires solving one eigenvalue problem of at most
twice the size of the eigenvalue problem in every iteration of a level set
method, but in practice often considerably lower. We first show that the
computation of extrema of the transfer function can be turned into the
computation of the imaginary axis zeros of a transcendental function. We
compute these zeros by a predictor-corrector type algorithm. It is known that
the H-infinity norm of delay differential algebraic systems, which can model
both retarded and neutral type systems, might be sensitive with respect to
arbitrarily small delay perturbations. This recently led to the concept of
strong H-infinity norms, which explicitly take into account such small delay
perturbations. We present a direct numerical method to compute the strong
H-infinity norm of SISO time-delay systems. Our algorithm is applicable to the
closed-loop system of interconnections (series, parallel, feedback, junctions)
of time-delay systems and/or controllers.

Title: Identifying DC Faults in HVDC-VSC Systems for Integrating Large Offshore
  Wind -- A Localized Protection Scheme
Authors: Vaibhav Nougain and Sukumar Mishra and George S. Misyris and Spyros
  Chatzivasileiadis
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  We propose a localized protection scheme based on rate of change of Running
Autoregressive Smoothing Average (RASA) of fault limiting reactor voltage in
VSC-HVDC systems. The paper addresses the issues of DC-fault identification,
such as measurement quality, high impedance faults (HIFs) and external faults,
when a localized protection scheme is employed. The scheme is validated to be
selective, dependent and secure for DC fault identification in the presence of
White Gaussian Noise (WGN) in measurement. The scheme operation is validated to
be intact for High Impedance Faults (HIFs) and external faults. Finally, to
validate the performance of our localized protection scheme, we perform a
comparison with already existing ones in the literature.

Title: Constrained Control and Observer Design by Inverse Optimality
Authors: Mario Zanon and Alberto Bemporad
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Submitted for publication
\\
  Tuning Model Predictive Control (MPC) laws often requires trial and error, as
many classical linear control design techniques are not directly applicable. In
this paper we overcome this issue by adopting the controller matching approach
suggested in [1]-[3]. We assume that a baseline linear controller has been
already designed to control the system in the absence of constraints, and that
we want to tune a MPC to satisfy them while delivering the same linear feedback
whenever they are not active. We prove that a positive-definite stage cost
matrix yielding this matching property can be computed for all stabilizing
linear controllers. Additionally, we prove that the constrained estimation
problem can also solved similarly, by matching a linear observer with a Moving
Horizon Estimator (MHE). Finally, we discuss in some examples various aspects
regarding the practical implementation of the proposed technique.

Title: Decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning with shared actions
Authors: Rajesh K Mishra, Deepanshu Vasal, Sriram Vishwanath
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 9 Pages, Two column, 2 figures
\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm
to compute the optimal policies for a multi-agent system with $N$ cooperative
agents where each agent privately observes it's own private type and publicly
observes each others' actions. The goal is to maximize their collective reward.
The problem belongs to the broad class of decentralized control problems with
partial information. We use the common agent approach wherein some fictitious
common agent picks the best policy based on a belief on the current states of
the agents. These beliefs are updated individually for each agent from their
current belief and action histories. Belief state updates without the knowledge
of system dynamics is a challenge. In this paper, we employ particle filters
called the bootstrap filter distributively across agents to update the belief.
We provide a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method for this multi-agent
partially observable Markov decision processes using the particle filter and
sampled trajectories to estimate the optimal policies for the agents. We
showcase our results with the help of a smartgrid application where the users
strive to reduce collective cost of power for all the agents in the grid.
Finally, we compare the performances for model and model-free implementation of
the RL algorithm establishing the effectiveness of particle filter (pf) method.

Title: Estimating Lower Limb Kinematics using Distance Measurements with a
  Reduced Wearable Inertial Sensor Count
Authors: Luke Sy, Nigel H. Lovell, Stephen J. Redmond
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 5 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1910.01808
\\
  This paper presents an algorithm that makes novel use of distance
measurements alongside a constrained Kalman filter to accurately estimate
pelvis, thigh, and shank kinematics for both legs during walking and other body
movements using only three wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs). The
distance measurement formulation also assumes hinge knee joint and constant
body segment length, helping produce estimates that are near or in the
constraint space for better estimator stability. Simulated experiments shown
that inter-IMU distance measurement is indeed a promising new source of
information to improve the pose estimation of inertial motion capture systems
under a reduced sensor count configuration. Furthermore, experiments show that
performance improved dramatically for dynamic movements even at high noise
levels (e.g., $\sigma_{dist} = 0.2$ m), and that acceptable performance for
normal walking was achieved at $\sigma_{dist} = 0.1$ m. Nevertheless, further
validation is recommended using actual distance measurement sensors.

Title: On the minimal set of controllers and sensors for linear power flow

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: To appear in Electric Power Systems Research, to be presented at 21st
  Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC), June 29 - July 3, 2020
\\
  We consider a linear power flow model with interval-bounded nodal power
injections and limited line power flows. We determine the minimal number of
power injections to control based on a minimal set of measurements, such that
the overall system is feasible for all assignments of the non-controlled power
injections. For the important case where the possible measurements are the
nodal power injections, we show that the problem can be solved efficiently as a
mixed-integer linear program (MILP). When also line power flows are considered
as potential measurements, we derive an iterative, greedy algorithm that
provides a feasible, but potentially conservative solution. We apply the
developed algorithms to both a small microgrid and a modified version of the
IEEE 118 bus test power system. We show that in both cases a sparse solution in
terms of the number of required controllers and measurements can be obtained.
Moreover, the number of required measurements can be reduced significantly if
line flow measurements are considered additionally to nodal power injections.

Title: Stochastic Event-based Sensor Schedules for Remote State Estimation in

\\
  We consider the problem of communication allocation for remote state
estimation in a cognitive radio sensor network~(CRSN). A sensor collects
measurements of a physical plant, and transmits the data to a remote estimator
as a secondary user (SU) in the shared network. The existence of the primal
users (PUs) brings exogenous uncertainties into the transmission scheduling
process, and how to design an event-based scheduling scheme considering these
uncertainties has not been addressed in the literature. In this work, we start
from the formulation of a discrete-time remote estimation process in the CRSN,
and then analyze the hidden information contained in the absence of data
transmission. In order to achieve a better tradeoff between estimation
performance and communication consumption, we propose both open-loop and
closed-loop schedules using the hidden information under a Bayesian setting.
The open-loop schedule does not rely on any feedback signal but only works for
stable plants. For unstable plants, a closed-loop schedule is designed based on
feedback signals. The parameter design problems in both schedules are
efficiently solved by convex programming. Numerical simulations are included to
illustrate the theoretical results.

Title: Distributed Set-Based Observers Using Diffusion Strategy
Authors: Amr Alanwar, Jagat Jyoti Rath, Hazem Said, Matthias Althoff
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY eess.SP math.OC
\\
  Distributed estimation is more robust against single points of failure and
requires less communication overhead compared to the centralized version. Among
distributed estimation techniques, set-based estimation has gained much
attention as it provides estimation guarantees for safety-critical applications
and copes with unknown but bounded uncertainties. We propose two distributed
set-based observers using interval-based and set-membership approaches for a
linear discrete-time dynamical system with bounded modeling and measurement
uncertainties. Both algorithms utilize a new over-approximating zonotopes
intersection step named the diffusion step. We use the term diffusion since our
zonotopes intersection formula resembles the traditional diffusion step in the
stochastic Kalman filter. Our diffusion step decreases the estimation errors
and the volume of the estimated sets and can be seen as a lightweight approach
to achieve partial consensus between the distributed estimated sets. Every node
shares its measurement with its neighbor in the measurement update step. The
neighbors intersect their estimated sets constituting our proposed diffusion
step. We represent sets as zonotopes since they compactly represent
high-dimensional sets, and they are closed under linear mapping and Minkowski
addition. The applicability of our algorithms is demonstrated by a localization
example. We make our Matlab code of the proposed algorithms available online.

networks of non-identical nonlinear dynamical systems. We show that the
synchronous dynamics is a solution to the average of the nodes' vector fields,

Title: Moment State Dynamical Systems for Nonlinear Chance-Constrained Motion
  Planning
Authors: Allen Wang, Ashkan Jasour, Brian Williams
Categories: eess.SY cs.RO cs.SC cs.SY
\\
  Chance-constrained motion planning requires uncertainty in dynamics to be
propagated into uncertainty in state. When nonlinear models are used, Gaussian
assumptions on the state distribution do not necessarily apply since almost all
random variables propagated through nonlinear dynamics results in non-Gaussian
state distributions. To address this, recent works have developed moment-based
approaches for enforcing chance-constraints on non-Gaussian state
distributions. However, there still lacks fast and accurate moment propagation
methods to determine the necessary statistical moments of these state
distributions. To address this gap, we present a framework that, given a
stochastic dynamical system, can algorithmically search for a new dynamical
system in terms of moment state that can be used to propagate moments of
disturbance random variables into moments of the state distribution. The key
algorithm, TreeRing, can be applied to a large class of nonlinear systems which
we refer to as trigonometric polynomial systems. As an example application, we
present a distributionally robust RRT (DR-RRT) algorithm that propagates
uncertainty through the nonlinear Dubin's car model without linearization.

  Radar for indoor monitoring is an emerging area of research and development,
covering and supporting different health and wellbeing applications of smart
homes, assisted living, and medical diagnosis. We report on a successful RF
sensing system for home monitoring applications. The system recognizes
Activities of Daily Living(ADL) and detects unique motion characteristics,
using data processing and training algorithms. We also examine the challenges
of continuously monitoring various human activities which can be categorized
into translation motions (active mode) and in-place motions (resting mode). We
use the range-map, offered by a range-Doppler radar, to obtain the transition
time between these two categories, characterized by changing and constant range
values, respectively. This is achieved using the Radon transform that
identifies straight lines of different slopes in the range-map image. Over the
in-place motion time intervals, where activities have insignificant or
negligible range swath, power threshold of the radar return micro-Doppler
signatures,which is employed to define the time-spans of individual activities
with insignificant or negligible range swath. Finding both the transition times
and the time-spans of the different motions leads to improved classifications,
as it avoids decisions rendered over time windows covering mixed activities.

  On-street parking is convenient, but has many disadvantages: on-street spots
come at the expense of other road uses such as traffic lanes, transit lanes,
bike lanes, or parklets; drivers looking for parking contribute substantially
to traffic congestion and hence to greenhouse gas emissions; safety is reduced
both due to the fact that drivers looking for spots are more distracted than
other road users and that people exiting parked cars pose a risk to cyclists.
These social costs may not be worth paying when off-street parking lots are
nearby and have surplus capacity. To see where this might be true in downtown
Vancouver, we used artificial intelligence techniques to estimate the amount of
time it would take drivers to both park on and off street for destinations
throughout the city. For on-street parking, we developed (1) a deep-learning
model of block-by-block parking availability based on data from parking meters
and audits and (2) a computational simulation of drivers searching for an
on-street spot. For off-street parking, we developed a computational simulation
of the time it would take drivers drive from their original destination to the
nearest city-owned off-street lot and then to queue for a spot based on traffic
and lot occupancy data. Finally, in both cases we also computed the time it
would take the driver to walk from their parking spot to their original
destination. We compared these time estimates for destinations in each block of
Vancouver's downtown core and each hour of the day. We found many areas where
off street would actually save drivers time over searching the streets for a
spot, and many more where the time cost for parking off street was small. The
identification of such areas provides an opportunity for the city to repurpose
valuable curbside space for community-friendly uses more in line with its
transportation goals.

Title: A Game-Theoretic Model of Human Driving and Application to Discretionary
  Lane-Changes
Authors: Jehong Yoo and Reza Langari
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.AI cs.GT
Comments: 14 pages, 14 figures
\\
  In this paper we consider the application of Stackelberg game theory to model
discretionary lane-changing in lightly congested highway setting. The
fundamental intent of this model, which is parameterized to capture driver
disposition (aggressiveness or inattentiveness), is to help with the
development of decision-making strategies for autonomous vehicles in ways that
are mindful of how human drivers perform the same function on the road (on
which have reported elsewhere.) This paper, however, focuses only on the model
development and the respective qualitative assessment. This is accomplished in
unit test simulations as well as in bulk mode (i.e. using the Monte Carlo
methodology), via a limited traffic micro-simulation compared against the NHTSA
100-Car Naturalistic Driving Safety data. In particular, a qualitative
comparison shows the relative consistency of the proposed model with human
decision-making in terms of producing qualitatively similar proportions of
crashes and near crashes as a function of driver inattentiveness (or
aggressiveness). While this result by itself does not offer a true quantitative

Title: Evaluation of Parameterized Quantum Circuits: on the design, and the
  relation between classification accuracy, expressibility and entangling
  capability
Authors: Thomas Hubregtsen, Josef Pichlmeier, Koen Bertels
Categories: quant-ph cs.AI
Comments: Pre-Print
\\
  Quantum computers promise improvements in terms of both computational speedup
and increased accuracy. Relevant areas are optimization, chemistry and machine
learning, of which we will focus on the latter. Much of the prior art focuses
on determining computational speedup, but how do we know if a particular
quantum circuit shows promise for achieving high classification accuracy?
Previous work by Sim et al. proposed descriptors to characterize and compare
Parameterized Quantum Circuits. In this work, we will investigate any potential
relation between the classification accuracy and two of these descriptors,
being expressibility and entangling capability. We will first investigate
different types of gates in quantum circuits and the changes they incur on the
decision boundary. From this, we will propose design criteria for constructing
circuits. We will also numerically compare the classifications performance of
various quantum circuits and their quantified measure of expressibility and
entangling capability, as derived in previous work. From this, we conclude that
the common approach to layer combinations of rotational gates and conditional
rotational gates provides the best accuracy. We also show that, for our
experiments on a limited number of circuits, a coarse-grained relationship
exists between entangling capability and classification accuracy, as well as a
more fine-grained correlation between expressibility and classification
accuracy. Future research will need to be performed to quantify this relation.

Title: Information-Theoretic Free Energy as Emotion Potential: Emotional
  Valence as a Function of Complexity and Novelty
Authors: Hideyoshi Yanagisawa
Categories: q-bio.NC cs.AI cs.IT math.IT
\\
  This study extends the mathematical model of emotion dimensions that we
previously proposed (Yanagisawa, et al. 2019, Front Comput Neurosci) to
consider perceived complexity as well as novelty, as a source of arousal
potential. Berlyne's hedonic function of arousal potential (or the inverse
U-shaped curve, the so-called Wundt curve) is assumed. We modeled the arousal
potential as information contents to be processed in the brain after sensory
stimuli are perceived (or recognized), which we termed sensory surprisal. We
mathematically demonstrated that sensory surprisal represents free energy, and
it is equivalent to a summation of information gain (or information from
novelty) and perceived complexity (or information from complexity), which are
the collative variables forming the arousal potential. We demonstrated
empirical evidence with visual stimuli (profile shapes of butterfly) supporting
the hypothesis that the summation of perceived novelty and complexity shapes
the inverse U-shaped beauty function. We discussed the potential of free energy
as a mathematical principle explaining emotion initiators.

\\
  Breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation plays a crucial role in a
computer-aided diagnosis system, which is regarded as a useful tool to help
increase the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis. Recently, many deep learning
methods have been developed for segmentation of BUS image and show some
advantages compared with conventional region-, model-, and traditional
learning-based methods. However, previous deep learning methods typically use
skip-connection to concatenate the encoder and decoder, which might not make
full fusion of coarse-to-fine features from encoder and decoder. Since the
structure and edge of lesion in BUS image are common blurred, these would make
it difficult to learn the discriminant information of structure and edge, and
reduce the performance. To this end, we propose and evaluate a coarse-to-fine
fusion convolutional network (CF2-Net) based on a novel feature integration
strategy (forming an 'E'-like type) for BUS image segmentation. To enhance
contour and provide structural information, we concatenate a super-pixel image
and the original image as the input of CF2-Net. Meanwhile, to highlight the
differences in the lesion regions with variable sizes and relieve the imbalance
issue, we further design a weighted-balanced loss function to train the CF2-Net
effectively. The proposed CF2-Net was evaluated on an open dataset by using
four-fold cross validation. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the
CF2-Net obtains state-of-the-art performance when compared with other deep
learning-based methods

\\
  This work proposes improvements in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording
protocols for motor imagery through the introduction of actual motor movement
and/or somatosensory cues. The results obtained demonstrate the advantage of
requiring the subjects to perform motor actions following the trials of
imagery. By introducing motor actions in the protocol, the subjects are able to
perform actual motor planning, rather than just visualizing the motor movement,
thus greatly improving the ease with which the motor movements can be imagined.
This study also probes the added advantage of administering somatosensory cues
in the subject, as opposed to the conventional auditory/visual cues. These
changes in the protocol show promise in terms of the aptness of the spatial
filters obtained on the data, on application of the well-known common spatial
pattern (CSP) algorithms. The regions highlighted by the spatial filters are
more localized and consistent across the subjects when the protocol is
augmented with somatosensory stimuli. Hence, we suggest that this may prove to
be a better EEG acquisition protocol for detecting brain activation in response
to intended motor commands in (clinically) paralyzed/locked-in patients.

\\
  This paper proposes a novel approach that uses deep neural networks for
classifying imagined speech, significantly increasing the classification
accuracy. The proposed approach employs only the EEG channels over specific
areas of the brain for classification, and derives distinct feature vectors
from each of those channels. This gives us more data to train a classifier,
enabling us to use deep learning approaches. Wavelet and temporal domain
features are extracted from each channel. The final class label of each test
trial is obtained by applying a majority voting on the classification results
of the individual channels considered in the trial. This approach is used for
classifying all the 11 prompts in the KaraOne dataset of imagined speech. The
proposed architecture and the approach of treating the data have resulted in an
average classification accuracy of 57.15%, which is an improvement of around
35% over the state-of-the-art results.

  We consider three classes of geodesic embeddings of graphs on Euclidean flat
tori: (1) A torus graph $G$ is equilibrium if it is possible to place positive
weights on the edges, such that the weighted edge vectors incident to each
vertex of G sum to zero. (2) A torus graph $G$ is reciprocal if there is a
geodesic embedding of the dual graph $G^*$ on the same flat torus, where each
edge of G is orthogonal to the corresponding dual edge in $G^*$. (3) A torus
graph $G$ is coherent if it is possible to assign weights to the vertices, so
that $G$ is the (intrinsic) weighted Delaunay graph of its vertices. The
classical Maxwell-Cremona correspondence and the well-known correspondence
between convex hulls and weighted Delaunay triangulations imply that the
analogous concepts for plane graphs (with convex outer faces) are equivalent.
Indeed, all three conditions are equivalent to $G$ being the projection of the
1-skeleton of the lower convex hull of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$. However, this
three-way equivalence does not extend directly to geodesic graphs on flat tori.
On any flat torus, reciprocal and coherent graphs are equivalent, and every
reciprocal graph is equilibrium, but not every equilibrium graph is reciprocal.
We establish a weaker correspondence: Every equilibrium graph on any flat torus
is affinely equivalent to a reciprocal/coherent graph on some flat torus.

Title: Intuitive Understanding of Quantum Computation and Post-Quantum

\\
  Post-quantum cryptography is inevitable. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) starts standardizing quantum-resistant public-key
cryptography (aka post-quantum cryptography). The reason is that investment in
quantum computing is blooming which poses significant threats to our currently
deployed cryptographic algorithms. As a security engineer, to prepare for the
apocalypse in advance, I've been watching the development of quantum computers
and post-quantum cryptography closely. Never mind, I simply made up an excuse
to study these fascinating scientific fields. However, they are extremely hard
to understand, at least to an amateur like me. This article shares with you my
notes with the hope that you will have an intuitive understanding of the
beautiful and mind-blowing quantum algorithms and post-quantum cryptography.

  Most of the existing works in video synthesis focus on generating videos
using adversarial learning. Despite their success, these methods often require
input reference frame or fail to generate diverse videos from the given data
distribution, with little to no uniformity in the quality of videos that can be
generated. Different from these methods, we focus on the problem of generating
videos from latent noise vectors, without any reference input frames. To this
end, we develop a novel approach that jointly optimizes the input latent space,
the weights of a recurrent neural network and a generator through
non-adversarial learning. Optimizing for the input latent space along with the
network weights allows us to generate videos in a controlled environment, i.e.,
we can faithfully generate all videos the model has seen during the learning
process as well as new unseen videos. Extensive experiments on three
challenging and diverse datasets well demonstrate that our approach generates
superior quality videos compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

  Since Particulate Matters (PMs) are closely related to people's living and
health, it has become one of the most important indicator of air quality
monitoring around the world. But the existing sensor-based methods for PM
monitoring have remarkable disadvantages, such as low-density monitoring
stations and high-requirement monitoring conditions. It is highly desired to
devise a method that can obtain the PM concentration at any location for the
following air quality control in time. The prior works indicate that the PM
concentration can be monitored by using ubiquitous photos. To further
investigate such issue, we gathered 1,500 photos in big cities to establish a
new AQPDCITY dataset. Experiments conducted to check nine state-of-the-art
methods on this dataset show that the performance of those above methods
perform poorly in the AQPDCITY dataset.

Title: Bridge the Domain Gap Between Ultra-wide-field and Traditional Fundus
  Images via Adversarial Domain Adaptation
Authors: Lie Ju, Xin Wang, Quan Zhou, Hu Zhu, Mehrtash Harandi, Paul

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  For decades, advances in retinal imaging technology have enabled effective
diagnosis and management of retinal disease using fundus cameras. Recently,
ultra-wide-field (UWF) fundus imaging by Optos camera is gradually put into use
because of its broader insights on fundus for some lesions that are not
typically seen in traditional fundus images. Research on traditional fundus
images is an active topic but studies on UWF fundus images are few. One of the
most important reasons is that UWF fundus images are hard to obtain. In this
paper, for the first time, we explore domain adaptation from the traditional
fundus to UWF fundus images. We propose a flexible framework to bridge the
domain gap between two domains and co-train a UWF fundus diagnosis model by
pseudo-labelling and adversarial learning. We design a regularisation technique
to regulate the domain adaptation. Also, we apply MixUp to overcome the
over-fitting issue from incorrect generated pseudo-labels. Our experimental
results on either single or both domains demonstrate that the proposed method
can well adapt and transfer the knowledge from traditional fundus images to UWF
fundus images and improve the performance of retinal disease recognition.

in conjunction with an adversarial critic model. It generalized well to CXR

  Ambiguity is inherently present in many machine learning tasks, but
especially for sequential models seldom accounted for, as most only output a
single prediction. In this work we propose an extension of the Multiple
Hypothesis Prediction (MHP) model to handle ambiguous predictions with
sequential data, which is of special importance, as often multiple futures are
equally likely. Our approach can be applied to the most common recurrent
architectures and can be used with any loss function. Additionally, we
introduce a novel metric for ambiguous problems, which is better suited to
account for uncertainties and coincides with our intuitive understanding of
correctness in the presence of multiple labels. We test our method on several
experiments and across diverse tasks dealing with time series data, such as
trajectory forecasting and maneuver prediction, achieving promising results.

\\
  Optimized sensing is important for computational imaging in low-resource
environments, when images must be recovered from severely limited measurements.
In this paper, we propose a physics-constrained, fully differentiable,
autoencoder that learns a probabilistic sensor-sampling strategy for optimized
sensor design. The proposed method learns a system's preferred sampling
distribution that characterizes the correlations between different sensor
selections as a binary, fully-connected Ising model. The learned probabilistic
model is achieved by using a Gibbs sampling inspired network architecture, and
is trained end-to-end with a reconstruction network for efficient co-design.
The proposed framework is applicable to sensor selection problems in a variety
of computational imaging applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the
approach in the context of a very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) array
design task, where sensor correlations and atmospheric noise present unique
challenges. We demonstrate results broadly consistent with expectation, and
draw attention to particular structures preferred in the telescope array
geometry that can be leveraged to plan future observations and design array
expansions.

Title: Deep Unfolding Network for Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Kai Zhang, Luc Van Gool, Radu Timofte
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020. Project page: https://github.com/cszn/USRNet
\\
  Learning-based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods are continuously
showing superior effectiveness and efficiency over traditional model-based
methods, largely due to the end-to-end training. However, different from
model-based methods that can handle the SISR problem with different scale
factors, blur kernels and noise levels under a unified MAP (maximum a
posteriori) framework, learning-based methods generally lack such flexibility.
To address this issue, this paper proposes an end-to-end trainable unfolding
network which leverages both learning-based methods and model-based methods.
Specifically, by unfolding the MAP inference via a half-quadratic splitting
algorithm, a fixed number of iterations consisting of alternately solving a
data subproblem and a prior subproblem can be obtained. The two subproblems
then can be solved with neural modules, resulting in an end-to-end trainable,
iterative network. As a result, the proposed network inherits the flexibility
of model-based methods to super-resolve blurry, noisy images for different
scale factors via a single model, while maintaining the advantages of
learning-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed deep unfolding network in terms of flexibility, effectiveness and
also generalizability.

  The obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea (OSAH) syndrome is a very common and
frequently undiagnosed sleep disorder. It is characterized by repeated events
of partial (hypopnea) or total (apnea) obstruction of the upper airway while
sleeping. This study makes use of a previously developed method called DAS-KSVD
for multiclass structured dictionary learning to automatically detect
individual events of apnea and hypopnea using only blood oxygen saturation
signals. The method uses a combined discriminant measure which is capable of
efficiently quantifying the degree of discriminability of each one of the atoms
in a dictionary. DAS-KSVD was applied to detect and classify apnea and hypopnea
events from signals obtained from the Sleep Heart Health Study database. For
moderate to severe OSAH screening, a receiver operating characteristic curve
analysis of the results shows an area under the curve of 0.957 and diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity of 87.56% and 88.32%, respectively. These results
represent improvements as compared to most state-of-the-art procedures. Hence,
the method could be used for screening OSAH syndrome more reliably and
conveniently, using only a pulse oximeter.

Categories: math.PR cs.DC
\\
  Computing with synthetically modified bacteria is a vibrant and active field
with numerous applications in bio-production, bio-sensors, and medicine.
Recently, distributed approaches with communication among bacteria have gained
interest, motivated by a lack of robustness and by resource limitations in
single cells. In this paper, we focus on the problem of population growth
happening in parallel, and possibly interfering, with the desired protocol.
Specifically, we present a fast protocol in systems with continuous population
growth for the majority consensus problem and prove that it correctly
identifies the initial majority among two inputs with high probability if the
initial difference is $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ where $n$ is the total initial
population. We also present a fast protocol that correctly computes the NAND of
two inputs with high probability. Combining both protocols, using the majority
consensus protocol as an amplifier stage, it is possible to implement circuits
computing arbitrary Boolean functions.

process modeling the spread of genetic mutations in populations. In this
process, agents of a two-type population (i.e. mutants and residents) are
associated with the vertices of a graph. Initially, only one vertex chosen
u.a.r. is a mutant, with fitness $r > 0$, while all other individuals are
residents, with fitness $1$. In every step, an individual is chosen with
probability proportional to its fitness, and its state (mutant or resident) is
passed on to a neighbor which is chosen u.a.r. In this paper, we introduce and
study for the first time a generalization of the model of [L05] by assuming
that different types of individuals perceive the population through different
graphs, namely $G_R(V,E_R)$ for residents and $G_M(V,E_M)$ for mutants. In this
model, we study the fixation probability, i.e. the probability that eventually
only mutants remain in the population, for various pairs of graphs.
  First, we transfer known results from the original single-graph model of
[L05] to our 2-graph model. Among them, we provide a generalization of the
Isothermal Theorem of [L05], that gives sufficient conditions for a pair of
graphs to have the same fixation probability as a pair of cliques.
  Next, we give a 2-player strategic game view of the process where player
payoffs correspond to fixation and/or extinction probabilities. In this
setting, we attempt to identify best responses for each player and give
evidence that the clique is the most beneficial graph for both players.
  Finally, we examine the possibility of efficient approximation of the
fixation probability. We show that the fixation probability in the general case
of an arbitrary pair of graphs cannot be approximated via a method similar to
[D14]. Nevertheless, we provide a FPRAS for the special case where the mutant
graph is complete.

  The Cantor distribution is obtained from bitstrings; the Cantor-solus
distribution (a new name) admits only strings without adjacent 1 bits. We
review moments and order statistics associated with these. The Cantor-multus
distribution is introduced -- which instead admits only strings without
isolated 1 bits -- and more complicated formulas emerge.

Title: A proof of the Total Coloring Conjecture
Authors: T Srinivasa Murthy
Categories: math.CO cs.DM
MSC-class: 05C15 (primary), 11T06, 11T55 (secondary)
\\
  A $total\ coloring$ of a graph G is a map $f:V(G) \cup E(G) \rightarrow
\mathcal{K}$, where $\mathcal{K}$ is a set of colors, satisfying the following
three conditions: 1. $f(u) \neq f(v)$ for any two adjacent vertices $u, v \in
V(G)$; 2. $f(e) \neq f(e')$ for any two adjacent edges $e, e' \in E(G)$; and 3.
$f(v) \neq f(e)$ for any vertex $v \in V(G)$ and any edge $e \in E(G)$ that is
incident to same vertex $v$. The $total\ chromatic\ number$, $\chi''(G)$, is
the minimum number of colors required for a $total\ coloring$ of $G$. Behzad
and Vizing independently conjectured that, for any graph $G$, $\chi''(G)\leq
\Delta + 2$. This is one of the classic mathematical unsolved problems. In this
paper, we settle this classical conjecture by proving that the $total\
chromatic\ number$ $\chi''(G)$ of a graph is indeed bounded above by
$\Delta+2$. Our novel approach involves algebraic settings over finite field
$\mathbb{Z}_p$ and application of combinatorial nullstellensatz.

Title: Spectral Clustering Revisited: Information Hidden in the Fiedler Vector
Authors: Adela DePavia, Stefan Steinerberger
Categories: math.PR cs.DM cs.LG math.SP stat.ML
\\
  We are interested in the clustering problem on graphs: it is known that if
there are two underlying clusters, then the signs of the eigenvector
corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix can
reliably reconstruct the two clusters. We argue that the vertices for which the
eigenvector has the largest and the smallest entries, respectively, are
unusually strongly connected to their own cluster and more reliably classified
than the rest. This can be regarded as a discrete version of the Hot Spots
conjecture and should be useful in applications. We give a rigorous proof for
the stochastic block model and several examples.

Title: Hidden Words Statistics for Large Patterns
Authors: Svante Janson and Wojciech Szpankowski
Categories: math.PR cs.DS
Comments: 22 pages
\\
  We study here the so called subsequence pattern matching also known as hidden
pattern matching in which one searches for a given pattern $w$ of length $m$ as
a subsequence in a random text of length $n$. The quantity of interest is the
number of occurrences of $w$ as a subsequence (i.e., occurring in not
necessarily consecutive text locations). This problem finds many applications
from intrusion detection, to trace reconstruction, to deletion channel, and to
DNA-based storage systems. In all of these applications, the pattern $w$ is of
variable length. To the best of our knowledge this problem was only tackled for
a fixed length $m=O(1)$ [Flajolet, Szpankowski and Vall\'ee, 2006]. In our main
result we prove that for $m=o(n^{1/3})$ the number of subsequence occurrences
is normally distributed. In addition, we show that under some constraints on
the structure of $w$ the asymptotic normality can be extended to
$m=o(\sqrt{n})$. For a special pattern $w$ consisting of the same symbol, we
indicate that for $m=o(n)$ the distribution of number of subsequences is either
asymptotically normal or asymptotically log normal. We conjecture that this
dichotomy is true for all patterns. We use Hoeffding's projection method for
$U$-statistics to prove our findings.

Title: Scaling up Kernel Ridge Regression via Locality Sensitive Hashing
Authors: Michael Kapralov, Navid Nouri, Ilya Razenshteyn, Ameya Velingker, Amir
  Zandieh
Categories: stat.ML cs.DS cs.LG
\\
  Random binning features, introduced in the seminal paper of Rahimi and Recht
(2007), are an efficient method for approximating a kernel matrix using
locality sensitive hashing. Random binning features provide a very simple and
efficient way of approximating the Laplace kernel but unfortunately do not
apply to many important classes of kernels, notably ones that generate smooth
Gaussian processes, such as the Gaussian kernel and Matern kernel. In this
paper, we introduce a simple weighted version of random binning features and
show that the corresponding kernel function generates Gaussian processes of any
desired smoothness. We show that our weighted random binning features provide a
spectral approximation to the corresponding kernel matrix, leading to efficient
algorithms for kernel ridge regression. Experiments on large scale regression
datasets show that our method outperforms the accuracy of random Fourier
features method.

\\
  Owing to their stability and convergence speed, extragradient methods have
become a staple for solving large-scale saddle-point problems in machine
learning. The basic premise of these algorithms is the use of an extrapolation
step before performing an update; thanks to this exploration step,
extra-gradient methods overcome many of the non-convergence issues that plague
gradient descent/ascent schemes. On the other hand, as we show in this paper,
running vanilla extragradient with stochastic gradients may jeopardize its
convergence, even in simple bilinear models. To overcome this failure, we
investigate a double stepsize extragradient algorithm where the exploration
step evolves at a more aggressive time-scale compared to the update step. We
show that this modification allows the method to converge even with stochastic
gradients, and we derive sharp convergence rates under an error bound
condition.

  We consider the stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium problem (SGNEP) with
joint feasibility constraints and expected-value cost functions. We propose a
distributed stochastic preconditioned projected reflected gradient algorithm
and show its almost sure convergence when the pseudogradient mapping is
cocoercive. The algorithm is based on monotone operator splitting methods for
SGNEPs when the expected-value pseudogradient mapping is approximated at each
iteration via an increasing number of samples of the random variable, an
approach known as sample average approximation. Finally, we show that a
non-preconditioned variant of our proposed algorithm has less restrictive
convergence guarantees than state-of-the-art (preconditioned) forward-backward
algorithms.

Title: Variations on a Demonic Theme: Szilard's Other Engines

\\
  Szilard's now-famous single-molecule engine was only the first of three
constructions he introduced in 1929 to resolve several paradoxes arising from
Maxwell's demon. We analyze Szilard's remaining two demon models. We show that
the second one, though a markedly different implementation employing a
population of distinct molecular species and semi-permeable membranes, is
informationally and thermodynamically equivalent to an ideal gas of the
single-molecule engines. Since it is a gas of noninteracting particles one
concludes, following Boyd and Crutchfield, that (i) it reduces to a chaotic
dynamical system---called the Szilard Map, a composite of three piecewise
linear maps that implement the thermodynamic transformations of measurement,
control, and erasure; (ii) its transitory functioning as an engine that
converts disorganized heat energy to work is governed by the Kolmogorov-Sinai
entropy rate; (iii) the demon's minimum necessary "intelligence" for optimal
functioning is given by the engine's statistical complexity, and (iv) its
functioning saturates thermodynamic bounds and so it is a minimal, optimal
implementation. We show that Szilard's third model is rather different and
addresses the fundamental issue, raised by the first two, of measurement in and
by thermodynamic systems and entropy generation. Taken together, Szilard's
suite of constructions lays out a range of possible realizations of Maxwellian
demons that anticipated by almost two decades Shannon's and Wiener's concept of
information as surprise and cybernetics' notion of functional information.
This, in turn, gives new insight into engineering implementations of novel
nanoscale information engines that leverage microscopic fluctuations and into
the diversity of thermodynamic mechanisms and intrinsic computation harnessed
in physical, molecular, biochemical, and biological systems.

Title: Hypergraph Clustering in the Weighted Stochastic Block Model via Convex
  Relaxation of Truncated MLE
Authors: Jeonghwan Lee, Daesung Kim and Hye Won Chung
Categories: stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
Comments: 37 pages, 1 figure
\\
  We study hypergraph clustering under the weighted $d$-uniform hypergraph
stochastic block model ($d$-WHSBM), where each edge consisting of $d$ nodes has
higher expected weight if $d$ nodes are from the same community compared to
edges consisting of nodes from different communities. We propose a new
hypergraph clustering algorithm, which is a convex relaxation of truncated
maximum likelihood estimator (CRTMLE), that can handle the relatively sparse,
high-dimensional regime of the $d$-WHSBM with community sizes of different
orders. We provide performance guarantees of this algorithm under a unified
framework for different parameter regimes, and show that it achieves the
order-wise optimal or the best existing results for approximately balanced
community sizes. We also demonstrate the first recovery guarantees for the
setting with growing number of communities of unbalanced sizes.

Title: On the intersection distribution of degree three polynomials and related
  topics
Authors: Gohar Kyureghyan, Shuxing Li, Alexander Pott
Categories: math.CO cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 24 pages, submitted
\\
  The intersection distribution of a polynomial $f$ over finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$ was recently proposed in Li and Pott (arXiv:2003.06678v1), which
concerns the collective behaviour of a collection of polynomials $\{f(x)+cx
\mid c \in \mathbb{F}_q\}$. The intersection distribution has an underlying
geometric interpretation, which indicates the intersection pattern between the
graph of $f$ and the lines in the affine plane $AG(2,q)$. When $q$ is even, the
long-standing open problem of classifying o-polynomials can be rephrased in a
simple way, namely, classifying all polynomials which have the same
intersection distribution as $x^2$. Inspired by this connection, we proceed to
consider the next simplest case and derive the intersection distribution for
all degree three polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ both odd and even.
Moreover, we initiate to classify all monomials having the same intersection
distribution as $x^3$, where some characterizations of such monomials are
obtained and a conjecture is proposed. In addition, two applications of the
intersection distributions of degree three polynomials are presented. The first
one is the construction of nonisomorphic Steiner triple systems and the second
one produces infinite families of Kakeya sets in affine planes with previously
unknown sizes.

Title: Improved Lower Bounds for Permutation Arrays Using Permutation Rational
  Functions
Authors: Sergey Bereg, Brian Malouf, Linda Morales, Thomas Stanley, I. Hal
  Sudborough
Categories: math.CO cs.IT math.IT
\\
  We consider rational functions of the form $V(x)/U(x)$, where both $V(x)$ and
$U(x)$ are polynomials over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. Polynomials that
permute the elements of a field, called {\it permutation polynomials ($PPs$)},
have been the subject of research for decades. Let ${\mathcal
P}^1(\mathbb{F}_q)$ denote $\mathbb{Z}_q \cup \{\infty\}$. If the rational
function, $V(x)/U(x)$, permutes the elements of ${\mathcal P}^1(\mathbb{F}_q)$,
it is called a {\em permutation rational function (PRf)}. Let $N_d(q)$ denote
the number of PPs of degree $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $N_{v,u}(q)$
denote the number of PRfs with a numerator of degree $v$ and a denominator of
degree $u$. It follows that $N_{d,0}(q) = N_d(q)$, so PRFs are a generalization
of PPs. The number of monic degree 3 PRfs is known [11]. We develop efficient
computational techniques for $N_{v,u}(q)$, and use them to show $N_{4,3}(q) =
(q+1)q^2(q-1)^2/3$, for all prime powers $q \le 307$, $N_{5,4}(q) >
(q+1)q^3(q-1)^2/2$, for all prime powers $q \le 97$, and $N_{4,4}(p) =
(p+1)p^2(p-1)^3/3$, for all primes $p \le 47$. We conjecture that these
formulas are, in fact, true for all prime powers $q$. Let $M(n,D)$ denote the
maximum number of permutations on $n$ symbols with pairwise Hamming distance
$D$. Computing improved lower bounds for $M(n,D)$ is the subject of much
current research with applications in error correcting codes. Using PRfs, we
obtain significantly improved lower bounds on $M(q,q-d)$ and $M(q+1,q-d)$, for
$d \in \{5,7,9\}$.

Title: Data-Aided Channel Estimator for MIMO Systems via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yo-Seb Jeon, Jun Li, Nima Tavangaran, and H. Vincent Poor
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  This paper presents a data-aided channel estimator that reduces the channel
estimation error of the conventional linear minimum-mean-squared-error (LMMSE)
method for multiple-input multiple-output communication systems. The basic idea
is to selectively exploit detected symbol vectors obtained from data detection
as additional pilot signals. To optimize the selection of the detected symbol
vectors, a Markov decision process (MDP) is defined which finds the best
selection to minimize the mean-squared-error (MSE) of the channel estimate.
Then a reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to solve this MDP in a
computationally efficient manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the
presented channel estimator significantly reduces the MSE of the channel
estimate and therefore improves the block error rate of the system, compared to
the conventional LMMSE method.

  Any integral convex polytope $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ provides a $N$-dimensional
toric variety $X_P$ and an ample divisor $D_P$ on this variety. This paper
gives an explicit construction of the algebraic geometric error-correcting code
on $X_P$ , obtained by evaluating global section of $\mathcal{L}(D_P)$ on every
rational point of $X_P$. This work presents an extension of toric codes
analogous to the one of Reed-Muller codes into projective ones, by evaluating
on the whole variety instead of considering only points with non-zero
coordinates. The dimension of the code is given in terms of the number of
integral points in the polytope $P$ and an algorithmic technique to get a
lowerbound on the minimum distance is described.

Title: aphBO-2GP-3B: A budgeted asynchronously-parallel multi-acquisition for

  architecture

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO
\\
  High-fidelity complex engineering simulations are highly predictive, but also
computationally expensive and often require substantial computational efforts.
The mitigation of computational burden is usually enabled through parallelism
in high-performance cluster (HPC) architecture. In this paper, an asynchronous
constrained batch-parallel Bayesian optimization method is proposed to
efficiently solve the computationally-expensive simulation-based optimization
problems on the HPC platform, with a budgeted computational resource, where the
maximum number of simulations is a constant. The advantages of this method are
three-fold. First, the efficiency of the Bayesian optimization is improved,
where multiple input locations are evaluated massively parallel in an
asynchronous manner to accelerate the optimization convergence with respect to
physical runtime. This efficiency feature is further improved so that when each
of the inputs is finished, another input is queried without waiting for the
whole batch to complete. Second, the method can handle both known and unknown
constraints. Third, the proposed method considers several acquisition functions
at the same time and sample based on an evolving probability mass distribution
function using GP-Hedge scheme, where parameters are corresponding to the
performance of each acquisition function. The proposed framework is termed
aphBO-2GP-3B, which corresponds to asynchronous parallel hedge Bayesian
optimization with two Gaussian processes and three batches. The aphBO-2GP-3B
framework is demonstrated using two high-fidelity expensive industrial
applications, where the first one is based on finite element analysis (FEA) and
the second one is based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.

Title: Learning reduced systems via deep neural networks with memory
Authors: Xiaohan Fu, Lo-bin Chang, Dongbin Xiu
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We present a general numerical approach for constructing governing equations
for unknown dynamical systems when only data on a subset of the state variables
are available. The unknown equations for these observed variables are thus a
reduced system of the complete set of state variables. Reduced systems possess
memory integrals, based on the well known Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formulism. Our
numerical strategy to recover the reduced system starts by formulating a
discrete approximation of the memory integral in the MZ formulation. The
resulting unknown approximate MZ equations are of finite dimensional, in the
sense that a finite number of past history data are involved. We then present a
deep neural network structure that directly incorporates the history terms to
produce memory in the network. The approach is suitable for any practical
systems with finite memory length. We then use a set of numerical examples to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Title: Weighted Meta-Learning

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 18 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Meta-learning leverages related source tasks to learn an initialization that
can be quickly fine-tuned to a target task with limited labeled examples.
However, many popular meta-learning algorithms, such as model-agnostic
meta-learning (MAML), only assume access to the target samples for fine-tuning.
In this work, we provide a general framework for meta-learning based on
weighting the loss of different source tasks, where the weights are allowed to
depend on the target samples. In this general setting, we provide upper bounds
on the distance of the weighted empirical risk of the source tasks and expected
target risk in terms of an integral probability metric (IPM) and Rademacher
complexity, which apply to a number of meta-learning settings including MAML
and a weighted MAML variant. We then develop a learning algorithm based on
minimizing the error bound with respect to an empirical IPM, including a
weighted MAML algorithm, $\alpha$-MAML. Finally, we demonstrate empirically on
several regression problems that our weighted meta-learning algorithm is able
to find better initializations than uniformly-weighted meta-learning
algorithms, such as MAML.

such as an inverse Fourier transform for MRI, work well for recovering clean
images from the measured data. Unfortunately in the case of X-Ray CT, where
undersampled data is very common, more than this is needed to resolve faithful
and usable images. In this paper, we explore the history of classical methods
for solving the inverse problem for X-Ray CT, followed by an analysis of the
state of the art methods that utilize supervised deep learning. Finally, we
will provide some possible avenues for research in the future.

Title: A new regret analysis for Adam-type algorithms
Authors: Ahmet Alacaoglu, Yura Malitsky, Panayotis Mertikopoulos, Volkan Cevher
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.OC
\\
  In this paper, we focus on a theory-practice gap for Adam and its variants
(AMSgrad, AdamNC, etc.). In practice, these algorithms are used with a constant
first-order moment parameter $\beta_{1}$ (typically between $0.9$ and $0.99$).
In theory, regret guarantees for online convex optimization require a rapidly
decaying $\beta_{1}\to0$ schedule. We show that this is an artifact of the
standard analysis and propose a novel framework that allows us to derive
optimal, data-dependent regret bounds with a constant $\beta_{1}$, without
further assumptions. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our analysis on a
wide range of different algorithms and settings.

Title: Generative Adversarial Networks for LHCb Fast Simulation
Authors: Fedor Ratnikov
Categories: physics.ins-det cs.LG hep-ex
Comments: Proceedings for 24th International Conference on Computing in High
  Energy and Nuclear Physics
\\
  LHCb is one of the major experiments operating at the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN. The richness of the physics program and the increasing precision of
the measurements in LHCb lead to the need of ever larger simulated samples.
This need will increase further when the upgraded LHCb detector will start
collecting data in the LHC Run 3. Given the computing resources pledged for the
production of Monte Carlo simulated events in the next years, the use of fast
simulation techniques will be mandatory to cope with the expected dataset size.
In LHCb generative models, which are nowadays widely used for computer vision
and image processing are being investigated in order to accelerate the
generation of showers in the calorimeter and high-level responses of Cherenkov
detector. We demonstrate that this approach provides high-fidelity results
along with a significant speed increase and discuss possible implication of
these results. We also present an implementation of this algorithm into LHCb
simulation software and validation tests.

Title: Audio Impairment Recognition Using a Correlation-Based Feature
  Representation

Comments: This publication has been accepted in 2020 Twelfth International
  Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)
\\
  Audio impairment recognition is based on finding noise in audio files and
categorising the impairment type. Recently, significant performance improvement
has been obtained thanks to the usage of advanced deep learning models.
However, feature robustness is still an unresolved issue and it is one of the
main reasons why we need powerful deep learning architectures. In the presence
of a variety of musical styles, hand-crafted features are less efficient in
capturing audio degradation characteristics and they are prone to failure when
recognising audio impairments and could mistakenly learn musical concepts
rather than impairment types. In this paper, we propose a new representation of
hand-crafted features that is based on the correlation of feature pairs. We
experimentally compare the proposed correlation-based feature representation
with a typical raw feature representation used in machine learning and we show
superior performance in terms of compact feature dimensionality and improved
computational speed in the test stage whilst achieving comparable accuracy.

Title: Efficient Clustering for Stretched Mixtures: Landscape and Optimality

Comments: 32 pages
MSC-class: 62H30
\\
  This paper considers a canonical clustering problem where one receives
unlabeled samples drawn from a balanced mixture of two elliptical distributions
and aims for a classifier to estimate the labels. Many popular methods
including PCA and k-means require individual components of the mixture to be
somewhat spherical, and perform poorly when they are stretched. To overcome
this issue, we propose a non-convex program seeking for an affine transform to
turn the data into a one-dimensional point cloud concentrating around -1 and 1,
after which clustering becomes easy. Our theoretical contributions are
two-fold: (1) we show that the non-convex loss function exhibits desirable
landscape properties as long as the sample size exceeds some constant multiple
of the dimension, and (2) we leverage this to prove that an efficient
first-order algorithm achieves near-optimal statistical precision even without
good initialization. We also propose a general methodology for multi-class
clustering tasks with flexible choices of feature transforms and loss
objectives.

Categories: gr-qc cs.LG
\\
  Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was the first
laboratory to measure the gravitational waves. It was needed an exceptional
experimental design to measure distance changes much less than a radius of a
proton. In the same way, the data analyses to confirm and extract information
is a tremendously hard task. Here, it is shown a computational procedure base
on artificial neural networks to detect a gravitation wave event and extract
the knowledge of its ring-down time from the LIGO data. With this proposal, it
is possible to make a probabilistic thermometer for gravitational wave
detection and obtain physical information about the astronomical body system
that created the phenomenon. Here, the ring-down time is determined with a
direct data measure, without the need to use numerical relativity techniques
and high computational power.

Title: Reinforcement Learning in Economics and Finance
Authors: Arthur Charpentier and Romuald Elie and Carl Remlinger
Categories: econ.TH cs.LG q-fin.CP
\\
  Reinforcement learning algorithms describe how an agent can learn an optimal
action policy in a sequential decision process, through repeated experience. In
a given environment, the agent policy provides him some running and terminal
rewards. As in online learning, the agent learns sequentially. As in
multi-armed bandit problems, when an agent picks an action, he can not infer
ex-post the rewards induced by other action choices. In reinforcement learning,
his actions have consequences: they influence not only rewards, but also future
states of the world. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find an optimal
policy -- a mapping from the states of the world to the set of actions, in
order to maximize cumulative reward, which is a long term strategy. Exploring
might be sub-optimal on a short-term horizon but could lead to optimal
long-term ones. Many problems of optimal control, popular in economics for more
than forty years, can be expressed in the reinforcement learning framework, and
recent advances in computational science, provided in particular by deep
learning algorithms, can be used by economists in order to solve complex
behavioral problems. In this article, we propose a state-of-the-art of
reinforcement learning techniques, and present applications in economics, game
theory, operation research and finance.

Title: QC-SPHRAM: Quasi-conformal Spherical Harmonics Based Geometric
  Distortions on Hippocampal Surfaces for Early Detection of the Alzheimer's
  Disease
Authors: Anthony Hei-Long Chan, Yishan Luo, Lin Shi, Ronald Lok-Ming Lui
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose a disease classification model, called the QC-SPHARM, for the
early detection of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The proposed QC-SPHARM can
distinguish between normal control (NC) subjects and AD patients, as well as
between amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients having high
possibility progressing into AD and those who do not. Using the spherical
harmonics (SPHARM) based registration, hippocampal surfaces segmented from the
ADNI data are individually registered to a template surface constructed from
the NC subjects using SPHARM. Local geometric distortions of the deformation
from the template surface to each subject are quantified in terms of
conformality distortions and curvatures distortions. The measurements are
combined with the spherical harmonics coefficients and the total volume change
of the subject from the template. Afterwards, a t-test based feature selection
method incorporating the bagging strategy is applied to extract those local
regions having high discriminating power of the two classes. The disease
diagnosis machine can therefore be built using the data under the Support
Vector Machine (SVM) setting. Using 110 NC subjects and 110 AD patients from
the ADNI database, the proposed algorithm achieves 85:2% testing accuracy on 80
random samples as testing subjects, with the incorporation of surface geometry
in the classification machine. Using 20 aMCI patients who has advanced to AD
during a two-year period and another 20 aMCI patients who remain non-AD for the
next two years, the algorithm achieves 81:2% accuracy using 10 randomly picked
subjects as testing data. Our proposed method is 6%-15% better than other
classification models without the incorporation of surface geometry. The
results demonstrate the advantages of using local geometric distortions as the
discriminating criterion for early AD diagnosis.

Title: A Nonconvex Low-Rank Tensor Completion Model for Spatiotemporal Traffic
  Data Imputation
Authors: Xinyu Chen, Jinming Yang and Lijun Sun
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Sparsity and missing data problems are very common in spatiotemporal traffic
data collected from various sensing systems. Making accurate imputation is
critical to many applications in intelligent transportation systems. In this
paper, we formulate the missing data imputation problem in spatiotemporal
traffic data in a low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) framework and define a
novel truncated nuclear norm (TNN) on traffic tensors of
location$\times$day$\times$time of day. In particular, we introduce an
universal rate parameter to control the degree of truncation on all tensor
modes in the proposed LRTC-TNN model, and this allows us to better characterize
the hidden patterns in spatiotemporal traffic data. Based on the framework of
the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we present an efficient
algorithm to obtain the optimal solution for each variable. We conduct
numerical experiments on four spatiotemporal traffic data sets, and our results
show that the proposed LRTC-TNN model outperforms many state-of-the-art
imputation models with missing rates/patterns. Moreover, the proposed model
also outperforms other baseline models in extreme missing scenarios.

Categories: stat.AP cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted for publication in IOS Press Intelligent Data Analysis
\\
  Players of a free-to-play game are divided into three main groups: non-paying
active users, paying active users and inactive users. A State Space time series
approach is then used to model the daily conversion rates between the different
groups, i.e., the probability of transitioning from one group to another. This
allows, not only for predictions on how these rates are to evolve, but also for
a deeper understanding of the impact that in-game planning and calendar effects
have. It is also used in this work for the detection of marketing and promotion
campaigns about which no information is available. In particular, two different
State Space formulations are considered and compared: an Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average process and an Unobserved Components approach, in
both cases with a linear regression to explanatory variables. Both yield very
close estimations for covariate parameters, producing forecasts with similar
performances for most transition rates. While the Unobserved Components
approach is more robust and needs less human intervention in regards to model
definition, it produces significantly worse forecasts for non-paying user
abandonment probability. More critically, it also fails to detect a plausible
marketing and promotion campaign scenario.

Title: BusTime: Which is the Right Prediction Model for My Bus Arrival Time?
Authors: Dairui Liu, Jingxiang Sun, Shen Wang
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  With the rise of big data technologies, many smart transportation
applications have been rapidly developed in recent years including bus arrival
time predictions. This type of applications help passengers to plan trips more
efficiently without wasting unpredictable amount of waiting time at bus stops.
Many studies focus on improving the prediction accuracy of various machine
learning and statistical models, while much less work demonstrate their
applicability of being deployed and used in realistic urban settings. This
paper tries to fill this gap by proposing a general and practical evaluation
framework for analysing various widely used prediction models (i.e. delay,
k-nearest-neighbour, kernel regression, additive model, and recurrent neural
network using long short term memory) for bus arrival time. In particular, this
framework contains a raw bus GPS data pre-processing method that needs much
less number of input data points while still maintain satisfactory prediction
results. This pre-processing method enables various models to predict arrival
time at bus stops only, by using a KD-tree based nearest point search method.
Based on this framework, using raw bus GPS dataset in different scales from the
city of Dublin, Ireland, we also present preliminary results for city managers
by analysing the practical strengths and weaknesses in both training and
predicting stages of commonly used prediction models.

Title: Markovian Score Climbing: Variational Inference with KL(p||q)
Authors: Christian A. Naesseth and Fredrik Lindsten and David Blei
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO stat.ME
\\
  Modern variational inference (VI) uses stochastic gradients to avoid
intractable expectations, enabling large-scale probabilistic inference in
complex models. VI posits a family of approximating distributions $q$ and then
finds the member of that family that is closest to the exact posterior $p$.
Traditionally, VI algorithms minimize the "exclusive KL" KL$(q\|p)$, often for
computational convenience. Recent research, however, has also focused on the
"inclusive KL" KL$(p\|q)$, which has good statistical properties that makes it
more appropriate for certain inference problems. This paper develops a simple
algorithm for reliably minimizing the inclusive KL. Consider a valid MCMC
method, a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is $p$. The algorithm we
develop iteratively samples the chain $z[k]$, and then uses those samples to
follow the score function of the variational approximation, $\nabla \log
q(z[k])$ with a Robbins-Monro step-size schedule. This method, which we call
Markovian score climbing (MSC), converges to a local optimum of the inclusive
KL. It does not suffer from the systematic errors inherent in existing methods,
such as Reweighted Wake-Sleep and Neural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo, which
lead to bias in their final estimates. In a variant that ties the variational
approximation directly to the Markov chain, MSC further provides a new
algorithm that melds VI and MCMC. We illustrate convergence on a toy model and
demonstrate the utility of MSC on Bayesian probit regression for classification
as well as a stochastic volatility model for financial data.

\\
  With the fast evolvement of embedded deep-learning computing systems,
applications powered by deep learning are moving from the cloud to the edge.
When deploying neural networks (NNs) onto the devices under complex
environments, there are various types of possible faults: soft errors caused by
cosmic radiation and radioactive impurities, voltage instability, aging,
temperature variations, and malicious attackers. Thus the safety risk of
deploying NNs is now drawing much attention. In this paper, after the analysis
of the possible faults in various types of NN accelerators, we formalize and
implement various fault models from the algorithmic perspective. We propose
Fault-Tolerant Neural Architecture Search (FT-NAS) to automatically discover
convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that are reliable to various
faults in nowadays devices. Then we incorporate fault-tolerant training (FTT)
in the search process to achieve better results, which is referred to as
FTT-NAS. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the discovered architectures
outperform other manually designed baseline architectures significantly, with
comparable or fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) and parameters.
Specifically, with the same fault settings, F-FTT-Net discovered under the
feature fault model achieves an accuracy of 86.2% (VS. 68.1% achieved by
MobileNet-V2), and W-FTT-Net discovered under the weight fault model achieves
an accuracy of 69.6% (VS. 60.8% achieved by ResNet-20). By inspecting the
discovered architectures, we find that the operation primitives, the weight
quantization range, the capacity of the model, and the connection pattern have
influences on the fault resilience capability of NN models.

Title: A classification for the performance of online SGD for high-dimensional
  inference
Authors: Gerard Ben Arous, Reza Gheissari, Aukosh Jagannath
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.PR math.ST stat.TH
\\
  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for optimization
problems arising in high-dimensional inference tasks. Here one produces an
estimator of an unknown parameter from a large number of independent samples of
data by iteratively optimizing a loss function. This loss function is
high-dimensional, random, and often complex. We study here the performance of
the simplest version of SGD, namely online SGD, in the initial "search" phase,
where the algorithm is far from a trust region and the loss landscape is highly
non-convex. To this end, we investigate the performance of online SGD at
attaining a "better than random" correlation with the unknown parameter, i.e,
achieving weak recovery.
  Our contribution is a classification of the difficulty of typical instances
of this task for online SGD in terms of the number of samples required as the
dimension diverges. This classification depends only on an intrinsic property
of the population loss, which we call the information exponent. Using the
information exponent, we find that there are three distinct regimes---the easy,
critical, and difficult regimes---where one requires linear, quasilinear, and
polynomially many samples (in the dimension) respectively to achieve weak
recovery. We illustrate our approach by applying it to a wide variety of
estimation tasks such as parameter estimation for generalized linear models,
two-component Gaussian mixture models, phase retrieval, and spiked matrix and
tensor models, as well as supervised learning for single-layer networks with
general activation functions. In this latter case, our results translate into a
classification of the difficulty of this task in terms of the Hermite
decomposition of the activation function.

Title: Dichotomy between deterministic and probabilistic models in countably
  additive effectus theory
Authors: Kenta Cho, Bas Westerbaan and John van de Wetering
Categories: math.CT cs.LO
\\
  Effectus theory is a relatively new approach to categorical logic that can be
seen as an abstract form of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs). While
the scalars of a GPT are always the real unit interval $[0,1]$, in an effectus
they can form any effect monoid. Hence, there are quite exotic effectuses
resulting from more pathological effect monoids.
  In this paper we introduce $\sigma$-effectuses, where certain countable sums
of morphisms are defined. We study in particular $\sigma$-effectuses where
unnormalized states can be normalized. We show that a non-trivial
$\sigma$-effectus with normalization has as scalars either the two-element
effect monoid $\{0,1\}$ or the real unit interval $[0,1]$.
  When states and/or predicates separate the morphisms we find that in the
$\{0,1\}$ case the category must embed into the category of sets and partial
functions (and hence the category of Boolean algebras), showing that it
implements a deterministic model, while in the $[0,1]$ case we find it embeds
into the category of Banach order-unit spaces and of Banach pre-base-norm
spaces (satisfying additional properties), recovering the structure present in
GPTs.
  Hence, from abstract categorical and operational considerations we find a
dichotomy between deterministic and convex probabilistic models of physical
theories.

Title: Data-based Receding Horizon Control of Linear Network Systems

Categories: math.OC cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  We propose a distributed data-based predictive control scheme to stabilize a
network system described by linear dynamics. Agents cooperate to predict the
future system evolution without knowledge of the dynamics, relying instead on
learning a data-based representation from a single sample trajectory. We employ
this representation to reformulate the finite-horizon Linear Quadratic
Regulator problem as a network optimization with separable objective functions
and locally expressible constraints. We show that the controller resulting from
approximately solving this problem using a distributed optimization algorithm
in a receding horizon manner is stabilizing. We validate our results through
numerical simulations.

\\
  In this paper we develop an agent-based model for a fine-grained
computational simulation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. This
model is calibrated to reproduce several characteristics of COVID-19
transmission, accounting for its reproductive number, the length of incubation
and generation periods, age-dependent attack rates, and the growth rate of
cumulative incidence during a sustained and unmitigated local transmission. An
important calibration outcome is the age-dependent fraction of symptomatic
cases, with this fraction for children found to be one-fifth of such fraction
for adults. We then apply the model to compare several intervention strategies,
including restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, social
distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures. School
closures are not found to bring decisive benefits. We report an important
transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range
between 70% and 80% levels. This suggests that a compliance of below 70% is
unlikely to succeed for any duration of social distancing, while a compliance
at the 90% level is likely to control the disease within 13-14 weeks, when
coupled with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions.

  In this paper, an SPH method based on the SPH-ALE formulation is used for
modelling two-phase flows with large density ratios and realistic sound speeds.
The SPH scheme is further improved to circumvent the tensile instability that
may occur in the SPH simulations. The two-phase SPH solver is then used to
model a benchmark problem of liquid impact on a rigid wall. The results are
compared with an incompressible Level Set solver. Furthermore, a wave impact on
a rigid wall with a large entrained air pocket is modelled. The SPH simulation
is initialised by the output of a fully non-linear potential flow solver. The
pressure distribution, velocity field and impact pressure are then analysed.

\\
  We provide the global optimization community with new optimality proofs for
six deceptive benchmark functions (five bound-constrained functions and one
nonlinearly constrained problem). These highly multimodal nonlinear test
problems are among the most challenging benchmark functions for global
optimization solvers; some have not been solved even with approximate methods.
The global optima that we report have been numerically certified using Charibde
(Vanaret et al., 2013), a hybrid algorithm that combines an evolutionary
algorithm and interval-based methods. While metaheuristics generally solve
large problems and provide sufficiently good solutions with limited computation
capacity, exact methods are deemed unsuitable for difficult multimodal
optimization problems. The achievement of new optimality results by Charibde
demonstrates that reconciling stochastic algorithms and numerical analysis
methods is a step forward into handling problems that were up to now considered
unsolvable. We also provide a comparison with state-of-the-art solvers based on
mathematical programming methods and population-based metaheuristics, and show
that Charibde, in addition to being reliable, is highly competitive with the
best solvers on the given test functions.

Title: Monte Carlo integration of non-differentiable functions on

\\
  This paper concerns the use of a particular class of determinantal point
processes (DPP), a class of repulsive spatial point processes, for Monte Carlo
integration. Let $d\ge 1$, $I\subseteq \overline d=\{1,\dots,d\}$ with
$\iota=|I|$. Using a single set of $N$ quadrature points $\{u_1,\dots,u_N\}$
defined, once for all, in dimension $d$ from the realization of the DPP model,
we investigate "minimal" assumptions on the integrand in order to obtain
unbiased Monte Carlo estimates of $\mu(f_I)=\int_{[0,1]^\iota} f_I(u)
\mathrm{d} u$ for any known $\iota$-dimensional integrable function on
$[0,1]^\iota$. In particular, we show that the resulting estimator has variance
with order $N^{-1-(2s\wedge 1)/d}$ when the integrand belongs to some Sobolev
space with regularity $s > 0$. When $s>1/2$ (which includes a large class of
non-differentiable functions), the variance is asymptotically explicit and the
estimator is shown to satisfy a Central Limit Theorem.

  When planning a 5G network in the sub-6GHz bands, similar cell planning
techniques to LTE can be applied. Looking at the Australian environment, the
n78 band (3.3-3.8GHz TDD) is approximately 1GHz higher than the 2.6GHz band
used in existing LTE networks. As a result, the coverage footprint can be
similar, and therefore co-locating 5G NR (New Radio) on existing LTE base
stations is a common strategy for initial network rollout. Any difference in
coverage can be compensated by beamforming gain, less downtilting, or
increasing the gNodeB's transmit power. This paper presents an initial link
budget for data services, provides a coverage prediction, and measurements for
a 5G NR NSA (Non Stand Alone) trial radiating at 3.5GHz with 60 MHz bandwidth.
The coverage prediction is generated using RF planning tool Atoll, which is
then compared to coverage measurements from the trial. These findings can be
used to help plan a future 5G network in the Sydney metro area or similar
environment.

  We study the existence of an $n$-fold rotationally symmetric placement of a
symmetric graph in the plane allowing a continuous deformation that preserves
the symmetry and the distances between adjacent vertices. We show that such a
flexible placement exists if and only if the graph has a NAC-colouring
satisfying an additional property on the symmetry; a NAC-colouring is a
surjective edge colouring by two colours such that every cycle is either
monochromatic, or there are at least two edges of each colour.

Title: Rank Conditions for Observability and Controllability for Time-varying
  Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Agostino Martinelli
Categories: math.OC cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 28 pages, 1 figure
\\
  This paper provides the extension of the observability rank condition and the
extension of the controllability rank condition to time-varying nonlinear
systems. Previous conditions to check the state observability and
controllability, only account for nonlinear systems that do not explicitly
depend on time, or, for time-varying systems, they only account for the linear
case. In this paper, the general analytic conditions are provided. The paper
shows that both these two new conditions (the extended observability rank
condition and the extended controllability rank condition) reduce to the well
known rank conditions for observability and controllability in the two simpler
cases of time-varying linear systems and time-invariant nonlinear systems. The
proposed new conditions work automatically and can deal with any system,
independently of its complexity (state dimension, type of nonlinearity, etc).
Simple examples illustrate both these conditions. In addition, the two new
conditions are used to study the observability and the controllability
properties of a lunar module. For this system, the dynamics exhibit an explicit
time-dependence due to the variation of the weight and the variation of the
moment of inertia. These variations are a consequence of the fuel consumption.
To study the observability and the controllability properties of this system,
the extended observability rank condition and the extended controllability rank
condition introduced by this paper are required. The paper shows that, even
under the constraint that the main rocket engine delivers constant power, the
state is weakly locally controllable. Additionally, it is weakly locally
observable up to the yaw angle.

Title: Sustainability Analysis of Interconnected Food Production Systems via
  Theory of Barriers

\\
  Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) is used for efficient food
production. Efficiency can be increased further by interconnecting different
CEA systems (e.g. plants and insect larvae or fish and larvae), using products
and by-products of one system in the other. These interconnected systems define
an overall system that can be described by models of interacting species. It is
necessary to identify system parameters (e.g. initial species concentration,
harvest rate, feed quality, etc.) such that the resources are not exhausted.
For such systems with interacting species, modelled by the Lotka-Volterra
equations, a set-based approach based on the recent results of the theory of
barriers to exactly determine the so-called admissible set (also known as
viability kernel) and the maximal robust positively invariant set is presented.
Using an example of a larvae-fish based production system, steps to obtain
special trajectories which are the boundaries of the admissible set are shown.
This admissible set is used to prevent the under and over population of the
species in the CEA. Furthermore, conditions of the system parameters are
stated, such that the existence of these trajectories can be guaranteed.

  Robustness and reliability are two key requirements for developing practical
quantum control systems. The purpose of this paper is to design a coherent
feedback controller for a class of linear quantum systems suffering from
Markovian jumping faults so that the closed-loop quantum system has both fault
tolerance and H-infinity disturbance attenuation performance. This paper first
extends the physical realization conditions from the time-invariant case to the
time-varying case for linear stochastic quantum systems. By relating the fault
tolerant H-infinity control problem to the dissipation properties and the
solutions of Riccati differential equations, an H-infinity controller for the
quantum system is then designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs). In particular, an algorithm is employed to introduce additional noises
and to construct the corresponding input matrices to ensure the physical
realizability of the quantum controller. For real applications of the developed
fault-tolerant control strategy, we present a linear quantum system example
from quantum optics, where the amplitude of the pumping field randomly jumps
among different values. It is demonstrated that a quantum H-infinity controller
can be designed and implemented using some basic optical components to achieve
the desired control goal.

  In late December 2019, a novel strand of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing a
severe, potentially fatal respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) was identified in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and is causing outbreaks in multiple world
countries, soon becoming a pandemic. Italy has now become the most hit country
outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a
total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of
paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an
effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a
new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on
whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The
distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because
non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than
diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain
misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic
phenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop
life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires
hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the
healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be
redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic
containment. Simulation results are compared with real data on the COVID-19
epidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different
possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.

Title: Over-the-Horizon Radar Network Measurement-Level Fusion Based on Message
  Passing Approach
Authors: Hua Lan and Zengfu Wang and Xianglong Bai and Quan Pan and Kun Lu
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 25 pages, 23 figures
\\
  This paper considers the problem of tracking an unknown number of targets
based on multipath measurements provided by an over-the-horizon radar (OTHR)
network with a statistical ionospheric model, which suffers from the
intractable inference of high-dimensional latent variables including target
kinematic state, target visibility state, multipath data association, and
ionospheric height. A unified message passing approach, combining belief
propagation (BP) and mean-field (MF) approximation, is developed for
simplifying the intractable inference. Based upon the factor graph
corresponding to a factorization of the joint probability distribution function
(PDF) of the latent variables and a choice for a separation of this
factorization into BP region and MF region, the posterior PDFs of continuous
latent variables including target kinematic state, target visibility state, and
ionospheric height, are approximated by MF due to its simple MP update rules
for conjugate-exponential models. With regard to discrete multipath data
association which contains one-to-one frame (hard) constraints, its probability
mass function (PMF) is approximated by loopy BP. Finally, the approximated
posterior PDFs and PMF are updated iteratively in a closed-loop manner, which
is effective for dealing with the coupling issue among target state estimation,
multipath data association, and ionospheric height identification. Meanwhile,
the proposed approach has the measurement-level fusion architecture due to the
direct processing of the raw multipath measurements from an OTHR network, which
is benefit to improving target tracking performance. Its performance is
demonstrated on a simulated OTHR network multitarget tracking scenario.

Title: Routing Apps May Deteriorate Stability in Traffic Networks: Oscillating
  Congestions and Robust Information Design
Authors: Gianluca Bianchin, Fabio Pasqualetti
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  A fundamental question in traffic theory concerns how drivers behave in
response to sudden fluctuations of traffic congestion, and to what extent
navigation apps can benefit the overall traffic system in these cases. In this
paper, we study the stability of the equilibrium points of traffic networks
under real-time app-informed routing. We propose a dynamical routing model to
describe the real-time route selection mechanism that is at the core of
app-informed routing, and we leverage the theory of passivity in nonlinear
dynamical systems to provide a theoretical framework to explain emerging
dynamical behaviors in real-world networks. We demonstrate for the first time
the existence of oscillatory trajectories due to the general adoption of
routing apps, which demonstrate how drivers continuously switch between
highways in the attempt of minimizing their travel time to destination.
Further, we propose a family of control policies to ensure the asymptotic
stability of the equilibrium points, which relies on the idea of regulating the
rate at which travelers react to traffic congestion. Illustrative numerical
simulations combined with empirical data from highway sensors illustrate our
findings.

Title: Low Power Unsupervised Anomaly Detection by Non-Parametric Modeling of
  Sensor Statistics

  and Amit Ranjan Trivedi
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  This work presents AEGIS, a novel mixed-signal framework for real-time
anomaly detection by examining sensor stream statistics. AEGIS utilizes Kernel
Density Estimation (KDE)-based non-parametric density estimation to generate a
real-time statistical model of the sensor data stream. The likelihood estimate
of the sensor data point can be obtained based on the generated statistical
model to detect outliers. We present CMOS Gilbert Gaussian cell-based design to
realize Gaussian kernels for KDE. For outlier detection, the decision boundary
is defined in terms of kernel standard deviation ($\sigma_{Kernel}$) and
likelihood threshold ($P_{Thres}$). We adopt a sliding window to update the
detection model in real-time. We use time-series dataset provided from Yahoo to
benchmark the performance of AEGIS. A f1-score higher than 0.87 is achieved by
optimizing parameters such as length of the sliding window and decision
thresholds which are programmable in AEGIS. Discussed architecture is designed
using 45nm technology node and our approach on average consumes $\sim$75 $\mu$W
power at a sampling rate of 2 MHz while using ten recent inlier samples for
density estimation. \textcolor{red}{Full-version of this research has been

Title: From bypass transition to flow control and data-driven turbulence
  modeling: An input-output viewpoint
Authors: Mihailo R. Jovanovi\'c
Categories: physics.flu-dyn cs.SY eess.SY math.DS math.OC
Comments: Submitted to Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech.; 36 pages, 12 figures
\\
  Transient growth and resolvent analyses are routinely used to assess
non-asymptotic properties of fluid flows. In particular, resolvent analysis can
be interpreted as a special case of viewing flow dynamics as an open system in
which free-stream turbulence, surface roughness, and other irregularities
provide sources of input forcing. We offer a comprehensive summary of the tools
that can be employed to probe the dynamics of fluctuations around a laminar or
turbulent base flow in the presence of such stochastic or deterministic input
forcing and describe how input-output techniques enhance resolvent analysis.
Specifically, physical insights that may remain hidden in the resolvent
analysis are gained by detailed examination of input-output responses between
spatially-localized body forces and selected linear combinations of state
variables. This differentiating feature plays a key role in quantifying the
importance of different mechanisms for bypass transition in wall-bounded shear
flows and in explaining how turbulent jets generate noise. We highlight the
utility of a stochastic framework, with white or colored inputs, in addressing
a variety of open challenges including transition in complex fluids, flow
control, and physics-aware data-driven turbulence modeling. Applications with
time- or spatially-periodic base flows are discussed and future research
directions are outlined.

  Research in epidemiology often focusses on designing interventions that
result in the number of infected individuals asymptotically approaching zero,
without considering that this number may peak at high values during transients.
Recent research has shown that a set-based approach could be used to address
the problem, and we build on this idea by applying the theory of barriers to
construct admissible and invariant sets for an epidemic model. We describe how
these sets may be used to choose intervention strategies that maintain
infection caps during epidemics. We also derive algebraic conditions of the
model parameters that classify a system as being either comfortable,
comfortable-viable, viable, or desperate.
