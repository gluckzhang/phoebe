Title: TIES: Temporal Interaction Embeddings For Enhancing Social Media
  Integrity At Facebook
Authors: Nima Noorshams, Saurabh Verma, Aude Hofleitner
Categories: cs.AI cs.SI
Comments: Submitted to KDD 2020 applied DS track
\\
  Since its inception, Facebook has become an integral part of the online
social community. People rely on Facebook to make connections with others and
build communities. As a result, it is paramount to protect the integrity of
such a rapidly growing network in a fast and scalable manner. In this paper, we
present our efforts to protect various social media entities at Facebook from
people who try to abuse our platform. We present a novel Temporal Interaction
EmbeddingS (TIES) model that is designed to capture rogue social interactions
and flag them for further suitable actions. TIES is a supervised, deep
learning, production ready model at Facebook-scale networks. Prior works on
integrity problems are mostly focused on capturing either only static or
certain dynamic features of social entities. In contrast, TIES can capture both
these variant behaviors in a unified model owing to the recent strides made in
the domains of graph embedding and deep sequential pattern learning. To show
the real-world impact of TIES, we present a few applications especially for
preventing spread of misinformation, fake account detection, and reducing ads
payment risks in order to enhance the platform's integrity.

Title: Interpreting Interpretations: Organizing Attribution Methods by Criteria
Authors: Zifan Wang and PiotrPiotr Mardziel and Anupam Datta and Matt
  Fredrikson
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Attribution methods that explains the behaviour of machine learning models,
e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have developed into many different
forms, motivated by desirable distinct, though related, criteria. Following the
diversity of attribution methods, evaluation tools are in need to answer: which
method is better for what purpose and why? This paper introduces a new way to
decompose the evaluation for attribution methods into two criteria: ordering
and proportionality. We argue that existing evaluations follow an ordering
criteria roughly corresponding to either the logical concept of necessity or
sufficiency. The paper further demonstrates a notion of Proportionality for
Necessity and Sufficiency, a quantitative evaluation to compare existing
attribution methods, as a refinement to the ordering criteria. Evaluating the
performance of existing attribution methods on explaining the CNN for image
classification, we conclude that some attribution methods are better in the
necessity analysis and the others are better in the sufficiency analysis, but
no method is always the winner on both sides.

Title: Neural Architecture Search For Fault Diagnosis
Authors: Xudong Li, Yang Hu, Jianhua Zheng, Mingtao Li
Categories: cs.AI eess.SP
\\
  Data-driven methods have made great progress in fault diagnosis, especially
deep learning method. Deep learning is suitable for processing big data, and
has a strong feature extraction ability to realize end-to-end fault diagnosis
systems. However, designing neural network architecture requires rich
professional knowledge and debugging experience, and a lot of experiments are
needed to screen models and hyperparameters, increasing the difficulty of
developing deep learning models. Frortunately, neural architecture search (NAS)
is developing rapidly, and is becoming one of the next directions for deep
learning. In this paper, we proposed a NAS method for fault diagnosis using
reinforcement learning. A recurrent neural network is used as an agent to
generate network architecture. The accuracy of the generated network on the
validation dataset is fed back to the agent as a reward, and the parameters of
the agent are updated through the strategy gradient algorithm. We use PHM 2009
Data Challenge gearbox dataset to prove the effectiveness of proposed method,
and obtain state-of-the-art results compared with other artificial designed
network structures. To author's best knowledge, it's the first time that NAS
has been applied in fault diagnosis.

Title: Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking
Authors: Hung Le, Richard Socher, Steven C.H. Hoi
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at ICLR 2020
\\
  Recent efforts in Dialogue State Tracking (DST) for task-oriented dialogues
have progressed toward open-vocabulary or generation-based approaches where the
models can generate slot value candidates from the dialogue history itself.
These approaches have shown good performance gain, especially in complicated
dialogue domains with dynamic slot values. However, they fall short in two
aspects: (1) they do not allow models to explicitly learn signals across
domains and slots to detect potential dependencies among (domain, slot) pairs;
and (2) existing models follow auto-regressive approaches which incur high time
cost when the dialogue evolves over multiple domains and multiple turns. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State
Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and
slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a
complete set rather than separate slots. In particular, the non-autoregressive
nature of our method not only enables decoding in parallel to significantly
reduce the latency of DST for real-time dialogue response generation, but also
detect dependencies among slots at token level in addition to slot and domain
level. Our empirical results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art
joint accuracy across all domains on the MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus, and the latency
of our model is an order of magnitude lower than the previous state of the art
as the dialogue history extends over time.

Title: Tree-structured Attention with Hierarchical Accumulation
Authors: Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Shafiq Joty, Steven C.H. Hoi, Richard Socher
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  Incorporating hierarchical structures like constituency trees has been shown
to be effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
it is evident that state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-based models like the
Transformer struggle to encode such structures inherently. On the other hand,
dedicated models like the Tree-LSTM, while explicitly modeling hierarchical
structures, do not perform as efficiently as the Transformer. In this paper, we
attempt to bridge this gap with "Hierarchical Accumulation" to encode parse
tree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity. Our approach
outperforms SOTA methods in four IWSLT translation tasks and the WMT'14
English-German translation task. It also yields improvements over Transformer
and Tree-LSTM on three text classification tasks. We further demonstrate that
using hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage, and that our model
prefers phrase-level attentions over token-level attentions.

Title: Knowledge Reconciliation of $n$-ary Relations
Authors: Pierre Monnin, Miguel Couceiro, Amedeo Napoli, Adrien Coulet
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In the expanding Semantic Web, an increasing number of sources of data and
knowledge are accessible by human and software agents. Sources may differ in
granularity or completeness, and thus be complementary. Consequently, unlocking
the full potential of the available knowledge requires combining them. To this
aim, we define the task of knowledge reconciliation, which consists in
identifying, within and across sources, equivalent, more specific, or similar
units. This task can be challenging since knowledge units are heterogeneously
represented in sources (e.g., in terms of vocabularies). In this paper, we
propose a rule-based methodology for the reconciliation of $n$-ary relations.
To alleviate the heterogeneity in representation, we rely on domain knowledge
expressed by ontologies. We tested our method on the biomedical domain of
pharmacogenomics by reconciling 50,435 $n$-ary relations from four different
real-world sources, which highlighted noteworthy agreements and discrepancies
within and across sources.

Title: Taxonomy of bio-inspired algorithms
Authors: Daniel Molina and Javier Poyatos and Javier Del Ser and Salvador
  Garc\'ia and Amir Hussain and Francisco Herrera
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 63 pages, 6 figures
ACM-class: I.2.8
\\
  In recent years, a great variety of nature and bio-inspired algorithms have
been published in the literature. These algorithms simulate some natural or
biological processes such as natural evolution, to optimize complex problems.
Last years, the accumulation of this type of algorithms has achieved a number
difficult to manage, so it is needed a good taxonomy that allows researchers to
organise existing and future meta-heuristics in well-defined categories. In
this work, we have reviewed more than two hundred nature-inspired and
bio-inspired algorithms, and proposed two taxonomies that group them in
categories ans subcategories, considering two different criteria. The first
category consider the source of inspiration, while the second one consider only
the behavior of each algorithm. It is shown the proposals in each one of the
categories, and the summarise of each category. Later, results of these two
taxonomies are compared, and obtained the most similar classic algorithm for
each reviewed papers. We have obtained that there is a poor relationship
between the natural inspiration of an algorithm and its behavior, and that,
their similarities in behavior are greater than expected. Even more, more than
half of reviewed proposals are versions of classic algorithms. Although there
are many proposals based in different concepts of reality, the majority of them
are actually more similar than expected, so authors should focus more on the
behaviour. Also, we give several suggestions to continue improving this growing
research field.

Title: A Structured Approach to Trustworthy Autonomous/Cognitive Systems
Authors: Henrik J. Putzer and Ernest Wozniak
Categories: cs.AI cs.RO
\\
  Autonomous systems with cognitive features are on their way into the market.
Within complex environments, they promise to implement complex and goal
oriented behavior even in a safety related context. This behavior is based on a
certain level of situational awareness (perception) and advanced de-cision
making (deliberation). These systems in many cases are driven by artificial
intelligence (e.g. neural networks). The problem with such complex systems and
with using AI technology is that there is no generally accepted approach to
ensure trustworthiness. This paper presents a framework to exactly fill this
gap. It proposes a reference lifecycle as a structured approach that is based
on current safety standards and enhanced to meet the requirements of
autonomous/cog-nitive systems and trustworthiness.

Title: Event sequence metric learning
Authors: Dmitrii Babaev, Ivan Kireev, Nikita Ovsov, Mariya Ivanova, Gleb Gusev,
  Alexander Tuzhilin
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In this paper we consider a challenging problem of learning discriminative
vector representations for event sequences generated by real-world users.
Vector representations map behavioral client raw data to the low-dimensional
fixed-length vectors in the latent space. We propose a novel method of learning
those vector embeddings based on metric learning approach. We propose a
strategy of raw data subsequences generation to apply a metric learning
approach in a fully self-supervised way. We evaluated the method over several
public bank transactions datasets and showed that self-supervised embeddings
outperform other methods when applied to downstream classification tasks.
Moreover, embeddings are compact and provide additional user privacy
protection.

Title: Physics-informed Neural Networks for Solving Nonlinear Diffusivity and
  Biot's equations
Authors: Teeratorn Kadeethum, Thomas M Jorgensen, Hamidreza M Nick
Categories: cs.CE cs.LG cs.NA math.NA
\\
  This paper presents the potential of applying physics-informed neural
networks for solving nonlinear multiphysics problems, which are essential to
many fields such as biomedical engineering, earthquake prediction, and
underground energy harvesting. Specifically, we investigate how to extend the
methodology of physics-informed neural networks to solve both the forward and
inverse problems in relation to the nonlinear diffusivity and Biot's equations.
We explore the accuracy of the physics-informed neural networks with different
training example sizes and choices of hyperparameters. The impacts of the
stochastic variations between various training realizations are also
investigated. In the inverse case, we also study the effects of noisy
measurements. Furthermore, we address the challenge of selecting the
hyperparameters of the inverse model and illustrate how this challenge is
linked to the hyperparameters selection performed for the forward one.

Title: Sparse Hop Spanners for Unit Disk Graphs
Authors: Adrian Dumitrescu, Anirban Ghosh, Csaba D. T\'oth
Categories: cs.CG
Comments: 16 pages, 6 figures
\\
  A unit disk graph $G$ on a given set of points $P$ in the plane is a
geometric graph where an edge exists between two points $p,q \in P$ if and only
if $|pq| \leq 1$. A subgraph $G'$ of $G$ is a $k$-hop spanner if and only if
for every edge $pq\in G$, the topological shortest path between $p,q$ in $G'$
has at most $k$ edges. We obtain the following results for unit disk graphs.
  (i) Every $n$-vertex unit disk graph has a $5$-hop spanner with at most
$5.5n$ edges. We analyze the family of spanners constructed by Biniaz (WADS
2019) and improve the upper bound on the number of edges from $9n$ to $5.5n$.
  (ii) Using a new construction, we show that every $n$-vertex unit disk graph
has a $3$-hop spanner with at most $11n$ edges.
  (iii) Every $n$-vertex unit disk graph has a $2$-hop spanner with
$O(n^{3/2})$ edges. This is the first construction of a $2$-hop spanner with a
subquadratic number of edges.
  (iv) For every sufficiently large $n$, there exists a set $P$ of $n$ points
such that every plane hop spanner on $P$ has hop stretch factor at least $4$.
Previously, no lower bound greater than $2$ was known.
  (v) For every point set on a circle, there exists a plane $4$-hop spanner. As
such, this provides a tight bound for points on a circle.
  (vi) The maximum degree of $k$-hop spanners cannot be bounded above by a
function of $k$.

Title: On the Planar Two-Center Problem and Circular Hulls
Authors: Haitao Wang
Categories: cs.CG cs.DS
Comments: A preliminary version to appear in SoCG 2020
\\
  Given a set $S$ of $n$ points in the Euclidean plane, the two-center problem
is to find two congruent disks of smallest radius whose union covers all points
of $S$. Previously, Eppstein [SODA'97] gave a randomized algorithm of
$O(n\log^2n)$ expected time and Chan [CGTA'99] presented a deterministic
algorithm of $O(n\log^2 n\log^2\log n)$ time. In this paper, we propose an
$O(n\log^2 n)$ time deterministic algorithm, which improves Chan's
deterministic algorithm and matches the randomized bound of Eppstein. If $S$ is
in convex position, then we solve the problem in $O(n\log n\log\log n)$
deterministic time. Our results rely on new techniques for dynamically
maintaining circular hulls under point insertions and deletions, which are of
independent interest.

Title: Globally optimal point set registration by joint symmetry plane fitting
Authors: Lan Hu, Haomin Shi, and Laurent Kneip
Categories: cs.CG cs.CV
\\
  The present work proposes a solution to the challenging problem of
registering two partial point sets of the same object with very limited
overlap. We leverage the fact that most objects found in man-made environments
contain a plane of symmetry. By reflecting the points of each set with respect
to the plane of symmetry, we can largely increase the overlap between the sets
and therefore boost the registration process. However, prior knowledge about
the plane of symmetry is generally unavailable or at least very hard to find,
especially with limited partial views, and finding this plane could strongly
benefit from a prior alignment of the partial point sets. We solve this
chicken-and-egg problem by jointly optimizing the relative pose and symmetry
plane parameters, and notably do so under global optimality by employing the
branch-and-bound (BnB) paradigm. Our results demonstrate a great improvement
over the current state-of-the-art in globally optimal point set registration
for common objects. We furthermore show an interesting application of our
method to dense 3D reconstruction of scenes with repetitive objects.

Title: The Tree Stabbing Number is not Monotone

  Let $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of points and $T$ be a spanning tree

intersections any line in the plane determines with the edges of $T$. The
\emph{tree stabbing number} of $P$ is the minimum stabbing number of any
spanning tree of $P$. We prove that the tree stabbing number is not a monotone
parameter, i.e., there exist point sets $P \subsetneq P'$ such that

Title: Transfer Learning for Abstractive Summarization at Controllable Budgets

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Summarizing a document within an allocated budget while maintaining its major
concepts is a challenging task. If the budget can take any arbitrary value and
not known beforehand, it becomes even more difficult. Most of the existing
methods for abstractive summarization, including state-of-the-art neural
networks are data intensive. If the number of available training samples
becomes limited, they fail to construct high-quality summaries. We propose MLS,
an end-to-end framework to generate abstractive summaries with limited training
data at arbitrary compression budgets. MLS employs a pair of supervised
sequence-to-sequence networks. The first network called the \textit{MFS-Net}
constructs a minimal feasible summary by identifying the key concepts of the
input document. The second network called the Pointer-Magnifier then generates
the final summary from the minimal feasible summary by leveraging an
interpretable multi-headed attention model. Experiments on two cross-domain
datasets show that MLS outperforms baseline methods over a range of success
metrics including ROUGE and METEOR. We observed an improvement of approximately
4% in both metrics over the state-of-art convolutional network at lower
budgets. Results from a human evaluation study also establish the effectiveness
of MLS in generating complete coherent summaries at arbitrary compression
budgets.

Title: Studying the Effects of Cognitive Biases in Evaluation of Conversational
  Agents
Authors: Sashank Santhanam, Alireza Karduni, Samira Shaikh
Categories: cs.CL cs.HC
Comments: Accepted at CHI 2020
\\
  Humans quite frequently interact with conversational agents. The rapid
advancement in generative language modeling through neural networks has helped
advance the creation of intelligent conversational agents. Researchers
typically evaluate the output of their models through crowdsourced judgments,
but there are no established best practices for conducting such studies.
Moreover, it is unclear if cognitive biases in decision-making are affecting
crowdsourced workers' judgments when they undertake these tasks. To
investigate, we conducted a between-subjects study with 77 crowdsourced workers
to understand the role of cognitive biases, specifically anchoring bias, when
humans are asked to evaluate the output of conversational agents. Our results
provide insight into how best to evaluate conversational agents. We find
increased consistency in ratings across two experimental conditions may be a
result of anchoring bias. We also determine that external factors such as time
and prior experience in similar tasks have effects on inter-rater consistency.

  We present MT-DNN, an open-source natural language understanding (NLU)
toolkit that makes it easy for researchers and developers to train customized
deep learning models. Built upon PyTorch and Transformers, MT-DNN is designed
to facilitate rapid customization for a broad spectrum of NLU tasks, using a
variety of objectives (classification, regression, structured prediction) and
text encoders (e.g., RNNs, BERT, RoBERTa, UniLM). A unique feature of MT-DNN is
its built-in support for robust and transferable learning using the adversarial
multi-task learning paradigm. To enable efficient production deployment, MT-DNN
supports multi-task knowledge distillation, which can substantially compress a
deep neural model without significant performance drop. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of MT-DNN on a wide range of NLU applications across general and
biomedical domains. The software and pre-trained models will be publicly
available at https://github.com/namisan/mt-dnn.

Title: Toward Making the Most of Context in Neural Machine Translation
Authors: Zaixiang Zheng, Xiang Yue, Shujian Huang, Jiajun Chen, Alexandra Birch
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Submitted to a conference
\\
  Document-level machine translation manages to outperform sentence level
models by a small margin, but have failed to be widely adopted. We argue that
previous research did not make a clear use of the global context, and propose a
new document-level NMT framework that deliberately models the local context of
each sentence with the awareness of the global context of the document in both
source and target languages. We specifically design the model to be able to
deal with documents containing any number of sentences, including single
sentences. This unified approach allows our model to be trained elegantly on
standard datasets without needing to train on sentence and document level data
separately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms
Transformer baselines and previous document-level NMT models with substantial
margins of up to 2.1 BLEU on state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide
analyses which show the benefit of context far beyond the neighboring two or
three sentences, which previous studies have typically incorporated.

  In this paper we introduce a novel approach to the problem of understanding
documents where the local semantics is influenced by non-trivial layout.
Namely, we modify the Transformer architecture in a way that allows it to use
the graphical features defined by the layout, without the need to re-learn the
language semantics from scratch, thanks to starting the training process from a
model pretrained on classical language modeling tasks.

Title: Rnn-transducer with language bias for end-to-end Mandarin-English
  code-switching speech recognition
Authors: Shuai Zhang, Jiangyan Yi, Zhengkun Tian, Jianhua Tao, Ye Bai
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  Recently, language identity information has been utilized to improve the
performance of end-to-end code-switching (CS) speech recognition. However,
previous works use an additional language identification (LID) model as an
auxiliary module, which causes the system complex. In this work, we propose an
improved recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) model with language bias
to alleviate the problem. We use the language identities to bias the model to
predict the CS points. This promotes the model to learn the language identity
information directly from transcription, and no additional LID model is needed.
We evaluate the approach on a Mandarin-English CS corpus SEAME. Compared to our
RNN-T baseline, the proposed method can achieve 16.2% and 12.9% relative error
reduction on two test sets, respectively.

Title: Hierarchical models vs. transfer learning for document-level sentiment
  classification
Authors: Jeremy Barnes and Vinit Ravishankar and Lilja {\O}vrelid and Erik

Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Documents are composed of smaller pieces - paragraphs, sentences, and tokens
- that have complex relationships between one another. Sentiment classification
models that take into account the structure inherent in these documents have a
theoretical advantage over those that do not. At the same time, transfer
learning models based on language model pretraining have shown promise for
document classification. However, these two paradigms have not been
systematically compared and it is not clear under which circumstances one
approach is better than the other. In this work we empirically compare
hierarchical models and transfer learning for document-level sentiment
classification. We show that non-trivial hierarchical models outperform
previous baselines and transfer learning on document-level sentiment
classification in five languages.

  We present CodeBERT, a bimodal pre-trained model for programming language
(PL) and nat-ural language (NL). CodeBERT learns general-purpose
representations that support downstream NL-PL applications such as natural
language codesearch, code documentation generation, etc. We develop CodeBERT
with Transformer-based neural architecture, and train it with a hybrid
objective function that incorporates the pre-training task of replaced token
detection, which is to detect plausible alternatives sampled from generators.
This enables us to utilize both bimodal data of NL-PL pairs and unimodal data,
where the former provides input tokens for model training while the latter
helps to learn better generators. We evaluate CodeBERT on two NL-PL
applications by fine-tuning model parameters. Results show that CodeBERT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both natural language code search and
code documentation generation tasks. Furthermore, to investigate what type of
knowledge is learned in CodeBERT, we construct a dataset for NL-PL probing, and
evaluate in a zero-shot setting where parameters of pre-trained models are
fixed. Results show that CodeBERT performs better than previous pre-trained
models on NL-PL probing.

Title: Multilogue-Net: A Context Aware RNN for Multi-modal Emotion Detection
  and Sentiment Analysis in Conversation
Authors: Aman Shenoy and Ashish Sardana
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables
\\
  Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection in conversation is key in a number
of real-world applications, with different applications leveraging different
kinds of data to be able to achieve reasonably accurate predictions. Multimodal
Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis can be particularly useful as
applications will be able to use specific subsets of the available modalities,
as per their available data, to be able to produce relevant predictions.
Current systems dealing with Multimodal functionality fail to leverage and
capture the context of the conversation through all modalities, the current
speaker and listener(s) in the conversation, and the relevance and relationship
between the available modalities through an adequate fusion mechanism. In this
paper, we propose a recurrent neural network architecture that attempts to take
into account all the mentioned drawbacks, and keeps track of the context of the
conversation, interlocutor states, and the emotions conveyed by the speakers in
the conversation. Our proposed model out performs the state of the art on two
benchmark datasets on a variety of accuracy and regression metrics. Our model
implementation is public and can be found at

Title: Compressing BERT: Studying the Effects of Weight Pruning on Transfer
  Learning
Authors: Mitchell A. Gordon, Kevin Duh, Nicholas Andrews
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Universal feature extractors, such as BERT for natural language processing
and VGG for computer vision, have become effective methods for improving deep
learning models without requiring more labeled data. A common paradigm is to
pre-train a feature extractor on large amounts of data then fine-tune it as
part of a deep learning model on some downstream task (i.e. transfer learning).
While effective, feature extractors like BERT may be prohibitively large for
some deployment scenarios. We explore weight pruning for BERT and ask: how does
compression during pre-training affect transfer learning? We find that pruning
affects transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of pruning
(30-40\%) do not affect pre-training loss or transfer to downstream tasks at
all. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful
pre-training information from being transferred to downstream tasks. High
levels of pruning additionally prevent models from fitting downstream datasets,
leading to further degradation. Finally, we observe that fine-tuning BERT on a
specific task does not improve its prunability. We conclude that BERT can be
pruned once during pre-training rather than separately for each task without
affecting performance.

Title: Collusion Attacks on Decentralized Attributed-Based Encryption: Analyses
  and a Solution
Authors: Ehsan Meamari, Hao Guo, Chien-Chung Shen and Junbeom Hur
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) is an information centric security solution
that moves beyond traditional restrictions of point-to-point encryption by
allowing for flexible, fine-grain policy-based and content-based access control
that is cryptographically enforced. As the original ABE systems are managed by
a single authority, several efforts have decentralized different ABE schemes to
address the key escrow problem, where the authority can issue secret keys to
itself to decrypt all the ciphertext. However, decentralized ABE (DABE) schemes
raise the issue of collusion attacks. In this paper, we review two existing
types of collusion attacks on DABE systems, and introduce a new type of
collusion among authorities and data users. We show that six existing DABE
systems are vulnerable to the newly introduced collusion and propose a model to
secure one of the DABE schemes.

Title: Framework to Describe Intentions of a Cyber Attack Action
Authors: Stephen Moskal and Shanchieh Jay Yang
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  The techniques and tactics used by cyber adversaries are becoming more
sophisticated, ironically, as defense getting stronger and the cost of a breach
continuing to rise. Understanding the thought processes and behaviors of
adversaries is extremely challenging as high profile or even amateur attackers
have no incentive to share the trades associated with their illegal activities.
One opportunity to observe the actions the adversaries perform is through the
use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) which generate alerts in the event
that suspicious behavior was detected. The alerts raised by these systems
typically describe the suspicious actions via the form of attack 'signature',
which do not necessarily reveal the true intent of the attacker performing the
action. Meanwhile, several high level frameworks exist to describe the sequence
or chain of action types an adversary might perform. These frameworks, however,
do not connect the action types to observables of standard intrusion detection
systems, nor describing the plausible intents of the adversarial actions. To
address these gaps, this work proposes the Action-Intent Framework (AIF) to
complement existing Cyber Attack Kill Chains and Attack Taxonomies. The AIF
defines a set of Action-Intent States (AIS) at two levels of description: the
Macro-AIS describes 'what' the attacker is trying to achieve and the Micro-AIS
describes "how" the intended goal is achieved. A full description of both the
Macro is provided along with a set of guiding principals of how the AIS is
derived and added to the framework.

  Reconciliation is a mechanism allowing to weed out the discrepancies between
two correlated variables. It has great role in every Quantum Key Distribution
protocol where the key has to be transmitted through a noisy channel or as in
our case of study in presence of an eavesdropping. In this paper, we show that
for discrete-variable QKD protocols, this problem can be advantageously solved
with Turbo codes. In particular, we demonstrate that our method leads to a
significant improvement of Bit Error Rate, may divide it by three in presence
of a eavesdropper even with great eavesdropping capability.

Categories: cs.CR
\\
  In this paper, we introduce DFSSD, a novel logic locking solution for
sequential and FSM circuits with a restricted (locked) access to the scan
chain. DFSSD combines two techniques for obfuscation: (1) Deep Faults, and (2)
Shallow State Duality. Both techniques are specifically designed to resist
against sequential SAT attacks based on bounded model checking. The shallow
state duality prevents a sequential SAT attack from taking a shortcut for early
termination without running an exhaustive unbounded model checker to assess if
the attack could be terminated. The deep fault, on the other hand, provides a
designer with a technique for building deep, yet key recoverable faults that
could not be discovered by sequential SAT (and bounded model checker based)
attacks in a reasonable time.

Title: Algebraic blinding and cryptographic trilinear maps

Categories: cs.CR math.NT
\\
  It has been shown recently that cryptographic trilinear maps are sufficient
for achieving indistinguishability obfuscation. In this paper we develop
algebraic blinding techniques for constructing such maps. An earlier approach
involving Weil restriction can be regarded as a special case of blinding in our
framework. However, the techniques developed in this paper are more general,
more robust, and easier to analyze. We demonstrate this approach in the
construction of trilinear maps based on elliptic curves.

Title: PTAuth: Temporal Memory Safety via Robust Points-to Authentication
Authors: Reza Mirzazade farkhani, Mansour Ahmadi, Long Lu
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: Pointer Authentication Code (PAC)
\\
  Temporal memory corruptions are commonly exploited software vulnerabilities
that can lead to powerful attacks. Despite significant progress made by decades
of research on mitigation techniques, existing countermeasures fall short due
to either limited coverage or overly high overhead. Furthermore, they require
external mechanisms (e.g., spatial memory safety) to protect their metadata.
Otherwise, their protection can be bypassed or disabled.
  To address these limitations, we present robust points-to authentication, a
novel runtime scheme for detecting all kinds of temporal memory corruptions. We
built a prototype system, called PTAuth, that realizes this scheme on ARM
architectures. PTAuth contains a customized compiler for code analysis and
instrumentation and a runtime library for performing the points-to
authentication as a protected program runs. PTAuth leverages the Pointer
Authentication Code (PAC) feature provided by the latest ARM CPUs, which serves
as a simple hardware-based encryption primitive. PTAuth uses minimal in-memory
metadata and protects its metadata without requiring spatial memory safety. We
report our evaluation of PTAuth in terms of security, robustness and
performance using 150 vulnerable programs from Juliet test suite and the SPEC
CPU2006 benchmarks. PTAuth detects all temporal memory corruptions from all 3
categories, generates zero false alerts, and slows down program execution by
26.0% (this number was measured based on software-emulated PAC; it is expected
to be lower on hardware with PAC support).

  A drive by download is a download that occurs without users action or
knowledge. It usually triggers an exploit of vulnerability in a browser to
downloads an unknown file. The malicious program in the downloaded file
installs itself on the victims machine. Moreover, the downloaded file can be
camouflaged as an installer that would further install malicious software.
Drive by downloads is a very good example of the exponential increase in
malicious activity over the Internet and how it affects the daily use of the
web. In this paper, we try to address the problem caused by drive by downloads
from different standpoints. We provide in depth understanding of the
difficulties in dealing with drive by downloads and suggest appropriate
solutions. We propose machine learning and feature selection solutions to
remedy the the drive-by download problem. Experimental results reported 98.2%

Title: Influence Function based Data Poisoning Attacks to Top-N Recommender
  Systems
Authors: Minghong Fang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Jia Liu
Categories: cs.CR cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by WWW 2020; This is technical report version
\\
  Recommender system is an essential component of web services to engage users.
Popular recommender systems model user preferences and item properties using a
large amount of crowdsourced user-item interaction data, e.g., rating scores;
then top-$N$ items that match the best with a user's preference are recommended
to the user. In this work, we show that an attacker can launch a data poisoning
attack to a recommender system to make recommendations as the attacker desires
via injecting fake users with carefully crafted user-item interaction data.
Specifically, an attacker can trick a recommender system to recommend a target
item to as many normal users as possible. We focus on matrix factorization
based recommender systems because they have been widely deployed in industry.
Given the number of fake users the attacker can inject, we formulate the
crafting of rating scores for the fake users as an optimization problem.
However, this optimization problem is challenging to solve as it is a
non-convex integer programming problem. To address the challenge, we develop
several techniques to approximately solve the optimization problem. For
instance, we leverage influence function to select a subset of normal users who
are influential to the recommendations and solve our formulated optimization
problem based on these influential users. Our results show that our attacks are
effective and outperform existing methods.

Title: Toward Low-Cost and Stable Blockchain Networks
Authors: Minghong Fang, Jia Liu
Categories: cs.CR cs.DC cs.LG cs.NI
Comments: Accepted by IEEE ICC 2020
\\
  Envisioned to be the future of distributed systems, blockchain networks have
received increasing attentions from both industry and academic research in
recent years. However, the blockchain mining process consumes vast amounts of
energy, and studies have shown that the amount of energy consumed in Bitcoin
mining is almost the same as electricity used in Ireland. To address the high
mining energy cost problem of blockchain networks, in this paper, we propose a
blockchain mining resources allocation algorithm to reduce the mining cost in
PoW-based (proof-of-work-based) blockchain networks. We first provide a
systematic study on general blockchain queueing model. In our queueing model,
transactions arrive randomly to the queue and served in a batch manner with
unknown probability distribution and agnostic to any priority mechanism. Then,
we leverage Lyapunov optimization techniques to propose a dynamic mining
resources allocation algorithm (DMRA), which is parameterized by a tuning
parameter $K>0$. We show that our algorithm achieves performance-delay tradeoff
as $[O(1/K), O(K)]$. The simulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness
of DMRA in reducing the mining cost.

Title: The Decentralized Financial Crisis: Attacking DeFi
Authors: Lewis Gudgeon, Daniel Perez, Dominik Harz, Arthur Gervais, Benjamin

Categories: cs.CR
\\
  The Global Financial Crisis of 2008, caused by excessive financial risk,
inspired Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. Now, more than ten years later,
Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm which leverages
blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure its integrity and security, contains
over 1bn USD of capital as of February 2020. Yet as this ecosystem develops,
with protocols intertwining and the complexity of financial products
increasing, it is at risk of the very sort of financial meltdown it is supposed
to be preventing.
  In this paper we explore how design weaknesses in DeFi protocols could lead
to a DeFi crisis. First, overcollateralized DeFi protocols are vulnerable to
exogenous price shocks. We quantify the robustness of DeFi lending protocols in
the presence of significant falls in the value of the assets these protocols
are based on, showing for a range of parameters the speed at which a DeFi
protocol would become undercollateralized. Second, we present a governance
attack on Maker - the largest DeFi protocol by market share - that allows an
attacker to steal all 0.5bn USD worth of collateral. Moreover, we present a
novel strategy that would allow an attacker to steal the Maker collateral
within just two transactions and without the need to lock any tokens. This
paper shows that with the composition of collateralized debt in these DeFi
protocols, the failure of one protocol may lead to financial contagion,
resulting in losses ranging from 145m USD to in excess of 246m USD.

\\
  This paper proposes a novel two-stage defense (NNoculation) against
backdoored neural networks (BadNets) that, unlike existing defenses, makes
minimal assumptions on the shape, size and location of backdoor triggers and
BadNet's functioning. In the pre-deployment stage, NNoculation retrains the
network using "broad-spectrum" random perturbations of inputs drawn from a
clean validation set to partially reduce the adversarial impact of a backdoor.
In the post-deployment stage, NNoculation detects and quarantines backdoored
test inputs by recording disagreements between the original and pre-deployment
patched networks. A CycleGAN is then trained to learn transformations between
clean validation inputs and quarantined inputs; i.e., it learns to add triggers
to clean validation images. This transformed set of backdoored validation
images along with their correct labels is used to further retrain the BadNet,
yielding our final defense. NNoculation outperforms state-of-the-art defenses
NeuralCleanse and Artificial Brain Simulation (ABS) that we show are
ineffective when their restrictive assumptions are circumvented by the
attacker.

Title: Algebraic attacks for solving the Rank Decoding and MinRank problems
  without Gr\"obner basis
Authors: Magali Bardet, Maxime Bros, Daniel Cabarcas, Philippe Gaborit, Ray
  Perlner, Daniel Smith-Tone, Jean-Pierre Tillich, Javier Verbel
Categories: cs.CR math.AG
\\
  Rank Decoding (RD) is the main underlying problem in rank-based cryptography.
Based on this problem and quasi-cyclic versions of it, very efficient schemes
have been proposed recently, such as those in the ROLLO and RQC submissions,
which have reached the second round of the NIST Post-Quantum competition. Two
main approaches have been studied to solve RD: combinatorial ones and algebraic
ones. While the former has been studied extensively, a better understanding of
the latter was recently obtained by Bardet et al. (EUROCRYPT20) where it
appeared that algebraic attacks can often be more efficient than combinatorial
ones for cryptographic parameters. This paper gives substantial improvements
upon this attack in terms both of complexity and of the assumptions required by
the cryptanalysis. We present attacks for ROLLO-I-128, 192, and 256 with bit
complexity respectively in 70, 86, and 158, to be compared to 117, 144, and 197
for the aforementionned previous attack. Moreover, unlike that previous attack,
the new one does not rely on Gr\"obner basis computations and thus does not
require any assumption. For a case called overdetermined, this modeling allows
us to avoid Gr\"obner basis computations by going directly to solving a linear
system. For the other case, called underdetermined, we also improve the results
from the previous attack by combining the Ourivski-Johansson modeling together
with a new modeling for a generic MinRank instance; the latter modeling allows
us to refine the analysis of MinRank's complexity given in the paper by Verbel
et al. (PQC19). Finally, since the proposed parameters of ROLLO and RQC are
completely broken by our new attack, we give examples of new parameters for
ROLLO and RQC that make them resistant to our attacks. These new parameters
show that these systems remain attractive, with a loss of only about 50\% in
terms of key size for ROLLO-I.

Title: Fawkes: Protecting Personal Privacy against Unauthorized Deep Learning
  Models

\\
  Today's proliferation of powerful facial recognition models poses a real
threat to personal privacy. As Clearview.ai demonstrated, anyone can canvas the
Internet for data, and train highly accurate facial recognition models of us
without our knowledge. We need tools to protect ourselves from unauthorized
facial recognition systems and their numerous potential misuses. Unfortunately,
work in related areas are limited in practicality and effectiveness. In this
paper, we propose Fawkes, a system that allow individuals to inoculate
themselves against unauthorized facial recognition models. Fawkes achieves this
by helping users adding imperceptible pixel-level changes (we call them
"cloaks") to their own photos before publishing them online. When collected by
a third-party "tracker" and used to train facial recognition models, these
"cloaked" images produce functional models that consistently misidentify the
user. We experimentally prove that Fawkes provides 95+% protection against user
recognition regardless of how trackers train their models. Even when clean,
uncloaked images are "leaked" to the tracker and used for training, Fawkes can
still maintain a 80+% protection success rate. In fact, we perform real
experiments against today's state-of-the-art facial recognition services and
achieve 100% success. Finally, we show that Fawkes is robust against a variety
of countermeasures that try to detect or disrupt cloaks.

Title: Algebraic Extension Ring Framework for Non-Commutative Asymmetric
  Cryptography

\\
  Post-Quantum Cryptography PQC attempts to find cryptographic protocols
resistant to attacks using Shors polynomial time algorithm for numerical field
problems or Grovers algorithm to find the unique input to a black-box function
that produces a particular output value. The use of non-standard algebraic
structures like non-commutative or non-associative structures, combined with
one-way trapdoor functions derived from combinatorial group theory, are mainly
unexplored choices for these new kinds of protocols and overlooked in current
PQC solutions. In this paper, we develop an algebraic extension ring framework
who could be applied to different asymmetric protocols, i.e. key exchange, key
transport, enciphering, digital signature, zero-knowledge authentication,
oblivious transfer, secret sharing etc.. A valuable feature is that there is no
need for big number libraries as all arithmetic is performed in F256 extension
field operations (precisely the AES field). We assume that the new framework is
cryptographical secure against strong classical attacks like the
sometimes-useful length-based attack, Romankovs linearization attacks and
Tsabans algebraic span attack. This statement is based on the non-linear
structure of the selected platform which proved to be useful protecting the AES
protocol. Otherwise, it could resist post-quantum attacks Grover, Shor and be
particularly useful for computational platforms with limited capabilities like
USB cryptographic keys or smartcards. Semantic security IND-CCA2 could also be
inferred for this new platform.

Title: Lake Ice Monitoring with Webcams and Crowd-Sourced Images

Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Lake ice is a strong climate indicator and has been recognised as part of the
Essential Climate Variables (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System
(GCOS). The dynamics of freezing and thawing, and possible shifts of freezing
patterns over time, can help in understanding the local and global climate
systems. One way to acquire the spatio-temporal information about lake ice
formation, independent of clouds, is to analyse webcam images. This paper
intends to move towards a universal model for monitoring lake ice with freely
available webcam data. We demonstrate good performance, including the ability
to generalise across different winters and different lakes, with a
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for semantic image
segmentation, Deeplab v3+. Moreover, we design a variant of that model, termed
Deep-U-Lab, which predicts sharper, more correct segmentation boundaries. We
have tested the model's ability to generalise with data from multiple camera
views and two different winters. On average, it achieves
intersection-over-union (IoU) values of ~71% across different cameras and ~69%
across different winters, greatly outperforming prior work. Going even further,
we show that the model even achieves 60% IoU on arbitrary images scraped from
photo-sharing web sites. As part of the work, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset of webcam images, Photi-LakeIce, from multiple cameras and two
different winters, along with pixel-wise ground truth annotations.

  The distribution and appearance of nuclei are essential markers for the
diagnosis and study of cancer. Despite the importance of nuclear morphology,
there is a lack of large scale, accurate, publicly accessible nucleus
segmentation data. To address this, we developed an analysis pipeline that
segments nuclei in whole slide tissue images from multiple cancer types with a
quality control process. We have generated nucleus segmentation results in
5,060 Whole Slide Tissue images from 10 cancer types in The Cancer Genome
Atlas. One key component of our work is that we carried out a multi-level
quality control process (WSI-level and image patch-level), to evaluate the
quality of our segmentation results. The image patch-level quality control used
manual segmentation ground truth data from 1,356 sampled image patches. The
datasets we publish in this work consist of roughly 5 billion quality
controlled nuclei from more than 5,060 TCGA WSIs from 10 different TCGA cancer
types and 1,356 manually segmented TCGA image patches from the same 10 cancer
types plus additional 4 cancer types.

Title: Universal Domain Adaptation through Self Supervision
Authors: Kuniaki Saito, Donghyun Kim, Stan Sclaroff, Kate Saenko
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Unsupervised domain adaptation methods traditionally assume that all source
categories are present in the target domain. In practice, little may be known
about the category overlap between the two domains. While some methods address
target settings with either partial or open-set categories, they assume that
the particular setting is known a priori. We propose a more universally
applicable domain adaptation approach that can handle arbitrary category shift,
called Domain Adaptative Neighborhood Clustering via Entropy optimization
(DANCE). DANCE combines two novel ideas: First, as we cannot fully rely on
source categories to learn features discriminative for the target, we propose a
novel neighborhood clustering technique to learn the structure of the target
domain in a self-supervised way. Second, we use entropy-based feature alignment
and rejection to align target features with the source, or reject them as
unknown categories based on their entropy. We show through extensive
experiments that DANCE outperforms baselines across open-set, open-partial and
partial domain adaptation settings.

  We propose an easy-to-use non-overlapping camera calibration method. First,
successive images are fed to a PoseNet-based network to obtain ego-motion of
cameras between frames. Next, the pose between cameras are estimated. Instead
of using a batch method, we propose an on-line method of the inter-camera pose
estimation. Furthermore, we implement the entire procedure on a computation
graph. Experiments with simulations and the KITTI dataset show the proposed
method to be effective in simulation.

Title: Feasibility of Video-based Sub-meter Localization on
  Resource-constrained Platforms
Authors: Abm Musa and Jakob Eriksson
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  While the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) is adequate for
some outdoor applications, many other applications are held back by its
multi-meter positioning errors and poor indoor coverage. In this paper, we
study the feasibility of real-time video-based localization on
resource-constrained platforms. Before commencing a localization task, a
video-based localization system downloads an offline model of a restricted
target environment, such as a set of city streets, or an indoor shopping mall.
The system is then able to localize the user within the model, using only video
as input.
  To enable such a system to run on resource-constrained embedded systems or
smartphones, we (a) propose techniques for efficiently building a 3D model of a
surveyed path, through frame selection and efficient feature matching, (b)
substantially reduce model size by multiple compression techniques, without
sacrificing localization accuracy, (c) propose efficient and concurrent
techniques for feature extraction and matching to enable online localization,
(d) propose a method with interleaved feature matching and optical flow based
tracking to reduce the feature extraction and matching time in online
localization.
  Based on an extensive set of both indoor and outdoor videos, manually
annotated with location ground truth, we demonstrate that sub-meter accuracy,
at real-time rates, is achievable on smart-phone type platforms, despite
challenging video conditions.

Title: Meta Segmentation Network for Ultra-Resolution Medical Images
Authors: Tong Wu, Yuan Xie, Yanyun Qu, Bicheng Dai, Shuxin Chen
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Despite recent progress on semantic segmentation, there still exist huge
challenges in medical ultra-resolution image segmentation. The methods based on
multi-branch structure can make a good balance between computational burdens
and segmentation accuracy. However, the fusion structure in these methods
require to be designed elaborately to achieve desirable result, which leads to
model redundancy. In this paper, we propose Meta Segmentation Network (MSN) to
solve this challenging problem. With the help of meta-learning, the fusion
module of MSN is quite simple but effective. MSN can fast generate the weights
of fusion layers through a simple meta-learner, requiring only a few training
samples and epochs to converge. In addition, to avoid learning all branches
from scratch, we further introduce a particular weight sharing mechanism to
realize a fast knowledge adaptation and share the weights among multiple
branches, resulting in the performance improvement and significant parameters
reduction. The experimental results on two challenging ultra-resolution medical
datasets BACH and ISIC show that MSN achieves the best performance compared
with the state-of-the-art methods.

  Image-based sports analytics enable automatic retrieval of key events in a
game to speed up the analytics process for human experts. However, most
existing methods focus on structured television broadcast video datasets with a
straight and fixed camera having minimum variability in the capturing pose. In
this paper, we study the case of event detection in sports videos for
unstructured environments with arbitrary camera angles. The transition from
structured to unstructured video analysis produces multiple challenges that we
address in our paper. Specifically, we identify and solve two major problems:
unsupervised identification of players in an unstructured setting and
generalization of the trained models to pose variations due to arbitrary
shooting angles. For the first problem, we propose a temporal feature
aggregation algorithm using person re-identification features to obtain high
player retrieval precision by boosting a weak heuristic scoring method.
Additionally, we propose a data augmentation technique, based on multi-modal
image translation model, to reduce bias in the appearance of training samples.
Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method improves precision for
player retrieval from 0.78 to 0.86 for obliquely angled videos. Additionally,
we obtain an improvement in F1 score for rally detection in table tennis videos
from 0.79 in case of global frame-level features to 0.89 using our proposed
player-level features. Please see the supplementary video submission at

\\
  Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation is a challenging task as no
pixel-wise label information is provided for training. Recent methods have
exploited classification networks to localize objects by selecting regions with
strong response. While such response map provides sparse information, however,
there exist strong pairwise relations between pixels in natural images, which
can be utilized to propagate the sparse map to a much denser one. In this
paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to learn such pairwise relations,
which consists of two branches, a unary segmentation network which learns the
label probabilities for each pixel, and a pairwise affinity network which
learns affinity matrix and refines the probability map generated from the unary
network. The refined results by the pairwise network are then used as
supervision to train the unary network, and the procedures are conducted
iteratively to obtain better segmentation progressively. To learn reliable
pixel affinity without accurate annotation, we also propose to mine confident
regions. We show that iteratively training this framework is equivalent to
optimizing an energy function with convergence to a local minimum. Experimental
results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO datasets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) usually come with the
expense of considerable computational overhead and memory footprint. Network
compression aims to alleviate this issue by training compact models with
comparable performance. However, existing compression techniques either entail
dedicated expert design or compromise with a moderate performance drop. To this
end, we propose a model-agnostic structured sparsification method for efficient
network compression. The proposed method automatically induces structurally
sparse representations of the convolutional weights, thereby facilitating the
implementation of the compressed model with the highly-optimized group
convolution. We further address the problem of inter-group communication with a
learnable channel shuffle mechanism. The proposed approach is model-agnostic
and highly compressible with a negligible performance drop. Extensive
experimental results and analysis demonstrate that our approach performs
favorably against the state-of-the-art network pruning methods. The code will
be publicly available after the review process.

Title: DeFraudNet:End2End Fingerprint Spoof Detection using Patch Level
  Attention
Authors: B.V.S Anusha, Sayan Banerjee, Subhasis Chaudhuri
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: WACV 2020
\\
  In recent years, fingerprint recognition systems have made remarkable
advancements in the field of biometric security as it plays an important role
in personal, national and global security. In spite of all these notable
advancements, the fingerprint recognition technology is still susceptible to
spoof attacks which can significantly jeopardize the user security. The cross
sensor and cross material spoof detection still pose a challenge with a myriad
of spoof materials emerging every day, compromising sensor interoperability and
robustness. This paper proposes a novel method for fingerprint spoof detection
using both global and local fingerprint feature descriptors. These descriptors
are extracted using DenseNet which significantly improves cross-sensor,
cross-material and cross-dataset performance. A novel patch attention network
is used for finding the most discriminative patches and also for network
fusion. We evaluate our method on four publicly available datasets:LivDet 2011,
2013, 2015 and 2017. A set of comprehensive experiments are carried out to
evaluate cross-sensor, cross-material and cross-dataset performance over these
datasets. The proposed approach achieves an average accuracy of 99.52%, 99.16%
and 99.72% on LivDet 2017,2015 and 2011 respectively outperforming the current
state-of-the-art results by 3% and 4% for LivDet 2015 and 2011 respectively.

Title: Three-Stream Fusion Network for First-Person Interaction Recognition
Authors: Ye-Ji Kim, Dong-Gyu Lee, Seong-Whan Lee
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 30 pages, 9 figures
\\
  First-person interaction recognition is a challenging task because of
unstable video conditions resulting from the camera wearer's movement. For
human interaction recognition from a first-person viewpoint, this paper
proposes a three-stream fusion network with two main parts: three-stream
architecture and three-stream correlation fusion. Thre three-stream
architecture captures the characteristics of the target appearance, target
motion, and camera ego-motion. Meanwhile the three-stream correlation fusion
combines the feature map of each of the three streams to consider the
correlations among the target appearance, target motion and camera ego-motion.
The fused feature vector is robust to the camera movement and compensates for
the noise of the camera ego-motion. Short-term intervals are modeled using the
fused feature vector, and a long short-term memory(LSTM) model considers the
temporal dynamics of the video. We evaluated the proposed method on two-public
benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. The
experimental results show that the proposed fusion method successfully
generated a discriminative feature vector, and our network outperformed all
competing activity recognition methods in first-person videos where
considerable camera ego-motion occurs.

  The rapid development of embedded hardware in autonomous vehicles broadens
their computational capabilities, thus bringing the possibility to mount more
complete sensor setups able to handle driving scenarios of higher complexity.
As a result, new challenges such as multiple detections of the same object have
to be addressed. In this work, a siamese network is integrated into the
pipeline of a well-known 3D object detector approach to suppress duplicate
proposals coming from different cameras via re-identification. Additionally,
associations are exploited to enhance the 3D box regression of the object by
aggregating their corresponding LiDAR frustums. The experimental evaluation on

  Deep artificial neural networks, trained with labeled data sets are widely

reflex models. Follow a common infrastructure with environment sensing and AI

Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Fully automatic large-scale land cover mapping belongs to the core challenges
addressed by the remote sensing community. Usually, the basis of this task is
formed by (supervised) machine learning models. However, in spite of recent
growth in the availability of satellite observations, accurate training data
remains comparably scarce. On the other hand, numerous global land cover
products exist and can be accessed often free-of-charge. Unfortunately, these
maps are typically of a much lower resolution than modern day satellite
imagery. Besides, they always come with a significant amount of noise, as they
cannot be considered ground truth, but are products of previous
(semi-)automatic prediction tasks. Therefore, this paper seeks to make a case
for the application of weakly supervised learning strategies to get the most
out of available data sources and achieve progress in high-resolution
large-scale land cover mapping. Challenges and opportunities are discussed
based on the SEN12MS dataset, for which also some baseline results are shown.
These baselines indicate that there is still a lot of potential for dedicated
approaches designed to deal with remote sensing-specific forms of weak
supervision.

\\
  Automatic radiology report generation has been an attracting research problem
towards computer-aided diagnosis to alleviate the workload of doctors in recent
years. Deep learning techniques for natural image captioning are successfully
adapted to generating radiology reports. However, radiology image reporting is
different from the natural image captioning task in two aspects: 1) the
accuracy of positive disease keyword mentions is critical in radiology image
reporting in comparison to the equivalent importance of every single word in a
natural image caption; 2) the evaluation of reporting quality should focus more
on matching the disease keywords and their associated attributes instead of
counting the occurrence of N-gram. Based on these concerns, we propose to
utilize a pre-constructed graph embedding module (modeled with a graph
convolutional neural network) on multiple disease findings to assist the
generation of reports in this work. The incorporation of knowledge graph allows
for dedicated feature learning for each disease finding and the relationship
modeling between them. In addition, we proposed a new evaluation metric for
radiology image reporting with the assistance of the same composed graph.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the methods
integrated with the proposed graph embedding module on a publicly accessible
dataset (IU-RR) of chest radiographs compared with previous approaches using
both the conventional evaluation metrics commonly adopted for image captioning
and our proposed ones.

Title: VQA-LOL: Visual Question Answering under the Lens of Logic
Authors: Tejas Gokhale, Pratyay Banerjee, Chitta Baral, Yezhou Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.CL
\\
  Logical connectives and their implications on the meaning of a natural
language sentence are a fundamental aspect of understanding. In this paper, we
investigate visual question answering (VQA) through the lens of logical
transformation and posit that systems that seek to answer questions about
images must be robust to these transformations of the question. If a VQA system
is able to answer a question, it should also be able to answer the logical
composition of questions. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art models
on the VQA task under these logical operations and show that they have
difficulty in correctly answering such questions. We then construct an
augmentation of the VQA dataset with questions containing logical operations
and retrain the same models to establish a baseline. We further propose a novel
methodology to train models to learn negation, conjunction, and disjunction and
show improvement in learning logical composition and retaining performance on
VQA. We suggest this work as a move towards embedding logical connectives in
visual understanding, along with the benefits of robustness and
generalizability. Our code and dataset is available online at

  Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer type in women around the
world. In some countries, due to non-existent or inadequate screening, it is
often detected at late stages, making standard treatment options often absent
or unaffordable. It is a deadly disease that could benefit from early detection
approaches. It is usually done by cytological exams which consist of visually
inspecting the nuclei searching for morphological alteration. Since it is done
by humans, naturally, some subjectivity is introduced. Computational methods
could be used to reduce this, where the first stage of the process would be the
nuclei segmentation. In this context, we present a complete pipeline for the
segmentation of nuclei in Feulgen-stained images using Convolutional Neural
Networks. Here we show the entire process of segmentation, since the collection
of the samples, passing through pre-processing, training the network,
post-processing and results evaluation. We achieved an overall IoU of 0.78,
showing the affordability of the approach of nuclei segmentation on
Feulgen-stained images. The code is available in:

Title: Extracting Semantic Indoor Maps from Occupancy Grids
Authors: Ziyuan Liu, Georg von Wichert
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  The primary challenge for any autonomous system operating in realistic,
rather unconstrained scenarios is to manage the complexity and uncertainty of
the real world. While it is unclear how exactly humans and other higher animals
master these problems, it seems evident, that abstraction plays an important
role. The use of abstract concepts allows to define the system behavior on
higher levels. In this paper we focus on the semantic mapping of indoor
environments. We propose a method to extract an abstracted floor plan from
typical grid maps using Bayesian reasoning. The result of this procedure is a
probabilistic generative model of the environment defined over abstract
concepts. It is well suited for higher-level reasoning and communication
purposes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using real-world
data.

Title: A Case for Humans-in-the-Loop: Decisions in the Presence of Erroneous
  Algorithmic Scores
Authors: Maria De-Arteaga, Riccardo Fogliato, Alexandra Chouldechova
Categories: cs.CY
DOI: 10.1145/3313831.3376638
\\
  The increased use of algorithmic predictions in sensitive domains has been
accompanied by both enthusiasm and concern. To understand the opportunities and
risks of these technologies, it is key to study how experts alter their
decisions when using such tools. In this paper, we study the adoption of an
algorithmic tool used to assist child maltreatment hotline screening decisions.
We focus on the question: Are humans capable of identifying cases in which the
machine is wrong, and of overriding those recommendations? We first show that
humans do alter their behavior when the tool is deployed. Then, we show that
humans are less likely to adhere to the machine's recommendation when the score
displayed is an incorrect estimate of risk, even when overriding the
recommendation requires supervisory approval. These results highlight the risks
of full automation and the importance of designing decision pipelines that
provide humans with autonomy.

Title: SPORES: Sum-Product Optimization via Relational Equality Saturation for
  Large Scale Linear Algebra
Authors: Yisu Remy Wang, Shana Hutchison, Jonathan Leang, Bill Howe, Dan Suciu
Categories: cs.DB cs.PL
\\
  Machine learning algorithms are commonly specified in linear algebra (LA). LA
expressions can be rewritten into more efficient forms, by taking advantage of
input properties such as sparsity, as well as program properties such as common
subexpressions and fusible operators. The complex interaction among these
properties' impact on the execution cost poses a challenge to optimizing
compilers. Existing compilers resort to intricate heuristics that complicate
the codebase and add maintenance cost but fail to search through the large
space of equivalent LA expressions to find the cheapest one. We introduce a
general optimization technique for LA expressions, by converting the LA
expressions into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions, optimizing the latter,
then converting the result back to (optimized) LA expressions. One major
advantage of this method is that it is complete, meaning that any equivalent LA
expression can be found using the equivalence rules in RA. The challenge is the
major size of the search space, and we address this by adopting and extending a
technique used in compilers, called equality saturation. We integrate the
optimizer into SystemML and validate it empirically across a spectrum of
machine learning tasks; we show that we can derive all existing hand-coded
optimizations in SystemML, and perform new optimizations that lead to speedups
from 1.2X to 5X.

Title: Realtime Index-Free Single Source SimRank Processing on Web-Scale Graphs
Authors: Jieming Shi, Tianyuan Jin, Renchi Yang, Xiaokui Xiao, Yin Yang
Categories: cs.DB cs.AI cs.SI
Comments: To appear in PVLDB 2020

\\
  Given a graph G and a node u in G, a single source SimRank query evaluates
the similarity between u and every node v in G. Existing approaches to single
source SimRank computation incur either long query response time, or expensive
pre-computation, which needs to be performed again whenever the graph G
changes. Consequently, to our knowledge none of them is ideal for scenarios in
which (i) query processing must be done in realtime, and (ii) the underlying
graph G is massive, with frequent updates.
  Motivated by this, we propose SimPush, a novel algorithm that answers single
source SimRank queries without any pre-computation, and at the same time
achieves significantly higher query processing speed than even the fastest
known index-based solutions. Further, SimPush provides rigorous result quality
guarantees, and its high performance does not rely on any strong assumption of
the underlying graph. Specifically, compared to existing methods, SimPush
employs a radically different algorithmic design that focuses on (i)
identifying a small number of nodes relevant to the query, and subsequently
(ii) computing statistics and performing residue push from these nodes only.
  We prove the correctness of SimPush, analyze its time complexity, and compare
its asymptotic performance with that of existing methods. Meanwhile, we
evaluate the practical performance of SimPush through extensive experiments on
8 real datasets. The results demonstrate that SimPush consistently outperforms
all existing solutions, often by over an order of magnitude. In particular, on
a commodity machine, SimPush answers a single source SimRank query on a web
graph containing over 133 million nodes and 5.4 billion edges in under 62
milliseconds, with 0.00035 empirical error, while the fastest index-based
competitor needs 1.18 seconds.

Title: Optimizing Federated Queries Based on the Physical Design of a Data Lake
Authors: Philipp D. Rohde and Maria-Esther Vidal
Categories: cs.DB
Comments: work-in-progress paper
\\
  The optimization of query execution plans is known to be crucial for reducing
the query execution time. In particular, query optimization has been studied
thoroughly for relational databases over the past decades. Recently, the
Resource Description Framework (RDF) became popular for publishing data on the
Web. As a consequence, federations composed of different data models like RDF
and relational databases evolved. One type of these federations are Semantic
Data Lakes where every data source is kept in its original data model and
semantically annotated with ontologies or controlled vocabularies. However,
state-of-the-art query engines for federated query processing over Semantic
Data Lakes often rely on optimization techniques tailored for RDF. In this
paper, we present query optimization techniques guided by heuristics that take
the physical design of a Data Lake into account. The heuristics are implemented
on top of Ontario, a SPARQL query engine for Semantic Data Lakes. Using
source-specific heuristics, the query engine is able to generate more efficient
query execution plans by exploiting the knowledge about indexes and
normalization in relational databases. We show that heuristics which take the
physical design of the Data Lake into account are able to speed up query
processing.

Title: Supporting OpenMP 5.0 Tasks in hpxMP -- A study of an OpenMP
  implementation within Task Based Runtime Systems
Authors: Tianyi Zhang, Shahrzad Shirzad, Bibek Wagle, Adrian S. Lemoine,

\\
  OpenMP has been the de facto standard for single node parallelism for more
than a decade. Recently, asynchronous many-task runtime (AMT) systems have
increased in popularity as a new programming paradigm for high performance
computing applications. One of the major challenges of this new paradigm is the
incompatibility of the OpenMP thread model and other AMTs. Highly optimized
OpenMP-based libraries do not perform well when coupled with AMTs because the
threading of both libraries will compete for resources. This paper is a
follow-up paper on the fundamental implementation of hpxMP, an implementation
of the OpenMP standard which utilizes the C++ standard library for Parallelism
and Concurrency (HPX) to schedule and manage tasks. In this paper, we present
the implementation of task features, e.g. taskgroup, task depend, and
task_reduction, of the OpenMP 5.0 standard and optimization of the #pragma omp
parallel for pragma. We use the daxpy benchmark, the Barcelona OpenMP Tasks
Suite, Parallel research kernels, and OpenBLAS benchmarks to compare the
different OpenMp implementations: hpxMP, llvm-OpenMP, and GOMP.

Title: Holistic Slowdown Driven Scheduling and Resource Management for
  Malleable Jobs
Authors: Marco D'Amico and Ana Jokanovic and Julita Corbalan
Categories: cs.DC
Journal-ref: In Proceedings of the 48th International Conference on Parallel
  Processing (ICPP 2019). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY,

DOI: 10.1145/3337821.3337909
\\
  In job scheduling, the concept of malleability has been explored since many
years ago. Research shows that malleability improves system performance, but
its utilization in HPC never became widespread. The causes are the difficulty
in developing malleable applications, and the lack of support and integration
of the different layers of the HPC software stack. However, in the last years,
malleability in job scheduling is becoming more critical because of the
increasing complexity of hardware and workloads. In this context, using nodes
in an exclusive mode is not always the most efficient solution as in
traditional HPC jobs, where applications were highly tuned for static
allocations, but offering zero flexibility to dynamic executions. This paper
proposes a new holistic, dynamic job scheduling policy, Slowdown Driven
(SD-Policy), which exploits the malleability of applications as the key
technology to reduce the average slowdown and response time of jobs. SD-Policy
is based on backfill and node sharing. It applies malleability to running jobs
to make room for jobs that will run with a reduced set of resources, only when
the estimated slowdown improves over the static approach. We implemented
SD-Policy in SLURM and evaluated it in a real production environment, and with
a simulator using workloads of up to 198K jobs. Results show better resource
utilization with the reduction of makespan, response time, slowdown, and energy
consumption, up to respectively 7%, 50%, 70%, and 6%, for the evaluated
workloads.

Title: The Sum of Its Parts: Analysis of Federated Byzantine Agreement Systems
Authors: Martin Florian, Sebastian Henningsen, Bj\"orn Scheuermann
Categories: cs.DC cs.CR
\\
  Federated Byzantine Agreement Systems (FBASs) are a fascinating new paradigm
in the context of consensus protocols. Originally proposed for powering the
Stellar payment network, FBASs can be thought of as a middle way between
typical permissionless systems (like Bitcoin) and permissioned approaches for
solving consensus (like classical BFT protocols). Unlike Bitcoin and the like,
validators must be explicitly chosen by peers. Unlike permissioned protocols,
there is no need for the whole system to agree on the same set of validators.
Instead, every node is free to decide for itself with whom it requires
agreement. In this paper, we propose an intuitive yet precise methodology for
determining whether the quorum systems resulting from such individual
configurations can enable liveness and safety, respectively how many
(byzantine) node failures they are away from losing these qualities. We apply
our analysis approach and software to evaluate the effects of different node
configuration policies, i.e., logics through which node configurations result
from strategic considerations or an existing inter-node relationship graph.
Lastly, we also investigate the reported "open-membership" property of FBASs.
We observe that an often small group of nodes is exclusively relevant for
determining safety and liveness "buffers", and prove that these top tiers are
effectively "closed-membership" if maintaining safety is a core requirement.

\\
  The complexity of modern and upcoming computing architectures poses severe
challenges for code developers and application specialists, and forces them to
expose the highest possible degree of parallelism, in order to make the best
use of the available hardware. The Intel$^{(R)}$ Xeon Phi$^{(TM)}$ of second
generation (code-named Knights Landing, henceforth KNL) is the latest many-core
system, which implements several interesting hardware features like for example
a large number of cores per node (up to 72), the 512 bits-wide vector registers
and the high-bandwidth memory. The unique features of KNL make this platform a
powerful testbed for modern HPC applications. The performance of codes on KNL
is therefore a useful proxy of their readiness for future architectures. In
this work we describe the lessons learnt during the optimisation of the widely
used codes for computational astrophysics P-Gadget-3, Flash and Echo. Moreover,
we present results for the visualisation and analysis tools VisIt and yt. These
examples show that modern architectures benefit from code optimisation at
different levels, even more than traditional multi-core systems. However, the
level of modernisation of typical community codes still needs improvements, for
them to fully utilise resources of novel architectures.

Title: Truly Tight-in-$\Delta$ Bounds for Bipartite Maximal Matching and
  Variants
Authors: Sebastian Brandt, Dennis Olivetti
Categories: cs.DC cs.CC
\\
  In a recent breakthrough result, Balliu et al. [FOCS'19] proved a
deterministic $\Omega(\min(\Delta,\log n /\log \log n))$-round and a randomized
$\Omega(\min(\Delta,\log \log n/\log \log \log n))$-round lower bound for the
complexity of the bipartite maximal matching problem on $n$-node graphs in the
LOCAL model of distributed computing.
  Both lower bounds are asymptotically tight as a function of the maximum
degree $\Delta$.
  We provide truly tight bounds in $\Delta$ for the complexity of bipartite
maximal matching and many natural variants, up to and including the additive
constant.
  As a by-product, our results yield a considerably simplified version of the
proof by Balliu et al.
  We show that our results can be obtained via bounded automatic round
elimination, a version of the recent automatic round elimination technique by
Brandt [PODC'19] that is particularly suited for automatization from a
practical perspective.
  In this context, our work can be seen as another step towards the
automatization of lower bounds in the LOCAL model.

Authors: Abdul Dakkak, Cheng Li, Jinjun Xiong, Wen-mei Hwu
Categories: cs.DC cs.AI cs.LG cs.PF cs.SE stat.ML
\\
  Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) innovations are being introduced
at such a rapid pace that researchers are hard-pressed to analyze and study
them. The complicated procedures for evaluating innovations, along with the
lack of standard and efficient ways of specifying and provisioning ML/DL
evaluation, is a major "pain point" for the community. This paper proposes
MLModelScope, an open-source, framework/hardware agnostic, extensible and
customizable design that enables repeatable, fair, and scalable model
evaluation and benchmarking.
  We implement the distributed design with support for all major frameworks and
hardware, and equip it with web, command-line, and library interfaces. To
demonstrate MLModelScope's capabilities we perform parallel evaluation and show
how subtle changes to model evaluation pipeline affects the accuracy and HW/SW
stack choices affect performance.

Title: Balancing Efficiency and Flexibility for DNN Acceleration via Temporal
  GPU-Systolic Array Integration
Authors: Cong Guo, Yangjie Zhou, Jingwen Leng, Yuhao Zhu, Zidong Du, Quan Chen,
  Chao Li, Minyi Guo and Bin Yao
Categories: cs.DC cs.LG
Comments: Accepted by DAC2020
\\
  The research interest in specialized hardware accelerators for deep neural
networks (DNN) spiked recently owing to their superior performance and
efficiency. However, today's DNN accelerators primarily focus on accelerating
specific "kernels" such as convolution and matrix multiplication, which are
vital but only part of an end-to-end DNN-enabled application. Meaningful
speedups over the entire application often require supporting computations that
are, while massively parallel, ill-suited to DNN accelerators. Integrating a
general-purpose processor such as a CPU or a GPU incurs significant data
movement overhead and leads to resource under-utilization on the DNN
accelerators.
  We propose Simultaneous Multi-mode Architecture (SMA), a novel architecture
design and execution model that offers general-purpose programmability on DNN
accelerators in order to accelerate end-to-end applications. The key to SMA is
the temporal integration of the systolic execution model with the GPU-like SIMD
execution model. The SMA exploits the common components shared between the
systolic-array accelerator and the GPU, and provides lightweight
reconfiguration capability to switch between the two modes in-situ. The SMA
achieves up to 63% performance improvement while consuming 23% less energy than
the baseline Volta architecture with TensorCore.

Title: BB_Evac: Fast Location-Sensitive Behavior-Based Building Evacuation
Authors: Subhra Mazumdar, Arindam Pal, Francesco Parisi, V.S. Subrahmanian
Categories: cs.DM cs.AI cs.DS cs.LG cs.SI
\\
  Past work on evacuation planning assumes that evacuees will follow
instructions -- however, there is ample evidence that this is not the case.
While some people will follow instructions, others will follow their own
desires. In this paper, we present a formal definition of a behavior-based
evacuation problem (BBEP) in which a human behavior model is taken into account
when planning an evacuation. We show that a specific form of constraints can be
used to express such behaviors. We show that BBEPs can be solved exactly via an
integer program called BB_IP, and inexactly by a much faster algorithm that we
call BB_Evac. We conducted a detailed experimental evaluation of both
algorithms applied to buildings (though in principle the algorithms can be
applied to any graphs) and show that the latter is an order of magnitude faster
than BB_IP while producing results that are almost as good on one real-world
building graph and as well as on several synthetically generated graphs.

Title: Fair Clustering with Multiple Colors
Authors: Matteo B\"ohm, Adriano Fazzone, Stefano Leonardi, Chris Schwiegelshohn
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  A fair clustering instance is given a data set $A$ in which every point is
assigned some color. Colors correspond to various protected attributes such as
sex, ethnicity, or age. A fair clustering is an instance where membership of
points in a cluster is uncorrelated with the coloring of the points.
  Of particular interest is the case where all colors are equally represented.
If we have exactly two colors, Chierrichetti, Kumar, Lattanzi and Vassilvitskii
(NIPS 2017) showed that various $k$-clustering objectives admit a constant
factor approximation. Since then, a number of follow up work has attempted to
extend this result to a multi-color case, though so far, the only known results
either result in no-constant factor approximation, apply only to special
clustering objectives such as $k$-center, yield bicrititeria approximations, or
require $k$ to be constant.
  In this paper, we present a simple reduction from unconstrained
$k$-clustering to fair $k$-clustering for a large range of clustering
objectives including $k$-median, $k$-means, and $k$-center. The reduction loses
only a constant factor in the approximation guarantee, marking the first true
constant factor approximation for many of these problems.

Title: Simplex based Steiner tree instances yield large integrality gaps for
  the bidirected cut relaxation
Authors: Robert Vicari
Categories: cs.DS cs.DM math.CO
\\
  The bidirected cut relaxation is the characteristic representative of the
bidirected relaxations ($\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}$) which are a well-known class
of equivalent LP-relaxations for the NP-hard Steiner Tree Problem in Graphs
(STP). Although no general approximation algorithm based on
$\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}$ with an approximation ratio better than $2$ for STP is
known, it is mostly preferred in integer programming as an implementation of
STP, since there exists a formulation of compact size, which turns out to be
very effective in practice.
  It is known that the integrality gap of $\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}$ is at most
$2$, and a long standing open question is whether the integrality gap is less
than $2$ or not. The best lower bound so far is $\frac{36}{31} \approx 1.161$
proven by Byrka et al. [BGRS13]. Based on the work of Chakrabarty et al.
[CDV11] about embedding STP instances into simplices by considering appropriate
dual formulations, we improve on this result by constructing a new class of
instances and showing that their integrality gaps tend at least to $\frac{6}{5}
= 1.2$.
  More precisely, we consider the class of equivalent LP-relaxations
$\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}^{+}$, that can be obtained by strengthening
$\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}$ by already known straightforward Steiner vertex degree
constraints, and show that the worst case ratio regarding the optimum value
between $\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}$ and $\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}^{+}$ is at least
$\frac{6}{5}$. Since $\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}^{+}$ is a lower bound for the
hypergraphic relaxations ($\mathrm{\mathcal{HYP}}$), another well-known class
of equivalent LP-relaxations on which the current best $(\ln(4) +
\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for STP by Byrka et al. [BGRS13] is
based, this worst case ratio also holds for $\mathrm{\mathcal{BCR}}$ and
$\mathrm{\mathcal{HYP}}$.

Title: Improved (Provable) Algorithms for the Shortest Vector Problem via
  Bounded Distance Decoding
Authors: Divesh Aggarwal, Yanlin Chen, Rajendra Kumar and Yixin Shen
Categories: cs.DS cs.CR
\\
  The most important computational problem on lattices is the Shortest Vector
Problem ($SVP$). In this paper we present new algorithms that improve the
state-of-the-art for provable classical/quantum algorithms for $SVP$. We
present the following results.
  $\bullet$ A new algorithm for $SVP$ that provides a smooth tradeoff between
time complexity and memory requirement. For any positive integer $q>1$, our
algorithm takes $q^{\Theta(n)}$ time and requires $q^{\Theta(n/q)}$ memory. In
fact, we give a similar time-memory tradeoff for Discrete Gaussian sampling
above the smoothing parameter.
  $\bullet$ A quantum algorithm that runs in time $2^{0.9532n+o(n)}$ and
requires $2^{0.5n+o(n)}$ classical memory and $poly(n)$ qubits. This improves
over the previously fastest classical (which is also the fastest quantum)
algorithm due to [ADRS15] that has a time and space complexity $2^{n+o(n)}$.
  $\bullet$ A classical algorithm for $SVP$ that runs in time $2^{1.73n+o(n)}$
time and $2^{0.5n+o(n)}$ space and improves over an algorithm from [CCL18] that
has the same space complexity.

  Given a text $T$ of length $n$ and a pattern $P$ of length $m$, the string
matching problem is a task to find all occurrences of $P$ in $T$. In this
study, we propose an algorithm that solves this problem in $O((n + m)q)$ time
considering the distance between two adjacent occurrences of the same $q$-gram
contained in $P$. We also propose a theoretical improvement of it which runs in
$O(n + m)$ time, though it is not necessarily faster in practice. We compare
the execution times of our and existing algorithms on various kinds of real and
artificial datasets such as an English text, a genome sequence and a Fibonacci
string. The experimental results show that our algorithm is as fast as the
state-of-the-art algorithms in many cases, particularly when a pattern
frequently appears in a text.

Title: Translating Between Wavelet Tree and Wavelet Matrix Construction
Authors: Patrick Dinklage
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: Paper originally submitted to and presented at the Prague Stringology
  Conference 2019
\\
  The wavelet tree (Grossi et al. [SODA, 2003]) and wavelet matrix (Claude et
al. [Inf. Syst., 2015]) are compact data structures with many applications such
as text indexing or computational geometry. By continuing the recent research
of Fischer et al. [ALENEX, 2018], we explore the similarities and differences
of these heavily related data structures with focus on their construction. We
develop a data structure to modify construction algorithms for either the
wavelet tree or matrix to construct instead the other. This modification is
efficient, in that it does not worsen the asymptotic time and space
requirements of any known wavelet tree or wavelet matrix construction
algorithm.

Title: Span Recovery for Deep Neural Networks with Applications to Input
  Obfuscation
Authors: Rajesh Jayaram, David P. Woodruff, Qiuyi Zhang
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  The tremendous success of deep neural networks has motivated the need to
better understand the fundamental properties of these networks, but many of the
theoretical results proposed have only been for shallow networks. In this
paper, we study an important primitive for understanding the meaningful input
space of a deep network: span recovery. For $k<n$, let $\mathbf{A} \in
\mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$ be the innermost weight matrix of an arbitrary feed
forward neural network $M:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, so $M(x)$ can be
written as $M(x) = \sigma(\mathbf{A} x)$, for some network $\sigma:\mathbb{R}^k
\to \mathbb{R}$. The goal is then to recover the row span of $\mathbf{A}$ given
only oracle access to the value of $M(x)$. We show that if $M$ is a
multi-layered network with ReLU activation functions, then partial recovery is
possible: namely, we can provably recover $k/2$ linearly independent vectors in
the row span of $\mathbf{A}$ using poly$(n)$ non-adaptive queries to $M(x)$.
Furthermore, if $M$ has differentiable activation functions, we demonstrate
that full span recovery is possible even when the output is first passed
through a sign or $0/1$ thresholding function; in this case our algorithm is
adaptive. Empirically, we confirm that full span recovery is not always
possible, but only for unrealistically thin layers. For reasonably wide
networks, we obtain full span recovery on both random networks and networks
trained on MNIST data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of span recovery
as an attack by inducing neural networks to misclassify data obfuscated by
controlled random noise as sensical inputs.

Title: Efficient Construction of Behavior Graphs for Uncertain Event Data
Authors: Marco Pegoraro and Merih Seran Uysal and Wil M.P. van der Aalst
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, 1 tables
\\
  The discipline of process mining deals with analyzing execution data of
operational processes, extracting models from event data, checking the
conformance between event data and normative models, and enhancing all aspects
of processes. Recently, new techniques have been developed to analyze event
data containing uncertainty; these techniques strongly rely on representing
uncertain event data through graph-based models capturing uncertainty. In this
paper we present a novel approach to efficiently compute a graph representation
of the behavior contained in an uncertain process trace. We present our new
algorithm, analyze its time complexity, and report experimental results showing
order-of-magnitude performance improvements for behavior graph construction.

Title: Subexponential parameterized algorithms and kernelization on almost
  chordal graphs
Authors: Fedor V. Fomin and Petr A. Golovach
Categories: cs.DS cs.DM
\\
  We study the algorithmic properties of the graph class Chordal-ke, that is,
graphs that can be turned into a chordal graph by adding at most k edges or,
equivalently, the class of graphs of fill-in at most k. We discover that a
number of fundamental intractable optimization problems being parameterized by
k admit subexponential algorithms on graphs from Chordal-ke. We identify a
large class of optimization problems on Chordal-ke that admit algorithms with
the typical running time 2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log k)}\cdot n^{O(1)}. Examples of the
problems from this class are finding an independent set of maximum weight,
finding a feedback vertex set or an odd cycle transversal of minimum weight, or
the problem of finding a maximum induced planar subgraph. On the other hand, we
show that for some fundamental optimization problems, like finding an optimal
graph coloring or finding a maximum clique, are FPT on Chordal-ke when
parameterized by k but do not admit subexponential in k algorithms unless ETH
fails. Besides subexponential time algorithms, the class of Chordal-ke graphs
appears to be appealing from the perspective of kernelization (with parameter
k). While it is possible to show that most of the weighted variants of
optimization problems do not admit polynomial in k kernels on Chordal-ke
graphs, this does not exclude the existence of Turing kernelization and
kernelization for unweighted graphs. In particular, we construct a polynomial
Turing kernel for Weighted Clique on Chordal-ke graphs. For (unweighted)
Independent Set we design polynomial kernels on two interesting subclasses of
Chordal-ke, namely, Interval-ke and Split-ke graphs.

Title: Parallel Algorithms for Small Subgraph Counting
Authors: Amartya Shankha Biswas, Talya Eden, Quanquan C. Liu, Slobodan

Categories: cs.DS cs.DC
\\
  Subgraph counting is a fundamental problem in analyzing massive graphs, often
studied in the context of social and complex networks. There is a rich
literature on designing efficient, accurate, and scalable algorithms for this
problem. In this work, we tackle this challenge and design several new
algorithms for subgraph counting in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC)
model:
  Given a graph $G$ over $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and $T$ triangles, our first
main result is an algorithm that, with high probability, outputs a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to $T$, with optimal round and space complexity
provided any $S \geq \max{(\sqrt m, n^2/m)}$ space per machine, assuming
$T=\Omega(\sqrt{m/n})$.
  Our second main result is an $\tilde{O}_{\delta}(\log \log n)$-rounds
algorithm for exactly counting the number of triangles, parametrized by the
arboricity $\alpha$ of the input graph. The space per machine is
$O(n^{\delta})$ for any constant $\delta$, and the total space is $O(m\alpha)$,
which matches the time complexity of (combinatorial) triangle counting in the
sequential model. We also prove that this result can be extended to exactly
counting $k$-cliques for any constant $k$, with the same round complexity and
total space $O(m\alpha^{k-2})$. Alternatively, allowing $O(\alpha^2)$ space per
machine, the total space requirement reduces to $O(n\alpha^2)$.
  Finally, we prove that a recent result of Bera, Pashanasangi and Seshadhri
(ITCS 2020) for exactly counting all subgraphs of size at most $5$, can be
implemented in the MPC model in $\tilde{O}_{\delta}(\sqrt{\log n})$ rounds,
$O(n^{\delta})$ space per machine and $O(m\alpha^3)$ total space. Therefore,
this result also exhibits the phenomenon that a time bound in the sequential
model translates to a space bound in the MPC model.

Title: U-Bubble Model for Mixed Unit Interval Graphs and its Applications: The
  MaxCut Problem Revisited
Authors: Jan Kratochv\'il, Tom\'a\v{s} Masa\v{r}\'ik, Jana Novotn\'a
Categories: cs.DS cs.CC cs.DM
Comments: 26 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Interval graphs, intersection graphs of segments on a real line (intervals),
play a key role in the study of algorithms and special structural properties.
Unit interval graphs, their proper subclass, where each interval has a unit
length, has also been extensively studied. We study mixed unit interval graphs;
a generalization of unit interval graphs where each interval has still a unit
length, but intervals of more than one type (open, closed, semi-closed) are
allowed. This small modification captures a much richer class of graphs. In
particular, mixed unit interval graphs are not claw-free, compared to unit
interval graphs.
  Heggernes, Meister, and Papadopoulos defined a representation of unit
interval graphs called the bubble model which turned out to be useful in
algorithm design. We extend this model to the class of mixed unit interval
graphs. The original bubble model was used by Boyaci, Ekim, and Shalom for
proving the polynomiality of the MaxCut problem on unit interval graphs.
However, we found a significant mistake in the proof which seems to be hardly
repairable. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantages of such a model by
providing a subexponential-time algorithm solving the MaxCut problem on mixed
unit interval graphs using our extended version of the bubble model. In
addition, it gives us a polynomial-time algorithm for specific mixed unit
interval graphs; that improves a state-of-the-art result even for unit interval
graphs. We further provide a better algorithmic upper-bound on the clique-width
of mixed unit interval graphs. Clique-width is one of the most general
structural graph parameters, where a large group of natural problems is still
solvable in the tracktable time when an efficient representation is given.
Unfortunately, the exact computation of the clique-width representation is
NP-hard. Therefore, good upper-bounds on clique-width are highly appreciated.

Title: Comparing consecutive letter counts in multiple context-free languages
Authors: Florian Lehner and Christian Lindorfer
Categories: cs.FL math.CO
MSC-class: 68Q45
\\
  Context-free grammars are not able to model cross-serial dependencies in
natural languages. To overcome this issue, Seki et al. introduced a
generalization called $m$-multiple context-free grammars ($m$-MCFGs), which
deal with $m$-tuples of strings. We show that $m$-MCFGs are capable of
comparing the number of consecutive occurrences of at most $2m$ different
letters. In particular, the language $\{a_1^{n_1} a_2^{n_2} \dots
a_{k}^{n_{2m+1}} \mid n_1 \geq n_2 \geq \dots \geq n_{2m+1} \geq 0\}$ is
$(m+1)$-multiple context-free, but not $m$-multiple context-free.

Title: A Survey on Deep Geometry Learning: From a Representation Perspective
Authors: Yun-Peng Xiao, Yu-Kun Lai, Fang-Lue Zhang, Chunpeng Li, Lin Gao
Categories: cs.GR
\\
  Researchers have now achieved great success on dealing with 2D images using
deep learning. In recent years, 3D computer vision and Geometry Deep Learning
gain more and more attention. Many advanced techniques for 3D shapes have been
proposed for different applications. Unlike 2D images, which can be uniformly
represented by regular grids of pixels, 3D shapes have various representations,
such as depth and multi-view images, voxel-based representation, point-based
representation, mesh-based representation, implicit surface representation,
etc. However, the performance for different applications largely depends on the
representation used, and there is no unique representation that works well for
all applications. Therefore, in this survey, we review recent development in
deep learning for 3D geometry from a representation perspective, summarizing
the advantages and disadvantages of different representations in different
applications. We also present existing datasets in these representations and
further discuss future research directions.

Title: Simultaneous games with purchase of randomly supplied perfect
  information: Oracle Games
Authors: Matthew J. Young and Andrew Belmonte
Categories: cs.GT cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 30 pages, 8 figures
\\
  We study the role of costly information in non-cooperative two-player games
when an extrinsic third party information broker is introduced asymmetrically,
allowing one player to obtain information about the other player's action. This
broker or "oracle" is defined by a probability of response, supplying correct
information randomly; the informed player can pay more for a higher probability
of response. We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for strategy
profiles to be equilibria, in terms of how both players change their strategies
in response to the existence of the oracle, as determined by its cost of
information function. For mixed strategy equilibria, there is a continuous
change as information becomes cheaper, with clear transitions occuring at
critical {\it nodes} at which pure strategies become dominated (or
undominated). These nodes separate distinct responses to the information for
sale, alternating between regions where the paying player increases the amount
of information purchased, and regions where the other player moves away from
riskier strategies, in favor of safer bets that minimize losses. We derive
conditions for these responses by defining a value of information.

systems to achieve great general usability and application across a variety of
domains. These advancements have improved not only people's understanding of
data, but also the general understanding of people themselves, and how they

Title: Familiarization tours for first-time users of highly automated cars:
  Comparing the effects of virtual environments with different levels of
  interaction fidelity
Authors: Mahdi Ebnali, Richard Lamb, Razieh Fathi
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Research in aviation and driving has highlighted the importance of training
as an effective approach to reduce the costs associated with the supervisory
role of the human in automated systems. However, only a few studies have
investigated the effect of pre-trip familiarization tours on highly automated
driving. In the present study, a driving simulator experiment compared the
effectiveness of four familiarization groups, control, video, low fidelity
virtual reality (VR), and high fidelity VR on automation trust and driving
performance in several critical and non-critical transition tasks. The results
revealed the positive impact of familiarization tours on trust, takeover, and
handback performance at the first time of measurement. Takeover quality only
improved when practice was presented in high-fidelity VR. After three times of
exposure to transition requests, trust and transition performance of all groups
converged to those of the high fidelity VR group, demonstrating that: a)
experiencing automation failures during the training may reduce costs
associated with first failures in highly automated driving; b) the VR tour with
high level of interaction fidelity is superior to other types of
familiarization tour, and c) uneducated and less-educated drivers learn about
automation by experiencing it. Knowledge resulting from this research could
help develop cost-effective familiarization tours for highly automated vehicles
in dealerships and car rental centers.

Title: Emotion Recognition Through Observer's Physiological Signals
Authors: Yang Liu, Tom Gedeon, Sabrina Caldwell, Shouxu Lin, and Zi Jin
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Emotion recognition based on physiological signals is a hot topic and has a
wide range of applications, like safe driving, health care and creating a
secure society. This paper introduces a physiological dataset PAFEW, which is
obtained using movie clips from the Acted Facial Expressions in the Wild (AFEW)
dataset as stimuli. To establish a baseline, we use the electrodermal activity
(EDA) signals in this dataset and extract 6 features from each signal series
corresponding to each movie clip to recognize 7 emotions, i.e., Anger, Disgust,
Fear, Happy, Surprise, Sad and Neutral. Overall, 24 observers participated in
our collection of the training set, including 19 observers who participated in
only one session watching 80 videos from 7 classes and 5 observers who
participated multiple times and watched all the videos. All videos were
presented in an order balanced fashion. Leave-one-observer-out was employed in
this classification task. We report the classification accuracy of our
baseline, a three-layer network, on this initial training set while training
with signals from all participants, only single participants and only multiple
participants. We also investigate the recognition accuracy of grouping the
dataset by arousal or valence, which achieves 68.66% and 72.72% separately.
Finally, we provide a two-step network. The first step is to classify the
features into high/low arousal or positive/negative valence by a network. Then
the arousal/valence middle output of the first step is concatenated with
feature sets as input of the second step for emotion recognition. We found that
adding arousal or valence information can help to improve the classification
accuracy. In addition, the information of positive/negative valence boosts the
classification accuracy to a higher degree on this dataset.

Title: How Interaction Designers Use Tools to Manage Ideas

Categories: cs.HC
\\
  This paper presents a grounded theory-analysis based on a qualitative study
of professional interaction designers (n=20) with a focus on how they use tools
to manage design ideas. Idea management can be understood as a subcategory of
the field Personal Information Management, which includes the activities around
the capture, organization, retrieval, and use of information. Idea management
pertains then to the management and use of ideas as part of creative
activities. The paper identifies tool-supported idea management strategies and
needs of professional interaction designers, and discusses the context and
consequences of these strategies. Based on our analysis, we identify a
conceptual framework of ten strategies which are supported by tools: saving,
externalizing, advancing, exploring, archiving, clustering, extracting,
browsing, verifying, and collaborating. Finally, we discuss how this framework
can be used to characterize and analyze existing and novel idea management
tools.

Title: CBIR using features derived by Deep Learning
Authors: Subhadip Maji and Smarajit Bose
Categories: cs.IR cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 18 pages, 31 figures
\\
  In a Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System, the task is to retrieve
similar images from a large database given a query image. The usual procedure
is to extract some useful features from the query image, and retrieve images
which have similar set of features. For this purpose, a suitable similarity
measure is chosen, and images with high similarity scores are retrieved.
Naturally the choice of these features play a very important role in the
success of this system, and high level features are required to reduce the
semantic gap.
  In this paper, we propose to use features derived from pre-trained network
models from a deep-learning convolution network trained for a large image
classification problem. This approach appears to produce vastly superior
results for a variety of databases, and it outperforms many contemporary CBIR
systems. We analyse the retrieval time of the method, and also propose a
pre-clustering of the database based on the above-mentioned features which
yields comparable results in a much shorter time in most of the cases.

Title: Beyond Clicks: Modeling Multi-Relational Item Graph for Session-Based
  Target Behavior Prediction
Authors: Wen Wang, Wei Zhang, Shukai Liu, Qi Liu, Bo Zhang, Leyu Lin, Hongyuan
  Zha
Categories: cs.IR
Comments: 7 pages, WWW'20
\\
  Session-based target behavior prediction aims to predict the next item to be
interacted with specific behavior types (e.g., clicking). Although existing
methods for session-based behavior prediction leverage powerful representation
learning approaches to encode items' sequential relevance in a low-dimensional
space, they suffer from several limitations. Firstly, they focus on only
utilizing the same type of user behavior for prediction, but ignore the
potential of taking other behavior data as auxiliary information. This is
particularly crucial when the target behavior is sparse but important (e.g.,
buying or sharing an item). Secondly, item-to-item relations are modeled
separately and locally in one behavior sequence, and they lack a principled way
to globally encode these relations more effectively. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel Multi-relational Graph Neural Network model for
Session-based target behavior Prediction, namely MGNN-SPred for short.
Specifically, we build a Multi-Relational Item Graph (MRIG) based on all
behavior sequences from all sessions, involving target and auxiliary behavior
types. Based on MRIG, MGNN-SPred learns global item-to-item relations and
further obtains user preferences w.r.t. current target and auxiliary behavior
sequences, respectively. In the end, MGNN-SPred leverages a gating mechanism to
adaptively fuse user representations for predicting next item interacted with
target behavior. The extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of MGNN-SPred by comparing with state-of-the-art
session-based prediction methods, validating the benefits of leveraging
auxiliary behavior and learning item-to-item relations over MRIG.

Title: Capacity-achieving Spatially Coupled Sparse Superposition Codes with AMP
  Decoding
Authors: Cynthia Rush, Kuan Hsieh, Ramji Venkataramanan
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 75 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Sparse superposition codes (SPARCs) are a class of codes for efficient
communication over the AWGN channel at rates approaching the channel capacity.
In a SPARC, codewords are sparse linear combinations of columns of an i.i.d.
Gaussian design matrix. In a spatially coupled SPARC, the design matrix has a
block-wise structure where the variance of the Gaussian entries can be varied
across blocks. A well-designed spatial coupling structure can enhance theerror
performance of iterative decoding algorithms such as Approximate Message
Passing (AMP). In this paper, we obtain a non-asymptotic bound on the
probability of error of spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding. Applying
this bound to a simple band-diagonal design matrix, we prove that spatially
coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding achieve the capacity of the AWGN channel. The
bound also highlights how the decay of error probability depends on each design
parameter of the spatially coupled SPARC.
  The asymptotic mean squared error (MSE) of the AMP decoder can be predicted
via a deterministic recursion called state evolution. Our result provides the
first proof that the MSE concentrates on the state evolution prediction for
spatially coupled SPARCs. Combined with the state evolution prediction, this
result implies that spatially coupled SPARCs are capacity-achieving. The proof
technique used to establish the main result is also used to obtain a
concentration inequality for the MSE of AMP applied to compressed sensing with
spatially coupled design matrices. Finally, we provide numerical simulation
results that demonstrate the finite length error performance of spatially
coupled SPARCs. The performance is compared with coded modulation schemes that
use LDPC codes from the DVB-S2 standard.

Title: The Capacity and Optimal Signaling for Gaussian MIMO Channels Under
  Interference Constraints (full version)
Authors: Sergey Loyka
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: accepted for publication
\\
  Gaussian MIMO channel under total transmit and interference power constraints
(TPC and IPC) is considered. A closed-form solution for the optimal transmit
covariance matrix in the general case is obtained using the KKT-based approach
(up to dual variables). While closed-from solutions for optimal dual variables
are possible in special cases, an iterative bisection algorithm (IBA) is
proposed to find the optimal dual variables in the general case and its
convergence is proved for some special cases. Numerical experiments illustrate
its efficient performance. Bounds for the optimal dual variables are given,
which facilitate numerical solutions. An interplay between the TPC and IPC is
studied, including the transition from power-limited to interference-limited
regimes as the total transmit power increases. Sufficient and necessary
conditions for each constraint to be redundant are given. A number of explicit
closed-form solutions are obtained, including full-rank and rank-1
(beamforming) cases as well as the case of identical eigenvectors (typical for
massive MIMO settings). A bound on the rank of optimal covariance is
established. A number of unusual properties of optimal covariance matrix are
pointed out.

Title: DLITE: The Discounted Least Information Theory of Entropy
Authors: Weimao Ke
Categories: cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH

\\
  We propose an entropy-based information measure, namely the Discounted Least
Information Theory of Entropy (DLITE), which not only exhibits important
characteristics expected as an information measure but also satisfies
conditions of a metric. Classic information measures such as Shannon Entropy,
KL Divergence, and Jessen-Shannon Divergence have manifested some of these
properties while missing others. This work fills an important gap in the
advancement of information theory and its application, where related properties
are desirable.

Title: Repair rate lower bounds for distributed storage
Authors: Michael Luby
Categories: cs.IT cs.DC math.IT
Comments: 18 pages, 3 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory
\\
  One of the primary objectives of a distributed storage system is to reliably
store a large amount $dsize$ of source data for a long duration using a large
number $N$ of unreliable storage nodes, each with capacity $nsize$. The storage
overhead $\beta$ is the fraction of system capacity available beyond $dsize$,
i.e., $\beta = 1- \frac{dsize}{N \cdot nsize}$. Storage nodes fail randomly
over time and are replaced with initially empty nodes, and thus data is erased
from the system at an average rate $erate = \lambda \cdot N \cdot nsize$, where
$1/\lambda$ is the average lifetime of a node before failure. To maintain
recoverability of the source data, a repairer continually reads data over a
network from nodes at some average rate $rrate$, and generates and writes data
to nodes based on the read data. The main result is that, for any repairer, if
the source data is recoverable at each point in time then it must be the case
that $rrate \ge \frac{erate}{2 \cdot \beta}$ asymptotically as $N$ goes to
infinity and beta goes to zero. This inequality provides a fundamental lower
bound on the average rate that any repairer needs to read data from the system
in order to maintain recoverability of the source data.

Title: Urgency of Information for Context-Aware Timely Status Updates in Remote
  Control Systems
Authors: Xi Zheng, Sheng Zhou, Zhisheng Niu
Categories: cs.IT cs.SY eess.SY math.IT math.OC
Comments: Submitted to IEEE for possible publications
\\
  As 5G and Internet-of-Things (IoT) are deeply integrated into vertical
industries such as autonomous driving and industrial robotics, timely status
update is crucial for remote monitoring and control. In this regard, Age of
Information (AoI) has been proposed to measure the freshness of status updates.
However, it is just a metric changing linearly with time and irrelevant of
context-awareness. We propose a context-based metric, named as Urgency of
Information (UoI), to measure the nonlinear time-varying importance and the
non-uniform context-dependence of the status information. This paper first
establishes a theoretical framework for UoI characterization and then provides
UoI-optimal status updating and user scheduling schemes in both single-terminal
and multi-terminal cases. Specifically, an update-index-based scheme is
proposed for a single-terminal system, where the terminal always updates and
transmits when its update index is larger than a threshold. For the
multi-terminal case, the UoI of the proposed scheduling scheme is proven to be
upper-bounded and its decentralized implementation by Carrier Sensing Multiple
Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) is also provided. In the simulations,
the proposed updating and scheduling schemes notably outperform the existing
ones such as round robin and AoI-optimal schemes in terms of UoI, error-bound
violation and control system stability.

Title: Majority Logic Decoding for Certain Schubert Codes Using Lines in
  Schubert Varieties
Authors: Prasant Singh
Categories: cs.IT math.AG math.IT
MSC-class: 14M15, 14G50, 94B05, 94B35
\\
  In this article, we consider Schubert codes, linear codes associated to
Schubert varieties, and discuss minimum weight codewords for dual Schubert
codes. The notion of lines in Schubert varieties is looked closely at, and it
has been proved that the supports of the minimum weight codewords of the dual
Schubert codes lie on lines and any three points on a line in Schubert variety
correspond to the support of some minimum weight parity check for the Schubert
code. We use these lines in Schubert varieties to construct orthogonal parity
checks for certain Schubert codes and use them for majority logic decoding. In
some special cases, we can correct approximately up to $\lfloor (d-1)/2\rfloor$
many errors where $d$ is the minimum distance of the code.

Title: Dynamic Coded Caching in Wireless Networks
Authors: Jesper Pedersen, Alexandre Graell i Amat, Jasper Goseling, Fredrik
  Br\"annstr\"om, Iryna Andriyanova, Eirik Rosnes
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  We consider distributed and dynamic caching of coded content at small base
stations (SBSs) in an area served by a macro base station (MBS). Specifically,
content is encoded using a maximum distance separable code and cached according
to a time-to-live (TTL) cache eviction policy, which allows coded packets to be
removed from the caches at periodic times. Mobile users requesting a particular
content download coded packets from SBSs within communication range. If
additional packets are required to decode the file, these are downloaded from
the MBS. We formulate an optimization problem that is efficiently solved
numerically, providing TTL caching policies minimizing the overall network
load. We demonstrate that distributed coded caching using TTL caching policies
can offer significant reductions in terms of network load when request arrivals
are bursty. We show how the distributed coded caching problem utilizing TTL
caching policies can be analyzed as a specific single cache, convex
optimization problem. Our problem encompasses static caching and the single
cache as special cases. We prove that, interestingly, static caching is optimal
under a Poisson request process, and that for a single cache the optimization
problem has a surprisingly simple solution.

Title: Massive MIMO Transmission for LEO Satellite Communications
Authors: Li You, Ke-Xin Li, Jiaheng Wang, Xiqi Gao, Xiang-Gen Xia, Bj\"orn

Comments: 31 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications are expected to be
incorporated in future wireless networks, in particular 5G and beyond networks,
to provide global wireless access with enhanced data rates. Massive MIMO
techniques, though widely used in terrestrial communication systems, have not
been applied to LEO satellite communication systems. In this paper, we propose
a massive MIMO transmission scheme with full frequency reuse (FFR) for LEO
satellite communication systems and exploit statistical channel state
information (sCSI) to address the difficulty of obtaining instantaneous CSI
(iCSI) at the transmitter. We first establish the massive MIMO channel model
for LEO satellite communications and simplify the transmission designs via
performing Doppler and delay compensations at user terminals (UTs). Then, we
develop the low-complexity sCSI based downlink (DL) precoder and uplink (UL)
receiver in closed-form, aiming to maximize the average
signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (ASLNR) and the average
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (ASINR), respectively. It is shown that
the DL ASLNRs and UL ASINRs of all UTs reach their upper bounds under some
channel condition. Motivated by this, we propose a space angle based user
grouping (SAUG) algorithm to schedule the served UTs into different groups,
where each group of UTs use the same time and frequency resource. The proposed
algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the lower and upper
bounds of the achievable rate coincide when the number of satellite antennas or
UT groups is sufficiently large. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed massive MIMO transmission scheme with FFR significantly enhances the
data rate of LEO satellite communication systems. Notably, the proposed sCSI
based precoder and receiver achieve the similar performance with the iCSI based
ones that are often infeasible in practice.

Title: Multi-Step Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning: Convergence and Improved
  Algorithms
Authors: Kaiyi Ji, Junjie Yang, Yingbin Liang
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
Comments: 67 pages, 8 figures
\\
  As a popular meta-learning approach, the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML)
algorithm has been widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
However, the convergence of the general multi-step MAML still remains
unexplored. In this paper, we develop a new theoretical framework, under which
we characterize the convergence rate and the computational complexity of
multi-step MAML. Our results indicate that although the estimation bias and
variance of the stochastic meta gradient involve exponential factors of $N$
(the number of the inner-stage gradient updates), MAML still attains the
convergence with complexity increasing only linearly with $N$ with a properly
chosen inner stepsize. We then take a further step to develop a more efficient
Hessian-free MAML. We first show that the existing zeroth-order Hessian
estimator contains a constant-level estimation error so that the MAML algorithm
can perform unstably. To address this issue, we propose a novel Hessian
estimator via a gradient-based Gaussian smoothing method, and show that it
achieves a much smaller estimation bias and variance, and the resulting
algorithm achieves the same performance guarantee as the original MAML under
mild conditions. Our experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed Hessian estimator.

  We study local SGD (also known as parallel SGD and federated averaging), a
natural and frequently used stochastic distributed optimization method. Its
theoretical foundations are currently lacking and we highlight how all existing
error guarantees in the convex setting are dominated by a simple baseline,
minibatch SGD. (1) For quadratic objectives we prove that local SGD strictly
dominates minibatch SGD and that accelerated local SGD is minimax optimal for
quadratics; (2) For general convex objectives we provide the first guarantee
that at least sometimes improves over minibatch SGD; (3) We show that indeed
local SGD does not dominate minibatch SGD by presenting a lower bound on the
performance of local SGD that is worse than the minibatch SGD guarantee.

  We propose a neural network-based approach that computes a stable and
generalizing metric (LSiM), to compare field data from a variety of numerical
simulation sources. Our method employs a Siamese network architecture that is
motivated by the mathematical properties of a metric. We leverage a
controllable data generation setup with partial differential equation (PDE)
solvers to create increasingly different outputs from a reference simulation in
a controlled environment. A central component of our learned metric is a
specialized loss function that introduces knowledge about the correlation
between single data samples into the training process. To demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms existing simple metrics for vector spaces and
other learned, image-based metrics, we evaluate the different methods on a
large range of test data. Additionally, we analyze benefits for generalization
and the impact of an adjustable training data difficulty. The robustness of
LSiM is demonstrated via an evaluation on three real-world data sets.

Title: Global Convergence of Deep Networks with One Wide Layer Followed by
  Pyramidal Topology
Authors: Quynh Nguyen and Marco Mondelli
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A recent line of research has provided convergence guarantees for gradient
descent algorithms in the excessive over-parameterization regime where the
widths of all the hidden layers are required to be polynomially large in the
number of training samples. However, the widths of practical deep networks are
often only large in the first layer(s) and then start to decrease towards the
output layer. This raises an interesting open question whether similar results
also hold under this empirically relevant setting. Existing theoretical
insights suggest that the loss surface of this class of networks is
well-behaved, but these results usually do not provide direct algorithmic
guarantees for optimization. In this paper, we close the gap by showing that
one wide layer followed by pyramidal deep network topology suffices for
gradient descent to find a global minimum with a geometric rate. Our proof is
based on a weak form of Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality which holds for deep
pyramidal networks in the manifold of full-rank weight matrices.

Title: Towards Query-Efficient Black-Box Adversary with Zeroth-Order Natural
  Gradient Descent
Authors: Pu Zhao, Pin-Yu Chen, Siyue Wang, Xue Lin
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: accepted by AAAI 2020
\\
  Despite the great achievements of the modern deep neural networks (DNNs), the
vulnerability/robustness of state-of-the-art DNNs raises security concerns in
many application domains requiring high reliability. Various adversarial
attacks are proposed to sabotage the learning performance of DNN models. Among
those, the black-box adversarial attack methods have received special
attentions owing to their practicality and simplicity. Black-box attacks
usually prefer less queries in order to maintain stealthy and low costs.
However, most of the current black-box attack methods adopt the first-order
gradient descent method, which may come with certain deficiencies such as
relatively slow convergence and high sensitivity to hyper-parameter settings.
In this paper, we propose a zeroth-order natural gradient descent (ZO-NGD)
method to design the adversarial attacks, which incorporates the zeroth-order
gradient estimation technique catering to the black-box attack scenario and the
second-order natural gradient descent to achieve higher query efficiency. The
empirical evaluations on image classification datasets demonstrate that ZO-NGD
can obtain significantly lower model query complexities compared with
state-of-the-art attack methods.

Title: Deep Transform and Metric Learning Network: Wedding Deep Dictionary
  Learning and Neural Networks

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  On account of its many successes in inference tasks and denoising
applications, Dictionary Learning (DL) and its related sparse optimization
problems have garnered a lot of research interest. While most solutions have
focused on single layer dictionaries, the improved recently proposed Deep DL
(DDL) methods have also fallen short on a number of issues. We propose herein,
a novel DDL approach where each DL layer can be formulated as a combination of
one linear layer and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The RNN is shown to
flexibly account for the layer-associated and learned metric. Our proposed work
unveils new insights into Neural Networks and DDL and provides a new, efficient
and competitive approach to jointly learn a deep transform and a metric for
inference applications. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate
that the proposed method can not only outperform existing DDL but also
state-of-the-art generic CNNs.

Title: CAUSE: Learning Granger Causality from Event Sequences using Attribution
  Methods
Authors: Wei Zhang, Thomas Kobber Panum, Somesh Jha, Prasad Chalasani, and
  David Page
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We study the problem of learning Granger causality between event types from
asynchronous, interdependent, multi-type event sequences. Existing work suffers
from either limited model flexibility or poor model explainability and thus
fails to uncover Granger causality across a wide variety of event sequences
with diverse event interdependency. To address these weaknesses, we propose
CAUSE (Causality from AttribUtions on Sequence of Events), a novel framework
for the studied task. The key idea of CAUSE is to first implicitly capture the
underlying event interdependency by fitting a neural point process, and then
extract from the process a Granger causality statistic using an axiomatic
attribution method. Across multiple datasets riddled with diverse event
interdependency, we demonstrate that CAUSE achieves superior performance on
correctly inferring the inter-type Granger causality over a range of
state-of-the-art methods.

  Randomization
Authors: Sharath Chandra Raparthy, Bhairav Mehta, Florian Golemo, Liam Paull
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO stat.ML
\\
  Goal-directed Reinforcement Learning (RL) traditionally considers an agent
interacting with an environment, prescribing a real-valued reward to an agent
proportional to the completion of some goal. Goal-directed RL has seen large
gains in sample efficiency, due to the ease of reusing or generating new
experience by proposing goals. In this work, we build on the framework of
self-play, allowing an agent to interact with itself in order to make progress
on some unknown task. We use Active Domain Randomization and self-play to
create a novel, coupled environment-goal curriculum, where agents learn through
progressively more difficult tasks and environment variations. Our method,
Self-Supervised Active Domain Randomization (SS-ADR), generates a growing
curriculum, encouraging the agent to try tasks that are just outside of its
current capabilities, while building a domain-randomization curriculum that
enables state-of-the-art results on various sim2real transfer tasks. Our
results show that a curriculum of co-evolving the environment difficulty along
with the difficulty of goals set in each environment provides practical
benefits in the goal-directed tasks tested.

\\
  Recent study of adversarial attacks has revealed the vulnerability of modern
deep learning models. That is, subtly crafted perturbations of the input can
make a trained network with high accuracy produce arbitrary incorrect
predictions, while maintain imperceptible to human vision system. In this
paper, we introduce Block Switching (BS), a defense strategy against
adversarial attacks based on stochasticity. BS replaces a block of model layers
with multiple parallel channels, and the active channel is randomly assigned in
the run time hence unpredictable to the adversary. We show empirically that BS
leads to a more dispersed input gradient distribution and superior defense
effectiveness compared with other stochastic defenses such as stochastic
activation pruning (SAP). Compared to other defenses, BS is also characterized
by the following features: (i) BS causes less test accuracy drop; (ii) BS is
attack-independent and (iii) BS is compatible with other defenses and can be
used jointly with others.

  In the presence of noisy or incorrect labels, neural networks have the

sometimes help, but do not prevent this behavior. If one considers neural
network weights as random variables that depend on the data and stochasticity
of training, the amount of memorized information can be quantified with the
Shannon mutual information between weights and the vector of all training
labels given inputs, $I(w : \mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x})$. We show that for any
training algorithm, low values of this term correspond to reduction in
memorization of label-noise and better generalization bounds. To obtain these
low values, we propose training algorithms that employ an auxiliary network
that predicts gradients in the final layers of a classifier without accessing
labels. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on versions of MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 corrupted with various noise models, and on a
large-scale dataset Clothing1M that has noisy labels.

Title: Source Separation with Deep Generative Priors
Authors: Vivek Jayaram, John Thickstun
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 18 pages, 15 figures
\\
  Despite substantial progress in signal source separation, results for richly
structured data continue to contain perceptible artifacts. In contrast, recent
deep generative models can produce authentic samples in a variety of domains
that are indistinguishable from samples of the data distribution. This paper
introduces a Bayesian approach to source separation that uses generative models
as priors over the components of a mixture of sources, and Langevin dynamics to
sample from the posterior distribution of sources given a mixture. This
decouples the source separation problem from generative modeling, enabling us
to directly use cutting-edge generative models as priors. The method achieves
state-of-the-art performance for MNIST digit separation. We introduce new
methodology for evaluating separation quality on richer datasets, providing
quantitative evaluation of separation results on CIFAR-10. We also provide
qualitative results on LSUN.

Title: Personalized Federated Learning: A Meta-Learning Approach
Authors: Alireza Fallah, Aryan Mokhtari, Asuman Ozdaglar
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  The goal of federated learning is to design algorithms in which several
agents communicate with a central node, in a privacy-protecting manner, to
minimize the average of their loss functions. In this approach, each node not
only shares the required computational budget but also has access to a larger
data set, which improves the quality of the resulting model. However, this
method only develops a common output for all the agents, and therefore, does
not adapt the model to each user data. This is an important missing feature
especially given the heterogeneity of the underlying data distribution for
various agents. In this paper, we study a personalized variant of the federated
learning in which our goal is to find a shared initial model in a distributed
manner that can be slightly updated by either a current or a new user by
performing one or a few steps of gradient descent with respect to its own loss
function. This approach keeps all the benefits of the federated learning
architecture while leading to a more personalized model for each user. We show
this problem can be studied within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)
framework. Inspired by this connection, we propose a personalized variant of
the well-known Federated Averaging algorithm and evaluate its performance in
terms of gradient norm for non-convex loss functions. Further, we characterize
how this performance is affected by the closeness of underlying distributions
of user data, measured in terms of distribution distances such as Total
Variation and 1-Wasserstein metric.

Comments: 11 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Gradient-based meta-learners such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) have
shown strong few-shot performance in supervised and reinforcement learning
settings. However, specifically in the case of meta-reinforcement learning
(meta-RL), we can show that gradient-based meta-learners are sensitive to task
distributions. With the wrong curriculum, agents suffer the effects of
meta-overfitting, shallow adaptation, and adaptation instability. In this work,
we begin by highlighting intriguing failure cases of gradient-based meta-RL and
show that task distributions can wildly affect algorithmic outputs, stability,
and performance. To address this problem, we leverage insights from recent
literature on domain randomization and propose meta Active Domain Randomization
(meta-ADR), which learns a curriculum of tasks for gradient-based meta-RL in a
similar as ADR does for sim2real transfer. We show that this approach induces
more stable policies on a variety of simulated locomotion and navigation tasks.
We assess in- and out-of-distribution generalization and find that the learned
task distributions, even in an unstructured task space, greatly improve the
adaptation performance of MAML. Finally, we motivate the need for better
benchmarking in meta-RL that prioritizes \textit{generalization} over
single-task adaption performance.

Title: Inductive Representation Learning on Temporal Graphs
Authors: Da Xu, Chuanwei Ruan, Evren Korpeoglu, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs is an important step
toward salable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks. The evolving
nature of temporal dynamic graphs requires handling new nodes as well as
capturing temporal patterns. The node embeddings, which are now functions of
time, should represent both the static node features and the evolving
topological structures. Moreover, node and topological features can be temporal
as well, whose patterns the node embeddings should also capture. We propose the
temporal graph attention (TGAT) layer to efficiently aggregate
temporal-topological neighborhood features as well as to learn the time-feature
interactions. For TGAT, we use the self-attention mechanism as building block
and develop a novel functional time encoding technique based on the classical
Bochner's theorem from harmonic analysis. By stacking TGAT layers, the network
recognizes the node embeddings as functions of time and is able to inductively
infer embeddings for both new and observed nodes as the graph evolves. The
proposed approach handles both node classification and link prediction task,
and can be naturally extended to include the temporal edge features. We
evaluate our method with transductive and inductive tasks under temporal
settings with two benchmark and one industrial dataset. Our TGAT model compares
favorably to state-of-the-art baselines as well as the previous temporal graph
embedding approaches.

Title: Being Bayesian about Categorical Probability
Authors: Taejong Joo, Uijung Chung, Min-Gwan Seo
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Neural networks utilize the softmax as a building block in classification
tasks, which contains an overconfidence problem and lacks an uncertainty
representation ability. As a Bayesian alternative to the softmax, we consider a
random variable of a categorical probability over class labels. In this
framework, the prior distribution explicitly models the presumed noise inherent
in the observed label, which provides consistent gains in generalization
performance in multiple challenging tasks. The proposed method inherits
advantages of Bayesian approaches that achieve better uncertainty estimation
and model calibration. Our method can be implemented as a plug-and-play loss
function with negligible computational overhead compared to the softmax with
the cross-entropy loss function.

Title: Best-item Learning in Random Utility Models with Subset Choices
Authors: Aadirupa Saha and Aditya Gopalan
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Accepted to 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence
  and Statistics (AISTATS), 2020
\\
  We consider the problem of PAC learning the most valuable item from a pool of
$n$ items using sequential, adaptively chosen plays of subsets of $k$ items,
when, upon playing a subset, the learner receives relative feedback sampled
according to a general Random Utility Model (RUM) with independent noise
perturbations to the latent item utilities. We identify a new property of such
a RUM, termed the minimum advantage, that helps in characterizing the
complexity of separating pairs of items based on their relative win/loss
empirical counts, and can be bounded as a function of the noise distribution
alone. We give a learning algorithm for general RUMs, based on pairwise
relative counts of items and hierarchical elimination, along with a new PAC
sample complexity guarantee of $O(\frac{n}{c^2\epsilon^2} \log
\frac{k}{\delta})$ rounds to identify an $\epsilon$-optimal item with
confidence $1-\delta$, when the worst case pairwise advantage in the RUM has
sensitivity at least $c$ to the parameter gaps of items. Fundamental lower
bounds on PAC sample complexity show that this is near-optimal in terms of its
dependence on $n,k$ and $c$.

Title: Action-Manipulation Attacks Against Stochastic Bandits: Attacks and
  Defense
Authors: Guanlin Liu and Lifeng lai
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR math.OC stat.ML
Comments: 13 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transaction on Signal
  Processing
\\
  Due to the broad range of applications of stochastic multi-armed bandit
model, understanding the effects of adversarial attacks and designing bandit
algorithms robust to attacks are essential for the safe applications of this
model. In this paper, we introduce a new class of attack named
action-manipulation attack. In this attack, an adversary can change the action
signal selected by the user. We show that without knowledge of mean rewards of
arms, our proposed attack can manipulate Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
algorithm, a widely used bandit algorithm, into pulling a target arm very
frequently by spending only logarithmic cost. To defend against this class of
attacks, we introduce a novel algorithm that is robust to action-manipulation
attacks when an upper bound for the total attack cost is given. We prove that
our algorithm has a pseudo-regret upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\max\{\log
T,A\})$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds and $A$ is the upper bound of
the total attack cost.

Title: Indirect Adversarial Attacks via Poisoning Neighbors for Graph
  Convolutional Networks
Authors: Tsubasa Takahashi
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
Comments: Accepted in IEEE BigData 2019
\\
  Graph convolutional neural networks, which learn aggregations over neighbor
nodes, have achieved great performance in node classification tasks. However,
recent studies reported that such graph convolutional node classifier can be
deceived by adversarial perturbations on graphs. Abusing graph convolutions, a
node's classification result can be influenced by poisoning its neighbors.
Given an attributed graph and a node classifier, how can we evaluate robustness
against such indirect adversarial attacks? Can we generate strong adversarial
perturbations which are effective on not only one-hop neighbors, but more far
from the target? In this paper, we demonstrate that the node classifier can be
deceived with high-confidence by poisoning just a single node even two-hops or
more far from the target. Towards achieving the attack, we propose a new
approach which searches smaller perturbations on just a single node far from
the target. In our experiments, our proposed method shows 99% attack success
rate within two-hops from the target in two datasets. We also demonstrate that
m-layer graph convolutional neural networks have chance to be deceived by our
indirect attack within m-hop neighbors. The proposed attack can be used as a
benchmark in future defense attempts to develop graph convolutional neural
networks with having adversary robustness.

  With the inflation of the data, clustering analysis, as a branch of
unsupervised learning, lacks unified understanding and application of its

model-based clustering and proposes a unified clustering framework. In order to
find fixed points as cluster centers, the framework iteratively constructs the
contraction map, which strongly reveals the convergence mechanism and
interconnections among algorithms. By specifying a contraction map, Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) can be mapped to the framework as an application. We hope
the fixed point framework will help the design of future clustering algorithms.

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by AAMAS'2020 as an EXTENDED ABSTRACT
\\
  Transfer Learning (TL) has shown great potential to accelerate Reinforcement
Learning (RL) by leveraging prior knowledge from past learned policies of
relevant tasks. Existing transfer approaches either explicitly computes the
similarity between tasks or select appropriate source policies to provide
guided explorations for the target task. However, how to directly optimize the
target policy by alternatively utilizing knowledge from appropriate source
policies without explicitly measuring the similarity is currently missing. In
this paper, we propose a novel Policy Transfer Framework (PTF) to accelerate RL
by taking advantage of this idea. Our framework learns when and which source
policy is the best to reuse for the target policy and when to terminate it by
modeling multi-policy transfer as the option learning problem. PTF can be
easily combined with existing deep RL approaches. Experimental results show it
significantly accelerates the learning process and surpasses state-of-the-art
policy transfer methods in terms of learning efficiency and final performance
in both discrete and continuous action spaces.

Title: Enlarging Discriminative Power by Adding an Extra Class in Unsupervised
  Domain Adaptation
Authors: Hai H. Tran, Sumyeong Ahn, Taeyoung Lee, Yung Yi
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation that
aims at obtaining a prediction model for the target domain using labeled data
from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. There exists
an array of recent research based on the idea of extracting features that are
not only invariant for both domains but also provide high discriminative power
for the target domain. In this paper, we propose an idea of empowering the
discriminativeness: Adding a new, artificial class and training the model on
the data together with the GAN-generated samples of the new class. The trained
model based on the new class samples is capable of extracting the features that
are more discriminative by repositioning data of current classes in the target
domain and therefore drawing the decision boundaries more effectively. Our idea
is highly generic so that it is compatible with many existing methods such as
DANN, VADA, and DIRT-T. We conduct various experiments for the standard data
commonly used for the evaluation of unsupervised domain adaptations and
demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the SOTA performance for many
scenarios.

Title: Progressive Identification of True Labels for Partial-Label Learning
Authors: Jiaqi Lv, Miao Xu, Lei Feng, Gang Niu, Xin Geng, Masashi Sugiyama
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Partial-label learning is one of the important weakly supervised learning
problems, where each training example is equipped with a set of candidate
labels that contains the true label. Most existing methods elaborately designed
learning objectives as constrained optimizations that must be solved in
specific manners, making their computational complexity a bottleneck for
scaling up to big data. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel framework
of partial-label learning without implicit assumptions on the model or
optimization algorithm. More specifically, we propose a general estimator of
the classification risk, theoretically analyze the classifier-consistency, and
establish an estimation error bound. We then explore a progressive
identification method for approximately minimizing the proposed risk estimator,
where the update of the model and identification of true labels are conducted
in a seamless manner. The resulting algorithm is model-independent and
loss-independent, and compatible with stochastic optimization. Thorough
experiments demonstrate it sets the new state of the art.

Title: The Geometry of Sign Gradient Descent
Authors: Lukas Balles and Fabian Pedregosa and Nicolas Le Roux
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Sign-based optimization methods have become popular in machine learning due
to their favorable communication cost in distributed optimization and their
surprisingly good performance in neural network training. Furthermore, they are
closely connected to so-called adaptive gradient methods like Adam. Recent
works on signSGD have used a non-standard "separable smoothness" assumption,
whereas some older works study sign gradient descent as steepest descent with
respect to the $\ell_\infty$-norm. In this work, we unify these existing
results by showing a close connection between separable smoothness and
$\ell_\infty$-smoothness and argue that the latter is the weaker and more
natural assumption. We then proceed to study the smoothness constant with
respect to the $\ell_\infty$-norm and thereby isolate geometric properties of
the objective function which affect the performance of sign-based methods. In
short, we find sign-based methods to be preferable over gradient descent if (i)
the Hessian is to some degree concentrated on its diagonal, and (ii) its
maximal eigenvalue is much larger than the average eigenvalue. Both properties
are common in deep networks.

state transition matrix $A$ is unknown, and when only the state-action
transition matrix $B$ is unknown and the optimal policy satisfies a certain
non-degeneracy condition. On the other hand, we give a lower bound that shows
that when the latter condition is violated, square root regret is unavoidable.

directed acyclic graphs (DAG) and studied a class of graphs derived from
functional resting state fMRI networks. A majority of the best performing
networks were indeed in these new families. We also proposed a general
procedure for turning a graph into a DAG necessary for a feed-forward neural
network. We investigated various structural and numerical properties of the
graphs in relation to neural network test accuracy. Since none of the classical
numerical graph invariants by itself seems to allow to single out the best
networks, we introduced new numerical characteristics that selected a set of
quasi-1-dimensional graphs, which were the majority among the best performing

\\
  Despite progress in training neural networks for lossy image compression,
current approaches fail to maintain both perceptual quality and high-level
features at very low bitrates. Encouraged by recent success in learning
discrete representations with Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders
(VQ-VAEs), we motivate the use of a hierarchy of VQ-VAEs to attain high factors
of compression. We show that the combination of quantization and hierarchical
latent structure aids likelihood-based image compression. This leads us to
introduce a more probabilistic framing of the VQ-VAE, of which previous work is
a limiting case. Our hierarchy produces a Markovian series of latent variables
that reconstruct high-quality images which retain semantically meaningful
features. These latents can then be further used to generate realistic samples.
We provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations of reconstructions and
samples on the CelebA and MNIST datasets.

  Randomized smoothing is a recently proposed defense against adversarial
attacks that has achieved state-of-the-art provable robustness against $\ell_2$
perturbations. Soon after, a number of works devised new randomized smoothing
schemes for other metrics, such as $\ell_1$ or $\ell_\infty$; however, for each
geometry, substantial effort was needed to derive new robustness guarantees.
This begs the question: can we find a general theory for randomized smoothing?
  In this work we propose a novel framework for devising and analyzing
randomized smoothing schemes, and validate its effectiveness in practice. Our
theoretical contributions are as follows: (1) We show that for an appropriate
notion of "optimal", the optimal smoothing distributions for any "nice" norm
have level sets given by the *Wulff Crystal* of that norm. (2) We propose two
novel and complementary methods for deriving provably robust radii for any
smoothing distribution. Finally, (3) we show fundamental limits to current
randomized smoothing techniques via the theory of *Banach space cotypes*. By
combining (1) and (2), we significantly improve the state-of-the-art certified
accuracy in $\ell_1$ on standard datasets. On the other hand, using (3), we
show that, without more information than label statistics under random input
perturbations, randomized smoothing cannot achieve nontrivial certified
accuracy against perturbations of $\ell_\infty$-norm $\Omega(1/\sqrt d)$, when
the input dimension $d$ is large. We provide code in github.com/tonyduan/rs4a.

Title: Gradient-Adjusted Neuron Activation Profiles for Comprehensive
  Introspection of Convolutional Speech Recognition Models
Authors: Andreas Krug, Sebastian Stober
Categories: cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS stat.ML
\\
  Deep Learning based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are very
successful, but hard to interpret. To gain better understanding of how
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) accomplish their tasks, introspection methods
have been proposed. Adapting such techniques from computer vision to speech
recognition is not straight-forward, because speech data is more complex and
less interpretable than image data. In this work, we introduce
Gradient-adjusted Neuron Activation Profiles (GradNAPs) as means to interpret
features and representations in Deep Neural Networks. GradNAPs are
characteristic responses of ANNs to particular groups of inputs, which
incorporate the relevance of neurons for prediction. We show how to utilize
GradNAPs to gain insight about how data is processed in ANNs. This includes
different ways of visualizing features and clustering of GradNAPs to compare
embeddings of different groups of inputs in any layer of a given network. We
demonstrate our proposed techniques using a fully-convolutional ASR model.

Title: Using Hindsight to Anchor Past Knowledge in Continual Learning
Authors: Arslan Chaudhry, Albert Gordo, Puneet K. Dokania, Philip Torr, David
  Lopez-Paz
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In continual learning, the learner faces a stream of data whose distribution
changes over time. Modern neural networks are known to suffer under this
setting, as they quickly forget previously acquired knowledge. To address such
catastrophic forgetting, many continual learning methods implement different
types of experience replay, re-learning on past data stored in a small buffer
known as episodic memory. In this work, we complement experience replay with a
new objective that we call anchoring, where the learner uses bilevel
optimization to update its knowledge on the current task, while keeping intact
the predictions on some anchor points of past tasks. These anchor points are
learned using gradient-based optimization to maximize forgetting, which is
approximated by fine-tuning the currently trained model on the episodic memory
of past tasks. Experiments on several supervised learning benchmarks for
continual learning demonstrate that our approach improves the standard
experience replay in terms of both accuracy and forgetting metrics and for
various sizes of episodic memories.

Title: Federated Learning in the Sky: Joint Power Allocation and Scheduling

\\
  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms must exploit machine learning (ML) in
order to execute various tasks ranging from coordinated trajectory planning to
cooperative target recognition. However, due to the lack of continuous
connections between the UAV swarm and ground base stations (BSs), using
centralized ML will be challenging, particularly when dealing with a large
volume of data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to implement
distributed federated learning (FL) algorithms within a UAV swarm that consists
of a leading UAV and several following UAVs. Each following UAV trains a local
FL model based on its collected data and then sends this trained local model to
the leading UAV who will aggregate the received models, generate a global FL
model, and transmit it to followers over the intra-swarm network. To identify
how wireless factors, like fading, transmission delay, and UAV antenna angle
deviations resulting from wind and mechanical vibrations, impact the
performance of FL, a rigorous convergence analysis for FL is performed. Then, a
joint power allocation and scheduling design is proposed to optimize the
convergence rate of FL while taking into account the energy consumption during
convergence and the delay requirement imposed by the swarm's control system.
Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the FL convergence analysis
and show that the joint design strategy can reduce the number of communication
rounds needed for convergence by as much as 35% compared with the baseline
design.

Title: SYMOG: learning symmetric mixture of Gaussian modes for improved
  fixed-point quantization
Authors: Lukas Enderich and Fabian Timm and Wolfram Burgard
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV
Comments: Preprint submitted to Neurocomputing
\\
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proven to outperform classical methods
on several machine learning benchmarks. However, they have high computational
complexity and require powerful processing units. Especially when deployed on
embedded systems, model size and inference time must be significantly reduced.
We propose SYMOG (symmetric mixture of Gaussian modes), which significantly
decreases the complexity of DNNs through low-bit fixed-point quantization.
SYMOG is a novel soft quantization method such that the learning task and the
quantization are solved simultaneously. During training the weight distribution
changes from an unimodal Gaussian distribution to a symmetric mixture of
Gaussians, where each mean value belongs to a particular fixed-point mode. We
evaluate our approach with different architectures (LeNet5, VGG7, VGG11,
DenseNet) on common benchmark data sets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and we
compare with state-of-the-art quantization approaches. We achieve excellent
results and outperform 2-bit state-of-the-art performance with an error rate of
only 5.71% on CIFAR-10 and 27.65% on CIFAR-100.

Title: Optimistic Policy Optimization with Bandit Feedback
Authors: Yonathan Efroni, Lior Shani, Aviv Rosenberg and Shie Mannor
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 34 pages
\\
  Policy optimization methods are one of the most widely used classes of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Yet, so far, such methods have been
mostly analyzed from an optimization perspective, without addressing the
problem of exploration, or by making strong assumptions on the interaction with
the environment. In this paper we consider model-based RL in the tabular
finite-horizon MDP setting with unknown transitions and bandit feedback. For
this setting, we propose an optimistic trust region policy optimization (TRPO)
algorithm for which we establish $\tilde O(\sqrt{S^2 A H^4 K})$ regret for
stochastic rewards. Furthermore, we prove $\tilde O( \sqrt{ S^2 A H^4 } K^{2/3}
) $ regret for adversarial rewards. Interestingly, this result matches previous
bounds derived for the bandit feedback case, yet with known transitions. To the
best of our knowledge, the two results are the first sub-linear regret bounds
obtained for policy optimization algorithms with unknown transitions and bandit
feedback.

Title: Learning Global Transparent Models from Local Contrastive Explanations
Authors: Tejaswini Pedapati, Avinash Balakrishnan, Karthikeyan Shanmugam and
  Amit Dhurandhar
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  There is a rich and growing literature on producing local point wise
contrastive/counterfactual explanations for complex models. These methods
highlight what is important to justify the classification and/or produce a
contrast point that alters the final classification. Other works try to build
globally interpretable models like decision trees and rule lists directly by
efficient model search using the data or by transferring information from a
complex model using distillation-like methods. Although these interpretable
global models can be useful, they may not be consistent with local explanations
from a specific complex model of choice. In this work, we explore the question:
Can we produce a transparent global model that is consistent with/derivable
from local explanations? Based on a key insight we provide a novel method where
every local contrastive/counterfactual explanation can be turned into a Boolean
feature. These Boolean features are sparse conjunctions of binarized features.
The dataset thus constructed is consistent with local explanations by design
and one can train an interpretable model like a decision tree on it. We note
that this approach strictly loses information due to reliance only on sparse
local explanations, nonetheless, we demonstrate empirically that in many cases
it can still be competitive with respect to the complex model's performance and
also other methods that learn directly from the original dataset. Our approach
also provides an avenue to benchmark local explanation methods in a
quantitative manner.

Title: Knapsack Pruning with Inner Distillation
Authors: Yonathan Aflalo and Asaf Noy and Ming Lin and Itamar Friedman and Lihi
  Zelnik
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Neural network pruning reduces the computational cost of an
over-parameterized network to improve its efficiency. Popular methods vary from
$\ell_1$-norm sparsification to Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this work,
we propose a novel pruning method that optimizes the final accuracy of the
pruned network and distills knowledge from the over-parameterized parent
network's inner layers. To enable this approach, we formulate the network
pruning as a Knapsack Problem which optimizes the trade-off between the
importance of neurons and their associated computational cost. Then we prune
the network channels while maintaining the high-level structure of the network.
The pruned network is fine-tuned under the supervision of the parent network
using its inner network knowledge, a technique we refer to as the Inner
Knowledge Distillation. Our method leads to state-of-the-art pruning results on
ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using ResNet backbones. To prune complex
network structures such as convolutions with skip-links and depth-wise
convolutions, we propose a block grouping approach to cope with these
structures. Through this we produce compact architectures with the same FLOPs
as EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNetV3 but with higher accuracy, by $1\%$ and
$0.3\%$ respectively on ImageNet, and faster runtime on GPU.

  Designing a single neural network architecture that performs competitively
across a range of molecule property prediction tasks remains largely an open
challenge, and its solution may unlock a widespread use of deep learning in the
drug discovery industry. To move towards this goal, we propose Molecule
Attention Transformer (MAT). Our key innovation is to augment the attention
mechanism in Transformer using inter-atomic distances and the molecular graph
structure. Experiments show that MAT performs competitively on a diverse set of
molecular prediction tasks. Most importantly, with a simple self-supervised
pretraining, MAT requires tuning of only a few hyperparameter values to achieve
state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks. Finally, we show that
attention weights learned by MAT are interpretable from the chemical point of
view.

Title: Outcome Correlation in Graph Neural Network Regression
Authors: Junteng Jia and Austin Benson
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Graph neural networks aggregate features in vertex neighborhoods to learn
vector representations of all vertices, using supervision from some labeled
vertices during training. The predictor is then a function of the vector
representation, and predictions are made independently on unlabeled nodes. This
widely-adopted approach implicitly assumes that vertex labels are independent
after conditioning on their neighborhoods. We show that this strong assumption
is far from true on many real-world graph datasets and severely limits
predictive power on a number of regression tasks. Given that traditional
graph-based semi-supervised learning methods operate in the opposite manner by
explicitly modeling the correlation in predicted outcomes, this limitation may
not be all that surprising.
  Here, we address this issue with a simple and interpretable framework that
can improve any graph neural network architecture by modeling correlation
structure in regression outcome residuals. Specifically, we model the joint
distribution of outcome residuals on vertices with a parameterized multivariate
Gaussian, where the parameters are estimated by maximizing the marginal
likelihood of the observed labels. Our model achieves substantially boosts the
performance of graph neural networks, and the learned parameters can also be
interpreted as the strength of correlation among connected vertices. To allow
us to scale to large networks, we design linear time algorithms for
low-variance, unbiased model parameter estimates based on stochastic trace
estimation. We also provide a simplified version of our method that makes
stronger assumptions on correlation structure but is extremely easy to
implement and provides great practical performance in several cases.

  Machine learning models provide statistically impressive results which might
be individually unreliable. To provide reliability, we propose an Epistemic
Classifier (EC) that can provide justification of its belief using support from
the training dataset as well as quality of reconstruction. Our approach is
based on modified variational auto-encoders that can identify a semantically
meaningful low-dimensional space where perceptually similar instances are close
in $\ell_2$-distance too. Our results demonstrate improved reliability of
predictions and robust identification of samples with adversarial attacks as
compared to baseline of softmax-based thresholding.

\\
  Value estimation is a critical component of the reinforcement learning (RL)
paradigm. The question of how to effectively learn predictors for value from
data is one of the major problems studied by the RL community, and different
approaches exploit structure in the problem domain in different ways. Model
learning can make use of the rich transition structure present in sequences of
observations, but this approach is usually not sensitive to the reward
function. In contrast, model-free methods directly leverage the quantity of
interest from the future but have to compose with a potentially weak scalar
signal (an estimate of the return). In this paper we develop an approach for
representation learning in RL that sits in between these two extremes: we
propose to learn what to model in a way that can directly help value
prediction. To this end we determine which features of the future trajectory
provide useful information to predict the associated return. This provides us
with tractable prediction targets that are directly relevant for a task, and
can thus accelerate learning of the value function. The idea can be understood
as reasoning, in hindsight, about which aspects of the future observations
could help past value prediction. We show how this can help dramatically even
in simple policy evaluation settings. We then test our approach at scale in
challenging domains, including on 57 Atari 2600 games.

  Although data may be abundant, complete data is less so, due to missing
columns or rows. This missingness undermines the performance of downstream data
products that either omit incomplete cases or create derived completed data for
subsequent processing. Appropriately managing missing data is required in order
to fully exploit and correctly use data. We propose a Multiple Imputation model
using Denoising Autoencoders to learn the internal representation of data.
Furthermore, we use the novel mechanisms of Metamorphic Truth and Imputation
Feedback to maintain statistical integrity of attributes and eliminate bias in
the learning process. Our approach explores the effects of imputation on
various missingness mechanisms and patterns of missing data, outperforming
other methods in many standard test cases.

Title: NeuroFabric: Identifying Ideal Topologies for Training A Priori Sparse
  Networks
Authors: Mihailo Isakov and Michel A. Kinsy
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Report-no: Report-v05
\\
  Long training times of deep neural networks are a bottleneck in machine
learning research. The major impediment to fast training is the quadratic
growth of both memory and compute requirements of dense and convolutional
layers with respect to their information bandwidth. Recently, training `a
priori' sparse networks has been proposed as a method for allowing layers to
retain high information bandwidth, while keeping memory and compute low.
However, the choice of which sparse topology should be used in these networks
is unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation for the choice of
intra-layer topology. First, we derive a new sparse neural network
initialization scheme that allows us to explore the space of very deep sparse
networks. Next, we evaluate several topologies and show that seemingly similar
topologies can often have a large difference in attainable accuracy. To explain
these differences, we develop a data-free heuristic that can evaluate a
topology independently from the dataset the network will be trained on. We then
derive a set of requirements that make a good topology, and arrive at a single
topology that satisfies all of them.

Title: Schoenberg-Rao distances: Entropy-based and geometry-aware statistical
  Hilbert distances
Authors: Ga\"etan Hadjeres and Frank Nielsen
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 18 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Distances between probability distributions that take into account the
geometry of their sample space,like the Wasserstein or the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) distances have received a lot of attention in machine
learning as they can, for instance, be used to compare probability
distributions with disjoint supports. In this paper, we study a class of
statistical Hilbert distances that we term the Schoenberg-Rao distances, a
generalization of the MMD that allows one to consider a broader class of
kernels, namely the conditionally negative semi-definite kernels. In
particular, we introduce a principled way to construct such kernels and derive
novel closed-form distances between mixtures of Gaussian distributions, among
others. These distances, derived from the concave Rao's quadratic entropy,
enjoy nice theoretical properties and possess interpretable hyperparameters
which can be tuned for specific applications. Our method constitutes a
practical alternative to Wasserstein distances and we illustrate its efficiency
on a broad range of machine learning tasks such as density estimation,
generative modeling and mixture simplification.

Title: On Adaptive Attacks to Adversarial Example Defenses
Authors: Florian Tramer, Nicholas Carlini, Wieland Brendel, Aleksander Madry
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Adaptive attacks have (rightfully) become the de facto standard for
evaluating defenses to adversarial examples. We find, however, that typical
adaptive evaluations are incomplete. We demonstrate that thirteen defenses
recently published at ICLR, ICML and NeurIPS---and chosen for illustrative and
pedagogical purposes---can be circumvented despite attempting to perform
evaluations using adaptive attacks. While prior evaluation papers focused
mainly on the end result---showing that a defense was ineffective---this paper
focuses on laying out the methodology and the approach necessary to perform an
adaptive attack. We hope that these analyses will serve as guidance on how to
properly perform adaptive attacks against defenses to adversarial examples, and
thus will allow the community to make further progress in building more robust
models.

Title: Functional Pearl: The Distributive $\lambda$-Calculus
Authors: Beniamino Accattoli and Alejandro D\'iaz-Caro
Categories: cs.LO
Comments: 17 pages. To appear at FLOPS 2020
\\
  We introduce a simple extension of the $\lambda$-calculus with pairs---called
the distributive $\lambda$-calculus---obtained by adding a computational
interpretation of the valid distributivity isomorphism $A \Rightarrow (B\wedge
C)\ \ \equiv\ \ (A\Rightarrow B) \wedge (A\Rightarrow C)$ of simple types. We
study the calculus both as an untyped and as a simply typed setting. Key
features of the untyped calculus are confluence, the absence of clashes of
constructs, that is, evaluation never gets stuck, and a leftmost-outermost
normalization theorem, obtained with straightforward proofs. With respect to
simple types, we show that the new rules satisfy subject reduction if types are
considered up to the distributivity isomorphism. The main result is strong
normalization for simple types up to distributivity. The proof is a smooth
variation over the one for the $\lambda$-calculus with pairs and simple types.

Title: Constructing Higher Inductive Types as Groupoid Quotients
Authors: Niels van der Weide
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  In this paper, we show that all finitary 1-truncated higher inductive types
(HITs) can be constructed from the groupoid quotient. We start by defining
internally a notion of signatures for HITs, and for each signature, we
construct a bicategory of algebras in 1-types and in groupoids. We continue by
proving initial algebra semantics for our signatures. After that, we show that
the groupoid quotient induces a biadjunction between the bicategories of
algebras in 1-types and in groupoids. We finish by constructing a biinitial
object in the bicategory of algebras in groupoids. From all this, we conclude
that all finitary 1-truncated HITs can be constructed from the groupoid
quotient. All the results are formalized over the UniMath library of univalent
mathematics in Coq.

Title: On Computability of Data Word Functions Defined by Transducers

Categories: cs.LO cs.FL
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the problem of synthesizing computable
functions of infinite words over an infinite alphabet (data omega-words). The
notion of computability is defined through Turing machines with infinite inputs
which can produce the corresponding infinite outputs in the limit. We use
non-deterministic transducers equipped with registers, an extension of register
automata with outputs, to specify functions. Such transducers may not define
functions but more generally relations of data omega-words, and we show that it
is PSpace-complete to test whether a given transducer defines a function. Then,
given a function defined by some register transducer, we show that it is
decidable (and again, PSpace-complete) whether such function is computable. As
for the known finite alphabet case, we show that computability and continuity
coincide for functions defined by register transducers, and show how to decide
continuity. We also define a subclass for which those problems are solvable in
polynomial time.

Title: Learning When to Transfer among Agents: An Efficient Multiagent Transfer
  Learning Framework
Authors: Tianpei Yang, Weixun Wang, Hongyao Tang, Jianye Hao, Zhaopeng Meng,

Categories: cs.MA
\\
  Transfer Learning has shown great potential to enhance the single-agent
Reinforcement Learning (RL) efficiency, by sharing previously learned policies.
Inspired by this, the team learning performance in multiagent settings can be
potentially promoted with agents reusing knowledge between each other when all
agents interact with the environment and learn simultaneously. However, how
each independent agent selectively learns from other agents' knowledge is still
a problem. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent transfer learning
framework to improve the learning efficiency of multiagent systems. Our
framework learns when and what advice to give to each agent and when to
terminate it by modeling multi-agent transfer as the option learning problem.
We also propose a novel option learning algorithm, named as the Successor
Representation Option (SRO) learning that decouples the dynamics of the
environment from the rewards to learn the option-value function under each
agent's preference. The proposed framework can be easily combined with existing
deep RL approaches. Experimental results show it significantly accelerates the
learning process and surpasses state-of-the-art deep RL methods in terms of
learning efficiency and final performance in both discrete and continuous
action spaces.

Title: hyper.deal: An efficient, matrix-free finite-element library for
  high-dimensional partial differential equations
Authors: Peter Munch, Katharina Kormann, Martin Kronbichler
Categories: cs.MS cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 33 pages, 18 figures
ACM-class: G.4
\\
  This work presents the efficient, matrix-free finite-element library
hyper.deal for solving partial differential equations in two to six dimensions
with high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods. It builds upon the
low-dimensional finite-element library deal.II to create complex
low-dimensional meshes and to operate on them individually. These meshes are
combined via a tensor product on the fly and the library provides new
special-purpose highly optimized matrix-free functions exploiting domain
decomposition as well as shared memory via MPI-3.0 features. Both node-level
performance analyses and strong/weak-scaling studies on up to 147,456 CPU cores
confirm the efficiency of the implementation. Results of the library hyper.deal
are reported for high-dimensional advection problems and for the solution of
the Vlasov--Poisson equation in up to 6D phase space.

Title: A note on devising HDG+ projections on polyhedral elements
Authors: Shukai Du, and Francisco-Javier Sayas
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  In this note, we propose a simple way of constructing HDG+ projections on
polyhedral elements. The projections enable us to analyze the
Lehrenfeld-Sch\"{o}berl HDG (HDG+) methods in a very concise manner, and make
many existing analysis techniques of standard HDG methods reusable for HDG+.
The novelty here is an alternative way of constructing the projections without
using $M$-decomposition as a middle step. This extends our previous results [S.
Du and F.-J. Sayas, SpringerBriefs in Mathematics (2019)] (elliptic problems)
and [S. Du and F.-J. Sayas, arXiv:1903.11766] (elasticity) to polyhedral
meshes.

Title: Implicit bias with Ritz-Galerkin method in understanding deep learning
  for solving PDEs
Authors: Jihong Wang, Zhi-Qin John Xu, Jiwei Zhang, Yaoyu Zhang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 35Q68, 65N30, 65N35
\\
  This paper aims at studying the difference between Ritz-Galerkin (R-G) method
and deep neural network (DNN) method in solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) to better understand deep learning. To this end, we consider solving a
particular Poisson problem, where the information of the right-hand side of the
equation f is only available at n sample points while the bases (neuron) number
is much larger than n, which is common in DNN-based methods. Through both
theoretical study and numerical study, we show the R-G method solves this
particular problem by a piecewise linear function because R-G method considers
the discrete sampling points as linear combinations of Dirac delta functions.
However, we show that DNNs solve the problem with a much smoother function
based on previous study of F-Principle (Xu et al., (2019) [15] and Zhang et
al., (2019) [17]), that is, DNN methods implicitly impose regularity on the
function that interpolates the discrete sampling points. Our work shows that
with implicit bias of DNNs, the traditional methods, e.g., FEM, could provide
insights into understanding DNNs.

  In this paper, we formulate the reconstruction problem in diffuse optical

Finally, a simulation study of this technique with different regularization

Title: High order numerical simulations for the polymer self-consistent field
  theory using the adaptive virtual element and spectral deferred correction
  methods
Authors: Kai Jiang, Xin Wang and Huayi Wei
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 18 pages, 10 figures
\\
  In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate numerical method, which
combine the high order adaptive virtual element method (VEM) and spectral
deferred correction (SDC) scheme together, to simulate the self-consistent
field theory (SCFT) model on arbitrary domains. The VEM is very flexible in
handling rather general polygonal elements, which is more suitable to discrete
the model defined on complex geometric domain, and the SDC scheme can
efficiently improve the approximation order of contour derivative. Moreover, an
adaptive method equipped with a new marking strategy is developed to
efficiently solve the SCFT for strong segregation systems. Results indicate
that our approaches can efficiently produce high-accuracy numerical results.

Title: Optimal DG allocation and sizing in power system networks using
  swarm-based algorithms
Authors: Kayode Adetunji, Ivan Hofsajer, Ling Cheng
Categories: cs.NE cs.SY eess.SY math.OC
\\
  Distributed generation (DG) units are power generating plants that are very
important to the architecture of present power system networks. The benefit of
the addition of these DG units is to increase the power supply to a network.
However, the installation of these DG units can cause an adverse effect if not
properly allocated and/or sized. Therefore, there is a need to optimally
allocate and size them to avoid cases such as voltage instability and expensive
investment costs. In this paper, two swarm-based meta-heuristic algorithms,
particle swarm optimization (PSO) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) were
developed to solve optimal placement and sizing of DG units in the quest for
transmission network planning. A supportive technique, loss sensitivity factors
(LSF) was used to identify potential buses for optimal location of DG units.
The feasibility of the algorithms was confirmed on two IEEE bus test systems
(14- and 30-bus). Comparison results showed that both algorithms produce good
solutions and they outperform each other in different metrics. The WOA real
power loss reduction considering techno-economic factors in the IEEE 14-bus and
30-bus test system are 6.14 MW and 10.77 MW, compared to the PSOs' 6.47 MW and
11.73 MW respectively. The PSO has a more reduced total DG unit size in both
bus systems with 133.45 MW and 82.44 MW compared to WOAs' 152.21 MW and 82.44
MW respectively. The paper unveils the strengths and weaknesses of the PSO and
the WOA in the application of optimal sizing of DG units in transmission
networks.

Title: QoS Evaluation and Prediction for C-V2X Communication in

Comments: 7 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables. Accepted for publication in the 2020

\\
  Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication is a key enabler for
future cooperative automated driving and safety-related applications. The
requirements they demand in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) performance vary
according to the use case. For instance, Day-1 applications such as Emergency
Brake Light warning have less strict requirements than remote driving. In this
paper, we seek to answer two questions: Are current LTE networks ready to
support Day-1 applications at all times? And, can underperforming situations be
reliably predicted based on GPS and network-related information? To address
these questions, we first implement a system that collects positioning data and
LTE key performance indicators (KPIs) with a higher time resolution than
commercial off-the-shelf LTE modems, while simultaneously measuring the
end-to-end (E2E) delay of an LTE network. We then use this system to assess the
readiness of multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) and a live Mobile Edge
Computing (MEC) deployment in an urban scenario. For evaluating whether an
adaptable operation is possible in adverse circumstances, e.g., by performing
hybrid networking or graceful degradation, we finally use Machine Learning to
generate a client-based QoS predictor and forecast the achievable QoS levels.

Title: Massive Access in Beyond 5G IoT Networks with NOMA: NP-hardness,
  Competitiveness and Learning
Authors: Zoubeir Mlika and Soumaya Cherkaoui
Categories: cs.NI cs.IT math.IT
\\
  This paper studies the problem of online user grouping, scheduling and power
allocation in beyond 5G cellular-based Internet of things networks. Due to the
massive number of devices trying to be granted to the network, non-orthogonal
multiple access method is adopted in order to accommodate multiple devices in
the same radio resource block. Different from most previous works, the
objective is to maximize the number of served devices while allocating their
transmission powers such that their real-time requirements as well as their
limited operating energy are respected. First, we formulate the general problem
as a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) that can be transformed easily to
MILP for some special cases. Second, we study its computational complexity by
characterizing the NP-hardness of different special cases. Then, by dividing
the problem into multiple NOMA grouping and scheduling subproblems, efficient
online competitive algorithms are proposed. Further, we show how to use these
online algorithms and combine their solutions in a reinforcement learning
setting to obtain the power allocation and hence the global solution to the
problem. Our analysis are supplemented by simulation results to illustrate the
performance of the proposed algorithms with comparison to optimal and
state-of-the-art methods.

\\
  LoRaWAN enables massive connectivity for Internet-of-Things applications.
Many published works employ stochastic geometry to derive outage models of
LoRaWAN over fading channels assuming fixed transmit power and distance-based
spreading factor (SF) allocation. However, in practice, LoRaWAN employs the
Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts SF and transmit
power of nodes based on channel state. The community addressed the performance
of ADR using simulations, but analytical models have not been introduced. In
this letter, we seek to close this gap. We build over an analytical LoRaWAN
model to consider the performance of steady-state ADR-enabled LoRaWAN. We
derive outage expressions and an optimization procedure to maximize the number
of users under reliability constraints. Results show that power allocation
reduces interference and improves network capacity while reducing average
power.

Title: Offloading and Resource Allocation with General Task Graph in Mobile
  Edge Computing: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Jia Yan, Suzhi Bi, and Ying-Jun Angela Zhang
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: This paper is under minor revision with IEEE Transactions on Wireless
  Communications
\\
  In this paper, we consider a mobile-edge computing system, where an access
point assists a mobile device (MD) to execute an application consisting of
multiple tasks following a general task call graph. The objective is to jointly
determine the offloading decision of each task and the resource allocation
under time-varying wireless fading channels and stochastic edge computing
capability, so that the energy-time cost (ETC) of the MD is minimized. Solving
the problem is particularly hard due to the combinatorial offloading decisions
and the strong coupling among task executions under the general dependency
model. Conventional numerical optimization methods are inefficient to solve
such a problem, especially when the problem size is large. To address the
issue, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the
actor-critic learning structure. In particular, the actor network utilizes a
DNN to learn the optimal mapping from the input states to the binary offloading
decision of each task. Meanwhile, by analyzing the structure of the optimal
solution, we derive a low-complexity algorithm for the critic network to
quickly evaluate the ETC performance of the offloading decisions output by the
actor network. With the low-complexity critic network, we can quickly select
the best offloading action and subsequently store the state-action pair in an
experience replay memory as the training dataset to continuously improve the
action generation DNN. To further reduce the complexity, we show that the
optimal offloading decision exhibits an one-climb structure, which can be
utilized to significantly reduce the search space of action generation.
Numerical results show that for various types of task graphs, the proposed
algorithm achieves up to $99.1\%$ of the optimal performance while
significantly reducing the computational complexity compared to the existing
optimization methods.

Title: Throughput Optimal Decentralized Scheduling with Single-bit State
  Feedback for a Class of Queueing Systems
Authors: Avinash Mohan, Aditya Gopalan and Anurag Kumar
Categories: cs.NI cs.PF
Comments: 53 pages, 18 figures, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking
\\
  Motivated by medium access control for resource-challenged wireless Internet
of Things (IoT), we consider the problem of queue scheduling with reduced queue
state information. In particular, we consider a time-slotted scheduling model
with $N$ sensor nodes, with pair-wise dependence, such that Nodes $i$ and $i +
1,~0 < i < N$ cannot transmit together. We develop new throughput-optimal
scheduling policies requiring only the empty-nonempty state of each queue that
we term Queue Nonemptiness-Based (QNB) policies. We propose a Policy Splicing
technique to combine scheduling policies for small networks in order to
construct throughput-optimal policies for larger networks, some of which also
aim for low delay. For $N = 3,$ there exists a sum-queue length optimal QNB
scheduling policy. We show, however, that for $N > 4,$ there is no QNB policy
that is sum-queue length optimal over all arrival rate vectors in the capacity
region.
  We then extend our results to a more general class of interference
constraints that we call cluster-of-cliques (CoC) conflict graphs. We consider
two types of CoC networks, namely, Linear Arrays of Cliques (LAoC) and
Star-of-Cliques (SoC) networks. We develop QNB policies for these classes of
networks, study their stability and delay properties, and propose and analyze
techniques to reduce the amount of state information to be disseminated across
the network for scheduling. In the SoC setting, we propose a throughput-optimal
policy that only uses information that nodes in the network can glean by
sensing activity (or lack thereof) on the channel. Our throughput-optimality
results rely on two new arguments: a Lyapunov drift lemma specially adapted to
policies that are queue length-agnostic, and a priority queueing analysis for
showing strong stability.

\\
  Amdahl's Law is generating debates in the community of experts dealing with
parallel processing since it was suggested. The paper explains why Amdahl's Law
shall be interpreted specifically for distributed parallel systems and why it
generated so many debates, discussions and abuses. A general model is set up
where many of the terms affecting parallel processing are listed and the
validity of neglecting certain terms in different approximations are
scrutinized, with special emphasize on the famous scaling laws of parallel
processing. It is clarified that using the right interpretation of terms,
Amdahl's Law is the governing law of all kinds of parallel processing. Amdahl's
Law describes among others the history of supercomputing, the inherent
performance limitation of the different kinds of parallel processing and it is
the basic Law of the 'modern computing' paradigm, that is desperately needed
for the computing systems working under extreme computing conditions.

Title: A Differential-form Pullback Programming Language for Higher-order
  Reverse-mode Automatic Differentiation
Authors: Carol Mak, Luke Ong
Categories: cs.PL cs.CL cs.LO
\\
  Building on the observation that reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD)
-- a generalisation of backpropagation -- can naturally be expressed as
pullbacks of differential 1-forms, we design a simple higher-order programming
language with a first-class differential operator, and present a reduction
strategy which exactly simulates reverse-mode AD. We justify our reduction

Title: Holistic Specifications for Robust Programs

  Functional specifications describe what program components do: the sufficient
conditions to invoke a component's operations. They allow us to reason about
the use of components in the closed world setting, where the component
interacts with known client code, and where the client code must establish the
appropriate pre-conditions before calling into the component.
  Sufficient conditions are not enough to reason about the use of components in
the open world setting, where the component interacts with external code,
possibly of unknown provenance, and where the component itself may evolve over
time. In this open world setting, we must also consider the necessary}
conditions, i.e, what are the conditions without which an effect will not
happen.
  In this paper we propose the language Chainmail for writing holistic
specifications that focus on necessary conditions (as well as sufficient
conditions). We give a formal semantics for \Chainmail. The core of Chainmail
has been mechanised in the Coq proof assistant.

Title: Incremental Nonlinear Fault-Tolerant Control of a Quadrotor with
  Complete Loss of Two Opposing Rotors

MSC-class: 93C85 93C95 93D25
\\
  In order to further expand the flight envelope of quadrotors under actuator
failures, we design a nonlinear sensor-based fault-tolerant controller to
stabilize a quadrotor with failure of two opposing rotors in the high-speed
flight condition (> 8m/s). The incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI)
approach which excels in handling model uncertainties is adopted to compensate
for the significant unknown aerodynamic effects. The internal dynamics of such
an underactuated system have been analyzed, and subsequently stabilized by
re-defining the control output. The proposed method can be generalized to
control a quadrotor under single-rotor-failure and nominal conditions. For
validation, flight tests have been carried out in a large-scale open jet wind
tunnel. The position of a damaged quadrotor can be controlled in the presence
of significant wind disturbances. A linear quadratic regulator (LQR) approach
from the literature has been compared to demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed nonlinear method in the windy and high-speed flight condition.

Title: Online Parameter Estimation for Safety-Critical Systems with Gaussian
  Processes
Authors: Mouhyemen Khan and Abhijit Chatterjee
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table
\\
  Parameter estimation is crucial for modeling, tracking, and control of
complex dynamical systems. However, parameter uncertainties can compromise
system performance under a controller relying on nominal parameter values.
Typically, parameters are estimated using numerical regression approaches
framed as inverse problems. However, they suffer from non-uniqueness due to
existence of multiple local optima, reliance on gradients, numerous
experimental data, or stability issues. Addressing these drawbacks, we present
a Bayesian optimization framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs) for online
parameter estimation. It uses an efficient search strategy over a response
surface in the parameter space for finding the global optima with minimal
function evaluations. The response surface is modeled as correlated surrogates
using GPs on noisy data. The GP posterior predictive variance is exploited for
smart adaptive sampling. This balances the exploration versus exploitation
trade-off which is key in reaching the global optima under limited budget. We
demonstrate our technique on an actuated planar pendulum and safety-critical
quadrotor in simulation with changing parameters. We also benchmark our results
against solvers using interior point method and sequential quadratic program.
By reconfiguring the controller with new optimized parameters iteratively, we
drastically improve trajectory tracking of the system versus the nominal case
and other solvers.

Title: Informative Path Planning for Mobile Sensing with Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Yongyong Wei, Rong Zheng
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: To appear at IEEE INFOCOM 2020
\\
  Large-scale spatial data such as air quality, thermal conditions and location
signatures play a vital role in a variety of applications. Collecting such data
manually can be tedious and labour intensive. With the advancement of robotic
technologies, it is feasible to automate such tasks using mobile robots with
sensing and navigation capabilities. However, due to limited battery lifetime
and scarcity of charging stations, it is important to plan paths for the robots
that maximize the utility of data collection, also known as the informative
path planning (IPP) problem. In this paper, we propose a novel IPP algorithm
using reinforcement learning (RL). A constrained exploration and exploitation
strategy is designed to address the unique challenges of IPP, and is shown to
have fast convergence and better optimality than a classical reinforcement
learning approach. Extensive experiments using real-world measurement data
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms
in most test cases. Interestingly, unlike existing solutions that have to be
re-executed when any input parameter changes, our RL-based solution allows a
degree of transferability across different problem instances.

Title: Trust Repairing for Human-Swarm Cooperation inDynamic Task Response
Authors: Yijiang Pang and Rui Liu
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Emergency happens in human-UAV cooperation, such as criminal activity
tracking and urgent needs for ground assistance. Emergency response usually has
high requirements on the motion control of the multi-UAV system, by maintaining
both the team performance and team behaviors. However When a UAV swarm executes
tasks in a real-world environment, because of real-world factors, such as
system reliability and environmental disturbances, some robots in the swarm
will behave abnormally, such as slow flocking speed, wrong heading direction,
or poor spatial relations. In the meanwhile, incorrect trust between human and
UAV swarm could map the abnormal behavior of faulty robot to the whole swarm
and request a time-consuming intervention from human supervisor, damage the UAV
swarm response for a dynamic task, even evolve to a failure of task because of
accumulated error. To correct reflect the trust between humans and UAV swarm
and rebuild the trust to improve the performance caused by incorrect trust. We
propose a dynamic trust repair model. The dynamic trust model focus on
human-supervisory UAV system which can help UAV swarm to reduce the negative
influence from faulty UAV on the performance of the UAV swarm, get a flexible
reaction and stable human-supervisory UAV task performance. Results show that
trust model could improve the performance of the swarm for dynamic task
response and regain human trust.

Title: Task-space Synergies for Reaching using Upper-limb Prostheses
Authors: Ricardo Garcia-Rosas, Denny Oetomo, Chris Manzie, Ying Tan, and Peter
  Choong
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Synergistic prostheses enable the coordinated movement of the
human-prosthetic arm, as required by activities of daily living. This is
achieved by coupling the motion of the prosthesis to the human command, such as
residual limb movement in motion-based interfaces. Previous studies
demonstrated that developing human-prosthetic synergies in joint-space must
consider individual motor behaviour and the intended task to be performed,
requiring personalisation and task calibration. In this work, an alternative
synergy-based strategy, utilising a synergistic relationship expressed in
task-space, is proposed. This task-space synergy has the potential to replace
the need for personalisation and task calibration with a model-based approach
requiring knowledge of the individual user's arm kinematics, the anticipated
hand motion during the task and voluntary information from the prosthetic user.
The proposed method is compared with surface electromyography-based and
joint-space synergy-based prosthetic interfaces in a study of motor behaviour
and task performance on able-bodied subjects using a VR-based transhumeral
prosthesis. Experimental results showed that for a set of forward reaching
tasks the proposed task-space synergy achieves comparable performance to
joint-space synergies and superior to conventional surface electromyography.
Case study results with an amputee subject motivate the further development of
the proposed task-space synergy method.

Title: Act, Perceive, and Plan in Belief Space for Robot Localization
Authors: Michele Colledanchise, Damiano Malafronte, and Lorenzo Natale
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 7 pages. Preprint of ICRA2020
\\
  In this paper, we outline an interleaved acting and planning technique to
rapidly reduce the uncertainty of the estimated robot's pose by perceiving
relevant information from the environment, as recognizing an object or asking
someone for a direction.
  Generally, existing localization approaches rely on low-level geometric
features such as points, lines, and planes, while these approaches provide the
desired accuracy, they may require time to converge, especially with incorrect
initial guesses. In our approach, a task planner computes a sequence of action
and perception tasks to actively obtain relevant information from the robot's
perception system. We validate our approach in large state spaces, to show how
the approach scales, and in real environments, to show the applicability of our
method on real robots.
  We prove that our approach is sound, complete, and tractable in practical
cases.

  This paper introduces the Omnidirectional Tractable Three Module Robot for
traversing inside complex pipe networks. The robot consists of three
omnidirectional modules fixed 120{\deg} apart circumferentially which can
rotate about their axis allowing holonomic motion of the robot. Holonomic
motion enables the robot to overcome motion singularity when negotiating
T-junctions and further allows the robot to arrive in a preferred orientation
while taking turns inside a pipe. The singularity region while negotiating
T-junctions is analyzed to formulate the geometry of the region. The design and
motion capabilities are validated by conducting simulations in MSC ADAMS on a
simplified lumped-model of the robot.

\\
  Chaotic itinerancy is a frequently observed phenomenon in high-dimensional
and nonlinear dynamical systems, and it is characterized by the random
transitions among multiple quasi-attractors. Several studies have revealed that
chaotic itinerancy has been observed in brain activity, and it is considered to
play a critical role in the spontaneous, stable behavior generation of animals.
Thus, chaotic itinerancy is a topic of great interest, particularly for
neurorobotics researchers who wish to understand and implement autonomous
behavioral controls for agents. However, it is generally difficult to gain
control over high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. Hence, the
implementation of chaotic itinerancy has mainly been accomplished
heuristically. In this study, we propose a novel way of implementing chaotic
itinerancy reproducibly and at will in a generic high-dimensional chaotic
system. In particular, we demonstrate that our method enables us to easily
design both the trajectories of quasi-attractors and the transition rules among
them simply by adjusting the limited number of system parameters and by
utilizing the intrinsic high-dimensional chaos. Finally, we quantitatively
discuss the validity and scope of application through the results of several
numerical experiments.

Title: Towards Intelligent Pick and Place Assembly of Individualized Products
  Using Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Caterina Neef, Dario Luipers, Jan Bollenbacher, Christian Gebel and
  Anja Richert
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
\\
  Individualized manufacturing is becoming an important approach as a means to
fulfill increasingly diverse and specific consumer requirements and
expectations. While there are various solutions to the implementation of the
manufacturing process, such as additive manufacturing, the subsequent automated
assembly remains a challenging task. As an approach to this problem, we aim to
teach a collaborative robot to successfully perform pick and place tasks by
implementing reinforcement learning. For the assembly of an individualized
product in a constantly changing manufacturing environment, the simulated
geometric and dynamic parameters will be varied. Using reinforcement learning
algorithms capable of meta-learning, the tasks will first be trained in
simulation. They will then be performed in a real-world environment where new
factors are introduced that were not simulated in training to confirm the
robustness of the algorithms. The robot will gain its input data from tactile
sensors, area scan cameras, and 3D cameras used to generate heightmaps of the
environment and the objects. The selection of machine learning algorithms and
hardware components as well as further research questions to realize the
outlined production scenario are the results of the presented work.

Title: Deep Learning of Movement Intent and Reaction Time for EEG-informed
  Adaptation of Rehabilitation Robots

Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with
  arXiv:2002.07541
\\
  Mounting evidence suggests that adaptation is a crucial mechanism for
rehabilitation robots in promoting motor learning. Yet, it is commonly based on
robot-derived movement kinematics, which is a rather subjective measurement of
performance, especially in the presence of a sensorimotor impairment. Here, we
propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses
electroencephalography (EEG) as an objective measurement of two kinematics
components that are typically used to assess motor learning and thereby
adaptation: i) the intent to initiate a goal-directed movement, and ii) the
reaction time (RT) of that movement. We evaluated our CNN on data acquired from
an in-house experiment where 13 subjects moved a rehabilitation robotic arm in
four directions on a plane, in response to visual stimuli. Our CNN achieved
average test accuracies of 80.08% and 79.82% in a binary classification of the
intent (intent vs. no intent) and RT (slow vs. fast), respectively. Our results
demonstrate how individual movement components implicated in distinct types of
motor learning can be predicted from synchronized EEG data acquired before the
start of the movement. Our approach can, therefore, inform robotic adaptation
in real-time and has the potential to further improve one's ability to perform
the rehabilitation task.

Title: Higher-Order Label Homogeneity and Spreading in Graphs
Authors: Dhivya Eswaran, Srijan Kumar and Christos Faloutsos
Categories: cs.SI
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  Do higher-order network structures aid graph semi-supervised learning? Given
a graph and a few labeled vertices, labeling the remaining vertices is a
high-impact problem with applications in several tasks, such as recommender
systems, fraud detection and protein identification. However, traditional
methods rely on edges for spreading labels, which is limited as all edges are
not equal. Vertices with stronger connections participate in higher-order
structures in graphs, which calls for methods that can leverage these
structures in the semi-supervised learning tasks.
  To this end, we propose Higher-Order Label Spreading (HOLS) to spread labels
using higher-order structures. HOLS has strong theoretical guarantees and
reduces to standard label spreading in the base case. Via extensive
experiments, we show that higher-order label spreading using triangles in
addition to edges is up to 4.7% better than label spreading using edges alone.
Compared to prior traditional and state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method
leads to statistically significant accuracy gains in all-but-one cases, while
remaining fast and scalable to large graphs.

\\
  Force-directed algorithms are widely used to generate aesthetically pleasing
layouts of graphs or networks arisen in many scientific disciplines. To
visualize large-scale graphs, several parallel algorithms have been discussed
in the literature. However, existing parallel algorithms do not utilize memory
hierarchy efficiently and often offer limited parallelism. This paper addresses
these limitations with BatchLayout, an algorithm that groups vertices into
minibatches and processes them in parallel. BatchLayout also employs cache
blocking techniques to utilize memory hierarchy efficiently. More parallelism
and improved memory accesses coupled with force approximating techniques,
better initialization, and optimized learning rate make BatchLayout
significantly faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms such as ForceAtlas2
and OpenOrd. The visualization quality of layouts from BatchLayout is
comparable or better than similar visualization tools. All of our source code,

Title: ITeM: Independent Temporal Motifs to Summarize and Compare Temporal
  Networks
Authors: Sumit Purohit, Lawrence B. Holder, George Chin
Categories: cs.SI cs.AI
\\
  Networks are a fundamental and flexible way of representing various complex
systems. Many domains such as communication, citation, procurement, biology,
social media, and transportation can be modeled as a set of entities and their
relationships. Temporal networks are a specialization of general networks where
the temporal evolution of the system is as important to understand as the
structure of the entities and relationships. We present the Independent
Temporal Motif (ITeM) to characterize temporal graphs from different domains.
The ITeMs are edge-disjoint temporal motifs that can be used to model the
structure and the evolution of the graph. For a given temporal graph, we
produce a feature vector of ITeM frequencies and apply this distribution to the
task of measuring the similarity of temporal graphs. We show that ITeM has
higher accuracy than other motif frequency-based approaches. We define various
metrics based on ITeM that reveal salient properties of a temporal network. We
also present importance sampling as a method for efficiently estimating the
ITeM counts. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real temporal
networks.

Title: Closed-Form Optimal Impulsive Control of Spacecraft Relative Motion
  Using Reachable Set Theory
Authors: Michelle Chernick and Simone D'Amico
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper addresses the spacecraft relative orbit reconfiguration problem of
minimizing the delta-v cost of impulsive control actions while achieving a
desired state in fixed time. The problem is posed in relative orbit element
(ROE) space, which yields insight into relative motion geometry and allows for
the straightforward inclusion of perturbations in linear time-variant form.
Reachable set theory is used to translate the cost-minimization problem into a
geometric path-planning problem and formulate the reachable delta-v minimum, a
new metric to assess optimality and quantify reachability of a maneuver scheme.
Next, this paper presents a methodology to compute maneuver schemes that meet
this new optimality criteria and achieve a prescribed reconfiguration. Though
the methodology is applicable to any linear time-variant system, this paper
leverages a state representation in ROE to derive new globally optimal maneuver
schemes in orbits of arbitrary eccentricity. The methodology is also used to
generate quantifiably sub-optimal solutions when the optimal solutions are
unreachable. Further, this paper determines the mathematical impact of
uncertainties on achieving the desired end state and provides a geometric
visualization of those effects on the reachable set. The proposed algorithms
are tested in realistic reconfiguration scenarios and validated in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

Title: Cellular UAV-to-Device Communications: Trajectory Design and Mode
  Selection by Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: F. Wu, H. Zhang, J. Wu and L. Song
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 33 pages, 12 figures
\\
  In the current unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) for sensing services,
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) transmit their sensory data to terrestrial
mobile devices over the unlicensed spectrum. However, the interference from
surrounding terminals is uncontrollable due to the opportunistic channel
access. In this paper, we consider a cellular Internet of UAVs to guarantee the
Quality-of-Service (QoS), where the sensory data can be transmitted to the
mobile devices either by UAV-to-Device (U2D) communications over cellular
networks, or directly through the base station (BS). Since UAVs' sensing and
transmission may influence their trajectories, we study the trajectory design
problem for UAVs in consideration of their sensing and transmission. This is a
Markov decision problem (MDP) with a large state-action space, and thus, we
utilize multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to approximate the
state-action space, and then propose a multi-UAV trajectory design algorithm to
solve this problem. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can
achieve a higher total utility than policy gradient algorithm and single-agent
algorithm.

Title: Distributed computation of optimal weights for consensus using ADMM
Authors: Kiran Rokade, Rachel Kalpana Kalaimani
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  We consider the problem of achieving average consensus among multiple agents,
where the inter-agent communication network is depicted by a graph. We consider
the discrete-time consensus protocol where each agent updates its value as a
weighted average of its own value and those of its neighbours. Given a graph,
it is known that there exists a set of 'optimal weights' such that the agents
reach average consensus asymptotically with an optimal rate of convergence.
However, existing methods require the knowledge of the entire graph to compute
these optimal weights. We propose a method for each agent to compute its set of
optimal weights locally, i.e., each agent only has to know who are its
neighbours. The method is derived by solving a matrix norm minimization problem
subject to linear constraints in a distributed manner using the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We illustrate our results using
numerical examples and compare our method with an existing method called the
Metropolis weights, which are also computed locally.

Title: A Multi-Step Reconfiguration Model for Active Distribution Network
  Restoration Integrating DG Start-Up Sequences
Authors: Hossein Sekhavatmanesh, Rachid Cherkaoui
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  The ever-increasing penetration of Distributed Generators (DGs) in
distribution networks suggests to enable their potentials in better fulfilling
the restoration objective. The objective of the restoration problem is to
resupply the maximum energy of loads considering their priorities using minimum
switching operations. Basically, it is desired to provide a unique
configuration that is valid regarding the load and generation profiles along
the entire restorative period. However, this unique configuration may not
satisfy at the same time: I) the DG start-up requirements at the beginning of
the restoration plan and II) the topological conditions that would allow the DG
to provide later on the most efficient support for the supply of loads.
Therefore, it is proposed in this paper to allow a limited number of
reconfiguration steps according to the DG start-up requirements. In addition,
this paper presents a novel formulation for the reconfiguration problem that
accounts for partial restoration scenarios where the whole unsupplied area
cannot be restored. The decision variables of the proposed multi-step
restoration problem are: I) the line switching actions at each step of the
reconfiguration process, II) the load switching actions during the whole
restorative period and, III) the active/reactive power dispatch of DGs during
the whole restorative period. A relaxed AC power flow formulation is integrated
to the optimization problem in order to ensure the feasibility of the solution

in terms of a mixed-integer second-order cone programming. Two simulation
scenarios are studied in order to illustrate different features of the proposed
strategy and to demonstrate its effectiveness particularly in the case of
large-scale outages in distribution networks.

Title: Computing a Strategic Decarbonization Pathway: A Chance-Constrained
  Equilibrium Problem
Authors: Jip Kim, Robert Mieth, Yury Dvorkin
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  US transmission systems and wholesale electricity markets, albeit federally
regulated, often span across multiple state jurisdictions. In this environment,
state regulators can strategically exploit this techno-economic coupling to
advance their clean energy policy goals at the expense of neighboring
jurisdictions. This paper investigates strategic regulatory competition to
understand its effect on achieving Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). We
formulate a chance-constrained equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints
(CC-EPEC), which considers multiple state regulators, acting in coordination
with in-state power companies, to implement RPS goals in the least-cost manner.
To solve this CC-EPEC, we customize a Progressive Hedging (PH) algorithm. The
case study uses the CCEPEC and PH algorithm to analyze the effects of state
regulatory competition in the ISO New England system.

Title: Online PMU-Based Method for Estimating Dynamic Load Parameters in
  Ambient Conditions
Authors: Georgia Pierrou, Xiaozhe Wang
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: To appear in 2020 IEEE PES General Meeting, August 2-6 2020,
  Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Accepted on 3rd February 2020
\\
  This paper proposes a novel purely measurement-based method for estimating
dynamic load parameters in near real-time when stochastic load fluctuations are
present. By leveraging on the regression theorem for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process, the proposed method can provide highly accurate estimation without
requiring any information about the power system model. Furthermore, by
exploiting recursion, an online algorithm is developed to estimate the dynamic
load parameters in near real-time. Simulation studies on the IEEE 39-Bus system
demonstrate the accuracy of the model-free method, its robustness against
measurement noise, as well as its satisfactory performance in tracking
real-time changes of the load parameters.

Title: MEM_GE: a new maximum entropy method for image reconstruction from solar
  X-ray visibilities

\\
  Maximum Entropy is an image reconstruction method conceived to image a
sparsely occupied field of view and therefore particularly appropriate to
achieve super-resolution effects. Although widely used in image deconvolution,
this method has been formulated in radio astronomy for the analysis of
observations in the spatial frequency domain, and an Interactive Data Language
(IDL) code has been implemented for image reconstruction from solar X-ray
Fourier data. However, this code relies on a non-convex formulation of the
constrained optimization problem addressed by the Maximum Entropy approach and
this sometimes results in unreliable reconstructions characterized by
unphysical shrinking effects.
  This paper introduces a new approach to Maximum Entropy based on the
constrained minimization of a convex functional. In the case of observations
recorded by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI),
the resulting code provides the same super-resolution effects of the previous
algorithm, while working properly also when that code produces unphysical
reconstructions. Results are also provided of testing the algorithm with
synthetic data simulating observations of the Spectrometer/Telescope for
Imaging X-rays (STIX) in Solar Orbiter. The new code is available in the
{\em{HESSI}} folder of the Solar SoftWare (SSW)tree.

Title: Using AI for Mitigating the Impact of Network Delay in Cloud-based
  Intelligent Traffic Signal Control
Authors: Rusheng Zhang, Xinze Zhou, Ozan K. Tonguz
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI
Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to IEEE BlackseaComm 2020
\\
  The recent advancements in cloud services, Internet of Things (IoT) and
Cellular networks have made cloud computing an attractive option for
intelligent traffic signal control (ITSC). Such a method significantly reduces
the cost of cables, installation, number of devices used, and maintenance. ITSC
systems based on cloud computing lower the cost of the ITSC systems and make it
possible to scale the system by utilizing the existing powerful cloud
platforms.
  While such systems have significant potential, one of the critical problems
that should be addressed is the network delay. It is well known that network
delay in message propagation is hard to prevent, which could potentially
degrade the performance of the system or even create safety issues for vehicles
at intersections.
  In this paper, we introduce a new traffic signal control algorithm based on
reinforcement learning, which performs well even under severe network delay.
The framework introduced in this paper can be helpful for all agent-based
systems using remote computing resources where network delay could be a
critical concern. Extensive simulation results obtained for different scenarios
show the viability of the designed algorithm to cope with network delay.

Title: Quantum statistical query learning
Authors: Srinivasan Arunachalam, Alex B. Grilo, Henry Yuen
Categories: quant-ph cs.CC cs.LG
Comments: 24 Pages
\\
  We propose a learning model called the quantum statistical learning QSQ
model, which extends the SQ learning model introduced by Kearns to the quantum
setting. Our model can be also seen as a restriction of the quantum PAC
learning model: here, the learner does not have direct access to quantum
examples, but can only obtain estimates of measurement statistics on them.
Theoretically, this model provides a simple yet expressive setting to explore
the power of quantum examples in machine learning. From a practical
perspective, since simpler operations are required, learning algorithms in the
QSQ model are more feasible for implementation on near-term quantum devices. We
prove a number of results about the QSQ learning model. We first show that
parity functions, (log n)-juntas and polynomial-sized DNF formulas are
efficiently learnable in the QSQ model, in contrast to the classical setting
where these problems are provably hard. This implies that many of the
advantages of quantum PAC learning can be realized even in the more restricted
quantum SQ learning model. It is well-known that weak statistical query
dimension, denoted by WSQDIM(C), characterizes the complexity of learning a
concept class C in the classical SQ model. We show that log(WSQDIM(C)) is a
lower bound on the complexity of QSQ learning, and furthermore it is tight for
certain concept classes C. Additionally, we show that this quantity provides
strong lower bounds for the small-bias quantum communication model under
product distributions. Finally, we introduce the notion of private quantum PAC
learning, in which a quantum PAC learner is required to be differentially
private. We show that learnability in the QSQ model implies learnability in the
quantum private PAC model. Additionally, we show that in the private PAC
learning setting, the classical and quantum sample complexities are equal, up
to constant factors.

Title: LocoGAN -- Locally Convolutional GAN
Authors: {\L}ukasz Struski, Szymon Knop, Jacek Tabor, Wiktor Daniec,

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  In the paper we construct a fully convolutional GAN model: LocoGAN, which
latent space is given by noise-like images of possibly different resolutions.
The learning is local, i.e. we process not the whole noise-like image, but the
sub-images of a fixed size. As a consequence LocoGAN can produce images of
arbitrary dimensions e.g. LSUN bedroom data set. Another advantage of our
approach comes from the fact that we use the position channels, which allows
the generation of fully periodic (e.g. cylindrical panoramic images) or almost
periodic ,,infinitely long" images (e.g. wall-papers).

Title: Variable-Bitrate Neural Compression via Bayesian Arithmetic Coding
Authors: Yibo Yang, Robert Bamler and Stephan Mandt

Comments: 8 pages + detailed supplement with additional full resolution
  reconstructed images
\\
  Deep Bayesian latent variable models have enabled new approaches to both
model and data compression. Here, we propose a new algorithm for compressing
latent representations in deep probabilistic models, such as variational
autoencoders, in post-processing. The approach thus separates model design and
training from the compression task. Our algorithm generalizes arithmetic coding
to the continuous domain, using adaptive discretization accuracy that exploits
estimates of posterior uncertainty. A consequence of the "plug and play" nature
of our approach is that various rate-distortion trade-offs can be achieved with
a single trained model, eliminating the need to train multiple models for
different bit rates. Our experimental results demonstrate the importance of
taking into account posterior uncertainties, and show that image compression
with the proposed algorithm outperforms JPEG over a wide range of bit rates
using only a single machine learning model. Further experiments on Bayesian
neural word embeddings demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method.

Title: The interconnectedness of the economic content in the speeches of the US
  Presidents
Authors: Matteo Cinellia Valerio Ficcadenti, Jessica Riccionib

Journal-ref: Ann Oper Res (2019)
DOI: 10.1007/s10479-019-03372-2
\\
  The speeches stated by influential politicians can have a decisive impact on
the future of a country. In particular, the economic content of such speeches
affects the economy of countries and their financial markets. For this reason,
we examine a novel dataset containing the economic content of 951 speeches
stated by 45 US Presidents from George Washington (April 1789) to Donald Trump
(February 2017). In doing so, we use an economic glossary carried out by means
of text mining techniques. The goal of our study is to examine the structure of
significant interconnections within a network obtained from the economic
content of presidential speeches. In such a network, nodes are represented by
talks and links by values of cosine similarity, the latter computed using the
occurrences of the economic terms in the speeches. The resulting network
displays a peculiar structure made up of a core (i.e. a set of highly central
and densely connected nodes) and a periphery (i.e. a set of non-central and
sparsely connected nodes). The presence of different economic dictionaries
employed by the Presidents characterize the core-periphery structure. The
Presidents' talks belonging to the network's core share the usage of generic
(non-technical) economic locutions like "interest" or "trade". While the use of
more technical and less frequent terms characterizes the periphery (e.g.
"yield" ). Furthermore, the speeches close in time share a common economic
dictionary. These results together with the economics glossary usages during
the US periods of boom and crisis provide unique insights on the economic
content relationships among Presidents' speeches.

that intersects every triangle of a graph $G$ is at most twice the size
$\nu(G)$ of a maximum set of edge-disjoint triangles of $G$. In this paper we
present three results regarding Tuza's Conjecture. We verify it for graphs with
treewidth at most $6$; we show that $\tau(G)\leq \frac{3}{2}\,\nu(G)$ for every
planar triangulation $G$ different from $K_4$; and that
$\tau(G)\leq\frac{9}{5}\,\nu(G) + \frac{1}{5}$ if $G$ is a maximal graph with
treewidth 3.

  We solve the stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium (SGNE) problem in merely
monotone games with expected value cost functions. Specifically, we present the
first distributed SGNE seeking algorithm for monotone games that only requires
one proximal computation (e.g., one projection step) and only one
pseudogradient evaluation per iteration. Our main contribution is to build upon
the relaxed forward-backward operator splitting by Malitsky (Mathematical
programming, 2019) and in turn to show almost sure convergence to a SGNE when
the expected value of the pseudogradient is approximated by the average over a
number of random samples.

  Linear information and rank inequalities as, for instance, Ingleton
inequality, are useful tools in information theory and matroid theory. Even
though many such inequalities have been found, it seems that most of them
remain undiscovered. Improved results have been obtained in recent works by
using the properties from which they are derived instead of the inequalities
themselves. We apply here this strategy to the classification of matroids
according to their representations and to the search for bounds on secret
sharing for matroid ports.

  Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea affects an estimated 1-5% of
elementary-school aged children and can lead to other detrimental health
problems. Swift diagnosis and treatment are critical to a child's growth and
development, but the variability of symptoms and the complexity of the
available data make this a challenge. We take a first step in streamlining the
process by focusing on inexpensive data from questionnaires and craniofacial
measurements. We apply correlation networks, the Mapper algorithm from
topological data analysis, and singular value decomposition in a process of
exploratory data analysis. We then apply a variety of supervised and
unsupervised learning techniques from statistics, machine learning, and
topology, ranging from support vector machines to Bayesian classifiers and
manifold learning. Finally, we analyze the results of each of these methods and
discuss the implications for a multi-data-sourced algorithm moving forward.

\\
  Deep learning models for MRI classification face two recurring problems: they
are typically limited by low sample size, and are abstracted by their own
complexity (the "black box problem"). In this paper, we train a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with the largest multi-source, functional MRI (fMRI)
connectomic dataset ever compiled, consisting of 43,858 datapoints. We apply
this model to a cross-sectional comparison of autism (ASD) vs typically
developing (TD) controls that has proved difficult to characterise with
inferential statistics. To contextualise these findings, we additionally
perform classifications of gender and task vs rest. Employing class-balancing
to build a training set, we trained 3$\times$300 modified CNNs in an ensemble
model to classify fMRI connectivity matrices with overall AUROCs of 0.6774,
0.7680, and 0.9222 for ASD vs TD, gender, and task vs rest, respectively.
Additionally, we aim to address the black box problem in this context using two
visualization methods. First, class activation maps show which functional
connections of the brain our models focus on when performing classification.
Second, by analyzing maximal activations of the hidden layers, we were also
able to explore how the model organizes a large and mixed-centre dataset,
finding that it dedicates specific areas of its hidden layers to processing
different covariates of data (depending on the independent variable analyzed),
and other areas to mix data from different sources. Our study finds that deep
learning models that distinguish ASD from TD controls focus broadly on temporal
and cerebellar connections, with a particularly high focus on the right caudate
nucleus and paracentral sulcus.

Title: Observational nonidentifiability, generalized likelihood and free energy
Authors: A.E. Allahverdyan
Categories: stat.ML cond-mat.stat-mech cs.LG physics.data-an
Comments: 25 pages, 1 figure
\\
  We study the parameter estimation problem in mixture models with
observational nonidentifiability: the full model (also containing hidden
variables) is identifiable, but the marginal (observed) model is not. Hence
global maxima of the marginal likelihood are (infinitely) degenerate and
predictions of the marginal likelihood are not unique. We show how to
generalize the marginal likelihood by introducing an effective temperature, and
making it similar to the free energy. This generalization resolves the
observational nonidentifiability, since its maximization leads to unique
results that are better than a random selection of one degenerate maximum of
the marginal likelihood or the averaging over many such maxima. The generalized
likelihood inherits many features from the usual likelihood, e.g. it holds the
conditionality principle, and its local maximum can be searched for via
suitably modified expectation-maximization method. The maximization of the
generalized likelihood relates to entropy optimization.

\\
  Creating a database of 21cm brightness temperature signals from the Epoch of
Reionisation (EoR) for an array of reionisation histories is a complex and
computationally expensive task, given the range of astrophysical processes
involved and the possibly high-dimensional parameter space that is to be
probed. We utilise a specific type of neural network, a Progressively Growing
Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN), to produce realistic tomography images
of the 21cm brightness temperature during the EoR, covering a continuous
three-dimensional parameter space that models varying X-ray emissivity, Lyman
band emissivity, and ratio between hard and soft X-rays. The GPU-trained
network generates new samples at a resolution of $\sim 3'$ in a second (on a
laptop CPU), and the resulting global 21cm signal, power spectrum, and pixel
distribution function agree well with those of the training data, taken from
the 21SSD catalogue \citep{Semelin2017}. Finally, we showcase how a trained
PGGAN can be leveraged for the converse task of inferring parameters from 21cm
tomography samples via Approximate Bayesian Computation.

Title: Tourism Demand Forecasting with Tourist Attention: An Ensemble Deep

Categories: stat.AP cs.LG econ.EM
\\
  The large amount of tourism-related data presents a series of challenges for
tourism demand forecasting, including data deficiencies, multicollinearity and
long calculation time. A Bagging-based multivariate ensemble deep learning
model, integrating Stacked Autoencoders and KELM (B-SAKE) is proposed to
address these challenges in this study. We forecast tourist arrivals arriving
in Beijing from four countries adopting historical data on tourist arrivals
arriving in Beijing, economic indicators and tourist online behavior variables.
The results from the cases of four origin countries suggest that our proposed
B-SAKE model outperforms than benchmark models whether in horizontal accuracy,
directional accuracy or statistical significance. Both Bagging and Stacked
Autoencoder can improve the forecasting performance of the models. Moreover,
the forecasting performance of the models is evaluated with consistent results
by means of the multi-step-ahead forecasting scheme.

partition the dataset among $m$ nodes and alternate between multiple (precisely
$p$) local power iterations and one global aggregation. We theoretically show
that under certain assumptions, \texttt{LocalPower} lowers the required number
of communications by a factor of $p$ to reach a certain accuracy. We also show
that the strategy of periodically decaying $p$ helps improve the performance of
\texttt{LocalPower}. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of
\texttt{LocalPower}.

Title: Seasonal and Trend Forecasting of Tourist Arrivals: An Adaptive
  Multiscale Ensemble Learning Approach
Authors: Shaolong Suna, Dan Bi, Ju-e Guo, Shouyang Wang
Categories: stat.AP cs.LG econ.EM
\\
  The accurate seasonal and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals is a very
challenging task. In the view of the importance of seasonal and trend
forecasting of tourist arrivals, and limited research work paid attention to
these previously. In this study, a new adaptive multiscale ensemble (AME)
learning approach incorporating variational mode decomposition (VMD) and least
square support vector regression (LSSVR) is developed for short-, medium-, and
long-term seasonal and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals. In the
formulation of our developed AME learning approach, the original tourist
arrivals series are first decomposed into the trend, seasonal and remainders
volatility components. Then, the ARIMA is used to forecast the trend component,
the SARIMA is used to forecast seasonal component with a 12-month cycle, while
the LSSVR is used to forecast remainder volatility components. Finally, the
forecasting results of the three components are aggregated to generate an
ensemble forecasting of tourist arrivals by the LSSVR based nonlinear ensemble
approach. Furthermore, a direct strategy is used to implement multi-step-ahead
forecasting. Taking two accuracy measures and the Diebold-Mariano test, the
empirical results demonstrate that our proposed AME learning approach can
achieve higher level and directional forecasting accuracy compared with other
benchmarks used in this study, indicating that our proposed approach is a
promising model for forecasting tourist arrivals with high seasonality and
volatility.

Title: Bayesian Experimental Design for Implicit Models by Mutual Information
  Neural Estimation

Comments: Conference submission
MSC-class: 62K05 (Primary)

\\
  Implicit stochastic models, where the data-generation distribution is
intractable but sampling is possible, are ubiquitous in the natural sciences.
The models typically have free parameters that need to be inferred from data
collected in scientific experiments. A fundamental question is how to design
the experiments so that the collected data are most useful. The field of
Bayesian experimental design advocates that, ideally, we should choose designs
that maximise the mutual information (MI) between the data and the parameters.
For implicit models, however, this approach is severely hampered by the high
computational cost of computing posteriors and maximising MI, in particular
when we have more than a handful of design variables to optimise. In this
paper, we propose a new approach to Bayesian experimental design for implicit
models that leverages recent advances in neural MI estimation to deal with
these issues. We show that training a neural network to maximise a lower bound
on MI allows us to jointly determine the optimal design and the posterior.
Simulation studies illustrate that this gracefully extends Bayesian
experimental design for implicit models to higher design dimensions.

Title: Learning Fair Scoring Functions: Fairness Definitions, Algorithms and
  Generalization Bounds for Bipartite Ranking
Authors: Robin Vogel, Aur\'elien Bellet, and St\'ephan Cl\'emen\c{c}on
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 27 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Many applications of artificial intelligence, ranging from credit lending to
the design of medical diagnosis support tools through recidivism prediction,
involve scoring individuals using a learned function of their attributes. These
predictive risk scores are used to rank a set of people, and/or take individual
decisions about them based on whether the score exceeds a certain threshold
that may depend on the context in which the decision is taken. The level of
delegation granted to such systems will heavily depend on how questions of
fairness can be answered. While this concern has received a lot of attention in
the classification setup, the design of relevant fairness constraints for the
problem of learning scoring functions has not been much investigated. In this
paper, we propose a flexible approach to group fairness for the scoring problem
with binary labeled data, a standard learning task referred to as bipartite
ranking. We argue that the functional nature of the ROC curve, the gold
standard measuring ranking performance in this context, leads to several
possible ways of formulating fairness constraints. We introduce general classes
of fairness conditions in bipartite ranking and establish generalization bounds
for scoring rules learned under such constraints. Beyond the theoretical
formulation and results, we design practical learning algorithms and illustrate
our approach with numerical experiments.

Title: A Unified Convergence Analysis for Shuffling-Type Gradient Methods
Authors: Lam M. Nguyen, Quoc Tran-Dinh, Dzung T. Phan, Phuong Ha Nguyen, Marten
  van Dijk
Categories: math.OC cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we provide a unified convergence analysis for a class of
shuffling-type gradient methods for solving a well-known finite-sum
minimization problem commonly used in machine learning. This algorithm covers
various variants such as randomized reshuffling, single shuffling, and
cyclic/incremental gradient schemes. We consider two different settings:
strongly convex and non-convex problems. Our main contribution consists of new
non-asymptotic and asymptotic convergence rates for a general class of
shuffling-type gradient methods to solve both non-convex and strongly convex
problems. While our rate in the non-convex problem is new (i.e. not known yet
under standard assumptions), the rate on the strongly convex case matches (up
to a constant) the best-known results. However, unlike existing works in this
direction, we only use standard assumptions such as smoothness and strong
convexity. Finally, we empirically illustrate the effect of learning rates via
a non-convex logistic regression and neural network examples.

\\
  On 21-22 November 2019, about 30 researchers gathered in Victoria, BC,
Canada, for the workshop "Detection and Classification in Marine Bioacoustics
with Deep Learning" organized by MERIDIAN and hosted by Ocean Networks Canada.
The workshop was attended by marine biologists, data scientists, and computer
scientists coming from both Canadian coasts and the US and representing a wide
spectrum of research organizations including universities, government
(Fisheries and Oceans Canada, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration),
industry (JASCO Applied Sciences, Google, Axiom Data Science), and
non-for-profits (Orcasound, OrcaLab). Consisting of a mix of oral
presentations, open discussion sessions, and hands-on tutorials, the workshop
program offered a rare opportunity for specialists from distinctly different
domains to engage in conversation about deep learning and its promising
potential for the development of detection and classification algorithms in
underwater acoustics. In this workshop report, we summarize key points from the
presentations and discussion sessions.

Title: Distance-Based Regularisation of Deep Networks for Fine-Tuning
Authors: Henry Gouk, Timothy M. Hospedales, Massimiliano Pontil
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We investigate approaches to regularisation during fine-tuning of deep neural
networks. First we provide a neural network generalisation bound based on
Rademacher complexity that uses the distance the weights have moved from their
initial values. This bound has no direct dependence on the number of weights
and compares favourably to other bounds when applied to convolutional networks.
Our bound is highly relevant for fine-tuning, because providing a network with
a good initialisation based on transfer learning means that learning can modify
the weights less, and hence achieve tighter generalisation. Inspired by this,
we develop a simple yet effective fine-tuning algorithm that constrains the
hypothesis class to a small sphere centred on the initial pre-trained weights,
thus obtaining provably better generalisation performance than conventional
transfer learning. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm works well,
corroborating our theoretical results. It outperforms both state of the art
fine-tuning competitors, and penalty-based alternatives that we show do not
directly constrain the radius of the search space.

Title: Learning Bounds for Moment-Based Domain Adaptation
Authors: Werner Zellinger, Bernhard A Moser and Susanne Saminger-Platz
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Domain adaptation algorithms are designed to minimize the misclassification
risk of a discriminative model for a target domain with little training data by
adapting a model from a source domain with a large amount of training data.
Standard approaches measure the adaptation discrepancy based on distance
measures between the empirical probability distributions in the source and
target domain. In this setting, we address the problem of deriving learning
bounds under practice-oriented general conditions on the underlying probability
distributions. As a result, we obtain learning bounds for domain adaptation
based on finitely many moments and smoothness conditions.

Title: Partial Gromov-Wasserstein with Applications on Positive-Unlabeled
  Learning
Authors: Laetitia Chapel, Mokhtar Z. Alaya, Gilles Gasso
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Optimal Transport (OT) framework allows defining similarity between
probability distributions and provides metrics such as the Wasserstein and
Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancies. Classical OT problem seeks a transportation
map that preserves the total mass, requiring the mass of the source and target
distributions to be the same. This may be too restrictive in certain
applications such as color or shape matching, since the distributions may have
arbitrary masses or that only a fraction of the total mass has to be
transported. Several algorithms have been devised for computing unbalanced
Wasserstein metrics but when it comes with the Gromov-Wasserstein problem, no
partial formulation is available yet. This precludes from working with
distributions that do not lie in the same metric space or when invariance to
rotation or translation is needed. In this paper, we address the partial
Gromov-Wasserstein problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. We showcase
the new formulation in a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning application. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first application of optimal transport in
this context and we first highlight that partial Wasserstein-based metrics
prove effective in usual PU learning settings. We then demonstrate that partial
Gromov-Wasserstein metrics is efficient in scenario where point clouds come
from different domains or have different features.

Title: Multi-wavelet residual dense convolutional neural network for image
  denoising
Authors: Shuo-Fei Wang, Wen-Kai Yu, and Ya-Xin Li
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 9 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Networks with large receptive field (RF) have shown advanced fitting ability
in recent years. In this work, we utilize the short-term residual learning
method to improve the performance and robustness of networks for image
denoising tasks. Here, we choose a multi-wavelet convolutional neural network
(MWCNN), one of the state-of-art networks with large RF, as the backbone, and
insert residual dense blocks (RDBs) in its each layer. We call this scheme
multi-wavelet residual dense convolutional neural network (MWRDCNN). Compared
with other RDB-based networks, it can extract more features of the object from
adjacent layers, preserve the large RF, and boost the computing efficiency.
Meanwhile, this approach also provides a possibility of absorbing advantages of
multiple architectures in a single network without conflicts. The performance
of the proposed method has been demonstrated in extensive experiments with a
comparison with existing techniques.

Title: Non-Aligned Distribution Distance using Metric Measure Embedding and
  Optimal Transport
Authors: Mokhtar Z. Alaya, Maxime B\'erar, Gilles Gasso, Alain Rakotomamonjy
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We propose a novel approach for comparing distributions whose supports do not
necessarily lie on the same metric space. Unlike Gromov-Wasserstein (GW)
distance that compares pairwise distance of elements from each distribution, we
consider a method that embeds the metric measure spaces in a common Euclidean
space and computes an optimal transport (OT) on the embedded distributions.
This leads to what we call a sub-embedding robust Wasserstein(SERW). Under some
conditions, SERW is a distance that considers an OT distance of the
(low-distorted) embedded distributions using a common metric. In addition to
this novel proposal that generalizes several recent OT works, our contributions
stand on several theoretical analyses: i) we characterize the embedding spaces
to define SERW distance for distribution alignment; ii) we prove that SERW
mimics almost the same properties of GW distance, and we give a cost relation
between GW and SERW. The paper also provides some numerical experiments
illustrating how SERW behaves on matching problems in real-world.

Title: Deep regularization and direct training of the inner layers of Neural
  Networks with Kernel Flows
Authors: Gene Ryan Yoo and Houman Owhadi
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  We introduce a new regularization method for Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) based on Kernel Flows (KFs). KFs were introduced as a method for kernel
selection in regression/kriging based on the minimization of the loss of
accuracy incurred by halving the number of interpolation points in random
batches of the dataset. Writing $f_\theta(x) = \big(f^{(n)}_{\theta_n}\circ
f^{(n-1)}_{\theta_{n-1}} \circ \dots \circ f^{(1)}_{\theta_1}\big)(x)$ for the
functional representation of compositional structure of the ANN, the inner
layers outputs $h^{(i)}(x) = \big(f^{(i)}_{\theta_i}\circ
f^{(i-1)}_{\theta_{i-1}} \circ \dots \circ f^{(1)}_{\theta_1}\big)(x)$ define a
hierarchy of feature maps and kernels $k^{(i)}(x,x')=\exp(- \gamma_i
\|h^{(i)}(x)-h^{(i)}(x')\|_2^2)$. When combined with a batch of the dataset
these kernels produce KF losses $e_2^{(i)}$ (the $L^2$ regression error
incurred by using a random half of the batch to predict the other half)
depending on parameters of inner layers $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_i$ (and
$\gamma_i$). The proposed method simply consists in aggregating a subset of
these KF losses with a classical output loss. We test the proposed method on
CNNs and WRNs without alteration of structure nor output classifier and report
reduced test errors, decreased generalization gaps, and increased robustness to
distribution shift without significant increase in computational complexity. We
suspect that these results might be explained by the fact that while
conventional training only employs a linear functional (a generalized moment)
of the empirical distribution defined by the dataset and can be prone to
trapping in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime (under over-parameterizations),
the proposed loss function (defined as a nonlinear functional of the empirical
distribution) effectively trains the underlying kernel defined by the CNN
beyond regressing the data with that kernel.

Title: High-precision quantum algorithms for partial differential equations
Authors: Andrew M. Childs, Jin-Peng Liu, Aaron Ostrander
Categories: quant-ph cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 38 pages
\\
  Quantum computers can produce a quantum encoding of the solution of a system
of differential equations exponentially faster than a classical algorithm can
produce an explicit description. However, while high-precision quantum
algorithms for linear ordinary differential equations are well established, the
best previous quantum algorithms for linear partial differential equations
(PDEs) have complexity $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the
error tolerance. By developing quantum algorithms based on adaptive-order
finite difference methods and spectral methods, we improve the complexity of
quantum algorithms for linear PDEs to be $\mathrm{poly}(d, \log(1/\epsilon))$,
where $d$ is the spatial dimension. Our algorithms apply high-precision quantum
linear system algorithms to systems whose condition numbers and approximation
errors we bound. We develop a finite difference algorithm for the Poisson
equation and a spectral algorithm for more general second-order elliptic
equations.

Title: Numerical study of Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations in two dimensions
Authors: C. Klein, S. Roudenko, N. Stoilov
Categories: math.AP cs.NA math.NA
\\
  We present a detailed numerical study of solutions to the (generalized)
Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in two spatial dimensions with various power
nonlinearities. In the $L^{2}$-subcritical case, numerical evidence is
presented for the stability of solitons and the soliton resolution for generic
initial data. In the $L^2$-critical and supercritical cases, solitons appear to
be unstable against both dispersion and blow-up. It is conjectured that blow-up
happens in finite time and that blow-up solutions have some resemblance of
being self-similar, i.e., the blow-up core forms a rightward moving
self-similar type rescaled profile with the blow-up happening at infinity in
the critical case and at a finite location in the supercritical case. In the
$L^{2}$-critical case, the blow-up appears to be similar to the one in the
$L^{2}$-critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation with the profile being
a dynamically rescaled soliton.

  As second-order methods, Gauss--Newton-type methods can be more effective
than first-order methods for the solution of nonsmooth optimization problems
with expensive-to-evaluate smooth components. Such methods, however, often do
not converge. Motivated by nonlinear inverse problems with nonsmooth
regularization, we propose a new Gauss--Newton-type method with inexact relaxed
steps. We prove that the method converges to a set of connected critical points
given that the linearisation of the forward operator for the inverse problem is
sufficiently precise. We extensively evaluate the performance of the method on
electrical impedance tomography (EIT).

Title: Fluid flow through anisotropic and deformable double porosity media with
  ultra-low matrix permeability: A continuum framework
Authors: Qi Zhang, Ronaldo I. Borja
Categories: physics.geo-ph cs.NA math.NA
\\
  Fractured porous media or double porosity media are common in nature. At the
same time, accurate modeling remains a significant challenge due to bi-modal
pore size distribution, anisotropy, multi-field coupling and various flow
patterns. The purpose of this study is to formulate a comprehensive coupled
flow and geomechanics model of anisotropic and deformable double porosity media
with ultra-low matrix permeability. Fluid in fissures is modeled with the
generalized Darcy's law with an equivalent permeability upscaled from the
detailed geological characterizations while the liquid in much less permeable
matrix follows a low velocity non-Darcy flow characterized by threshold values
and non-linearity, and fluid mass transfer is dependent on shape factor, phase
pressure difference, and interface permeability. The geomechanics relies on a
thermodynamically consistent effective stress derived from the energy balance
equation, and it is modeled following poroelastic theory. Scaling analysis is
performed to drop negligible force density terms under reasonable parameters'
ranges which also guarantee no violation of entropy inequality. The discussion
revolves around generic double porosity media. Numerical simulation of the
initial boundary value problem reveals the capability of this framework to
capture the crucial role of coupling, anisotropy and ultra-low matrix
permeability in dictating the pressure and displacement fields.

  Understanding how humans use and consume space by comparing stratified
groups, either through observation or controlled study, is key to designing
better spaces, cities, and policies. GPS data traces provide detailed movement
patterns of individuals but can be difficult to interpret due to the scale and
scope of the data collected. For actionable insights, GPS traces are usually
reduced to one or more features which express the spatial phenomenon of
interest. However, it is not always clear which spatial features should be
employed, and substantial effort can be invested into designing features which
may or may not provide insight. In this paper we present an alternative
approach: a standardized feature set with actionable interpretations that can
be efficiently run against many datasets. We show that these features can
distinguish between disparate human mobility patterns, although no single
feature can distinguish them alone.

\\
  Originally a speculative pattern in ecological networks, the hybrid or
compound nested-modular pattern has been confirmed, during the last decade, as
a relevant structural arrangement that emerges in a variety of contexts --in
ecological mutualistic system and beyond. This implies shifting the focus from
the measurement of nestedness as a global property (macro level), to the
detection of blocks (meso level) that internally exhibit a high degree of
nestedness. Unfortunately, the availability and understanding of the methods to
properly detect in-block nested partitions lie behind the empirical findings:
while a precise quality function of in-block nestedness has been proposed, we
lack an understanding of its possible inherent constraints. Specifically, while
it is well known that Newman-Girvan's modularity, and related quality
functions, notoriously suffer from a resolution limit that impairs their
ability to detect small blocks, the potential existence of resolution limits
for in-block nestedness is unexplored. Here, we provide empirical, numerical
and analytical evidence that the in-block nestedness function lacks a
resolution limit, and thus our capacity to detect correct partitions in
networks via its maximization depends solely on the accuracy of the
optimization algorithms.

Title: A Two-Stage Decomposition Approach for AC Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Shenyinying Tu, Andreas Waechter, Ermin Wei
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures
\\
  The alternating current optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem is critical to
power system operations and planning, but it is generally hard to solve due to
its nonconvex and large-scale nature. This paper proposes a scalable
decomposition approach to solve AC-OPF problems. The power network is
decomposed into a master network and a number of subnetworks, where each
network has its own AC-OPF subproblem. We formulate the problem as a two-stage
optimization problem and require only a small amount of communication between
the master network and subnetworks. The key contribution is a novel smoothing
technique that renders the response of a subnetwork differentiable with respect
to the input from the master problem, utilizing properties of the barrier
problem formulation that naturally arises when the subproblem is solved by a
primal-dual interior point algorithm. As a consequence, existing efficient
nonlinear programming solver implementations can be used to solve both the
master problem and the subproblems. The advantage of this algorithm is that
speedup can be obtained by processing the subnetworks in parallel. The method
is readily extended to instances with stochastic loads in the subnetworks.
Numerical results show favorable performance and illustrate the scalability of
the algorithm.
