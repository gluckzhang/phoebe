Title: Multiscale modelling and simulation of physical systems as semiosis
Authors: Martin Thomas Horsch and Silvia Chiacchiera and Michael A. Seaton and
  Ilian T. Todorov
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  It is explored how physicalist mereotopology and Peircean semiotics can be
applied to represent models, simulations, and workflows in multiscale modelling
and simulation of physical systems within a top-level ontology. It is argued
that to conceptualize modelling and simulation in such a framework, two major
types of semiosis need to be formalized and combined with each other:
Interpretation, where a sign and a represented object yield an interpretant
(another representamen for the same object), and metonymization, where the
represented object and a sign are in a three-way relationship with another
object to which the signification is transferred. It is outlined how the main
elements of the pre-existing simulation workflow descriptions MODA and OSMO,
i.e., use cases, models, solvers, and processors, can be aligned with a
top-level ontology that implements this ontological paradigm, which is here
referred to as mereosemiotic physicalism. Implications are discussed for the
development of the European Materials and Modelling Ontology, an implementation
of mereosemiotic physicalism.

  Transportation is an essential area in the nowadays society, both for
business sector and citizenry. There are different kinds of transportation
systems, each one with its own characteristics. In the same way, various areas
of knowledge can deal efficiently with the transport planning. The majority of
the problems related with the transport and logistics have common
characteristics, so they can be modeled as optimization problems, being able to
see them as special cases of other generic problems. These problems fit into
the combinatorial optimization field. Much of the problems of this type have an
exceptional complexity. A great amount of meta-heuristics can be found the
literature, each one with its advantages and disadvantages. Due to the high
complexity of combinatorial optimization problems, there is no technique able
to solve all these problems optimally. This fact makes the fields of
combinatorial optimization and vehicle routing problems be a hot topic of
research. This doctoral thesis will focus its efforts on developing a new
meta-heuristic to solve different kind of vehicle routing problems. The
presented technique offers an added value compared to existing methods, either
in relation to the performance, and the contribution of conceptual originality.
With the aim of validating the proposed model, the results obtained by the
developed meta-heuristic have been compared with the ones obtained by other
four algorithms of similar philosophy. Four well-known routing problems have
been used in this experimentation, as well as two classical combinatorial
optimization problems. In addition to the comparisons based on parameters such
as the mean, or the standard deviation, two different statistical tests have
been carried out. Thanks to these tests it can be affirmed that the proposed
meta-heuristic is competitive in terms of performance and conceptual
originality.

Title: Verification and Design Methods for the BrainScaleS Neuromorphic
  Hardware System
Authors: Andreas Gr\"ubl, Sebastian Billaudelle, Benjamin Cramer, Vitali

Categories: cs.AR cs.NE
Comments: 15 pages, 12 figures
\\
  This paper presents verification and implementation methods that have been
developed for the design of the BrainScaleS-2 65nm ASICs. The 2nd generation
BrainScaleS chips are mixed-signal devices with tight coupling between
full-custom analog neuromorphic circuits and two general purpose
microprocessors (PPU) with SIMD extension for on-chip learning and plasticity.
Simulation methods for automated analysis and pre-tapeout calibration of the
highly parameterizable analog neuron and synapse circuits and for
hardware-software co-development of the digital logic and software stack are
presented. Accelerated operation of neuromorphic circuits and highly-parallel
digital data buses between the full-custom neuromorphic part and the PPU
require custom methodologies to close the digital signal timing at the
interfaces. Novel extensions to the standard digital physical implementation
design flow are highlighted. We present early results from the first full-size
BrainScaleS-2 ASIC containing 512 neurons and 130K synapses, demonstrating the
successful application of these methods. An application example illustrates the
full functionality of the BrainScaleS-2 hybrid plasticity architecture.

Title: Topology and adjunction in promise constraint satisfaction

  The approximate graph colouring problem concerns colouring a $k$-colourable
graph with $c$ colours, where $c\geq k$. This problem naturally generalises to
promise graph homomorphism and further to promise constraint satisfaction
problems. Complexity analysis of all these problems is notoriously difficult.
In this paper, we introduce two new techniques to analyse the complexity of
promise CSPs: one is based on topology and the other on adjunction. We apply
these techniques, together with the previously introduced algebraic approach,
to obtain new NP-hardness results for a significant class of approximate graph
colouring and promise graph homomorphism problems.

Title: A machine learning accelerated FE$^2$ homogenization algorithm for
  elastic solids
Authors: Saumik Dana and Mary F Wheeler
Categories: cs.CE
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2002.03770
\\
  The FE$^2$ homogenization algorithm for multiscale modeling iterates between
the macroscale and the microscale (represented by a representative volume
element) till convergence is achieved at every increment of macroscale loading.
The information exchange between the two scales occurs at the gauss points of
the macroscale finite element discretization. The microscale problem is also
solved using finite elements on-the-fly thus rendering the algorithm
computationally expensive for complex microstructures. We invoke machine
learning to establish the input-output causality of the RVE boundary value
problem using a neural network framework. This renders the RVE as a blackbox
which gets the information from the macroscale as an input and gives
information back to the macroscale as output, thereby eliminating the need for
on-the-fly finite element solves at the RVE level. This framework has the
potential to significantly accelerate the FE$^2$ algorithm.

Title: An Implicit Representation of Swept Volumes based on Local Shapes and
  Movements
Authors: Cl\'ement Laroche
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  We introduce a new way to implicitly represent swept volumes in 3D. We first
implicitize the base volume and then apply the time-dependent rigid
transformation to build an implicit representation of the swept volume. This
way, we build a fitting representation, where geometric details generated by
the rigid transformation and details of the base volume itself are both taken
into account. This representation relies on a partition of a boundary box of
the swept volume according to portions of the space related either to parts of
the base volume or to time span of the transformation.

Title: XTREME: A Massively Multilingual Multi-task Benchmark for Evaluating
  Cross-lingual Generalization
Authors: Junjie Hu, Sebastian Ruder, Aditya Siddhant, Graham Neubig, Orhan
  Firat, Melvin Johnson
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Much recent progress in applications of machine learning models to NLP has
been driven by benchmarks that evaluate models across a wide variety of tasks.
However, these broad-coverage benchmarks have been mostly limited to English,
and despite an increasing interest in multilingual models, a benchmark that
enables the comprehensive evaluation of such methods on a diverse range of
languages and tasks is still missing. To this end, we introduce the
Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders XTREME benchmark, a
multi-task benchmark for evaluating the cross-lingual generalization
capabilities of multilingual representations across 40 languages and 9 tasks.
We demonstrate that while models tested on English reach human performance on
many tasks, there is still a sizable gap in the performance of cross-lingually
transferred models, particularly on syntactic and sentence retrieval tasks.
There is also a wide spread of results across languages. We release the
benchmark to encourage research on cross-lingual learning methods that transfer
linguistic knowledge across a diverse and representative set of languages and
tasks.

Title: Can Embeddings Adequately Represent Medical Terminology? New Large-Scale
  Medical Term Similarity Datasets Have the Answer!
Authors: Claudia Schulz, Damir Juric
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Accepted at AAAI 2020
\\
  A large number of embeddings trained on medical data have emerged, but it
remains unclear how well they represent medical terminology, in particular
whether the close relationship of semantically similar medical terms is encoded
in these embeddings. To date, only small datasets for testing medical term
similarity are available, not allowing to draw conclusions about the
generalisability of embeddings to the enormous amount of medical terms used by
doctors. We present multiple automatically created large-scale medical term
similarity datasets and confirm their high quality in an annotation study with
doctors. We evaluate state-of-the-art word and contextual embeddings on our new
datasets, comparing multiple vector similarity metrics and word vector
aggregation techniques. Our results show that current embeddings are limited in
their ability to adequately encode medical terms. The novel datasets thus form
a challenging new benchmark for the development of medical embeddings able to
accurately represent the whole medical terminology.

Title: Learning Syntactic and Dynamic Selective Encoding for Document
  Summarization
Authors: Haiyang Xu, Yahao He, Kun Han, Junwen Chen and Xiangang Li
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: IJCNN 2019
\\
  Text summarization aims to generate a headline or a short summary consisting
of the major information of the source text. Recent studies employ the
sequence-to-sequence framework to encode the input with a neural network and
generate abstractive summary. However, most studies feed the encoder with the
semantic word embedding but ignore the syntactic information of the text.
Further, although previous studies proposed the selective gate to control the
information flow from the encoder to the decoder, it is static during the
decoding and cannot differentiate the information based on the decoder states.
In this paper, we propose a novel neural architecture for document
summarization. Our approach has the following contributions: first, we
incorporate syntactic information such as constituency parsing trees into the
encoding sequence to learn both the semantic and syntactic information from the
document, resulting in more accurate summary; second, we propose a dynamic gate
network to select the salient information based on the context of the decoder
state, which is essential to document summarization. The proposed model has
been evaluated on CNN/Daily Mail summarization datasets and the experimental
results show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline approaches.

Title: Adversarial Multi-Binary Neural Network for Multi-class Classification
Authors: Haiyang Xu, Junwen Chen, Kun Han, Xiangang Li
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Multi-class text classification is one of the key problems in machine
learning and natural language processing. Emerging neural networks deal with
the problem using a multi-output softmax layer and achieve substantial
progress, but they do not explicitly learn the correlation among classes. In
this paper, we use a multi-task framework to address multi-class
classification, where a multi-class classifier and multiple binary classifiers
are trained together. Moreover, we employ adversarial training to distinguish
the class-specific features and the class-agnostic features. The model benefits
from better feature representation. We conduct experiments on two large-scale
multi-class text classification tasks and demonstrate that the proposed
architecture outperforms baseline approaches.

  In digital environments where substantial amounts of information are shared
online, news headlines play essential roles in the selection and diffusion of
news articles. Some news articles attract audience attention by showing
exaggerated or misleading headlines. This study addresses the \textit{headline
incongruity} problem, in which a news headline makes claims that are either
unrelated or opposite to the contents of the corresponding article. We present
\textit{BaitWatcher}, which is a lightweight web interface that guides readers
in estimating the likelihood of incongruence in news articles before clicking
on the headlines. BaitWatcher utilizes a hierarchical recurrent encoder that
efficiently learns complex textual representations of a news headline and its
associated body text. For training the model, we construct a million scale
dataset of news articles, which we also release for broader research use. Based
on the results of a focus group interview, we discuss the importance of
developing an interpretable AI agent for the design of a better interface for
mitigating the effects of online misinformation.

Title: Hurtful Words: Quantifying Biases in Clinical Contextual Word Embeddings

Categories: cs.CL cs.CY cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted at ACM CHIL 2020 (Spotlight)
\\
  In this work, we examine the extent to which embeddings may encode
marginalized populations differently, and how this may lead to a perpetuation
of biases and worsened performance on clinical tasks. We pretrain deep
embedding models (BERT) on medical notes from the MIMIC-III hospital dataset,
and quantify potential disparities using two approaches. First, we identify
dangerous latent relationships that are captured by the contextual word
embeddings using a fill-in-the-blank method with text from real clinical notes
and a log probability bias score quantification. Second, we evaluate
performance gaps across different definitions of fairness on over 50 downstream
clinical prediction tasks that include detection of acute and chronic
conditions. We find that classifiers trained from BERT representations exhibit
statistically significant differences in performance, often favoring the
majority group with regards to gender, language, ethnicity, and insurance
status. Finally, we explore shortcomings of using adversarial debiasing to
obfuscate subgroup information in contextual word embeddings, and recommend
best practices for such deep embedding models in clinical settings.

Title: Keyword-Attentive Deep Semantic Matching
Authors: Changyu Miao, Zhen Cao and Yik-Cheung Tam
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Deep Semantic Matching is a crucial component in various natural language
processing applications such as question and answering (QA), where an input
query is compared to each candidate question in a QA corpus in terms of
relevance. Measuring similarities between a query-question pair in an open
domain scenario can be challenging due to diverse word tokens in the
queryquestion pair. We propose a keyword-attentive approach to improve deep
semantic matching. We first leverage domain tags from a large corpus to
generate a domain-enhanced keyword dictionary. Built upon BERT, we stack a
keyword-attentive transformer layer to highlight the importance of keywords in
the query-question pair. During model training, we propose a new negative
sampling approach based on keyword coverage between the input pair. We evaluate
our approach on a Chinese QA corpus using various metrics, including precision
of retrieval candidates and accuracy of semantic matching. Experiments show
that our approach outperforms existing strong baselines. Our approach is
general and can be applied to other text matching tasks with little adaptation.

sentence and its structure, as defined by (Hosseini et al., 2014). We define
the function signature and extract its arguments from the text using dependency
parsing. We have a working implementation of the entire pipeline which can be

Title: Hybrid Attention-Based Transformer Block Model for Distant Supervision
  Relation Extraction
Authors: Yan Xiao, Yaochu Jina, Ran Cheng, Kuangrong Hao
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  With an exponential explosive growth of various digital text information, it
is challenging to efficiently obtain specific knowledge from massive
unstructured text information. As one basic task for natural language
processing (NLP), relation extraction aims to extract the semantic relation
between entity pairs based on the given text. To avoid manual labeling of
datasets, distant supervision relation extraction (DSRE) has been widely used,
aiming to utilize knowledge base to automatically annotate datasets.
Unfortunately, this method heavily suffers from wrong labelling due to the
underlying strong assumptions. To address this issue, we propose a new
framework using hybrid attention-based Transformer block with multi-instance
learning to perform the DSRE task. More specifically, the Transformer block is
firstly used as the sentence encoder to capture syntactic information of
sentences, which mainly utilizes multi-head self-attention to extract features
from word level. Then, a more concise sentence-level attention mechanism is
adopted to constitute the bag representation, aiming to incorporate valid
information of each sentence to effectively represent the bag. Experimental
results on the public dataset New York Times (NYT) demonstrate that the
proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms on the
evaluation dataset, which verifies the effectiveness of our model for the DSRE
task.

Title: Vector logic and counterfactuals
Authors: Eduardo Mizraji
Categories: cs.CL cs.LO
Comments: This is a 12 pages preprint
MSC-class: 03B65
ACM-class: A.m
\\
  In this work we investigate the representation of counterfactual conditionals
using the vector logic, a matrix-vectors formalism for logical functions and
truth values. With this formalism, we can describe the counterfactuals as
complex matrix operators that appear preprocessing the implication matrix with
one of the square roots of the negation, a complex matrix. This mathematical
approach puts in evidence the virtual character of the counterfactuals. The
reason of this fact, is that this representation of a counterfactual
proposition produces a valuation that is the superposition the two opposite
truth values weighted, respectively, by two complex conjugated coefficients.
This result shows that this procedure produces a uncertain evaluation projected
on the complex domain. After this basic representation, the judgment of the
plausibility of a given counterfactual allows us to shift the decision towards
an acceptance or a refusal represented by the real vectors 'true' or 'false',
and we can represent symbolically this shift applying for a second time the two
square roots of the negation.

\\
  Bias in Word Embeddings has been a subject of recent interest, along with
efforts for its reduction. Current approaches show promising progress towards
debiasing single bias dimensions such as gender or race. In this paper, we
present a joint multiclass debiasing approach that is capable of debiasing
multiple bias dimensions simultaneously. In that direction, we present two
approaches, HardWEAT and SoftWEAT, that aim to reduce biases by minimizing the
scores of the Word Embeddings Association Test (WEAT). We demonstrate the
viability of our methods by debiasing Word Embeddings on three classes of
biases (religion, gender and race) in three different publicly available word
embeddings and show that our concepts can both reduce or even completely
eliminate bias, while maintaining meaningful relationships between vectors in
word embeddings. Our work strengthens the foundation for more unbiased neural
representations of textual data.

maximizing the mutual information between text matching neural network's input
and output. We use both global and local mutual information to learn text
representations. We evaluate our text matching approach on several tasks
including natural language inference, paraphrase identification, and answer
selection. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, the experiments show
that our method integrated with mutual information estimation learns better
text representation and achieves better experimental results of text matching
tasks without exploiting pretraining on external data.

Title: Generating Major Types of Chinese Classical Poetry in a Uniformed
  Framework
Authors: Jinyi Hu, Maosong Sun
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Poetry generation is an interesting research topic in the field of text
generation. As one of the most valuable literary and cultural heritages of
China, Chinese classical poetry is very familiar and loved by Chinese people
from generation to generation. It has many particular characteristics in its
language structure, ranging from form, sound to meaning, thus is regarded as an
ideal testing task for text generation. In this paper, we propose a GPT-2 based
uniformed framework for generating major types of Chinese classical poems. We
define a unified format for formulating all types of training samples by
integrating detailed form information, then present a simple form-stressed
weighting method in GPT-2 to strengthen the control to the form of the
generated poems, with special emphasis on those forms with longer body length.
Preliminary experimental results show this enhanced model can generate Chinese
classical poems of major types with high quality in both form and content,
validating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The model has been
incorporated into Jiuge, the most influential Chinese classical poetry
generation system developed by Tsinghua University (Guo et al., 2019).

\\
  Africa has over 2000 languages. Despite this, African languages account for a
small portion of available resources and publications in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). This is due to multiple factors, including: a lack of focus
from government and funding, discoverability, a lack of community, sheer
language complexity, difficulty in reproducing papers and no benchmarks to
compare techniques. To begin to address the identified problems, MASAKHANE, an
open-source, continent-wide, distributed, online research effort for machine
translation for African languages, was founded. In this paper, we discuss our
methodology for building the community and spurring research from the African
continent, as well as outline the success of the community in terms of
addressing the identified problems affecting African NLP.

Title: Meta-CoTGAN: A Meta Cooperative Training Paradigm for Improving
  Adversarial Text Generation
Authors: Haiyan Yin, Dingcheng Li, Xu Li, Ping Li
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Training generative models that can generate high-quality text with
sufficient diversity is an important open problem for Natural Language
Generation (NLG) community. Recently, generative adversarial models have been
applied extensively on text generation tasks, where the adversarially trained
generators alleviate the exposure bias experienced by conventional maximum
likelihood approaches and result in promising generation quality. However, due
to the notorious defect of mode collapse for adversarial training, the
adversarially trained generators face a quality-diversity trade-off, i.e., the
generator models tend to sacrifice generation diversity severely for increasing
generation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which aims to
improve the performance of adversarial text generation via efficiently
decelerating mode collapse of the adversarial training. To this end, we
introduce a cooperative training paradigm, where a language model is
cooperatively trained with the generator and we utilize the language model to
efficiently shape the data distribution of the generator against mode collapse.
Moreover, instead of engaging the cooperative update for the generator in a
principled way, we formulate a meta learning mechanism, where the cooperative
update to the generator serves as a high level meta task, with an intuition of
ensuring the parameters of the generator after the adversarial update would
stay resistant against mode collapse. In the experiment, we demonstrate our
proposed approach can efficiently slow down the pace of mode collapse for the
adversarial text generators. Overall, our proposed method is able to outperform
the baseline approaches with significant margins in terms of both generation
quality and diversity in the testified domains.

\\
  There is a growing interest in creating tools to assist in clinical note
generation using the audio of provider-patient encounters. Motivated by this
goal and with the help of providers and medical scribes, we developed an
annotation scheme to extract relevant clinical concepts. We used this
annotation scheme to label a corpus of about 6k clinical encounters. This was
used to train a state-of-the-art tagging model. We report ontologies, labeling
results, model performances, and detailed analyses of the results. Our results
show that the entities related to medications can be extracted with a
relatively high accuracy of 0.90 F-score, followed by symptoms at 0.72 F-score,
and conditions at 0.57 F-score. In our task, we not only identify where the
symptoms are mentioned but also map them to canonical forms as they appear in
the clinical notes. Of the different types of errors, in about 19-38% of the
cases, we find that the model output was correct, and about 17-32% of the
errors do not impact the clinical note. Taken together, the models developed in
this work are more useful than the F-scores reflect, making it a promising
approach for practical applications.

Title: The DAO Induction Attack Against the RPL-based Internet of Things
Authors: Ahmad Shabani Baghani, Sonbol Rahimpour, and Majid Khabbazian
Categories: cs.CR cs.NI
\\
  RPL is the emerging routing standard for low power and lossy networks (LLNs).
LLN is a key component of the Internet of Things (IoT), hence its security is
imperative for the age of IoT. In this work, we present the DAO induction
attack, a novel attack against RPL. In this attack, a malicious insider or a
compromised node periodically increments its DTSN number. Each such increment
can trigger/induce a large number of control message transmissions in the
network. We show that this degrades the network performance in terms of
end-to-end latency, packet loss ratio, and power consumption. To mitigate, we
propose a lightweight solution to detect the DAO induction attack. Our solution
imposes nearly no overhead on IoT devices, which is important as these devices
are typically constrained in terms of power, memory and processing.

Title: PoisHygiene: Detecting and Mitigating Poisoning Attacks in Neural
  Networks
Authors: Junfeng Guo, Zelun Kong, Cong Liu
Categories: cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  The black-box nature of deep neural networks (DNNs) facilitates attackers to
manipulate the behavior of DNN through data poisoning. Being able to detect and
mitigate poisoning attacks, typically categorized into backdoor and adversarial
poisoning (AP), is critical in enabling safe adoption of DNNs in many
application domains. Although recent works demonstrate encouraging results on
detection of certain backdoor attacks, they exhibit inherent limitations which
may significantly constrain the applicability. Indeed, no technique exists for
detecting AP attacks, which represents a harder challenge given that such
attacks exhibit no common and explicit rules while backdoor attacks do (i.e.,
embedding backdoor triggers into poisoned data). We believe the key to detect
and mitigate AP attacks is the capability of observing and leveraging essential
poisoning-induced properties within an infected DNN model. In this paper, we
present PoisHygiene, the first effective and robust detection and mitigation
framework against AP attacks. PoisHygiene is fundamentally motivated by Dr.
Ernest Rutherford's story (i.e., the 1908 Nobel Prize winner), on observing the
structure of atom through random electron sampling.

Title: Unsupervised Learning for security of Enterprise networks by
  micro-segmentation
Authors: Mahmood Yousefi-Azar, Mohamed-Ali Kaafar, Andy Walker
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Micro-segmentation is a network security technique that requires delivering
services for each unique segment. To do so, the first stage is defining these
unique segments (a.k.a security groups) and then initializing policy-driven
security controls. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning technique
that covers both the security grouping and policy creation. For the network
asset grouping, we develop a distance-based machine learning algorithm using
the dynamic behavior of the assets. That is, after observing the entire network
logs, our unsupervised learning algorithm suggests partitioning network assets
into the groups. A key point of this un-supervised technique is that the
grouping is only generated during the training phase and remains valid during
the testing phase. The outcome of the grouping stage is then fed into the rules
(security policies) creation stage enabling to establish the security groups as
the lowest granularity of firewall rules. We conducted both quantitative and
qualitative experiments and demonstrate the good performance of our network
micro-segmentation approach. We further developed a prototype to validate the
run-time performance of our approach at scale in a real-world environment. The
hyper-parameters of our approach provides users with a flexible model to be
fine-tuned to adapt very easily with the enterprise's security governance.

Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures
\\
  In this paper we describe our experience in designing and evaluating our
graduate level computer security seminar course. In particular, our seminar is
designed with two goals in mind. First, to instil critical thinking by teaching
graduate students how to read, review and present scientific literature.
Second, to learn about the state-of-the-art in computer security and privacy
research by reviewing proceedings from one of the top four security and privacy
conferences including IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Oakland SP),
USENIX Security, Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) and
ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The course
entails each student to i) choose a specific technical session from the most
recent conference, ii) review and present three papers from the chosen session
and iii) analyze the relationship between the chosen papers from the session.
To evaluate the course, we designed a set of questions to understand the
motivation and decisions behind the students' choices as well as to evaluate
and improve the quality of the course. Our key insights from the evaluation are
the following: The three most popular topics of interest were Privacy, Web
Security and Authentication, ii) 33% of the students chose the sessions based
on the title of papers and iii) when providing an encouraging environment,
students enjoy and engage in discussions.

Title: BlockMarkchain: A Secure Decentralized Data Market with a Constant Load
  on the Blockchain
Authors: Hamidreza Ehteram, Mohammad Taha Toghani, Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 16 pages, 4 figures
\\
  In this paper, we develop BlockMarkchain, as a secure data market place,
where individual data sellers can exchange certified data with buyers, in a
secure environment, without any mutual trust among the parties, and without
trusting on a third party, as a mediator. To develop this platform, we rely on
a smart contract, deployed on a secure public blockchain. The main challenges
here are to verify the validity of data and to prevent malicious behavior of
the parties, while preserving the privacy of the data and taking into account
the limited computing and storage resources available on the blockchain. In
BlockMarkchain, the buyer has the option to dispute the honesty of the seller
and prove the invalidity of the data to the smart contract. The smart contract
evaluates the buyer's claim and punishes the dishonest party by forfeiting
his/her deposit in favor of the honest party. BlockMarkchain enjoys several
salient features including (i) the certified data has never been revealed on
the public blockchain, (ii) the size of data posted on the blockchain, the load
of computation on the blockchain, and the cost of communication with the
blockchain is constant and negligible, and (iii) the computation cost of
verifications on the parties is not expensive.

Title: Probabilistic Counters for Privacy Preserving Data Aggregation
Authors: Dominik Bojko, Krzysztof Grining, Marek Klonowski
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Probabilistic counters are well known tools often used for space-efficient
set cardinality estimation. In this paper we investigate probabilistic counters
from the perspective of preserving privacy. We use standard, rigid differential
privacy notion. The intuition is that the probabilistic counters do not reveal
too much information about individuals, but provide only general information
about the population. Thus they can be used safely without violating privacy of
individuals. It turned out however that providing a precise, formal analysis of
privacy parameters of probabilistic counters is surprisingly difficult and
needs advanced techniques and a very careful approach.
  We demonstrate also that probabilistic counters can be used as a privacy
protecion mechanism without any extra randomization. That is, the inherit
randomization from the protocol is sufficient for protecting privacy, even if
the probabilistic counter is used many times. In particular we present a
specific privacy-preserving data aggregation protocol based on a probabilistic
counter. Our results can be used for example in performing distributed surveys.

Title: FastPay: High-Performance Byzantine Fault Tolerant Settlement
Authors: Mathieu Baudet, George Danezis, Alberto Sonnino
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  FastPay allows a set of distributed authorities, some of which are Byzantine,
to maintain a high-integrity and availability settlement system for pre-funded
payments. It can be used to settle payments in a native unit of value
(crypto-currency), or as a financial side-infrastructure to support retail
payments in fiat currencies. FastPay is based on Byzantine Consistent Broadcast
as its core primitive, foregoing the expenses of full atomic commit channels
(consensus). The resulting system has low-latency for both confirmation and
payment finality. Remarkably, each authority can be sharded across many
machines to allow unbounded horizontal scalability. Our experiments demonstrate
intra-continental confirmation latency of less than 100ms, making FastPay
applicable to point of sale payments. In laboratory environments, we achieve
over 80,000 transactions per second with 20 authorities---surpassing the
requirements of current retail card payment networks, while significantly
increasing their robustness.

\\
  Contact tracing is an essential tool for public health officials and local
communities to fight the spread of novel diseases, such as for the COVID-19
pandemic. The Singaporean government just released a mobile phone app,
TraceTogether, that is designed to assist health officials in tracking down
exposures after an infected individual is identified. However, there are
important privacy implications of the existence of such tracking apps. Here, we
analyze some of those implications and discuss ways of ameliorating the privacy
concerns without decreasing usefulness to public health. We hope in writing
this document to ensure that privacy is a central feature of conversations
surrounding mobile contact tracing apps and to encourage community efforts to
develop alternative effective solutions with stronger privacy protection for
the users. Importantly, though we discuss potential modifications, this
document is not meant as a formal research paper, but instead is a response to
some of the privacy characteristics of direct contact tracing apps like
TraceTogether and an early-stage Request for Comments to the community.

  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are successful in many computer vision tasks.
However, the most accurate DNNs require millions of parameters and operations,
making them energy, computation and memory intensive. This impedes the
deployment of large DNNs in low-power devices with limited compute resources.
Recent research improves DNN models by reducing the memory requirement, energy
consumption, and number of operations without significantly decreasing the
accuracy. This paper surveys the progress of low-power deep learning and
computer vision, specifically in regards to inference, and discusses the
methods for compacting and accelerating DNN models. The techniques can be
divided into four major categories: (1) parameter quantization and pruning, (2)
compressed convolutional filters and matrix factorization, (3) network
architecture search, and (4) knowledge distillation. We analyze the accuracy,
advantages, disadvantages, and potential solutions to the problems with the
techniques in each category. We also discuss new evaluation metrics as a
guideline for future research.

Title: Bootstrapping Weakly Supervised Segmentation-free Word Spotting through
  HMM-based Alignment
Authors: Tomas Wilkinson and Carl Nettelblad
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent work in word spotting in handwritten documents has yielded impressive
results. This progress has largely been made by supervised learning systems,
which are dependent on manually annotated data, making deployment to new
collections a significant effort. In this paper, we propose an approach that
utilises transcripts without bounding box annotations to train
segmentation-free query-by-string word spotting models, given a partially
trained model. This is done through a training-free alignment procedure based
on hidden Markov models. This procedure creates a tentative mapping between
word region proposals and the transcriptions to automatically create additional
weakly annotated training data, without choosing any single alignment
possibility as the correct one. When only using between 1% and 7% of the fully
annotated training sets for partial convergence, we automatically annotate the
remaining training data and successfully train using it. On all our datasets,
our final trained model then comes within a few mAP% of the performance from a
model trained with the full training set used as ground truth. We believe that
this will be a significant advance towards a more general use of word spotting,
since digital transcription data will already exist for parts of many
collections of interest.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 11 figures, accepted in CVPR 2020
\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel real-time 6D object pose estimation
framework, named G2L-Net. Our network operates on point clouds from RGB-D
detection in a divide-and-conquer fashion. Specifically, our network consists
of three steps. First, we extract the coarse object point cloud from the RGB-D
image by 2D detection. Second, we feed the coarse object point cloud to a
translation localization network to perform 3D segmentation and object
translation prediction. Third, via the predicted segmentation and translation,
we transfer the fine object point cloud into a local canonical coordinate, in
which we train a rotation localization network to estimate initial object
rotation. In the third step, we define point-wise embedding vector features to
capture viewpoint-aware information. In order to calculate more accurate
rotation, we adopt a rotation residual estimator to estimate the residual
between initial rotation and ground truth, which can boost initial pose
estimation performance. Our proposed G2L-Net is real-time despite the fact
multiple steps are stacked. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of
both accuracy and speed.

Title: PADS: Policy-Adapted Sampling for Visual Similarity Learning
Authors: Karsten Roth, Timo Milbich, Bj\"orn Ommer
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR2020
\\
  Learning visual similarity requires to learn relations, typically between
triplets of images. Albeit triplet approaches being powerful, their
computational complexity mostly limits training to only a subset of all
possible training triplets. Thus, sampling strategies that decide when to use
which training sample during learning are crucial. Currently, the prominent
paradigm are fixed or curriculum sampling strategies that are predefined before
training starts. However, the problem truly calls for a sampling process that
adjusts based on the actual state of the similarity representation during
training. We, therefore, employ reinforcement learning and have a teacher
network adjust the sampling distribution based on the current state of the
learner network, which represents visual similarity. Experiments on benchmark
datasets using standard triplet-based losses show that our adaptive sampling
strategy significantly outperforms fixed sampling strategies. Moreover,
although our adaptive sampling is only applied on top of basic triplet-learning
frameworks, we reach competitive results to state-of-the-art approaches that
employ diverse additional learning signals or strong ensemble architectures.

  Deep learning has been applied to achieve significant progress in emotion
recognition. Despite such substantial progress, existing approaches are still
hindered by insufficient training data, and the resulting models do not
generalize well under mismatched conditions. To address this challenge, we
propose a learning strategy which jointly transfers the knowledge learned from
rich datasets to source-poor datasets. Our method is also able to learn
cross-domain features which lead to improved recognition performance. To
demonstrate the robustness of our proposed framework, we conducted experiments

Experimental results show that the proposed method surpassed state-of-the-art
transfer learning schemes by a significant margin.

become a popular strategy to rank the relative quality of different
architectures (child models) using a single set of shared weights. However,
while one-shot model weights can effectively rank different network
architectures, the absolute accuracies from these shared weights are typically
far below those obtained from stand-alone training. To compensate, existing
methods assume that the weights must be retrained, finetuned, or otherwise
post-processed after the search is completed. These steps significantly
increase the compute requirements and complexity of the architecture search and
model deployment. In this work, we propose BigNAS, an approach that challenges
the conventional wisdom that post-processing of the weights is necessary to get
good prediction accuracies. Without extra retraining or post-processing steps,
we are able to train a single set of shared weights on ImageNet and use these
weights to obtain child models whose sizes range from 200 to 1000 MFLOPs. Our
discovered model family, BigNASModels, achieve top-1 accuracies ranging from
76.5% to 80.9%, surpassing state-of-the-art models in this range including
EfficientNets and Once-for-All networks without extra retraining or
post-processing. We present ablative study and analysis to further understand
the proposed BigNASModels.

Title: Adversarial Light Projection Attacks on Face Recognition Systems: A
  Feasibility Study
Authors: Luan Nguyen and Sunpreet S. Arora and Yuhang Wu and Hao Yang
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Deep learning-based systems have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
attacks in both digital and physical domains. While feasible, digital attacks
have limited applicability in attacking deployed systems, including face
recognition systems, where an adversary typically has access to the input and
not the transmission channel. In such setting, physical attacks that directly
provide a malicious input through the input channel pose a bigger threat. We
investigate the feasibility of conducting real-time physical attacks on face
recognition systems using adversarial light projections. A setup comprising a
commercially available web camera and a projector is used to conduct the
attack. The adversary uses a transformation-invariant adversarial pattern
generation method to generate a digital adversarial pattern using one or more
images of the target available to the adversary. The digital adversarial
pattern is then projected onto the adversary's face in the physical domain to
either impersonate a target (impersonation) or evade recognition (obfuscation).
We conduct preliminary experiments using two open-source and one commercial
face recognition system on a pool of 50 subjects. Our experimental results
demonstrate the vulnerability of face recognition systems to light projection
attacks in both white-box and black-box attack settings.

Title: A Systematic Evaluation: Fine-Grained CNN vs. Traditional CNN
  Classifiers
Authors: Saeed Anwar, Nick Barnes and Lars Petersson
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  To make the best use of the underlying minute and subtle differences,
fine-grained classifiers collect information about inter-class variations. The
task is very challenging due to the small differences between the colors,
viewpoint, and structure in the same class entities. The classification becomes
more difficult due to the similarities between the differences in viewpoint
with other classes and differences with its own. In this work, we investigate
the performance of the landmark general CNN classifiers, which presented
top-notch results on large scale classification datasets, on the fine-grained
datasets, and compare it against state-of-the-art fine-grained classifiers. In
this paper, we pose two specific questions: (i) Do the general CNN classifiers
achieve comparable results to fine-grained classifiers? (ii) Do general CNN
classifiers require any specific information to improve upon the fine-grained
ones? Throughout this work, we train the general CNN classifiers without
introducing any aspect that is specific to fine-grained datasets. We show an
extensive evaluation on six datasets to determine whether the fine-grained
classifier is able to elevate the baseline in their experiments.

Title: Fusing Wearable IMUs with Multi-View Images for Human Pose Estimation: A
  Geometric Approach
Authors: Zhe Zhang, Chunyu Wang, Wenhu Qin, Wenjun Zeng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR 2020. Code will be released at
  https://github.com/microsoft/imu-human-pose-estimation-pytorch
\\
  We propose to estimate 3D human pose from multi-view images and a few IMUs
attached at person's limbs. It operates by firstly detecting 2D poses from the
two signals, and then lifting them to the 3D space. We present a geometric
approach to reinforce the visual features of each pair of joints based on the
IMUs. This notably improves 2D pose estimation accuracy especially when one
joint is occluded. We call this approach Orientation Regularized Network (ORN).
Then we lift the multi-view 2D poses to the 3D space by an Orientation
Regularized Pictorial Structure Model (ORPSM) which jointly minimizes the
projection error between the 3D and 2D poses, along with the discrepancy
between the 3D pose and IMU orientations. The simple two-step approach reduces
the error of the state-of-the-art by a large margin on a public dataset. Our
code will be released at

\\
  With the mass-market adoption of dual-camera mobile phones, leveraging stereo
information in computer vision has become increasingly important. Current
state-of-the-art methods utilize learning-based algorithms, where the amount
and quality of training samples heavily influence results. Existing stereo
image datasets are limited either in size or subject variety. Hence, algorithms
trained on such datasets do not generalize well to scenarios encountered in
mobile photography. We present Holopix50k, a novel in-the-wild stereo image
dataset, comprising 49,368 image pairs contributed by users of the Holopix
mobile social platform. In this work, we describe our data collection process
and statistically compare our dataset to other popular stereo datasets. We
experimentally show that using our dataset significantly improves results for
tasks such as stereo super-resolution and self-supervised monocular depth
estimation. Finally, we showcase practical applications of our dataset to
motivate novel works and use cases. The Holopix50k dataset is available at

Title: Prior-enlightened and Motion-robust Video Deblurring
Authors: Ya Zhou, Jianfeng Xu, Kazuyuki Tasakab, Zhibo Chen, Weiping Li
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: 26 pages, 13 figures, and 7 tables
\\
  Various blur distortions in video will cause negative impact on both human
viewing and video-based applications, which makes motion-robust deblurring
methods urgently needed. Most existing works have strong dataset dependency and
limited generalization ability in handling challenging scenarios, like blur in
low contrast or severe motion areas, and non-uniform blur. Therefore, we
propose a PRiOr-enlightened and MOTION-robust video deblurring model
(PROMOTION) suitable for challenging blurs. On the one hand, we use 3D group
convolution to efficiently encode heterogeneous prior information, explicitly
enhancing the scenes' perception while mitigating the output's artifacts. On
the other hand, we design the priors representing blur distribution, to better
handle non-uniform blur in spatio-temporal domain. Besides the classical camera
shake caused global blurry, we also prove the generalization for the downstream
task suffering from local blur. Extensive experiments demonstrate we can
achieve the state-of-the-art performance on well-known REDS and GoPro datasets,
and bring machine task gain.

Title: Two-stage Discriminative Re-ranking for Large-scale Landmark Retrieval
Authors: Shuhei Yokoo, Kohei Ozaki, Edgar Simo-Serra, and Satoshi Iizuka
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We propose an efficient pipeline for large-scale landmark image retrieval
that addresses the diversity of the dataset through two-stage discriminative
re-ranking. Our approach is based on embedding the images in a feature-space
using a convolutional neural network trained with a cosine softmax loss. Due to
the variance of the images, which include extreme viewpoint changes such as
having to retrieve images of the exterior of a landmark from images of the
interior, this is very challenging for approaches based exclusively on visual
similarity. Our proposed re-ranking approach improves the results in two steps:
in the sort-step, $k$-nearest neighbor search with soft-voting to sort the
retrieved results based on their label similarity to the query images, and in
the insert-step, we add additional samples from the dataset that were not
retrieved by image-similarity. This approach allows overcoming the low visual
diversity in retrieved images. In-depth experimental results show that the
proposed approach significantly outperforms existing approaches on the
challenging Google Landmarks Datasets. Using our methods, we achieved 1st place
in the Google Landmark Retrieval 2019 challenge and 3rd place in the Google
Landmark Recognition 2019 challenge on Kaggle. Our code is publicly available

Title: A New Multiple Max-pooling Integration Module and Cross Multiscale
  Deconvolution Network Based on Image Semantic Segmentation
Authors: Hongfeng You, Shengwei Tian, Long Yu, Xiang Ma, Yan Xing and Ning Xin
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  To better retain the deep features of an image and solve the sparsity problem
of the end-to-end segmentation model, we propose a new deep convolutional
network model for medical image pixel segmentation, called MC-Net. The core of
this network model consists of four parts, namely, an encoder network, a
multiple max-pooling integration module, a cross multiscale deconvolution
decoder network and a pixel-level classification layer. In the network
structure of the encoder, we use multiscale convolution instead of the
traditional single-channel convolution. The multiple max-pooling integration
module first integrates the output features of each submodule of the encoder
network and reduces the number of parameters by convolution using a kernel size
of 1. At the same time, each max-pooling layer (the pooling size of each layer
is different) is spliced after each convolution to achieve the translation
invariance of the feature maps of each submodule. We use the output feature
maps from the multiple max-pooling integration module as the input of the
decoder network; the multiscale convolution of each submodule in the decoder
network is cross-fused with the feature maps generated by the corresponding
multiscale convolution in the encoder network. Using the above feature map
processing methods solves the sparsity problem after the max-pooling
layer-generating matrix and enhances the robustness of the classification. We
compare our proposed model with the well-known Fully Convolutional Networks for
Semantic Segmentation (FCNs), DecovNet, PSPNet, U-net, SgeNet and other
state-of-the-art segmentation networks such as HyperDenseNet, MS-Dual,
Espnetv2, Denseaspp using one binary Kaggle 2018 data science bowl dataset and
two multiclass dataset and obtain encouraging experimental results.

  In this paper, we propose a novel Automatic and Scalable Face Detector
(ASFD), which is based on a combination of neural architecture search
techniques as well as a new loss design. First, we propose an automatic feature
enhance module named Auto-FEM by improved differential architecture search,
which allows efficient multi-scale feature fusion and context enhancement.
Second, we use Distance-based Regression and Margin-based Classification (DRMC)
multi-task loss to predict accurate bounding boxes and learn highly
discriminative deep features. Third, we adopt compound scaling methods and
uniformly scale the backbone, feature modules, and head networks to develop a
family of ASFD, which are consistently more efficient than the state-of-the-art
face detectors. Extensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks, e.g.
WIDER FACE and FDDB, demonstrate that our ASFD-D6 outperforms the prior strong
competitors, and our lightweight ASFD-D0 runs at more than 120 FPS with
Mobilenet for VGA-resolution images.

Title: GreedyNAS: Towards Fast One-Shot NAS with Greedy Supernet
Authors: Shan You, Tao Huang, Mingmin Yang, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, Changshui

Categories: cs.CV cs.NE
Comments: To appear in CVPR 2020
\\
  Training a supernet matters for one-shot neural architecture search (NAS)
methods since it serves as a basic performance estimator for different
architectures (paths). Current methods mainly hold the assumption that a
supernet should give a reasonable ranking over all paths. They thus treat all
paths equally, and spare much effort to train paths. However, it is harsh for a
single supernet to evaluate accurately on such a huge-scale search space (e.g.,
$7^{21}$). In this paper, instead of covering all paths, we ease the burden of
supernet by encouraging it to focus more on evaluation of those
potentially-good ones, which are identified using a surrogate portion of
validation data. Concretely, during training, we propose a multi-path sampling
strategy with rejection, and greedily filter the weak paths. The training
efficiency is thus boosted since the training space has been greedily shrunk
from all paths to those potentially-good ones. Moreover, we further adopt an
exploration and exploitation policy by introducing an empirical candidate path
pool. Our proposed method GreedyNAS is easy-to-follow, and experimental results
on ImageNet dataset indicate that it can achieve better Top-1 accuracy under
same search space and FLOPs or latency level, but with only $\sim$60\% of
supernet training cost. By searching on a larger space, our GreedyNAS can also
obtain new state-of-the-art architectures.

Title: What Deep CNNs Benefit from Global Covariance Pooling: An Optimization
  Perspective

Categories: cs.CV

\\
  Recent works have demonstrated that global covariance pooling (GCP) has the
ability to improve performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on
visual classification task. Despite considerable advance, the reasons on
effectiveness of GCP on deep CNNs have not been well studied. In this paper, we
make an attempt to understand what deep CNNs benefit from GCP in a viewpoint of
optimization. Specifically, we explore the effect of GCP on deep CNNs in terms
of the Lipschitzness of optimization loss and the predictiveness of gradients,
and show that GCP can make the optimization landscape more smooth and the
gradients more predictive. Furthermore, we discuss the connection between GCP
and second-order optimization for deep CNNs. More importantly, above findings
can account for several merits of covariance pooling for training deep CNNs
that have not been recognized previously or fully explored, including
significant acceleration of network convergence (i.e., the networks trained
with GCP can support rapid decay of learning rates, achieving favorable
performance while significantly reducing number of training epochs), stronger
robustness to distorted examples generated by image corruptions and
perturbations, and good generalization ability to different vision tasks, e.g.,
object detection and instance segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments
using various deep CNN models on diversified tasks, and the results provide
strong support to our findings.

Title: VaB-AL: Incorporating Class Imbalance and Difficulty with Variational
  Bayes for Active Learning
Authors: Jongwon Choi, Kwang Moo Yi, Jihoon Kim, Jincho Choo, Byoungjip Kim,
  Jin-Yeop Chang, Youngjune Gwon, Hyung Jin Chang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Active Learning for discriminative models has largely been studied with the
focus on individual samples, with less emphasis on how classes are distributed
or which classes are hard to deal with. In this work, we show that this is
harmful. We propose a method based on the Bayes' rule, that can naturally
incorporate class imbalance into the Active Learning framework. We derive that
three terms should be considered together when estimating the probability of a
classifier making a mistake for a given sample; i) probability of mislabelling
a class, ii) likelihood of the data given a predicted class, and iii) the prior
probability on the abundance of a predicted class. Implementing these terms
requires a generative model and an intractable likelihood estimation.
Therefore, we train a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) for this purpose. To
further tie the VAE with the classifier and facilitate VAE training, we use the
classifiers' deep feature representations as input to the VAE. By considering
all three probabilities, among them especially the data imbalance, we can
substantially improve the potential of existing methods under limited data
budget. We show that our method can be applied to classification tasks on
multiple different datasets -- including one that is a real-world dataset with
heavy data imbalance -- significantly outperforming the state of the art.

Title: Multiscale Sparsifying Transform Learning for Image Denoising
Authors: Ashkan Abbasi, Amirhassan Monadjemi, Leyuan Fang, Hossein Rabbani,

Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image
  Processing at 03/25/2020
\\
  The data-driven sparse methods such as synthesis dictionary learning and
sparsifying transform learning have been proven to be effective in image
denoising. However, these methods are intrinsically single-scale, which ignores
the multiscale nature of images. This often leads to suboptimal results. In
this paper, we propose several strategies to exploit multiscale information in
image denoising through the sparsifying transform learning denoising (TLD)
method. To this end, we first employ a simple method of denoising each wavelet
subband independently via TLD. Then, we show that this method can be greatly
enhanced using wavelet subbands mixing, which is a cheap fusion technique, to
combine the results of single-scale and multiscale methods. Finally, we remove
the need for denoising detail subbands. This simplification leads to an
efficient multiscale denoising method with competitive performance to its
baseline. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are experimentally shown
over two datasets: 1) classic test images corrupted with Gaussian noise, and 2)
fluorescence microscopy images corrupted with real Poisson-Gaussian noise. The
proposed multiscale methods improve over the single-scale baseline method by an
average of about 0.2 dB (in terms of PSNR) for removing synthetic Gaussian
noise form classic test images and real Poisson-Gaussian noise from microscopy
images, respectively. Interestingly, the proposed multiscale methods keep their
superiority over the baseline even when noise is relatively weak. More
importantly, we show that the proposed methods lead to visually pleasing
results, in which edges and textures are better recovered. Extensive
experiments over these two different datasets show that the proposed methods
offer a good trade-off between performance and complexity.

Comments: In CVPR 2020
\\
  Scene Text Recognition (STR), the task of recognizing text against complex
image backgrounds, is an active area of research. Current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods still struggle to recognize text written in arbitrary shapes. In
this paper, we introduce a novel architecture for STR, named Selective Context
ATtentional Text Recognizer (SCATTER). SCATTER utilizes a stacked block
architecture with intermediate supervision during training, that paves the way
to successfully train a deep BiLSTM encoder, thus improving the encoding of
contextual dependencies. Decoding is done using a two-step 1D attention
mechanism. The first attention step re-weights visual features from a CNN
backbone together with contextual features computed by a BiLSTM layer. The
second attention step, similar to previous papers, treats the features as a
sequence and attends to the intra-sequence relationships. Experiments show that
the proposed approach surpasses SOTA performance on irregular text recognition
benchmarks by 3.7\% on average.

Title: A Unified Object Motion and Affinity Model for Online Multi-Object
  Tracking
Authors: Junbo Yin, Wenguan Wang, Qinghao Meng, Ruigang Yang, Jianbing Shen
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2020. Code: https://github.com/yinjunbo/UMA-MOT
\\
  Current popular online multi-object tracking (MOT) solutions apply single
object trackers (SOTs) to capture object motions, while often requiring an
extra affinity network to associate objects, especially for the occluded ones.
This brings extra computational overhead due to repetitive feature extraction
for SOT and affinity computation. Meanwhile, the model size of the
sophisticated affinity network is usually non-trivial. In this paper, we
propose a novel MOT framework that unifies object motion and affinity model
into a single network, named UMA, in order to learn a compact feature that is
discriminative for both object motion and affinity measure. In particular, UMA
integrates single object tracking and metric learning into a unified triplet
network by means of multi-task learning. Such design brings advantages of
improved computation efficiency, low memory requirement and simplified training
procedure. In addition, we equip our model with a task-specific attention
module, which is used to boost task-aware feature learning. The proposed UMA
can be easily trained end-to-end, and is elegant - requiring only one training
stage. Experimental results show that it achieves promising performance on
several MOT Challenge benchmarks.

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: CVPR 2020
\\
  Existing techniques to encode spatial invariance within deep convolutional
neural networks only model 2D transformation fields. This does not account for
the fact that objects in a 2D space are a projection of 3D ones, and thus they
have limited ability to severe object viewpoint changes. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce a learnable module, cylindrical convolutional networks
(CCNs), that exploit cylindrical representation of a convolutional kernel
defined in the 3D space. CCNs extract a view-specific feature through a
view-specific convolutional kernel to predict object category scores at each
viewpoint. With the view-specific feature, we simultaneously determine
objective category and viewpoints using the proposed sinusoidal soft-argmax
module. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the cylindrical
convolutional networks on joint object detection and viewpoint estimation.

Title: DCDLearn: Multi-order Deep Cross-distance Learning for Vehicle
  Re-Identification
Authors: Rixing Zhu, Jianwu Fang, Hongke Xu, Hongkai Yu, Jianru Xue
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) has become a popular research topic owing
to its practicability in intelligent transportation systems. Vehicle Re-ID
suffers the numerous challenges caused by drastic variation in illumination,
occlusions, background, resolutions, viewing angles, and so on. To address it,
this paper formulates a multi-order deep cross-distance learning
(\textbf{DCDLearn}) model for vehicle re-identification, where an efficient
one-view CycleGAN model is developed to alleviate exhaustive and enumerative
cross-camera matching problem in previous works and smooth the domain
discrepancy of cross cameras. Specially, we treat the transferred images and
the reconstructed images generated by one-view CycleGAN as multi-order
augmented data for deep cross-distance learning, where the cross distances of
multi-order image set with distinct identities are learned by optimizing an
objective function with multi-order augmented triplet loss and center loss to
achieve the camera-invariance and identity-consistency. Extensive experiments
on three vehicle Re-ID datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
significant improvement over the state-of-the-arts, especially for the small
scale dataset.

Title: SPFCN: Select and Prune the Fully Convolutional Networks for Real-time
  Parking Slot Detection

\\
  For passenger cars equipped with automatic parking function, convolutional
neural networks are employed to detect parking slots on the panoramic surround

which leverages deep convolutional networks for the faster speed and smaller
model while keep the accuracy by simultaneously training and pruning it. To
achieve the optimal trade-off, we developed a strategy to select the best
receptive fields and prune the redundant channels automatically during
training. The proposed model is capable of jointly detecting corners and line
features of parking slots while running efficiently in real time on average
CPU. Even without any specific computing devices, the model outperforms
existing counterparts, at a frame rate of about 30 FPS on a 2.3 GHz CPU core,
getting parking slot corner localization error of 1.51$\pm$2.14 cm (std. err.)
and slot detection accuracy of 98\%, generally satisfying the requirements in
both speed and accuracy on on-board mobile terminals.

Title: Data Uncertainty Learning in Face Recognition
Authors: Jie Chang, Zhonghao Lan, Changmao Cheng, Yichen Wei
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted as poster by CVPR2020
\\
  Modeling data uncertainty is important for noisy images, but seldom explored
for face recognition. The pioneer work, PFE, considers uncertainty by modeling
each face image embedding as a Gaussian distribution. It is quite effective.
However, it uses fixed feature (mean of the Gaussian) from an existing model.
It only estimates the variance and relies on an ad-hoc and costly metric. Thus,
it is not easy to use. It is unclear how uncertainty affects feature learning.
  This work applies data uncertainty learning to face recognition, such that
the feature (mean) and uncertainty (variance) are learnt simultaneously, for
the first time. Two learning methods are proposed. They are easy to use and
outperform existing deterministic methods as well as PFE on challenging
unconstrained scenarios. We also provide insightful analysis on how
incorporating uncertainty estimation helps reducing the adverse effects of
noisy samples and affects the feature learning.

Title: Circumventing Outliers of AutoAugment with Knowledge Distillation
Authors: Longhui Wei, An Xiao, Lingxi Xie, Xin Chen, Xiaopeng Zhang, Qi Tian
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 18 pages, 4 figures
\\
  AutoAugment has been a powerful algorithm that improves the accuracy of many
vision tasks, yet it is sensitive to the operator space as well as
hyper-parameters, and an improper setting may degenerate network optimization.
This paper delves deep into the working mechanism, and reveals that AutoAugment
may remove part of discriminative information from the training image and so
insisting on the ground-truth label is no longer the best option. To relieve
the inaccuracy of supervision, we make use of knowledge distillation that
refers to the output of a teacher model to guide network training. Experiments
are performed in standard image classification benchmarks, and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in suppressing noise of data augmentation and
stabilizing training. Upon the cooperation of knowledge distillation and
AutoAugment, we claim the new state-of-the-art on ImageNet classification with
a top-1 accuracy of 85.8%.

Title: Fisheye Distortion Rectification from Deep Straight Lines
Authors: Zhu-Cun Xue, Nan Xue, Gui-Song Xia
Categories: cs.CV
ACM-class: I.4.1
\\
  This paper presents a novel line-aware rectification network (LaRecNet) to
address the problem of fisheye distortion rectification based on the classical
observation that straight lines in 3D space should be still straight in image
planes. Specifically, the proposed LaRecNet contains three sequential modules
to (1) learn the distorted straight lines from fisheye images; (2) estimate the
distortion parameters from the learned heatmaps and the image appearance; and
(3) rectify the input images via a proposed differentiable rectification layer.
To better train and evaluate the proposed model, we create a synthetic
line-rich fisheye (SLF) dataset that contains the distortion parameters and
well-annotated distorted straight lines of fisheye images. The proposed method
enables us to simultaneously calibrate the geometric distortion parameters and
rectify fisheye images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both geometric accuracy and
image quality on several evaluation metrics. In particular, the images
rectified by LaRecNet achieve an average reprojection error of 0.33 pixels on
the SLF dataset and produce the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and
structure similarity index (SSIM) compared with the groundtruth.

Title: PiP: Planning-informed Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving
Authors: Haoran Song, Wenchao Ding, Yuxuan Chen, Shaojie Shen, Michael Yu Wang,
  Qifeng Chen
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  It is critical to predict the motion of surrounding vehicles for self-driving
planning, especially in a socially compliant and flexible way. However, future
prediction is challenging due to the interaction and uncertainty in driving
behaviors. We propose planning-informed trajectory prediction (PiP) to tackle
the prediction problem in the multi-agent setting. Our approach is
differentiated from the traditional manner of prediction, which is only based
on historical information and decoupled with planning. By informing the
prediction process with the planning of ego vehicle, our method achieves the
state-of-the-art performance of multi-agent forecasting on highway datasets.
Moreover, our approach enables a novel pipeline which couples the prediction
and planning, by conditioning PiP on multiple candidate trajectories of the ego
vehicle, which is highly beneficial for autonomous driving in interactive
scenarios.

Title: Improved Techniques for Training Single-Image GANs
Authors: Tobias Hinz, Matthew Fisher, Oliver Wang, Stefan Wermter
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Code available at https://github.com/tohinz/ConSinGAN
\\
  Recently there has been an interest in the potential of learning generative
models from a single image, as opposed to from a large dataset. This task is of
practical significance, as it means that generative models can be used in
domains where collecting a large dataset is not feasible. However, training a
model capable of generating realistic images from only a single sample is a
difficult problem. In this work, we conduct a number of experiments to
understand the challenges of training these methods and propose some best
practices that we found allowed us to generate improved results over previous
work in this space. One key piece is that unlike prior single image generation
methods, we concurrently train several stages in a sequential multi-stage
manner, allowing us to learn models with fewer stages of increasing image
resolution. Compared to a recent state of the art baseline, our model is up to
six times faster to train, has fewer parameters, and can better capture the
global structure of images.

Title: Training Binary Neural Networks with Real-to-Binary Convolutions
Authors: Brais Martinez and Jing Yang and Adrian Bulat and Georgios
  Tzimiropoulos
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  This paper shows how to train binary networks to within a few percent points
($\sim 3-5 \%$) of the full precision counterpart. We first show how to build a
strong baseline, which already achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, by combining
recently proposed advances and carefully adjusting the optimization procedure.
Secondly, we show that by attempting to minimize the discrepancy between the
output of the binary and the corresponding real-valued convolution, additional
significant accuracy gains can be obtained. We materialize this idea in two
complementary ways: (1) with a loss function, during training, by matching the
spatial attention maps computed at the output of the binary and real-valued
convolutions, and (2) in a data-driven manner, by using the real-valued
activations, available during inference prior to the binarization process, for
re-scaling the activations right after the binary convolution. Finally, we show
that, when putting all of our improvements together, the proposed model beats
the current state of the art by more than 5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and
reduces the gap to its real-valued counterpart to less than 3% and 5% top-1
accuracy on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet respectively when using a ResNet-18
architecture. Code available at https://github.com/brais-martinez/real2binary.

Title: HP2IFS: Head Pose estimation exploiting Partitioned Iterated Function
  Systems
Authors: Carmen Bisogni, Michele Nappi, Chiara Pero and Stefano Ricciardi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Estimating the actual head orientation from 2D images, with regard to its
three degrees of freedom, is a well known problem that is highly significant
for a large number of applications involving head pose knowledge. Consequently,
this topic has been tackled by a plethora of methods and algorithms the most
part of which exploits neural networks. Machine learning methods, indeed,
achieve accurate head rotation values yet require an adequate training stage
and, to that aim, a relevant number of positive and negative examples. In this
paper we take a different approach to this topic by using fractal coding theory
and particularly Partitioned Iterated Function Systems to extract the fractal
code from the input head image and to compare this representation to the
fractal code of a reference model through Hamming distance. According to
experiments conducted on both the BIWI and the AFLW2000 databases, the proposed
PIFS based head pose estimation method provides accurate yaw/pitch/roll angular
values, with a performance approaching that of state of the art of
machine-learning based algorithms and exceeding most of non-training based
approaches.

\\
  The focus of recent meta-learning research has been on the development of
learning algorithms that can quickly adapt to test time tasks with limited data
and low computational cost. Few-shot learning is widely used as one of the
standard benchmarks in meta-learning. In this work, we show that a simple
baseline: learning a supervised or self-supervised representation on the
meta-training set, followed by training a linear classifier on top of this
representation, outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods. An
additional boost can be achieved through the use of self-distillation. This
demonstrates that using a good learned embedding model can be more effective
than sophisticated meta-learning algorithms. We believe that our findings
motivate a rethinking of few-shot image classification benchmarks and the
associated role of meta-learning algorithms. Code is available at:

Authors: Goutam Bhat, Felix J\"aremo Lawin, Martin Danelljan, Andreas Robinson,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: First two authors contributed equally
\\
  Video object segmentation (VOS) is a highly challenging problem, since the
target object is only defined during inference with a given first-frame
reference mask. The problem of how to capture and utilize this limited target
information remains a fundamental research question. We address this by
introducing an end-to-end trainable VOS architecture that integrates a
differentiable few-shot learning module. This internal learner is designed to
predict a powerful parametric model of the target by minimizing a segmentation
error in the first frame. We further go beyond standard few-shot learning
techniques by learning what the few-shot learner should learn. This allows us
to achieve a rich internal representation of the target in the current frame,
significantly increasing the segmentation accuracy of our approach. We perform
extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art on the large-scale YouTube-VOS 2018 dataset by achieving an
overall score of 81.5, corresponding to a 2.6% relative improvement over the
previous best result.

Title: AI loyalty: A New Paradigm for Aligning Stakeholder Interests
Authors: Anthony Aguirre, Gaia Dempsey, Harry Surden, and Peter B. Reiner
Categories: cs.CY
ACM-class: K.4
\\
  When we consult with a doctor, lawyer, or financial advisor, we generally
assume that they are acting in our best interests. But what should we assume
when it is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is acting on our behalf?
Early examples of AI assistants like Alexa, Siri, Google, and Cortana already
serve as a key interface between consumers and information on the web, and
users routinely rely upon AI-driven systems like these to take automated
actions or provide information. Superficially, such systems may appear to be
acting according to user interests. However, many AI systems are designed with
embedded conflicts of interests, acting in ways that subtly benefit their
creators (or funders) at the expense of users. To address this problem, in this
paper we introduce the concept of AI loyalty. AI systems are loyal to the
degree that they are designed to minimize, and make transparent, conflicts of
interest, and to act in ways that prioritize the interests of users. Properly
designed, such systems could have considerable functional and competitive - not
to mention ethical - advantages relative to those that do not. Loyal AI
products hold an obvious appeal for the end-user and could serve to promote the
alignment of the long-term interests of AI developers and customers. To this
end, we suggest criteria for assessing whether an AI system is sufficiently
transparent about conflicts of interest, and acting in a manner that is loyal
to the user, and argue that AI loyalty should be considered during the
technological design process alongside other important values in AI ethics such
as fairness, accountability privacy, and equity. We discuss a range of
mechanisms, from pure market forces to strong regulatory frameworks, that could
support incorporation of AI loyalty into a variety of future AI systems.

Title: Artificial Intelligence for EU Decision-Making. Effects on Citizens
  Perceptions of Input, Throughput and Output Legitimacy
Authors: Christopher Starke, Marco Luenich
Categories: cs.CY cs.HC
\\
  A lack of political legitimacy undermines the ability of the European Union
to resolve major crises and threatens the stability of the system as a whole.
By integrating digital data into political processes, the EU seeks to base
decision-making increasingly on sound empirical evidence. In particular,
artificial intelligence systems have the potential to increase political
legitimacy by identifying pressing societal issues, forecasting potential
policy outcomes, informing the policy process, and evaluating policy
effectiveness. This paper investigates how citizens perceptions of EU input,
throughput, and output legitimacy are influenced by three distinct
decision-making arrangements. First, independent human decision-making, HDM,
Second, independent algorithmic decision-making, ADM, and, third, hybrid
decision-making by EU politicians and AI-based systems together. The results of
a pre-registered online experiment with 572 respondents suggest that existing
EU decision-making arrangements are still perceived as the most democratic -
input legitimacy. However, regarding the decision-making process itself -
throughput legitimacy - and its policy outcomes - output legitimacy, no
difference was observed between the status quo and hybrid decision-making
involving both ADM and democratically elected EU institutions. Where ADM
systems are the sole decision-maker, respondents tend to perceive these as
illegitimate. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for EU
legitimacy and data-driven policy-making.

principle of minimalism in design and pursues simplicity and easy to learn so
that everyone can master it quickly. EQL language and lambda calculus are
interconvertible, that reveals the mathematical nature of EQL language, and
lays a solid foundation for rigor and logical integrity of EQL language. The
EQL language and a comprehensive knowledge graph system with the world's
commonsense can together form the foundation of strong AI in the future, and
make up for the current lack of understanding of world's commonsense by current

  With low latency, high throughput and enterprise-grade reliability, SSDs have

are used in all online data stores in LinkedIn. These apps persist and serve
critical user data and have millisecond latencies. For the hosts serving these
applications, SSD faults are the single largest cause of failure. Frequent SSD
failures result in significant downtime for critical applications. They also
generate a significant downstream RCA (Root Cause Analysis) load for systems
operations teams. A lack of insight into the runtime characteristics of these
drives results in limited ability to provide accurate RCAs for such issues and
hinders the ability to provide credible, long term fixes to such issues. In

characteristics. We describe how we used that insight to perform predictive
maintenance and present the resulting reduction of man-hours spent on

  The Gatan K2 IS direct electron detector (Gatan Inc., 2018), which was
introduced in 2014, marked a watershed moment in the development of cameras for
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Pan & Czarnik, 2016). Its pixel
frequency, i.e. the number of data points (pixels) recorded per second, was two
orders of magnitude higher than the fastest cameras available only five years
before. Starting from 2009, the data rate of TEM cameras has outpaced the
development of network, mass storage and memory bandwidth by almost two orders
of magnitude. Consequently, solutions based on personal computers (PCs) that
were adequate until then are no longer able to handle the resulting data rates.
Instead, tailored high-performance setups are necessary. Similar developments
have occurred for advanced X-ray sources such as the European XFEL, requiring
special information technology (IT) systems for data handling (Sauter, Hattne,
Grosse-Kunstleve, & Echols, 2013) (Fangohr, et al., 2018). Information and
detector technology are currently under rapid development and involve
disruptive technological innovations. This chapter briefly reviews the
technological developments of the past 20 years, presents a snapshot of the
current situation at the beginning of 2019 with many practical considerations,
and looks forward to future developments.

  The Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm is a standard technique used in
cosmological $N$-body simulations to identify structures. Its goal is to find
clusters of particles (called groups) that are separated by at most a cut-off
radius. $N$-body simulations typically use most of the memory present on a
node, leaving very little free for a FoF algorithm to run on-the-fly. We
propose a new method that utilises the common Union-Find data structure and a
hybrid MPI+threads approach. The algorithm can also be expressed elegantly in a
task-based formalism if such a framework is used in the rest of the
application. We have implemented our algorithm in the open-source cosmological
code, SWIFT. Our implementation displays excellent strong- and weak-scaling
behaviour on realistic problems and compares favourably (speed-up of 18x) over
other methods commonly used in the $N$-body community.

  At the start of 2020, COVID-19 became the most urgent threat to global public
health. Uniquely in recent times, governments have imposed partly voluntary,
partly compulsory restrictions on the population to slow the spread of the
virus. In this context, public attitudes and behaviors are vitally important
for reducing the death rate. Analyzing tweets about the disease may therefore
give insights into public reactions that may help guide public information
campaigns. This article analyses 3,038,026 English tweets about COVID-19 from
March 10 to 23, 2020. It focuses on one relevant aspect of public reaction:
gender differences. The results show that females are more likely to tweet
about the virus in the context of family, social distancing and healthcare
whereas males are more likely to tweet about sports cancellations, the global
spread of the virus and political reactions. Thus, women seem to be taking a
disproportionate share of the responsibility for directly keeping the
population safe. The detailed results may be useful to inform public
information announcements and to help understand the spread of the virus. For
example, failure to impose a sporting bans whilst encouraging social distancing
may send mixed messages to males.

Title: Which papers cited which tweets? An empirical analysis based on Scopus
  data

  Many altmetric studies analyze which papers were mentioned how often in
specific altmetrics sources. In order to study the potential policy relevance
of tweets from another perspective, we investigate which tweets were cited in
papers. If many tweets were cited in publications, this might demonstrate that
tweets have substantial and useful content. Overall, a rather low number of
tweets (n=5506) were cited by less than 3000 papers. Most tweets do not seem to
be cited because of any cognitive influence they might have had on studies;
they rather were study objects. Most of the papers citing tweets are from the
subject areas Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Computer Sciences. Most
of the papers cited only one tweet. Up to 55 tweets cited in a single paper
were found. This research-in-progress does not support a high policy-relevance
of tweets. However, a content analysis of the tweets and/or papers might lead
to a more detailed conclusion.

  In this work we add a graph theoretical perspective to a classical problem of
fairly allocating indivisible items to several agents. Agents have different
profit valuations of items and we allow an incompatibility relation between
pairs of items described in terms of a conflict graph. Hence, every feasible
allocation of items to the agents corresponds to a partial coloring, that is, a
collection of pairwise disjoint independent sets. The sum of profits of
vertices/items assigned to one color/agent should be optimized in a maxi-min
sense. We derive complexity and algorithmic results for this problem, which is
a generalization of the classical Partition and Independent Set problems. In
particular, we show that the problem is strongly NP-complete in the classes of
bipartite graphs and their line graphs, and solvable in pseudo-polynomial time
in the classes of cocomparability graphs and biconvex bipartite graphs.

Title: Efficient Algorithms for Multidimensional Segmented Regression
Authors: Ilias Diakonikolas and Jerry Li and Anastasia Voloshinov
Categories: cs.DS cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  We study the fundamental problem of fixed design {\em multidimensional
segmented regression}: Given noisy samples from a function $f$, promised to be
piecewise linear on an unknown set of $k$ rectangles, we want to recover $f$ up
to a desired accuracy in mean-squared error. We provide the first sample and
computationally efficient algorithm for this problem in any fixed dimension.
Our algorithm relies on a simple iterative merging approach, which is novel in
the multidimensional setting. Our experimental evaluation on both synthetic and
real datasets shows that our algorithm is competitive and in some cases
outperforms state-of-the-art heuristics. Code of our implementation is
available at

  Let $H$ be a fixed graph. Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the $H$-free
edge modification problem asks whether it is possible to modify at most $k$
edges in $G$ to make it $H$-free. Sandeep and Sivadasan (IPEC 2015) asks
whether the paw-free completion problem and the paw-free edge deletion problem
admit polynomial kernels. We answer both questions affirmatively by presenting,
respectively, $O(k)$-vertex and $O(k^4)$-vertex kernels for them. This is part
of an ongoing program that aims at understanding compressibility of $H$-free
edge modification problems.

Title: Tight Algorithms for the Submodular Multiple Knapsack Problem
Authors: Xiaoming Sun, Jialin Zhang, Zhijie Zhang
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  Submodular function maximization has been a central topic in the theoretical
computer science community over the last decade. A plenty of well-performed
approximation algorithms have been designed for the maximization of
monotone/non-monotone submodular functions over a variety of constraints. In
this paper, we consider the submodular multiple knapsack problem (SMKP), which
is the submodular version of the well-studied multiple knapsack problem (MKP).
Roughly speaking, the problem asks to maximize a monotone submodular function
over multiple bins (knapsacks). Despite lots of known results in the field of
submodular maximization, surprisingly, it remains unknown whether or not this
problem enjoys the well-known tight $(1 - 1 / e)$-approximation. In this paper,
we answer this question affirmatively by proposing tight $(1 - 1 / e -
\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for this problem in most cases.
  We first considered the case when the number of bins is a constant.
Previously a randomized approximation algorithm can obtain approximation ratio
$(1 - 1 / e-\epsilon)$ based on the involved continuous greedy technique. Here
we provide a simple combinatorial deterministic algorithm with ratio $(1-1/e)$
by directly applying the greedy technique. We then generalized the result to
arbitrary number of bins. When the capacity of bins are identical, we design a
combinatorial and deterministic algorithm which can achieve the tight
approximation ratio $(1 - 1 / e-\epsilon)$. When the ratio between the maximum
capacity and the minimum capacity of the bins is bounded by a constant, we
provide a $(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm which is also combinatorial
and deterministic. We can further boost the approximation ratio to $(1 - 1 / e
- \epsilon)$ with the help of continuous greedy technique, which gives a tight
randomized approximation algorithm for this case.

Title: The Exact Query Complexity of Yes-No Permutation Mastermind

Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures, submitted to GAMES
MSC-class: 91A46
\\
  Mastermind is famous two-players game. The ?rst player (codemaker) chooses a
secret code which the second player (codebreaker) is supposed to crack within a
minimum number of code guesses (queries). Therefore, codemaker's duty is to
help codebreaker by providing a well-de?ned error measure between the secret
code and the guessed code after each query. We consider a variant, called
Yes-No AB-Mastermind, where both secret code and queries must be
repetition-free and the provided information by codemaker only indicates if a
query contains any correct position at all. For this Mastermind version with n
positions and $k\le n$ colors we prove a lower bound of
$\log_2(k+1-n)+\log_2(k+2-n)+\dots+\log_2(k)$ and an upper bound of
$n\log_2(n)+k$ on the number of queries necessary to break the secret code. For
the important case $k=n$, where both secret code and queries represent
permutations, our results imply an exact asymptotic complexity of
$\Theta(n\log_2(n))$ queries.

Title: Automatic Modelling of Human Musculoskeletal Ligaments -- Framework

  Accurate segmentation of connective soft tissues is still a challenging task,
which hinders the generation of corresponding geometric models for
biomechanical computations. Alternatively, one could predict ligament insertion
sites and then approximate the shapes, based on anatomical knowledge and
morphological studies. Here, we describe a corresponding integrated framework
for the automatic modelling of human musculoskeletal ligaments. We combine
statistical shape modelling with geometric algorithms to automatically identify
insertion sites, based on which geometric surface and volume meshes are
created. For demonstrating a clinical use case, the framework has been applied
to generate models of the interosseous membrane in the forearm. For the
adoption to the forearm anatomy, ligament insertion sites in the statistical
model were defined according to anatomical predictions following an approach
proposed in prior work. For evaluation we compared the generated sites, as well
as the ligament shapes, to data obtained from a cadaveric study, involving five
forearms with a total of 15 ligaments. Our framework permitted the creation of
3D models approximating ligaments' shapes with good fidelity. However, we found
that the statistical model trained with the state-of-the-art prediction of the
insertion sites was not always reliable. Using that model, average mean square
errors as well as Hausdorff distances of the meshes increased by more than one
order of magnitude, as compared to employing the known insertion locations of
the cadaveric study. Using the latter an average mean square error of 0.59 mm
and an average Hausdorff distance of less than 7 mm resulted, for the complete
set of ligaments. In conclusion, the presented approach for generating ligament
shapes from insertion points appears to be feasible but the detection of the
insertion sites with a SSM is too inaccurate.

Categories: cs.GR eess.IV
\\
  Virtual reality (VR) enables data visualization in an immersive and engaging
manner, and it can be used for creating ways to explore scientific data. Here,
we use VR for visualization of 3D histology data, creating a novel interface
for digital pathology. Our contribution includes 3D modeling of a whole organ
and embedded objects of interest, fusing the models with associated
quantitative features and full resolution serial section patches, and
implementing the virtual reality application. Our VR application is multi-scale
in nature, covering two object levels representing different ranges of detail,
namely organ level and sub-organ level. In addition, the application includes
several data layers, including the measured histology image layer and multiple
representations of quantitative features computed from the histology. In this
interactive VR application, the user can set visualization properties, select
different samples and features, and interact with various objects. In this
work, we used whole mouse prostates (organ level) with prostate cancer tumors
(sub-organ objects of interest) as example cases, and included quantitative
histological features relevant for tumor biology in the VR model. Due to
automated processing of the histology data, our application can be easily
adopted to visualize other organs and pathologies from various origins. Our
application enables a novel way for exploration of high-resolution,
multidimensional data for biomedical research purposes, and can also be used in
teaching and researcher training.

\\
  Human gait refers to a daily motion that represents not only mobility, but it
can also be used to identify the walker by either human observers or computers.
Recent studies reveal that gait even conveys information about the walker's
emotion. Individuals in different emotion states may show different gait
patterns. The mapping between various emotions and gait patterns provides a new
source for automated emotion recognition. Compared to traditional emotion
detection biometrics, such as facial expression, speech and physiological
parameters, gait is remotely observable, more difficult to imitate, and
requires less cooperation from the subject. These advantages make gait a
promising source for emotion detection. This article reviews current research
on gait-based emotion detection, particularly on how gait parameters can be
affected by different emotion states and how the emotion states can be
recognized through distinct gait patterns. We focus on the detailed methods and
techniques applied in the whole process of emotion recognition: data
collection, preprocessing, and classification. At last, we discuss possible
future developments of efficient and effective gait-based emotion recognition
using the state of the art techniques on intelligent computation and big data.

  Exploratory information search can challenge users in the formulation of
efficacious search queries. Moreover, complex information spaces, such as those
managed by Geographical Information Systems, can disorient people, making it
difficult to find relevant data. In order to address these issues, we developed
a session-based suggestion model that proposes concepts as a "you might also be
interested in" function, by taking the user's previous queries into account.
Our model can be applied to incrementally generate suggestions in interactive
search. It can be used for query expansion, and in general to guide users in
the exploration of possibly complex spaces of data categories. Our model is
based on a concept co-occurrence graph that describes how frequently concepts
are searched together in search sessions. Starting from an ontological domain
representation, we generated the graph by analyzing the query log of a major
search engine. Moreover, we identified clusters of ontology concepts which
frequently co-occur in the sessions of the log via community detection on the
graph. The evaluation of our model provided satisfactory accuracy results.

  Many collaborative recommender systems leverage social correlation theories
to improve suggestion performance. However, they focus on explicit relations
between users and they leave out other types of information that can contribute
to determine users' global reputation; e.g., public recognition of reviewers'
quality. We are interested in understanding if and when these additional types
of feedback improve Top-N recommendation. For this purpose, we propose a
multi-faceted trust model to integrate local trust, represented by social
links, with various types of global trust evidence provided by social networks.
We aim at identifying general classes of data in order to make our model
applicable to different case studies. Then, we test the model by applying it to
a variant of User-to-User Collaborative filtering (U2UCF) which supports the
fusion of rating similarity, local trust derived from social relations, and
multi-faceted reputation for rating prediction. We test our model on two
datasets: the Yelp one publishes generic friend relations between users but
provides different types of trust feedback, including user profile
endorsements. The LibraryThing dataset offers fewer types of feedback but it
provides more selective friend relations aimed at content sharing. The results
of our experiments show that, on the Yelp dataset, our model outperforms both
U2UCF and state-of-the-art trust-based recommenders that only use rating
similarity and social relations. Differently, in the LibraryThing dataset, the
combination of social relations and rating similarity achieves the best
results. The lesson we learn is that multi-faceted trust can be a valuable type
of information for recommendation. However, before using it in an application
domain, an analysis of the type and amount of available trust evidence has to
be done to assess its real impact on recommendation performance.

Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 35 pages; a reply and answer to Paul Vitanyi's review
\\
  I review previous and novel techniques in the field of applications of
algorithmic (Kolmogorov) complexity starting from those dominating the area
such as statistical lossless compression algorithms to more recent approaches
that advance and complement those based on statistical compression but also
bring new challenges and have their own limitations. I present evidence
suggesting that different methods complement each other for different regimes.
I also make the case that despite the many challenges, some methods can be
better motivated by and better grounded in the principles of algorithmic
complexity theory. I will explain how different approaches to algorithmic
complexity can explore the relaxation of different necessary and sufficient
conditions in their exploration of numerical applicability with some of those
approaches taking greater risks than others in exchange for application
relevancy. I conclude with a discussion of possible directions that may be
taken to advance the area and encourage methodological innovation.

Title: Bayesian Methods for Multiple Change-Point Detection with Reduced
  Communication
Authors: Eyal Nitzan, Topi Halme, and Visa Koivunen
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 13 pages, 10 figures
\\
  In many modern applications, large-scale sensor networks are used to perform
statistical inference tasks. In this paper, we propose Bayesian methods for
multiple change-point detection using a sensor network in which a fusion center
(FC) can receive a data stream from each sensor. Due to communication
limitations, the FC monitors only a subset of the sensors at each time slot.
Since the number of change points can be high, we adopt the false discovery
rate (FDR) criterion for controlling the rate of false alarms, while minimizing
the average detection delay (ADD). We propose two Bayesian detection procedures
that handle the communication limitations by monitoring the subset of the
sensors with the highest posterior probabilities of change points having
occurred. This monitoring policy aims to minimize the delay between the
occurrence of each change point and its declaration using the corresponding
posterior probabilities. One of the proposed procedures is more conservative
than the second one in terms of having lower FDR at the expense of higher ADD.
It is analytically shown that both procedures control the FDR under a specified
tolerated level and are also scalable in the sense that they attain an ADD that
does not increase asymptotically with the number of sensors. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the proposed detection procedures are useful for trading off
between reduced ADD and reduced average number of observations drawn until
discovery. Numerical simulations are conducted for validating the analytical
results and for demonstrating the properties of the proposed procedures.

Title: Polynomial graph filter of multiple shifts and distributed
  implementation of inverse filtering
Authors: Nazar Emirov, Cheng Cheng, Junzheng Jiang, and Qiyu Sun
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Polynomial graph filters and their inverses play important roles in graph
signal processing. An advantage of polynomial graph filters is that they can be
implemented in a distributed manner, which involves data transmission between
adjacent vertices only. The challenge arisen in the inverse filtering is that a
direct implementation may suffer from high computational burden, as the inverse
graph filter usually has full bandwidth even if the original filter has small
bandwidth. In this paper, we consider distributed implementation of the inverse
filtering procedure for a polynomial graph filter of multiple shifts, and we
propose two iterative approximation algorithms that can be implemented in a
distributed network, where each vertex is equipped with systems for limited
data storage, computation power and data exchanging facility to its adjacent
vertices. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative
approximation algorithms to implement the inverse filtering procedure and their
satisfactory performance to denoise time-varying graph signals and a data set
of US hourly temperature at 218 locations.

  In this letter, we investigate the robust and secure beamforming (RSBF) in an
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple
input single output (MISO) system, where multiple single antenna eavesdroppers
(Eves) are arbitrarily distributed nearby the legitimate receiver. Considering
the channel state information (CSI) of Eves' channels is imperfectly known at
the legitimate transmitter, the RSBF design problems to maximize the worst case
of achievable secrecy rate (ASR) are formulated under the total transmission
power and unit-modulus constraints. Since the problems are difficult to solve
optimally due to their nonconvexity and coupled variables, we substitute the
wiretap channels by a weighted combination of discrete samples and propose a
RSBF scheme based on alternating optimization and semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
techniques, for both colluding and noncolluding eavesdropping scenarios.
Simulation results show that the proposed RSBF scheme can effectively improve
the ASR and also outperforms other benchmark schemes.

\\
  Most of the indoor coverage issues arise from network deployments that are
usually planned for outdoor scenarios. Moreover, the ever-growing number of
devices with different Radio Access Technologies (RATs), expected for new 5G
scenarios and to maintain compatibility with older cellular standards (mostly
3G/4G), worsen this situation thus calling for novel bandwidth-efficient,
low-latency and cost-effective solutions for indoor coverage. To solve this
problem, Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures have been
proposed to provide dense and controlled coverage inside buildings. However,
all-digital C-RAN solutions are complex and expensive when indoor layout
constraints and device costs are considered. We discuss here an analog C-RAN
architecture, referred to as Analog MIMO Radio-over-Copper (A-MIMO-RoC), that
aims at distributing RF signals indoors over distances in the order of 50 m.
The all-analog passive-only design presented here proves the feasibility of
analog relaying of MIMO radio signals over LAN cables at frequency bandwidth
values up to 400 MHz for multi-RAT applications. After asserting the
feasibility of the A-MIMO-RoC platform, we present some experimental results
obtained with the proposed architecture. These preliminary results show that
the A-MIMO-RoC system is a valid solution towards the design of dedicated 4G/5G
indoor wireless systems for the billions of buildings which nowadays still
suffer from severe indoor coverage issues.

Title: Integrating Physiological Time Series and Clinical Notes with Deep
  Learning for Improved ICU Mortality Prediction
Authors: Satya Narayan Shukla, Benjamin M. Marlin
Categories: cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML
Comments: Accepted at ACM Conference on Health, Inference and Learning, 2020
\\
  Intensive Care Unit Electronic Health Records (ICU EHRs) store multimodal
data about patients including clinical notes, sparse and irregularly sampled
physiological time series, lab results, and more. To date, most methods
designed to learn predictive models from ICU EHR data have focused on a single
modality. In this paper, we leverage the recently proposed
interpolation-prediction deep learning architecture(Shukla and Marlin 2019) as
a basis for exploring how physiological time series data and clinical notes can
be integrated into a unified mortality prediction model. We study both early
and late fusion approaches and demonstrate how the relative predictive value of
clinical text and physiological data change over time. Our results show that a
late fusion approach can provide a statistically significant improvement in
mortality prediction performance over using individual modalities in isolation.

Title: Incorporating User's Preference into Attributed Graph Clustering
Authors: Wei Ye, Dominik Mautz, Christian Boehm, Ambuj Singh, Claudia Plant

DOI: 10.1109/TKDE.2020.2976063
\\
  Graph clustering has been studied extensively on both plain graphs and
attributed graphs. However, all these methods need to partition the whole graph
to find cluster structures. Sometimes, based on domain knowledge, people may
have information about a specific target region in the graph and only want to
find a single cluster concentrated on this local region. Such a task is called
local clustering. In contrast to global clustering, local clustering aims to
find only one cluster that is concentrating on the given seed vertex (and also
on the designated attributes for attributed graphs). Currently, very few
methods can deal with this kind of task. To this end, we propose two quality
measures for a local cluster: Graph Unimodality (GU) and Attribute Unimodality
(AU). The former measures the homogeneity of the graph structure while the
latter measures the homogeneity of the subspace that is composed of the
designated attributes. We call their linear combination as Compactness.
Further, we propose LOCLU to optimize the Compactness score. The local cluster
detected by LOCLU concentrates on the region of interest, provides efficient
information flow in the graph and exhibits a unimodal data distribution in the
subspace of the designated attributes.

  This work presents an application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the
complete control of real soccer robots of the IEEE Very Small Size Soccer
(VSSS), a traditional league in the Latin American Robotics Competition (LARC).
In the VSSS league, two teams of three small robots play against each other. We
propose a simulated environment in which continuous or discrete control
policies can be trained, and a Sim-to-Real method to allow using the obtained
policies to control a robot in the real world. The results show that the
learned policies display a broad repertoire of behaviors that are difficult to
specify by hand. This approach, called VSSS-RL, was able to beat the
human-designed policy for the striker of the team ranked 3rd place in the 2018
LARC, in 1-vs-1 matches.

Title: Black-box Off-policy Estimation for Infinite-Horizon Reinforcement
  Learning
Authors: Ali Mousavi, Lihong Li, Qiang Liu, Denny Zhou
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Published at ICLR 2020
\\
  Off-policy estimation for long-horizon problems is important in many
real-life applications such as healthcare and robotics, where high-fidelity
simulators may not be available and on-policy evaluation is expensive or
impossible. Recently, \cite{liu18breaking} proposed an approach that avoids the
\emph{curse of horizon} suffered by typical importance-sampling-based methods.
While showing promising results, this approach is limited in practice as it
requires data be drawn from the \emph{stationary distribution} of a
\emph{known} behavior policy. In this work, we propose a novel approach that
eliminates such limitations. In particular, we formulate the problem as solving
for the fixed point of a certain operator. Using tools from Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs), we develop a new estimator that computes importance
ratios of stationary distributions, without knowledge of how the off-policy
data are collected. We analyze its asymptotic consistency and finite-sample
generalization. Experiments on benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our
approach.

Title: Born-Again Tree Ensembles
Authors: Thibaut Vidal, Toni Pacheco, Maximilian Schiffer
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The use of machine learning algorithms in finance, medicine, and criminal
justice can deeply impact human lives. As a consequence, research into
interpretable machine learning has rapidly grown in an attempt to better
control and fix possible sources of mistakes and biases. Tree ensembles offer a
good prediction quality in various domains, but the concurrent use of multiple
trees reduces the interpretability of the ensemble. Against this background, we
study born-again tree ensembles, i.e., the process of constructing a single
decision tree of minimum size that reproduces the exact same behavior as a
given tree ensemble. To find such a tree, we develop a dynamic-programming
based algorithm that exploits sophisticated pruning and bounding rules to
reduce the number of recursive calls. This algorithm generates optimal
born-again trees for many datasets of practical interest, leading to
classifiers which are typically simpler and more interpretable without any
other form of compromise.

Title: Fiber: A Platform for Efficient Development and Distributed Training for
  Reinforcement Learning and Population-Based Methods
Authors: Jiale Zhi, Rui Wang, Jeff Clune, Kenneth O. Stanley
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Recent advances in machine learning are consistently enabled by increasing
amounts of computation. Reinforcement learning (RL) and population-based
methods in particular pose unique challenges for efficiency and flexibility to
the underlying distributed computing frameworks. These challenges include
frequent interaction with simulations, the need for dynamic scaling, and the
need for a user interface with low adoption cost and consistency across
different backends. In this paper we address these challenges while still
retaining development efficiency and flexibility for both research and
practical applications by introducing Fiber, a scalable distributed computing
framework for RL and population-based methods. Fiber aims to significantly
expand the accessibility of large-scale parallel computation to users of
otherwise complicated RL and population-based approaches without the need to
for specialized computational expertise.

Title: A Unified Framework for Multiclass and Multilabel Support Vector
  Machines
Authors: Hoda Shajari, Anand Rangarajan
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose a novel integrated formulation for multiclass and multilabel
support vector machines (SVMs). A number of approaches have been proposed to
extend the original binary SVM to an all-in-one multiclass SVM. However, its
direct extension to a unified multilabel SVM has not been widely investigated.
We propose a straightforward extension to the SVM to cope with multiclass and
multilabel classification problems within a unified framework. Our framework
deviates from the conventional soft margin SVM framework with its direct
oppositional structure. In our formulation, class-specific weight vectors
(normal vectors) are learned by maximizing their margin with respect to an
origin and penalizing patterns when they get too close to this origin. As a
result, each weight vector chooses an orientation and a magnitude with respect
to this origin in such a way that it best represents the patterns belonging to
its corresponding class. Opposition between classes is introduced into the
formulation via the minimization of pairwise inner products of weight vectors.
We also extend our framework to cope with nonlinear separability via standard
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). Biases which are closely related to
the origin need to be treated properly in both the original feature space and
Hilbert space. We have the flexibility to incorporate constraints into the
formulation (if they better reflect the underlying geometry) and improve the
performance of the classifier. To this end, specifics and technicalities such
as the origin in RKHS are addressed. Results demonstrates a competitive
classifier for both multiclass and multilabel classification problems.

Title: Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis: A Subspace Intersection
  Approach
Authors: Mikael S{\o}rensen, Charilaos I. Kanatsoulis, and Nicholas D.
  Sidiropoulos
Categories: cs.LG cs.IR eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA) is an important tool that
finds numerous applications in data mining, machine learning, and artificial
intelligence. It aims at finding `common' random variables that are strongly
correlated across multiple feature representations (views) of the same set of
entities. CCA and to a lesser extent GCCA have been studied from the
statistical and algorithmic points of view, but not as much from the standpoint
of linear algebra. This paper offers a fresh algebraic perspective of GCCA
based on a (bi-)linear generative model that naturally captures its essence. It
is shown that from a linear algebra point of view, GCCA is tantamount to
subspace intersection; and conditions under which the common subspace of the
different views is identifiable are provided. A novel GCCA algorithm is
proposed based on subspace intersection, which scales up to handle large GCCA
tasks. Synthetic as well as real data experiments are provided to showcase the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Logarithmic Regret Bound in Partially Observable Linear Dynamical
  Systems
Authors: Sahin Lale, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Babak Hassibi, Anima Anandkumar
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  We study the problem of adaptive control in partially observable linear
dynamical systems. We propose a novel algorithm, adaptive control online
learning algorithm (AdaptOn), which efficiently explores the environment,
estimates the system dynamics episodically and exploits these estimates to
design effective controllers to minimize the cumulative costs. Through
interaction with the environment, AdaptOn deploys online convex optimization to
optimize the controller while simultaneously learning the system dynamics to
improve the accuracy of controller updates. We show that when the cost
functions are strongly convex, after $T$ times step of agent-environment
interaction, AdaptOn achieves regret upper bound of
$\text{polylog}\left(T\right)$. To the best of our knowledge, AdaptOn is the
first algorithm which achieves $\text{polylog}\left(T\right)$ regret in
adaptive control of unknown partially observable linear dynamical systems which
includes linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control.

Title: AutoFIS: Automatic Feature Interaction Selection in Factorization Models
  for Click-Through Rate Prediction
Authors: Bin Liu, Chenxu Zhu, Guilin Li, Weinan Zhang, Jincai Lai, Ruiming
  Tang, Xiuqiang He, Zhenguo Li, Yong Yu
Categories: cs.LG cs.IR stat.ML
\\
  Learning effective feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate
(CTR) prediction tasks in recommender systems. In most of the existing deep
learning models, feature interactions are either manually designed or simply
enumerated. However, enumerating all feature interactions brings large memory
and computation cost. Even worse, useless interactions may introduce
unnecessary noise and complicate the training process. In this work, we propose
a two-stage algorithm called Automatic Feature Interaction Selection (AutoFIS).
AutoFIS can automatically identify all the important feature interactions for
factorization models with just the computational cost equivalent to training
the target model to convergence. In the \emph{search stage}, instead of
searching over a discrete set of candidate feature interactions, we relax the
choices to be continuous by introducing the architecture parameters. By
implementing a regularized optimizer over the architecture parameters, the
model can automatically identify and remove the redundant feature interactions
during the training process of the model. In the \emph{re-train stage}, we keep
the architecture parameters serving as an attention unit to further boost the
performance. Offline experiments on three large-scale datasets (two public
benchmarks, one private) demonstrate that the proposed AutoFIS can
significantly improve various FM based models. AutoFIS has been deployed onto
the training platform of Huawei App Store recommendation service, where a
10-day online A/B test demonstrated that AutoFIS improved the DeepFM model by
20.3\% and 20.1\% in terms of CTR and CVR respectively.

Title: Safety-Aware Hardening of 3D Object Detection Neural Network Systems
Authors: Chih-Hong Cheng
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: Work-in-progress research report
\\
  We study how state-of-the-art neural networks for 3D object detection using a
single-stage pipeline can be made safety aware. We start with the safety
specification (reflecting the capability of other components) that partitions
the 3D input space by criticality, where the critical area employs a separate
criterion on robustness under perturbation, quality of bounding boxes, and the
tolerance over false negatives demonstrated on the training set. In the
architecture design, we consider symbolic error propagation to allow
feature-level perturbation. Subsequently, we introduce a specialized loss
function reflecting (1) the safety specification, (2) the use of single-stage
detection architecture, and finally, (3) the characterization of robustness
under perturbation. We also replace the commonly seen non-max-suppression
post-processing algorithm by a safety-aware non-max-inclusion algorithm, in
order to maintain the safety claim created by the neural network. The concept
is detailed by extending the state-of-the-art PIXOR detector which creates
object bounding boxes in bird's eye view with inputs from point clouds.

Title: Volumization as a Natural Generalization of Weight Decay
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Zihao Wang, Makoto Yamada, Masahito Ueda
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 18 pages, 20 figures
\\
  We propose a novel regularization method, called \textit{volumization}, for
neural networks. Inspired by physics, we define a physical volume for the
weight parameters in neural networks, and we show that this method is an
effective way of regularizing neural networks. Intuitively, this method
interpolates between an $L_2$ and $L_\infty$ regularization. Therefore, weight
decay and weight clipping become special cases of the proposed algorithm. We
prove, on a toy example, that the essence of this method is a regularization
technique to control bias-variance tradeoff. The method is shown to do well in
the categories where the standard weight decay method is shown to work well,
including improving the generalization of networks and preventing memorization.
Moreover, we show that the volumization might lead to a simple method for
training a neural network whose weight is binary or ternary.

Title: FastDTW is approximate and Generally Slower than the Algorithm it
  Approximates
Authors: Renjie Wu and Eamonn J. Keogh
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Many time series data mining problems can be solved with repeated use of
distance measure. Examples of such tasks include similarity search, clustering,
classification, anomaly detection and segmentation. For over two decades it has
been known that the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure is the best
measure to use for most tasks, in most domains. Because the classic DTW
algorithm has quadratic time complexity, many ideas have been introduced to
reduce its amortized time, or to quickly approximate it. One of the most cited
approximate approaches is FastDTW. The FastDTW algorithm has well over a
thousand citations and has been explicitly used in several hundred research
efforts. In this work, we make a surprising claim. In any realistic data mining
application, the approximate FastDTW is much slower than the exact DTW. This
fact clearly has implications for the community that uses this algorithm:
allowing it to address much larger datasets, get exact results, and do so in
less time. Our observation also has a more sobering lesson for the community.
This work may serve as a reminder to the community to exercise more caution in
uncritically accepting published results.

\\
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have surpassed human-level accuracy in a variety
of cognitive tasks but at the cost of significant memory/time requirements in
DNN training. This limits their deployment in energy and memory limited
applications that require real-time learning. Matrix-vector multiplications
(MVM) and vector-vector outer product (VVOP) are the two most expensive
operations associated with the training of DNNs. Strategies to improve the
efficiency of MVM computation in hardware have been demonstrated with minimal
impact on training accuracy. However, the VVOP computation remains a relatively
less explored bottleneck even with the aforementioned strategies. Stochastic
computing (SC) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of VVOP computation
but on relatively shallow networks with bounded activation functions and
floating-point (FP) scaling of activation gradients. In this paper, we propose
ESSOP, an efficient and scalable stochastic outer product architecture based on
the SC paradigm. We introduce efficient techniques to generalize SC for weight
update computation in DNNs with the unbounded activation functions (e.g.,
ReLU), required by many state-of-the-art networks. Our architecture reduces the
computational cost by re-using random numbers and replacing certain FP
multiplication operations by bit shift scaling. We show that the ResNet-32
network with 33 convolution layers and a fully-connected layer can be trained
with ESSOP on the CIFAR-10 dataset to achieve baseline comparable accuracy.
Hardware design of ESSOP at 14nm technology node shows that, compared to a
highly pipelined FP16 multiplier design, ESSOP is 82.2% and 93.7% better in
energy and area efficiency respectively for outer product computation.

Title: Auto-Ensemble: An Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling based Deep Learning
  Model Ensembling
Authors: Jun Yang, Fei Wang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 14 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Ensembling deep learning models is a shortcut to promote its implementation
in new scenarios, which can avoid tuning neural networks, losses and training
algorithms from scratch. However, it is difficult to collect sufficient
accurate and diverse models through once training. This paper proposes
Auto-Ensemble (AE) to collect checkpoints of deep learning model and ensemble
them automatically by adaptive learning rate scheduling algorithm. The
advantage of this method is to make the model converge to various local optima
by scheduling the learning rate in once training. When the number of lo-cal
optimal solutions tends to be saturated, all the collected checkpoints are used
for ensemble. Our method is universal, it can be applied to various scenarios.
Experiment results on multiple datasets and neural networks demonstrate it is
effective and competitive, especially on few-shot learning. Besides, we
proposed a method to measure the distance among models. Then we can ensure the
accuracy and diversity of collected models.

Title: Predictive Business Process Monitoring via Generative Adversarial Nets:
  The Case of Next Event Prediction
Authors: Farbod Taymouri, Marcello La Rosa, Sarah Erfani, Zahra Dasht Bozorgi,
  Ilya Verenich
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Predictive process monitoring aims to predict future characteristics of an
ongoing process case, such as case outcome or remaining timestamp. Recently,
several predictive process monitoring methods based on deep learning such as
Long Short-Term Memory or Convolutional Neural Network have been proposed to
address the problem of next event prediction. However, due to insufficient
training data or sub-optimal network configuration and architecture, these
approaches do not generalize well the problem at hand. This paper proposes a
novel adversarial training framework to address this shortcoming, based on an
adaptation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the realm of sequential
temporal data. The training works by putting one neural network against the
other in a two-player game (hence the adversarial nature) which leads to
predictions that are indistinguishable from the ground truth. We formally show
that the worst-case accuracy of the proposed approach is at least equal to the
accuracy achieved in non-adversarial settings. From the experimental evaluation
it emerges that the approach systematically outperforms all baselines both in
terms of accuracy and earliness of the prediction, despite using a simple
network architecture and a naive feature encoding. Moreover, the approach is
more robust, as its accuracy is not affected by fluctuations over the case
length.

Title: Boosting Ridge Regression for High Dimensional Data Classification
Authors: Jakramate Bootkrajang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Ridge regression is a well established regression estimator which can
conveniently be adapted for classification problems. One compelling reason is
probably the fact that ridge regression emits a closed-form solution thereby
facilitating the training phase. However in the case of high-dimensional
problems, the closed-form solution which involves inverting the regularised
covariance matrix is rather expensive to compute. The high computational demand
of such operation also renders difficulty in constructing ensemble of ridge
regressions. In this paper, we consider learning an ensemble of ridge
regressors where each regressor is trained in its own randomly projected
subspace. Subspace regressors are later combined via adaptive boosting
methodology. Experiments based on five high-dimensional classification problems
demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of learning time
and in some cases improved predictive performance can be observed.

Title: MIM-Based Generative Adversarial Networks and Its Application on Anomaly
  Detection
Authors: Rui She and Pingyi Fan
Categories: cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
\\
  In terms of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the information metric to
discriminate the generative data and the real data, lies in the key point of
generation efficiency, which plays an important role in GAN-based applications,
especially in anomaly detection. As for the original GAN, the information
metric based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence has limitations on rare events
generation and training performance for adversarial networks. Therefore, it is
significant to investigate the metrics used in GANs to improve the generation
ability as well as bring gains in the training process. In this paper, we adopt
the exponential form, referred from the Message Importance Measure (MIM), to
replace the logarithm form of the original GAN. This approach named MIM-based
GAN, has dominant performance on training process and rare events generation.
Specifically, we first discuss the characteristics of training process in this
approach. Moreover, we also analyze its advantages on generating rare events in
theory. In addition, we do simulations on the datasets of MNIST and ODDS to see
that the MIM-based GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on anomaly
detection compared with some classical GANs.

Comments: ICLR 2020 workshop on PML4DC: Learning under limited/low resource

\\
  Network pruning is an effective methodology to compress large neural
networks, and sparse neural networks obtained by pruning can benefit from their
reduced memory and computational costs at use. Notably, recent advances have
found that it is possible to find a trainable sparse neural network even at
random initialization prior to training; hence the obtained sparse network only
needs to be trained. While this approach of pruning at initialization turned
out to be highly effective, little has been studied about the training aspects
of these sparse neural networks. In this work, we focus on measuring the
effects of data parallelism on training sparse neural networks. As a result, we
find that the data parallelism in training sparse neural networks is no worse
than that in training densely parameterized neural networks, despite the
general difficulty of training sparse neural networks. When training sparse
networks using SGD with momentum, the breakdown of the perfect scaling regime
occurs even much later than the dense at large batch sizes.

Deep Learning models operate, a problem addressed by using assorted approaches
aimed at audiences from different domains. However, as the focus of the
application is placed more on non-expert users, it results mandatory to provide
the means for him/her to trust the model, just like a human gets familiar with
a system or process: by understanding the hypothetical circumstances under
which it fails. This is indeed the angular stone for this research work: to
undertake an adversarial analysis of a Deep Learning model. The proposed
framework constructs counterfactual examples by ensuring their plausibility,
e.g. there is a reasonable probability that a human could generate them without
resorting to a computer program. Therefore, this work must be regarded as
valuable auditing exercise of the usable bounds a certain model is constrained
within, thereby allowing for a much greater understanding of the capabilities
and pitfalls of a model used in a real application. To this end, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and multi-objective heuristics are used to furnish a
plausible attack to the audited model, efficiently trading between the
confusion of this model, the intensity and plausibility of the generated
counterfactual. Its utility is showcased within a human face classification
task, unveiling the enormous potential of the proposed framework.

Title: Accelerated learning algorithms of general fuzzy min-max neural network
  using a branch-and-bound-based hyperbox selection rule
Authors: Thanh Tung Khuat and Bogdan Gabrys

\\
  This paper proposes a method to accelerate the training process of general
fuzzy min-max neural network. The purpose is to reduce the unsuitable
hyperboxes selected as the potential candidates of the expansion step of
existing hyperboxes to cover a new input pattern in the online learning
algorithms or candidates of the hyperbox aggregation process in the
agglomerative learning algorithms. Our proposed approach is based on the
mathematical formulas to form a branch-and-bound solution aiming to remove the
hyperboxes which are certain not to satisfy expansion or aggregation
conditions, and in turn decreasing the training time of learning algorithms.
The efficiency of the proposed method is assessed over a number of widely used
data sets. The experimental results indicated the significant decrease in
training time of proposed approach for both online and agglomerative learning
algorithms. Notably, the training time of the online learning algorithms is
reduced from 1.2 to 12 times when using the proposed method, while the
agglomerative learning algorithms are accelerated from 7 to 37 times on
average.

\\
  We study the problem of identifying viewers of arbitrary images based on
their eye gaze. Psychological research has derived generative stochastic models
of eye movements. In order to exploit this background knowledge within a
discriminatively trained classification model, we derive Fisher kernels from
different generative models of eye gaze. Experimentally, we find that the
performance of the classifier strongly depends on the underlying generative
model. Using an SVM with Fisher kernel improves the classification performance
over the underlying generative model.

Title: Convergence of Recursive Stochastic Algorithms using Wasserstein
  Divergence

\\
  This paper develops a unified framework, based on iterated random operator
theory, to analyze the convergence of constant stepsize recursive stochastic
algorithms (RSAs) in machine learning and reinforcement learning. RSAs use
randomization to efficiently compute expectations, and so their iterates form a
stochastic process. The key idea is to lift the RSA into an appropriate
higher-dimensional space and then express it as an equivalent Markov chain.
Instead of determining the convergence of this Markov chain (which may not
converge under constant stepsize), we study the convergence of the distribution
of this Markov chain. To study this, we define a new notion of Wasserstein
divergence. We show that if the distribution of the iterates in the Markov
chain satisfy certain contraction property with respect to the Wasserstein
divergence, then the Markov chain admits an invariant distribution. Inspired by
the SVRG algorithm, we develop a method to convert any RSA to a variance
reduced RSA that converges to the optimal solution with in almost sure sense or
in probability. We show that convergence of a large family of constant stepsize
RSAs can be understood using this framework. We apply this framework to
ascertain the convergence of mini-batch SGD, forward-backward splitting with
catalyst, SVRG, SAGA, empirical Q value iteration, synchronous Q-learning,
enhanced policy iteration, and MDPs with a generative model. We also develop
two new algorithms for reinforcement learning and establish their convergence
using this framework.

Title: Bayesian Sparsification Methods for Deep Complex-valued Networks

\\
  With continual miniaturization ever more applications of deep learning can be
found in embedded systems, where it is common to encounter data with natural
complex domain representation. To this end we extend Sparse Variational Dropout
to complex-valued neural networks and verify the proposed Bayesian technique by
conducting a large numerical study of the performance-compression trade-off of
C-valued networks on two tasks: image recognition on MNIST-like and CIFAR10
datasets and music transcription on MusicNet. We replicate the state-of-the-art
result by Trabelsi et al. [2018] on MusicNet with a complex-valued network
compressed by 50-100x at a small performance penalty.

\\
  Most research in Bayesian optimization (BO) has focused on direct feedback
scenarios, where one has access to exact, or perturbed, values of some
expensive-to-evaluate objective. This direction has been mainly driven by the
use of BO in machine learning hyper-parameter configuration problems. However,
in domains such as modelling human preferences, A/B tests or recommender
systems, there is a need of methods that are able to replace direct feedback
with preferential feedback, obtained via rankings or pairwise comparisons. In
this work, we present Preferential Batch Bayesian Optimization (PBBO), a new
framework that allows to find the optimum of a latent function of interest,
given any type of parallel preferential feedback for a group of two or more
points. We do so by using a Gaussian process model with a likelihood specially
designed to enable parallel and efficient data collection mechanisms, which are
key in modern machine learning. We show how the acquisitions developed under
this framework generalize and augment previous approaches in Bayesian
optimization, expanding the use of these techniques to a wider range of
domains. An extensive simulation study shows the benefits of this approach,
both with simulated functions and four real data sets.

Title: Scalable Variational Gaussian Process Regression Networks
Authors: Shibo Li, Wei Xing, Mike Kirby and Shandian Zhe
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Gaussian process regression networks (GPRN) are powerful Bayesian models for
multi-output regression, but their inference is intractable. To address this
issue, existing methods use a fully factorized structure (or a mixture of such
structures) over all the outputs and latent functions for posterior
approximation, which, however, can miss the strong posterior dependencies among
the latent variables and hurt the inference quality. In addition, the updates
of the variational parameters are inefficient and can be prohibitively
expensive for a large number of outputs. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a scalable variational inference algorithm for GPRN, which not only
captures the abundant posterior dependencies but also is much more efficient
for massive outputs. We tensorize the output space and introduce
tensor/matrix-normal variational posteriors to capture the posterior
correlations and to reduce the parameters. We jointly optimize all the
parameters and exploit the inherent Kronecker product structure in the
variational model evidence lower bound to accelerate the computation. We
demonstrate the advantages of our method in several real-world applications.

Title: A multivariate water quality parameter prediction model using recurrent

\\
  The global degradation of water resources is a matter of great concern,
especially for the survival of humanity. The effective monitoring and
management of existing water resources is necessary to achieve and maintain
optimal water quality. The prediction of the quality of water resources will
aid in the timely identification of possible problem areas and thus increase
the efficiency of water management. The purpose of this research is to develop
a water quality prediction model based on water quality parameters through the
application of a specialised recurrent neural network (RNN), Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) and the use of historical water quality data over several years.
Both multivariate single and multiple step LSTM models were developed, using a
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function and a Root Mean Square
Propagation (RMSprop) optimiser was developed. The single step model attained
an error of 0.01 mg/L, whilst the multiple step model achieved a Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.227 mg/L.

Title: Similarity of Neural Networks with Gradients

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  A suitable similarity index for comparing learnt neural networks plays an
important role in understanding the behaviour of the highly-nonlinear
functions, and can provide insights on further theoretical analysis and
empirical studies. We define two key steps when comparing models: firstly, the
representation abstracted from the learnt model, where we propose to leverage
both feature vectors and gradient ones (which are largely ignored in prior
work) into designing the representation of a neural network. Secondly, we
define the employed similarity index which gives desired invariance properties,
and we facilitate the chosen ones with sketching techniques for comparing
various datasets efficiently. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach
provides a state-of-the-art method for computing similarity of neural networks
that are trained independently on different datasets and the tasks defined by
the datasets.

Title: Not all domains are equally complex: Adaptive Multi-Domain Learning
Authors: Ali Senhaji, Jenni Raitoharju, Moncef Gabbouj and Alexandros Iosifidis
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Deep learning approaches are highly specialized and require training separate
models for different tasks. Multi-domain learning looks at ways to learn a
multitude of different tasks, each coming from a different domain, at once. The
most common approach in multi-domain learning is to form a domain agnostic
model, the parameters of which are shared among all domains, and learn a small
number of extra domain-specific parameters for each individual new domain.
However, different domains come with different levels of difficulty;
parameterizing the models of all domains using an augmented version of the
domain agnostic model leads to unnecessarily inefficient solutions, especially
for easy to solve tasks. We propose an adaptive parameterization approach to
deep neural networks for multi-domain learning. The proposed approach performs
on par with the original approach while reducing by far the number of
parameters, leading to efficient multi-domain learning solutions.

Title: Robustness Analysis of the Data-Selective Volterra NLMS Algorithm
Authors: Javad Sharafi and Abbas Maarefparvar
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  Recently, the data-selective adaptive Volterra filters have been proposed;
however, up to now, there are not any theoretical analyses on its behavior
rather than numerical simulations. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the
robustness (in the sense of l2-stability) of the data-selective Volterra
normalized least-mean-square (DS-VNLMS) algorithm. First, we study the local
robustness of this algorithm at any iteration, then we propose a global bound
for the error/discrepancy in the coefficient vector. Also, we demonstrate that
the DS-VNLMS algorithm improves the parameter estimation for the majority of
the iterations that an update is implemented. Moreover, we prove that if the
noise bound is known, we can set the DS-VNLMS so that it never degrades the
estimate. The simulation results corroborate the validity of the executed
analysis and demonstrate that the DS-VNLMS algorithm is robust against noise,
no matter how its parameters are adopted.

Title: A Formalization of SQL with Nulls
Authors: Wilmer Ricciotti and James Cheney
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  SQL is the world's most popular declarative language, forming the basis of
the multi-billion-dollar database industry. Although SQL has been standardized,
the full standard is based on ambiguous natural language rather than formal
specification. Commercial SQL implementations interpret the standard in
different ways, so that, given the same input data, the same query can yield
different results depending on the SQL system it is run on. Even for a
particular system, mechanically checked formalization of all widely-used
features of SQL remains an open problem. The lack of a well-understood formal
semantics makes it very difficult to validate the soundness of database
implementations.
  Although formal semantics for fragments of SQL were designed in the past,
they usually did not support set and bag operations, nested subqueries, and,
crucially, null values. Null values complicate SQL's semantics in profound ways
analogous to null pointers or side-effects in other programming languages.
Since certain SQL queries are equivalent in the absence of null values, but
produce different results when applied to tables containing incomplete data,
semantics which ignore null values are able to prove query equivalences that
are unsound in realistic databases.
  A formal semantics of SQL supporting all the aforementioned features was only
proposed recently. In this paper, we report about our mechanization of SQL
semantics covering set/bag operations, nested subqueries, and nulls, written
the Coq proof assistant, and describe the validation of key metatheoretic
properties.

Title: Driver Modeling through Deep Reinforcement Learning and Behavioral Game
  Theory
Authors: Berat Mert Albaba, Yildiray Yildiz
Categories: cs.MA cs.LG
Comments: 22 pages, 19 figures
\\
  In this paper, a synergistic combination of deep reinforcement learning and
hierarchical game theory is proposed as a modeling framework for behavioral
predictions of drivers in highway driving scenarios. The need for a modeling
framework that can address multiple human-human and human-automation
interactions, where all the agents can be modeled as decision makers
simultaneously, is the main motivation behind this work. Such a modeling
framework may be utilized for the validation and verification of autonomous
vehicles: It is estimated that for an autonomous vehicle to reach the same
safety level of cars with drivers, millions of miles of driving tests are
required. The modeling framework presented in this paper may be used in a
high-fidelity traffic simulator consisting of multiple human decision makers to
reduce the time and effort spent for testing by allowing safe and quick
assessment of self-driving algorithms. To demonstrate the fidelity of the
proposed modeling framework, game theoretical driver models are compared with
real human driver behavior patterns extracted from traffic data.

  Many cybersecurity breaches occur due to users not following good
cybersecurity practices, chief among them being regulations for applying
software patches to operating systems, updating applications, and maintaining
strong passwords.
  We capture cybersecurity expectations on users as norms. We empirically
investigate sanctioning mechanisms in promoting compliance with those norms as
well as the detrimental effect of sanctions on the ability of users to complete
their work. We realize these ideas in a game that emulates the decision making
of workers in a research lab.
  Through a human-subject study, we find that whereas individual sanctions are
more effective than group sanctions in achieving compliance and less
detrimental on the ability of users to complete their work, individual
sanctions offer significantly lower resilience especially for organizations
comprising risk seekers. Our findings have implications for workforce training
in cybersecurity.

Title: Robust Stochastic Bayesian Games for Behavior Space Coverage
Authors: Julian Bernhard and Alois Knoll
Categories: cs.MA
ACM-class: I.2.8; I.2.11; I.2.9
\\
  A key challenge in multi-agent systems is the design of intelligent agents
solving real-world tasks in close interaction with other agents (e.g. humans),
thereby being confronted with a variety of behavioral variations and limited
knowledge about the true behaviors of observed agents. The practicability of
existing works addressing this challenge is being limited due to using finite
sets of hypothesis for behavior prediction, the lack of a hypothesis design
process ensuring coverage over all behavioral variations and
sample-inefficiency when modeling continuous behavioral variations. In this
work, we present an approach to this challenge based on a new framework of
Robust Stochastic Bayesian Games (RSBGs). An RSBG defines hypothesis sets by
partitioning the physically feasible, continuous behavior space of the other
agents. It combines the optimality criteria of the Robust Markov Decision
Process (RMDP) and the Stochastic Bayesian Game (SBG) to exponentially reduce
the sample complexity for planning with hypothesis sets defined over continuous
behavior spaces. In an intersection crossing task with broad continuous
behavioral variations, we find that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms achieving the same performance as a planning
algorithm with knowledge of the true behaviors of other agents.

Title: How deep is your encoder: an analysis of features descriptors for an
  autoencoder-based audio-visual quality metric
Authors: Helard Martinez and Andrew Hines and Mylene C. Q. Farias
Categories: cs.MM cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  The development of audio-visual quality assessment models poses a number of
challenges in order to obtain accurate predictions. One of these challenges is
the modelling of the complex interaction that audio and visual stimuli have and
how this interaction is interpreted by human users. The No-Reference
Audio-Visual Quality Metric Based on a Deep Autoencoder (NAViDAd) deals with
this problem from a machine learning perspective. The metric receives two sets
of audio and video features descriptors and produces a low-dimensional set of
features used to predict the audio-visual quality. A basic implementation of
NAViDAd was able to produce accurate predictions tested with a range of
different audio-visual databases. The current work performs an ablation study
on the base architecture of the metric. Several modules are removed or
re-trained using different configurations to have a better understanding of the
metric functionality. The results presented in this study provided important
feedback that allows us to understand the real capacity of the metric's
architecture and eventually develop a much better audio-visual quality metric.

\\
  The subjective quality of transmitted speech is traditionally assessed in a
controlled laboratory environment according to ITU-T Rec. P.800. In turn, with
crowdsourcing, crowdworkers participate in a subjective online experiment using
their own listening device, and in their own working environment. Despite such
less controllable conditions, the increased use of crowdsourcing micro-task
platforms for quality assessment tasks has pushed a high demand for
standardized methods, resulting in ITU-T Rec. P.808. This work investigates the
impact of the number of judgments on the reliability and the validity of
quality ratings collected through crowdsourcing-based speech quality
assessments, as an input to ITU-T Rec. P.808 . Three crowdsourcing experiments
on different platforms were conducted to evaluate the overall quality of three
different speech datasets, using the Absolute Category Rating procedure. For
each dataset, the Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) are calculated using differing
numbers of crowdsourcing judgements. Then the results are compared to MOS
values collected in a standard laboratory experiment, to assess the validity of
crowdsourcing approach as a function of number of votes. In addition, the
reliability of the average scores is analyzed by checking inter-rater
reliability, gain in certainty, and the confidence of the MOS. The results
provide a suggestion on the required number of votes per condition, and allow
to model its impact on validity and reliability.

Title: Advanced Newton Methods for Geodynamical Models of Stokes Flow with
  Viscoplastic Rheologies
Authors: Johann Rudi, Yu-hsuan Shih, Georg Stadler
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: submitted
\\
  Strain localization and resulting plasticity and failure play an important
role in the evolution of the lithosphere. These phenomena are commonly modeled
by Stokes flows with viscoplastic rheologies. The nonlinearities of these
rheologies make the numerical solution of the resulting systems challenging,
and iterative methods often converge slowly or not at all. Yet accurate
solutions are critical for representing the physics. Moreover, for some
rheology laws, aspects of solvability are still unknown. We study a basic but
representative viscoplastic rheology law. The law involves a yield stress that
is independent of the dynamic pressure, referred to as von Mises yield
criterion. Two commonly used variants, perfect/ideal and composite
viscoplasticity, are compared. We derive both variants from energy minimization
principles, and we use this perspective to argue when solutions are unique. We
propose a new stress-velocity Newton solution algorithm that treats the stress
as an independent variable during the Newton linearization but requires
solution only of Stokes systems that are of the usual velocity-pressure form.
To study different solution algorithms, we implement 2D and 3D finite element
discretizations, and we generate Stokes problems with up to 7 orders of
magnitude viscosity contrasts, in which compression or tension results in
significant nonlinear localization effects. Comparing the performance of the
proposed Newton method with the standard Newton method and the Picard
fixed-point method, we observe a significant reduction in the number of
iterations and improved stability with respect to problem nonlinearity, mesh
refinement, and the polynomial order of the discretization.

Title: Permanent charge effects on ionic flow: a numerical study of flux ratios

\\
  Ionic flow carries electrical signals for cells to communicate with each
other. The permanent charge of an ion channel is a crucial protein structure
for flow properties while boundary conditions play a role of the driving force.
Their effects on flow properties have been analyzed via a quasi-one-dimensional
Poisson-Nernst-Planck model for small and relatively large permanent charges.
The analytical studies have led to the introduction of flux ratios that reflect
permanent charge effects and have a universal property. The studies also show
that the flux ratios have different behaviors for small and large permanent
charges. However, the existing analytical techniques can reveal neither
behaviors of flux ratios nor transitions between small and large permanent
charges. In this work we present a numerical investigation on flux ratios to
bridge between small and large permanent charges. Numerical results verify the
analytical predictions for the two extremal regions. More significantly,
emergence of non-trivial behaviors is detected as the permanent charge varies
from small to large. In particular, saddle-node bifurcations of flux ratios are
revealed, showing rich phenomena of permanent charge effects by the power of
combining analytical and numerical techniques. An adaptive moving mesh finite
element method is used in the numerical studies.

  Data assisted reconstruction algorithms, incorporating trained neural
networks, are a novel paradigm for solving inverse problems. One approach is to
first apply a classical reconstruction method and then apply a neural network
to improve its solution. Empirical evidence shows that such two-step methods
provide high-quality reconstructions, but they lack a convergence analysis. In
this paper we formalize the use of such two-step approaches with classical
regularization theory. We propose data-consistent neural networks that we
combine with classical regularization methods. This yields a data-driven
regularization method for which we provide a full convergence analysis with
respect to noise. Numerical simulations show that compared to standard two-step
deep learning methods, our approach provides better stability with respect to
structural changes in the test set, while performing similarly on test data
similar to the training set. Our method provides a stable solution of inverse
problems that exploits both the known nonlinear forward model as well as the
desired solution manifold from data.

Title: Convergence of Random Batch Method for interacting particles with
  disparate species and weights
Authors: Shi Jin, Lei Li, Jian-Guo Liu
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
MSC-class: 65C20, 37M05
\\
  We consider in this work the convergence of Random Batch Method proposed in
our previous work [Jin et al., J. Comput. Phys., 400(1), 2020] for interacting
particles to the case of disparate species and weights. We show that the strong
error is of $O(\sqrt{\tau})$ while the weak error is of $O(\tau)$ where $\tau$
is the time step between two random divisions of batches. Both types of
convergence are uniform in $N$, the number of particles. The proof of strong
convergence follows closely the proof in [Jin et al., J. Comput. Phys., 400(1),
2020] for indistinguishable particles, but there are still some differences:
since there is no exchangeability now, we have to use a certain weighted
average of the errors; some refined auxiliary lemmas have to be proved compared
with our previous work. To show that the weak convergence of empirical measure
is uniform in $N$, certain sharp estimates for the derivatives of the backward
equations have been used. The weak convergence analysis is also illustrating
for the convergence of Random Batch Method for $N$-body Liouville equations.

  Inverse scattering problems of the reconstructions of physical properties of
a medium from boundary measurements are substantially challenging ones. This
work aims to verify the performance on experimental data of a newly developed
convexification method for a 3D coefficient inverse problem for the case of
objects buried in a sandbox a fixed frequency and the point source moving along
an interval of a straight line. Using a special Fourier basis, the method of
this work strongly relies on a new derivation of a boundary value problem for a
system of coupled quasilinear elliptic equations. This problem, in turn, is
solved via the minimization of a Tikhonov-like functional weighted by a
Carleman Weight Function. The global convergence of the numerical procedure is
established analytically. The numerical verification is performed using
experimental data, which are raw backscatter data of the electric field. These
data were collected using a microwave scattering facility at The University of
North Carolina at Charlotte.

Title: Derivation of Coupled PCA and SVD Learning Rules from a Newton
  Zero-Finding Framework
Authors: Ralf M\"oller
Categories: cs.NE
\\
  In coupled learning rules for PCA (principal component analysis) and SVD
(singular value decomposition), the update of the estimates of eigenvectors or
singular vectors is influenced by the estimates of eigenvalues or singular
values, respectively. This coupled update mitigates the speed-stability problem
since the update equations converge from all directions with approximately the
same speed. A method to derive coupled learning rules from information criteria
by Newton optimization is known. However, these information criteria have to be
designed, offer no explanatory value, and can only impose Euclidean constraints
on the vector estimates. Here we describe an alternative approach where coupled
PCA and SVD learning rules can systematically be derived from a Newton
zero-finding framework. The derivation starts from an objective function,
combines the equations for its extrema with arbitrary constraints on the vector
estimates, and solves the resulting vector zero-point equation using Newton's
zero-finding method. To demonstrate the framework, we derive PCA and SVD
learning rules with constant Euclidean length or constant sum of the vector
estimates.

\\
  Sandia has an extensive background in cybersecurity research and is currently
extending its state-of-the-art modeling via emulation capability. However, a
key part of Sandia's modeling methodology is the discovery and specification of
the information-system under study, and the ability to recreate that
specification with the highest fidelity possible in order to extrapolate
meaningful results.
  This work details a method to conduct information system discovery and
develop tools to enable the creation of high-fidelity emulation models that can
be used to enable assessment of our infrastructure information system security
posture and potential system impacts that could result from cyber threats. The
outcome are a set of tools and techniques to go from network discovery of
operational systems to emulating complex systems.
  As a concrete usecase, we have applied these tools and techniques at
Supercomputing 2016 to model SCinet, the world's largest research network. This
model includes five routers and nearly 10,000 endpoints which we have launched
in our emulation platform.

Title: Contract-based Scheduling of URLLC Packets in Incumbent EMBB Traffic
Authors: Aunas Manzoor, S. M. Ahsan Kazmi, Shashi Raj Pandey, and Choong Seon

Categories: cs.NI
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Access
\\
  Recently, the coexistence of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication
(URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services on the same licensed
spectrum has gained a lot of attention from both academia and industry.
However, the coexistence of these services is not trivial due to the diverse
multiple access protocols, contrasting frame distributions in the existing
network, and the distinct quality of service requirements posed by these
services. Therefore, such coexistence drives towards a challenging resource
scheduling problem. To address this problem, in this paper, we first
investigate the possibilities of scheduling URLLC packets in incumbent eMBB
traffic. In this regard, we formulate an optimization problem for coexistence
by dynamically adopting a superposition or puncturing scheme. In particular,
the aim is to provide spectrum access to the URLLC users while reducing the
intervention on incumbent eMBB users. Next, we apply the one-to-one matching
game to find stable URLLC-eMBB pairs that can coexist on the same spectrum.
Then, we apply the contract theory framework to design contracts for URLLC
users to adopt the superposition scheme. Simulation results reveal that the
proposed contract-based scheduling scheme achieves up to 63% of the eMBB rate
for the "No URLLC" case compared to the "Puncturing" scheme.

Title: Value-Decomposition Networks based Distributed Interference Control in
  Multi-platoon Groupcast
Authors: Xiongfeng Guo, Tianhao Wu and Lin Zhang
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Platooning is considered one of the most representative 5G use cases. Due to
the small spacing within the platoon, the platoon needs more reliable
transmission to guarantee driving safety while improving fuel and driving
efficiency. However, efficient resource allocation between platoons has been a
challenge, especially considering that the channel and power selected by each
platoon will affect other platoons. Therefore, platoons need to coordinate with
each other to ensure the groupcast quality of each platoon. To solve these
challenges, we model the multi-platoon resource selection problem as Markov
games and then propose a distributed resource allocation algorithm based on
Value-Decomposition Networks. Our scheme utilizes the historical data of each
platoon for centralized training. In distributed execution, agents only need
their local observations to make decisions. At the same time, we decrease the
training burden by sharing the neural network parameters. Simulation results
show that the proposed algorithm has excellent convergence. Compared with
another multi-agent algorithm (MARL) and random algorithm, our proposed
solution can dramatically reduce the probability of platoon groupcast failure
and improve the quality of platoon groupcast.

Title: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Multiple Access for
  Heterogeneous Wireless Networks with Imperfect Channels
Authors: Yiding Yu, Soung Chang Liew, and Taotao Wang
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  This paper investigates a futuristic spectrum sharing paradigm for
heterogeneous wireless networks with imperfect channels. In the heterogeneous
networks, multiple wireless networks adopt different medium access control
(MAC) protocols to share a common wireless spectrum and each network is unaware
of the MACs of others. This paper aims to design a distributed deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) based MAC protocol for a particular network, and
the objective of this network is to achieve a global $\alpha$-fairness
objective. In the conventional DRL framework, feedback/reward given to the
agent is always correctly received, so that the agent can optimize its strategy
based on the received reward. In our wireless application where the channels
are noisy, the feedback/reward (i.e., the ACK packet) may be lost due to
channel noise and interference. Without correct feedback, the agent (i.e., the
network user) may fail to find a good solution. Moreover, in the distributed
protocol, each agent makes decisions on its own. It is a challenge to guarantee
that the multiple agents will make coherent decisions and work together to
achieve the same objective, particularly in the face of imperfect feedback
channels. To tackle the challenge, we put forth (i) a feedback recovery
mechanism to recover missing feedback information, and (ii) a two-stage action
selection mechanism to aid coherent decision making to reduce transmission
collisions among the agents. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of these two mechanisms. Last but not least, we believe that the
feedback recovery mechanism and the two-stage action selection mechanism can
also be used in general distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning problems
in which feedback information on rewards can be corrupted.

Title: Inter-Slice Mobility Management in 5G: Motivations, Standard Principles,
  Challenges and Research Directions
Authors: Muhammad Mohtasim Sajjad, Carlos J. Bernardos, Dhammika Jayalath,
  Yu-Chu Tian
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  As a prime feature of 5G networks, Network Slicing has opened up several new
avenues of research. Mobility management in a network-sliced environment, in
particular, introduces new and complex research challenges. In a network-sliced
environment, user mobility has to be managed not only among different base
stations or access technologies, but also among different slices. This
motivates the need for new mobility management solutions, which, by convention,
are required to be standards-compliant. This article investigates the problem
of inter-slice mobility from the perspective of 3GPP standards for 5G. The
existing 3GPP standard procedures only enable users to change (or switch)
slices. They lack formal mechanisms for session continuation among slices, and
thus need to be enhanced to achieve seamless inter-slice mobility or handovers.
In this direction, we identify some open challenges as well as some potential
research directions towards developing efficient, comprehensive and 3GPP
compliant inter-slice mobility management solutions.

  The simplified parse tree (SPT) presented in Aroma, a state-of-the-art code
recommendation system, is a tree-structured representation used to infer code
semantics by capturing program \emph{structure} rather than program
\emph{syntax}. This is a departure from the classical abstract syntax tree,
which is principally driven by programming language syntax. While we believe a
semantics-driven representation is desirable, the specifics of an SPT's
construction can impact its performance. We analyze these nuances and present a
new tree structure, heavily influenced by Aroma's SPT, called a
\emph{context-aware parse tree} (CAPT). CAPT enhances SPT by providing a richer
level of semantic representation. Specifically, CAPT provides additional
binding support for language-specific techniques for adding
semantically-salient features, and language-agnostic techniques for removing
syntactically-present but semantically-irrelevant features. Our research
quantitatively demonstrates the value of our proposed semantically-salient
features, enabling a specific CAPT configuration to be 39\% more accurate than
SPT across the 48,610 programs we analyzed.

Title: Removing Dynamic Objects for Static Scene Reconstruction using Light
  Fields
Authors: Pushyami Kaveti, Sammie Katt, Hanumant Singh
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  There is a general expectation that robots should operate in environments
that consist of static and dynamic entities including people, furniture and
automobiles. These dynamic environments pose challenges to visual simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms by introducing errors into the
front-end. Light fields provide one possible method for addressing such
problems by capturing a more complete visual information of a scene. In
contrast to a single ray from a perspective camera, Light Fields capture a
bundle of light rays emerging from a single point in space, allowing us to see
through dynamic objects by refocusing past them.
  In this paper we present a method to synthesize a refocused image of the
static background in the presence of dynamic objects that uses a light-field
acquired with a linear camera array. We simultaneously estimate both the depth
and the refocused image of the static scene using semantic segmentation for
detecting dynamic objects in a single time step. This eliminates the need for
initializing a static map . The algorithm is parallelizable and is implemented
on GPU allowing us execute it at close to real time speeds. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on real-world data acquired using a small robot
with a five camera array.

\\
  This paper presents a localization technique using aerial imagery maps and
LIDAR based ground reflectivity for autonomous vehicles in urban environments.
Traditional localization techniques using LIDAR reflectivity rely on high
definition reflectivity maps generated from a mapping vehicle. The cost and
effort required to maintain such prior maps are generally very high because it
requires a fleet of expensive mapping vehicles. In this work we propose a
localization technique where the vehicle localizes using aerial/satellite
imagery, eradicating the need to develop and maintain complex high-definition
maps. The proposed technique has been tested on a real world dataset collected
from a test track in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This research concludes that aerial
imagery based maps provides real-time localization performance similar to
state-of-the-art LIDAR based maps for autonomous vehicles in urban environments
at reduced costs.

Title: An Energy-based Approach to Ensure the Stability of Learned Dynamical
  Systems
Authors: Matteo Saveriano
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Non-linear dynamical systems represent a compact, flexible, and robust tool
for reactive motion generation. The effectiveness of dynamical systems relies
on their ability to accurately represent stable motions. Several approaches
have been proposed to learn stable and accurate motions from demonstration.
Some approaches work by separating accuracy and stability into two learning
problems, which increases the number of open parameters and the overall
training time. Alternative solutions exploit single-step learning but restrict
the applicability to one regression technique. This paper presents a
single-step approach to learn stable and accurate motions that work with any
regression technique. The approach makes energy considerations on the learned
dynamics to stabilize the system at run-time while introducing small deviations
from the demonstrated motion. Since the initial value of the energy injected
into the system affects the reproduction accuracy, it is estimated from
training data using an efficient procedure. Experiments on a real robot and a
comparison on a public benchmark shows the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

\\
  Learning by Demonstration provides a sample efficient way to equip robots
with complex sensorimotor skills in supervised manner. Several movement
primitive representations can be used for flexible motor representation and
learning. A recent state-of-the art approach is Conditional Neural Movement
Primitives (CNMP) that can learn non-linear relations between environment
parameters and complex multi-modal trajectories from a few expert
demonstrations by forming powerful latent space representations. In this study,
to improve the applicability of CNMP to changing tasks and/or environments, we
couple it with a reinforcement learning agent that exploits the formed
representations by the original CNMP network, and learns to generate synthetic
demonstrations for further learning. This enables the CNMP network to
generalize to new environments by adapting its internal representations. In the
current implementation, the reinforcement learning agent is triggered when a
failure in task execution is detected, and the CNMP is trained with the newly
discovered demonstration (trajectory), which shares essential characteristics
with the original demonstrations due to the representation sharing. As a
result, the overall system increases its capacity and handle situations in
scenarios where the initial CNMP network can not produce a useful trajectory.
To show the validity of our proposed model, we compare our approach with
original CNMP work and other movement primitives approaches. Furthermore, we
presents the experimental results from the implementation of the proposed model
on real robotics setups, which indicate the applicability of our approach as an
effective adaptive learning by demonstration system.

Title: A Socially Adaptable Framework for Human-Robot Interaction
Authors: Ana Tanevska, Francesco Rea, Giulio Sandini, Lola Ca\~namero,
  Alessandra Sciutti
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  In our everyday lives we are accustomed to partake in complex, personalized,
adaptive interactions with our peers. For a social robot to be able to recreate
this same kind of rich, human-like interaction, it should be aware of our needs
and affective states and be capable of continuously adapting its behavior to
them. One proposed solution to this problem would involve the robot to learn
how to select the behaviors that would maximize the pleasantness of the
interaction for its peers, guided by an internal motivation system that would
provide autonomy to its decision-making process. We are interested in studying
how an adaptive robotic framework of this kind would function and personalize
to different users. In addition we explore whether including the element of
adaptability and personalization in a cognitive framework will bring any
additional richness to the human-robot interaction (HRI), or if it will instead
bring uncertainty and unpredictability that would not be accepted by the
robot`s human peers. To this end, we designed a socially-adaptive framework for
the humanoid robot iCub which allows it to perceive and reuse the affective and
interactive signals from the person as input for the adaptation based on
internal social motivation. We propose a comparative interaction study with
iCub where users act as the robot's caretaker, and iCub's social adaptation is
guided by an internal comfort level that varies with the amount of stimuli iCub
receives from its caretaker. We investigate and compare how the internal
dynamics of the robot would be perceived by people in a condition when the
robot does not personalize its interaction, and in a condition where it is
adaptive. Finally, we establish the potential benefits that an adaptive
framework could bring to the context of having repeated interactions with a
humanoid robot.

\\
  This paper presents a task and motion planning (TAMP) framework for a robotic
manipulator in order to retrieve a target object from clutter. We consider a
configuration of objects in a confined space with a high density so no
collision-free path to the target exists. The robot must relocate some objects
to retrieve the target without collisions. For fast completion of object
rearrangement, the robot aims to optimize the number of pick-and-place actions
which often determines the efficiency of a TAMP framework.
  We propose a task planner incorporating motion planning to generate
executable plans which aims to minimize the number of pick-and-place actions.
In addition to fully known and static environments, our method can deal with
uncertain and dynamic situations incurred by occluded views. Our method is
shown to reduce the number of pick-and-place actions compared to baseline
methods (e.g., at least 28.0% of reduction in a known static environment with
20 objects).

the common linear profile and a profile based on the animation principles of
slow in, slow out. The investigation was accomplished by running an experiment
in a home context where people and the robot cooperated on a clean-up task. We
used the Godspeed series of questionnaires to gather people's perception of the
robot. Average scores for each series appear not to be different enough to
reject the null hypotheses, but looking at the component items provides paths
to future areas of research. We also discuss the scenario for the experiment
and how it may be used for future research into using animation techniques for
moving robots and improving the legibility of a robot's locomotion.

  This correspondence comments on the findings reported in a recent Science
Robotics article by Mitrokhin et al. [1]. The main goal of this commentary is
to expand on some of the issues touched on in that article. Our experience is
that hyperdimensional computing is very different from other approaches to
computation and that it can take considerable exposure to its concepts before
attaining practically useful understanding. Therefore, in order to provide an
overview of the area to the first time reader of [1], the commentary includes a
brief historic overview as well as connects the findings of the article to a
larger body of literature existing in the area.

Title: Learning Barrier Functions for Constrained Motion Planning with
  Dynamical Systems
Authors: Matteo Saveriano, Dongheui Lee

DOI: 10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967981
\\
  Stable dynamical systems are a flexible tool to plan robotic motions in
real-time. In the robotic literature, dynamical system motions are typically
planned without considering possible limitations in the robot's workspace. This
work presents a novel approach to learn workspace constraints from human
demonstrations and to generate motion trajectories for the robot that lie in
the constrained workspace. Training data are incrementally clustered into
different linear subspaces and used to fit a low dimensional representation of
each subspace. By considering the learned constraint subspaces as zeroing
barrier functions, we are able to design a control input that keeps the system
trajectory within the learned bounds. This control input is effectively
combined with the original system dynamics preserving eventual asymptotic
properties of the unconstrained system. Simulations and experiments on a real
robot show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Merging Position and Orientation Motion Primitives

DOI: 10.1109/ICRA.2019.8793786
\\
  In this paper, we focus on generating complex robotic trajectories by merging
sequential motion primitives. A robotic trajectory is a time series of
positions and orientations ending at a desired target. Hence, we first discuss
the generation of converging pose trajectories via dynamical systems, providing
a rigorous stability analysis. Then, we present approaches to merge motion
primitives which represent both the position and the orientation part of the
motion. Developed approaches preserve the shape of each learned movement and
allow for continuous transitions among succeeding motion primitives. Presented
methodologies are theoretically described and experimentally evaluated, showing
that it is possible to generate a smooth pose trajectory out of multiple motion
primitives.

  This paper presents a novel telepresence system for enhancing aerial
manipulation capabilities. It involves not only a haptic device, but also a
virtual reality that provides a 3D visual feedback to a remotely-located
teleoperator in real-time. We achieve this by utilizing onboard visual and
inertial sensors, an object tracking algorithm and a pre-generated object
database. As the virtual reality has to closely match the real remote scene, we
propose an extension of a marker tracking algorithm with visual-inertial
odometry. Both indoor and outdoor experiments show benefits of our proposed
system in achieving advanced aerial manipulation tasks, namely grasping,
placing, force exertion and peg-in-hole insertion.

Title: COVID-19 and Computer Audition: An Overview on What Speech & Sound

  At the time of writing, the world population is suffering from more than
10,000 registered COVID-19 disease epidemic induced deaths since the outbreak
of the Corona virus more than three months ago now officially known as
SARS-CoV-2. Since, tremendous efforts have been made worldwide to counter-steer
and control the epidemic by now labelled as pandemic. In this contribution, we
provide an overview on the potential for computer audition (CA), i.e., the
usage of speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this
scenario. We first survey which types of related or contextually significant
phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound. These include the
automatic recognition and monitoring of breathing, dry and wet coughing or
sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain to
name but a few. Then, we consider potential use-cases for exploitation. These
include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their
development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and
its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient wellbeing. We quickly guide
further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage. We come
to the conclusion that CA appears ready for implementation of (pre-)diagnosis
and monitoring tools, and more generally provides rich and significant, yet so
far untapped potential in the fight against COVID-19 spread.

  Antisocial behavior such as negative gossip, cheating, or bullying can be
contagious, spreading from individual to individual and rippling through social
networks. Previous experimental research has suggested that individuals who
either experience or observe antisocial behavior become more likely to behave
antisocially. Here, we distinguish between victimization and observation using
an observational study. We apply temporal network analysis on large-scale
digital trace data to study the spread of cheating in online gaming. We analyze
1,146,941 matches of the multiplayer online game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,
in which up to 100 players compete individually or in teams against strangers.
We identify temporal motifs in which a player who is killed by or observes
cheaters starts cheating, and evaluate the extent to which these motifs would
appear if we preserve the team and interaction structure but assume an
alternative sequence of events. The results suggest that social contagion is
only likely to exist for those who both experience and observe cheating
multiple times. The findings point to strategies for targeted interventions to
stem the spread of cheating and antisocial behavior in online communities,
schools, organizations, and sports.

  During the last months, there is an increasing alarm about a new mutation of
coronavirus, covid-19 coined by World Health Organization(WHO) with an impact
in many areas: economy, health, politics and others. This situation was
declared a pandemic by WHO, because of the fast expansion over many countries.
At the same time, people is using Social Networks to express what they think,
feel or experiment, so this people are Social Sensors and helps to analyze what
is happening in their city. The objective of this paper is analyze the
publications of Colombian people living in Bogota with a radius of 50 km using
Text Mining techniques from symptomatology approach. The results support the
understanding of the spread in Colombia related to symptoms of covid19.

\\
  The collection and examination of social media has become a useful mechanism
for studying the mental activity and behavior tendencies of users. Through the
analysis of collected Twitter data, models were developed for classifying
drug-related tweets. Using topic pertaining keywords, such as slang and methods
of drug consumption, a set of tweets was generated. Potential candidates were
then preprocessed resulting in a dataset of 3,696,150 rows. The classification
power of multiple methods was compared including support vector machines (SVM),
XGBoost, and convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifiers. Rather than
simple feature or attribute analysis, a deep learning approach was implemented
to screen and analyze the tweets' semantic meaning. The two CNN-based
classifiers presented the best result when compared against other
methodologies. The first was trained with 2,661 manually labeled samples, while
the other included synthetically generated tweets culminating in 12,142
samples. The accuracy scores were 76.35% and 82.31%, with an AUC of 0.90 and
0.91. Additionally, association rule mining showed that commonly mentioned
drugs had a level of correspondence with frequently used illicit substances,
proving the practical usefulness of the system. Lastly, the synthetically
generated set provided increased scores, improving the classification
capability and proving the worth of this methodology.

\\
  In this paper, we propose to design an automated service discovery process to
allow mobile crowdsourcing task requesters select a small set of devices out of
a large-scale Internet-of-things (IoT) network to execute their tasks. To this
end, we proceed by dividing the large-scale IoT network into several virtual
communities whose members share strong social IoT relations. Two community
detection algorithms, namely Louvain and order statistics local method (OSLOM)
algorithms, are investigated and applied to a real-world IoT dataset to form
non-overlapping and overlapping IoT devices groups. Afterwards, a natural
language process (NLP)-based approach is executed to handle crowdsourcing
textual requests and accordingly find the list of IoT devices capable of
effectively accomplishing the tasks. This is performed by matching the NLP
outputs, e.g., type of application, location, required trustworthiness level,
with the different detected communities. The proposed approach effectively
helps in automating and reducing the service discovery procedure and
recruitment process for mobile crowdsourcing applications.

Title: Analysis and Control of Power-Temperature Dynamics in Heterogeneous
  Multiprocessors

Comments: Will appear in a future issue of IEEE Transactions on Control Systems

DOI: 10.1109/TCST.2020.2974421
\\
  Virtually all electronic systems try to optimize a fundamental trade-off
between higher performance and lower power consumption. The latter becomes
critical in mobile computing systems, such as smartphones, which rely on
passive cooling. Otherwise, the heat concentrated in a small area drives both
the junction and skin temperatures up. High junction temperatures degrade the
reliability, while skin temperature deteriorates the user experience.
Therefore, there is a strong need for a formal analysis of power
consumption-temperature dynamics and predictive thermal management algorithms.
This paper presents a theoretical power-temperature analysis of multiprocessor
systems, which are modeled as multi-input multi-output dynamic systems. We
analyze the conditions under which the system converges to a stable
steady-state temperature. Then, we use these models to design a control
algorithm that manages the temperature of the system without affecting the
performance of the application. Experiments on the Odroid-XU3 board show that
the control algorithm is able to regulate the temperature with a minimal loss
in performance when compared to the default thermal governors.

Title: Event-Triggered Consensus of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Multi-Agent

\\
  This paper investigates the distributed event-based consensus problem of
switching networks satisfying the jointly connected condition. Both the state
consensus of homogeneous linear networks and output consensus of heterogeneous
networks are studied. Two kinds of event-based protocols based on local sampled
information are designed, without the need to solve any matrix equation or
inequality. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed event-based
protocols guarantee the achievement of consensus and the exclusion of Zeno
behaviors for jointly connected undirected switching graphs. These protocols,
relying on no global knowledge of the network topology and independent of
switching rules, can be devised and utilized in a completely distributed
manner. They are able to avoid continuous information exchanges for either
controllers' updating or triggering functions' monitoring, which ensures the
feasibility of the presented protocols.

Title: Measures and LMIs for Lateral F-16 MRAC Validation
Authors: Daniel Wagner, Didier Henrion (LAAS-MAC), Martin Hrom\v{c}\'ik
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  Occupation measures and linear matrix inequality (LMI) relax-ations (called
the moment sums of squares or Lasserre hierarchy) are state-of-the-art methods
for verification and validation (VV) in aerospace. In this document, we extend
these results to a full F-16 closed-loop nonlinear dutch roll polynomial model
complete with model reference adaptive control (MRAC). This is done through a
new technique of approximating the reference trajectory by exploiting sparse
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with parsimony. The VV problem is then
solved directly using moment LMI relaxations and off-the-shelf-software. The
main results are then compared to their numerical counterparts obtained using
traditional Monte-Carlo simulations.

Title: On wind farm wake mixing strategies using dynamic individual pitch
  control
Authors: Joeri Frederik, Bart Doekemeijer, Sebastiaan Mulders and Jan-Willem
  van Wingerden
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Torque 2020 conference
\\
  Dynamic wind farm control is a new strategy that aims to apply time-varying,
often periodic, control signals on upstream wind turbines to increase the wake
mixing behind the turbine. As a result, wake recovery is accelerated, leading
to a higher power production of downstream turbines. As the amount of interest
in dynamic control strategies for wind turbines in a wind farm is increasing,
different approaches are being proposed. One such novel approach is called
Dynamic Individual Pitch Control (DIPC). In DIPC, each blade pitch angle of a
turbine is controlled independently to dynamically manipulate the direction of
the thrust force vector exerted on the wind. Hence, the direction of the wake
is varied, inducing wake mixing without significant thrust force magnitude
variations on the rotor. In this paper, the effectiveness of different
variations in the thrust direction are evaluated and compared using Large Eddy
Simulation (LES) experiments.

Title: A Novel Wide-Area Control Strategy for Damping of Critical Frequency
  Oscillations via Modulation of Active Power Injections
Authors: Ruichao Xie, Innocent Kamwa, C. Y. Chung
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper proposes a novel wide-area control strategy for modulating the
active power injections to damp the critical frequency oscillations in power
systems, this includes the inter-area oscillations and the transient frequency
swing. The proposed method pursues an efficient utilization of the limited
power reserve of existing distributed energy resources (DERs) to mitigate these
oscillations. This is accomplished by decoupling the damping control actions at
different sites using the oscillation signals of the concerned mode as the
power commands. A theoretical basis for this decoupled modulating control is
provided. Technically, the desired sole modal oscillation signals are filtered
out by linearly combining the system-wide frequencies, which is determined by
the linear quadratic regulator based sparsity-promoting (LQRSP) technique. With
the proposed strategy, the modulation of each active power injection can be
effectively engineered considering the response limit and steady-state output
capability of the supporting device. The method is validated based on a
two-area test system and is further demonstrated based on the New England
39-bus test system.

Title: Probabilistic forecasting approaches for extreme NO$_2$ episodes: a
  comparison of models
Authors: Sebasti\'an P\'erez Vasseur and Jos\'e L. Aznarte
Categories: stat.AP cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  High concentration episodes for NO$_2$ are increasingly dealt with by
authorities through traffic restrictions which are activated when air quality
deteriorates beyond certain thresholds. Foreseeing the probability that
pollutant concentrations reach those thresholds becomes thus a necessity.
Probabilistic forecasting is a family of techniques that allow for the
prediction of the expected distribution function instead of a single value. In
the case of NO$_2$, it allows for the calculation of future chances of
exceeding thresholds and to detect pollution peaks. We thoroughly compared 10
state of the art probabilistic predictive models, using them to predict the
distribution of NO$_2$ concentrations in a urban location for a set of
forecasting horizons (up to 60 hours). Quantile gradient boosted trees shows
the best performance, yielding the best results for both the expected value and
the forecast full distribution. Furthermore, we show how this approach can be
used to detect pollution peaks.

Title: Parallel Computation of Optimal Ate Cryptographic Pairings at the $128$,
  $192$ and $256$-bit security levels using elliptic net algorithm
Authors: Narcisse Bang Mbang and Emmanuel Fouotsa and Celestin Lele
Categories: math.AG cs.CR math.NT
\\
  Efficient computations of pairings with Miller Algorithm have recently
received a great attention due to the many applications in cryptography. In
this work, we give formulae for the optimal Ate pairing in terms of elliptic
nets associated to twisted Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curve, Barreto-Lynn-Scott(BLS)
curves and Kachisa-Schaefer-Scott(KSS) curves considered at the $128$, $192$
and $256$-bit security levels, and Scott-Guillevic curve with embedding degree
$54$. We show how to parallelize the computation of these pairings when the
elliptic net algorithm instead is used and we obtain except in the case of
Kachisa-Schaefer-Scott(KSS) curves considered at the $256$-bit security level,
more efficient theoretical results with $8$ processors compared to the case
where the Miller algorithm is used. This work still confirms that $BLS48$
curves are the best for pairing-based cryptography at $256$-bit security level

Title: COVIDX-Net: A Framework of Deep Learning Classifiers to Diagnose
  COVID-19 in X-Ray Images
Authors: Ezz El-Din Hemdan, Marwa A. Shouman and Mohamed Esmail Karar
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG

\\
  Background and Purpose: Coronaviruses (CoV) are perilous viruses that may
cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS-CoV). The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was
discovered as a novel disease pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China at the end
of 2019. Now, it becomes a Coronavirus outbreak around the world, the number of
infected people and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the
updated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of
this article is to introduce a new deep learning framework; namely COVIDX-Net
to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images.
Materials and Methods: Due to the lack of public COVID-19 datasets, the study
is validated on 50 Chest X-ray images with 25 confirmed positive COVID-19
cases. The COVIDX-Net includes seven different architectures of deep
convolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group
Network (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural
network model is able to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image
to classify the patient status either negative or positive COVID-19 case.
Results: Experiments and evaluation of the COVIDX-Net have been successfully
done based on 80-20% of X-ray images for the model training and testing phases,
respectively. The VGG19 and Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) models
showed a good and similar performance of automated COVID-19 classification with
f1-scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19, respectively. Conclusions:
This study demonstrated the useful application of deep learning models to

Title: ML-SIM: A deep neural network for reconstruction of structured
  illumination microscopy images
Authors: Charles N. Christensen, Edward N. Ward, Pietro Lio, Clemens F.
  Kaminski
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG physics.optics
\\
  Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has become an important technique
for optical super-resolution imaging because it allows a doubling of image
resolution at speeds compatible for live-cell imaging. However, the
reconstruction of SIM images is often slow and prone to artefacts. Here we
propose a versatile reconstruction method, ML-SIM, which makes use of machine
learning. The model is an end-to-end deep residual neural network that is
trained on a simulated data set to be free of common SIM artefacts. ML-SIM is
thus robust to noise and irregularities in the illumination patterns of the raw
SIM input frames. The reconstruction method is widely applicable and does not
require the acquisition of experimental training data. Since the training data
are generated from simulations of the SIM process on images from generic
libraries the method can be efficiently adapted to specific experimental SIM
implementations. The reconstruction quality enabled by our method is compared
with traditional SIM reconstruction methods, and we demonstrate advantages in
terms of noise, reconstruction fidelity and contrast for both simulated and
experimental inputs. In addition, reconstruction of one SIM frame typically
only takes ~100ms to perform on PCs with modern Nvidia graphics cards, making
the technique compatible with real-time imaging. The full implementation and
the trained networks are available at http://ML-SIM.com.

Title: Patch-based Non-Local Bayesian Networks for Blind Confocal Microscopy
  Denoising
Authors: Saeed Izadi, Ghassan Hamarneh
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Confocal microscopy is essential for histopathologic cell visualization and
quantification. Despite its significant role in biology, fluorescence confocal
microscopy suffers from the presence of inherent noise during image
acquisition. Non-local patch-wise Bayesian mean filtering (NLB) was until
recently the state-of-the-art denoising approach. However, classic denoising
methods have been outperformed by neural networks in recent years. In this
work, we propose to exploit the strengths of NLB in the framework of Bayesian
deep learning. We do so by designing a convolutional neural network and
training it to learn parameters of a Gaussian model approximating the prior on
noise-free patches given their nearest, similar yet non-local, neighbors. We
then apply Bayesian reasoning to leverage the prior and information from the
noisy patch in the process of approximating the noise-free patch. Specifically,
we use the closed-form analytic \textit{maximum a posteriori} (MAP) estimate in
the NLB algorithm to obtain the noise-free patch that maximizes the posterior
distribution. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated on confocal
microscopy images with real noise Poisson-Gaussian noise. Our experiments
reveal the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art unsupervised
denoising techniques.

Title: Content Adaptive and Error Propagation Aware Deep Video Compression
Authors: Guo Lu, Chunlei Cai, Xiaoyun Zhang, Li Chen, Wanli Ouyang, Dong Xu,
  Zhiyong Gao
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: First two authors contributed equally
\\
  Recently, learning based video compression methods attract increasing
attention. However, the previous works suffer from error propagation due to the
accumulation of reconstructed error in inter predictive coding. Meanwhile, the
previous learning based video codecs are also not adaptive to different video
contents. To address these two problems, we propose a content adaptive and
error propagation aware video compression system. Specifically, our method
employs a joint training strategy by considering the compression performance of
multiple consecutive frames instead of a single frame. Based on the learned
long-term temporal information, our approach effectively alleviates error
propagation in reconstructed frames. More importantly, instead of using the
hand-crafted coding modes in the traditional compression systems, we design an
online encoder updating scheme in our system. The proposed approach updates the
parameters for encoder according to the rate-distortion criterion but keeps the
decoder unchanged in the inference stage. Therefore, the encoder is adaptive to
different video contents and achieves better compression performance by
reducing the domain gap between the training and testing datasets. Our method
is simple yet effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art learning based
video codecs on benchmark datasets without increasing the model size or
decreasing the decoding speed.

Title: Improved lower bound on the dimension of the EU council's voting rules
Authors: Stefan Kober and Stefan Weltge
Categories: math.OC cs.DM cs.GT
\\
  Kurz and Napel (2015) proved that the voting system of the EU council (based
on the 2014 population data) cannot be represented as the intersection of six
weighted games, i.e., its dimension is at least 7. This set a new record for
real-world voting rules and the authors posed the exact determination as a
challenge. Recently, Chen, Cheung, and Ng (2019) showed that the dimension is
at most 24.
  We provide the first improved lower bound and show that the dimension is at
least 8.

Title: Punishing defectors and rewarding cooperators: Do people discriminate
  between genders?
Authors: H\'el\`ene Barcelo and Valerio Capraro
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.GT q-bio.PE
\\
  Do people discriminate between men and women when they are in charge of
punishing defectors or rewarding cooperators? Answering this question has
potentially far-reaching implications on gender equity, since cooperative
behaviour forms the basis of our societies and is typically enforced through
punishment or rewarding. In this paper we report on two pre-registered
experiments, that we hope shed some light on this question. Study 1 (N=1,077)
shows that people do not discriminate between genders when they are in charge
of punishing (rewarding) defectors (cooperators) in a one-shot public goods
game. In this study, punishment/reward is implemented by asking participants
whether they want to pay a cost to decrease/increase the payoff of a
defector/cooperator. Study 2 (N=253) extends Study 1 to a different method of
punishing/rewarding; participants are asked to rate the behaviour of a
defector/cooperator from 1 to 5 stars. In this case too, we find that people do
not discriminate between genders. All these results are robust to splitting the
sample by gender: in our context, neither men nor women discriminate between
genders when they are in charge of punishing defectors or rewarding
cooperators.

\\
  In this paper we study the spectral features, on fractal-like graphs, of
Hamiltonians which exhibit the special property of perfect quantum state
transfer: the transmission of quantum states without dissipation. The essential
goal is to develop the theoretical framework for understanding the interplay
between perfect quantum state transfer, spectral properties, and the geometry
of the underlying graph, in order to design novel protocols for applications in
quantum information science. We present a new lifting and gluing construction,
and use this to prove results concerning an inductive spectral structure,
applicable to a wide variety of fractal-like graphs. We illustrate this
construction with explicit examples for several classes of diamond graphs.

  Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. The
fundamental particles of QCD, quarks and gluons, carry colour charge and form
colourless bound states at low energies. The hadronic bound states of primary
interest to us are the mesons and the baryons. From knowledge of the meson
spectrum, we use neural networks and Gaussian processes to predict the masses
of baryons with 90.3% and 96.6% accuracy, respectively. These results compare
favourably to the constituent quark model. We as well predict the masses of
pentaquarks and other exotic hadrons.

Title: Dimension Independent Generalization Error with Regularized Online
  Optimization
Authors: Xi Chen and Qiang Liu and Xin T. Tong
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.TH
Comments: 47 pages, 2 figures
\\
  One classical canon of statistics is that large models are prone to
overfitting and model selection procedures are necessary for high-dimensional
data. However, many overparameterized models such as neural networks, which are
often trained with simple online methods and regularization, perform very well
in practice. The empirical success of overparameterized models, which is often
known as benign overfitting, motivates us to have a new look at the statistical
generalization theory for online optimization. In particular, we present a
general theory on the generalization error of stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
for both convex and non-convex loss functions. We further provide the
definition of "low effective dimension" so that the generalization error either
does not depend on the ambient dimension $p$ or depends on $p$ via a
poly-logarithmic factor. We also demonstrate on several widely used statistical
models that the "low effect dimension" arises naturally in overparameterized
settings. The studied statistical applications include both convex models such
as linear regression and logistic regression, and non-convex models such as
$M$-estimator and two-layer neural networks.

Title: Zeroth-order Optimization on Riemannian Manifolds
Authors: Jiaxiang Li, Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Shiqian Ma
Categories: math.OC cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose and analyze zeroth-order algorithms for optimization over
Riemannian manifolds, where we observe only potentially noisy evaluations of
the objective function. Our approach is based on estimating the Riemannian
gradient from the objective function evaluations. We consider three settings
for the objective function: (i) deterministic and smooth, (ii) stochastic and
smooth, and (iii) composition of smooth and non-smooth parts. For each of the
setting, we characterize the oracle complexity of our algorithm to obtain
appropriately defined notions of $\epsilon$-stationary points. Notably, our
complexities are independent of the ambient dimension of the Euclidean space in
which the manifold is embedded in, and only depend on the intrinsic dimension
of the manifold. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the applicability of our
method to the problem of black-box attacks to deep neural networks, by
providing simulation and real-world image data based experimental results.

Title: Design-unbiased statistical learning in survey sampling
Authors: Luis Sanguiao Sande and Li-Chun Zhang
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.TH
\\
  Design-consistent model-assisted estimation has become the standard practice
in survey sampling. However, a general theory is lacking so far, which allows
one to incorporate modern machine-learning techniques that can lead to
potentially much more powerful assisting models. We propose a subsampling
Rao-Blackwell method, and develop a statistical learning theory for exactly
design-unbiased estimation with the help of linear or non-linear prediction
models. Our approach makes use of classic ideas from Statistical Science as
well as the rapidly growing field of Machine Learning. Provided rich auxiliary
information, it can yield considerable efficiency gains over standard linear
model-assisted methods, while ensuring valid estimation for the given target
population, which is robust against potential mis-specifications of the
assisting model at the individual level.

Title: Towards Patient Record Summarization Through Joint Phenotype Learning in
  HIV Patients
Authors: Gal Levy-Fix, Jason Zucker, Konstantin Stojanovic, and No\'emie
  Elhadad
Categories: stat.AP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Identifying a patient's key problems over time is a common task for providers
at the point care, yet a complex and time-consuming activity given current
electric health records. To enable a problem-oriented summarizer to identify a
patient's comprehensive list of problems and their salience, we propose an
unsupervised phenotyping approach that jointly learns a large number of
phenotypes/problems across structured and unstructured data. To identify the
appropriate granularity of the learned phenotypes, the model is trained on a
target patient population of the same clinic. To enable the content
organization of a problem-oriented summarizer, the model identifies phenotype
relatedness as well. The model leverages a correlated-mixed membership approach
with variational inference applied to heterogenous clinical data. In this
paper, we focus our experiments on assessing the learned phenotypes and their
relatedness as learned from a specific patient population. We ground our
experiments in phenotyping patients from an HIV clinic in a large urban care
institution (n=7,523), where patients have voluminous, longitudinal
documentation, and where providers would benefit from summaries of these
patient's medical histories, whether about their HIV or any comorbidities. We
find that the learned phenotypes and their relatedness are clinically valid
when assessed qualitatively by clinical experts, and that the model surpasses
baseline in inferring phenotype-relatedness when comparing to existing
expert-curated condition groupings.

  Edge lengths of a graph are called flexible if there exist infinitely many
non-congruent realizations of the graph in the plane satisfying these edge
lengths. It has been shown recently that a graph has flexible edge lengths if
and only if the graph has a special type of edge coloring called NAC-coloring.
We address the question how to determine all possible proper flexible edge
lengths from the set of all NAC-colorings of a graph. We do so using
restrictions to 4-cycle subgraphs.
