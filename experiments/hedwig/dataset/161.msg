Title: Dropout Prediction over Weeks in MOOCs by Learning Representations of
  Clicks and Videos
Authors: Byungsoo Jeon, Namyong Park
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: Accepted at AAAI 2020 AI4Edu Workshop
\\
  This paper addresses a key challenge in MOOC dropout prediction, namely to
build meaningful representations from clickstream data. While a variety of
feature extraction techniques have been explored extensively for such purposes,
to our knowledge, no prior works have explored modeling of educational content
(e.g. video) and their correlation with the learner's behavior (e.g.
clickstream) in this context. We bridge this gap by devising a method to learn
representation for videos and the correlation between videos and clicks. The
results indicate that modeling videos and their correlation with clicks bring
statistically significant improvements in predicting dropout.

Title: From Route Instructions to Landmark Graphs
Authors: Christopher M Cervantes
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Landmarks are central to how people navigate, but most navigation
technologies do not incorporate them into their representations. We propose the
landmark graph generation task (creating landmark-based spatial representations
from natural language) and introduce a fully end-to-end neural approach to
generate these graphs. We evaluate our models on the SAIL route instruction
dataset, as well as on a small set of real-world delivery instructions that we
collected, and we show that our approach yields high quality results on both
our task and the related robotic navigation task.

Title: Stimulating Creativity with FunLines: A Case Study of Humor Generation
  in Headlines
Authors: Nabil Hossain, John Krumm, Tanvir Sajed and Henry Kautz
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Building datasets of creative text, such as humor, is quite challenging. We
introduce FunLines, a competitive game where players edit news headlines to
make them funny, and where they rate the funniness of headlines edited by
others. FunLines makes the humor generation process fun, interactive,
collaborative, rewarding and educational, keeping players engaged and providing
humor data at a very low cost compared to traditional crowdsourcing approaches.
FunLines offers useful performance feedback, assisting players in getting
better over time at generating and assessing humor, as our analysis shows. This
helps to further increase the quality of the generated dataset. We show the
effectiveness of this data by training humor classification models that
outperform a previous benchmark, and we release this dataset to the public.

Title: Learning Fine Grained Place Embeddings with Spatial Hierarchy from Human
  Mobility Trajectories
Authors: Toru Shimizu, Takahiro Yabe, Kota Tsubouchi
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: submitted to IJCAI 2020
\\
  Place embeddings generated from human mobility trajectories have become a
popular method to understand the functionality of places. Place embeddings with
high spatial resolution are desirable for many applications, however,
downscaling the spatial resolution deteriorates the quality of embeddings due
to data sparsity, especially in less populated areas. We address this issue by
proposing a method that generates fine grained place embeddings, which
leverages spatial hierarchical information according to the local density of
observed data points. The effectiveness of our fine grained place embeddings
are compared to baseline methods via next place prediction tasks using real
world trajectory data from 3 cities in Japan. In addition, we demonstrate the
value of our fine grained place embeddings for land use classification
applications. We believe that our technique of incorporating spatial
hierarchical information can complement and reinforce various place embedding
generating methods.

Title: Temporal-adaptive Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Wen-Ji Zhou, Yang Yu
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) helps address large-scale and
sparse reward issues in reinforcement learning. In HRL, the policy model has an
inner representation structured in levels. With this structure, the
reinforcement learning task is expected to be decomposed into corresponding
levels with sub-tasks, and thus the learning can be more efficient. In HRL,
although it is intuitive that a high-level policy only needs to make macro
decisions in a low frequency, the exact frequency is hard to be simply
determined. Previous HRL approaches often employed a fixed-time skip strategy
or learn a terminal condition without taking account of the context, which,
however, not only requires manual adjustments but also sacrifices some decision
granularity. In this paper, we propose the \emph{temporal-adaptive hierarchical
policy learning} (TEMPLE) structure, which uses a temporal gate to adaptively
control the high-level policy decision frequency. We train the TEMPLE structure
with PPO and test its performance in a range of environments including 2-D
rooms, Mujoco tasks, and Atari games. The results show that the TEMPLE
structure can lead to improved performance in these environments with a
sequential adaptive high-level control.

Title: Soft Hindsight Experience Replay
Authors: Qiwei He, Liansheng Zhuang, Houqiang Li
Categories: cs.AI cs.RO
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, submitted to IJCAI2020
\\
  Efficient learning in the environment with sparse rewards is one of the most
important challenges in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In continuous DRL
environments such as robotic arms control, Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)
has been shown an effective solution. However, due to the brittleness of
deterministic methods, HER and its variants typically suffer from a major
challenge for stability and convergence, which significantly affects the final
performance. This challenge severely limits the applicability of such methods
to complex real-world domains. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we
propose Soft Hindsight Experience Replay (SHER), a novel approach based on HER
and Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MERL), combining the failed
experiences reuse and maximum entropy probabilistic inference model. We
evaluate SHER on Open AI Robotic manipulation tasks with sparse rewards.
Experimental results show that, in contrast to HER and its variants, our
proposed SHER achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in the
difficult HandManipulation tasks. Furthermore, our SHER method is more stable,
achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.

Title: Relational Neural Machines
Authors: Giuseppe Marra, Michelangelo Diligenti, Francesco Giannini, Marco Gori
  and Marco Maggini
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Deep learning has been shown to achieve impressive results in several tasks
where a large amount of training data is available. However, deep learning
solely focuses on the accuracy of the predictions, neglecting the reasoning
process leading to a decision, which is a major issue in life-critical
applications. Probabilistic logic reasoning allows to exploit both statistical
regularities and specific domain expertise to perform reasoning under
uncertainty, but its scalability and brittle integration with the layers
processing the sensory data have greatly limited its applications. For these
reasons, combining deep architectures and probabilistic logic reasoning is a
fundamental goal towards the development of intelligent agents operating in
complex environments. This paper presents Relational Neural Machines, a novel
framework allowing to jointly train the parameters of the learners and of a
First--Order Logic based reasoner. A Relational Neural Machine is able to
recover both classical learning from supervised data in case of pure
sub-symbolic learning, and Markov Logic Networks in case of pure symbolic
reasoning, while allowing to jointly train and perform inference in hybrid
learning tasks. Proper algorithmic solutions are devised to make learning and
inference tractable in large-scale problems. The experiments show promising
results in different relational tasks.

Title: Transfer Heterogeneous Knowledge Among Peer-to-Peer Teammates: A Model
  Distillation Approach
Authors: Zeyue Xue, Shuang Luo, Chao Wu, Pan Zhou, Kaigui Bian and Wei Du
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 7 pages, 7 figures
ACM-class: I.2.11
\\
  Peer-to-peer knowledge transfer in distributed environments has emerged as a
promising method since it could accelerate learning and improve team-wide
performance without relying on pre-trained teachers in deep reinforcement
learning. However, for traditional peer-to-peer methods such as action
advising, they have encountered difficulties in how to efficiently expressed
knowledge and advice. As a result, we propose a brand new solution to reuse
experiences and transfer value functions among multiple students via model
distillation. But it is still challenging to transfer Q-function directly since
it is unstable and not bounded. To address this issue confronted with existing
works, we adopt Categorical Deep Q-Network. We also describe how to design an
efficient communication protocol to exploit heterogeneous knowledge among
multiple distributed agents. Our proposed framework, namely Learning and
Teaching Categorical Reinforcement (LTCR), shows promising performance on
stabilizing and accelerating learning progress with improved team-wide reward
in four typical experimental environments.

Title: From Data to Actions in Intelligent Transportation Systems: a
  Prescription of Functional Requirements for Model Actionability
Authors: Ibai Lana, Javier J. Sanchez-Medina, Eleni I. Vlahogianni, Javier Del
  Ser
Categories: cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE
Comments: 22 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Advances in Data Science are lately permeating every field of Transportation
Science and Engineering, making it straightforward to imagine that developments
in the transportation sector will be data-driven. Nowadays, Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS) could be arguably approached as a "story"
intensively producing and consuming large amounts of data. A diversity of
sensing devices densely spread over the infrastructure, vehicles or the
travelers' personal devices act as sources of data flows that are eventually
fed to software running on automatic devices, actuators or control systems
producing, in turn, complex information flows between users, traffic managers,
data analysts, traffic modeling scientists, etc. These information flows
provide enormous opportunities to improve model development and
decision-making. The present work aims to describe how data, coming from
diverse ITS sources, can be used to learn and adapt data-driven models for
efficiently operating ITS assets, systems and processes; in other words, for
data-based models to fully become actionable. Grounded on this described data
modeling pipeline for ITS, we define the characteristics, engineering
requisites and challenges intrinsic to its three compounding stages, namely,
data fusion, adaptive learning and model evaluation. We deliberately generalize
model learning to be adaptive, since, in the core of our paper is the firm
conviction that most learners will have to adapt to the everchanging phenomenon
scenario underlying the majority of ITS applications. Finally, we provide a
prospect of current research lines within the Data Science realm that can bring
notable advances to data-based ITS modeling, which will eventually bridge the
gap towards the practicality and actionability of such models.

Title: Towards Semantic Noise Cleansing of Categorical Data based on Semantic
  Infusion
Authors: Rishabh Gupta and Rajesh N Rao
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Semantic Noise affects text analytics activities for the domain-specific
industries significantly. It impedes the text understanding which holds prime
importance in the critical decision making tasks. In this work, we formalize
semantic noise as a sequence of terms that do not contribute to the narrative
of the text. We look beyond the notion of standard statistically-based stop
words and consider the semantics of terms to exclude the semantic noise. We
present a novel Semantic Infusion technique to associate meta-data with the
categorical corpus text and demonstrate its near-lossless nature. Based on this
technique, we propose an unsupervised text-preprocessing framework to filter
the semantic noise using the context of the terms. Later we present the
evaluation results of the proposed framework using a web forum dataset from the
automobile-domain.

Title: EgoMap: Projective mapping and structured egocentric memory for Deep RL
Authors: Edward Beeching, Christian Wolf, Jilles Dibangoye, Olivier Simonin
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Tasks involving localization, memorization and planning in partially
observable 3D environments are an ongoing challenge in Deep Reinforcement
Learning. We present EgoMap, a spatially structured neural memory architecture.
EgoMap augments a deep reinforcement learning agent's performance in 3D
environments on challenging tasks with multi-step objectives. The EgoMap
architecture incorporates several inductive biases including a differentiable
inverse projection of CNN feature vectors onto a top-down spatially structured
map. The map is updated with ego-motion measurements through a differentiable
affine transform. We show this architecture outperforms both standard recurrent
agents and state of the art agents with structured memory. We demonstrate that
incorporating these inductive biases into an agent's architecture allows for
stable training with reward alone, circumventing the expense of acquiring and
labelling expert trajectories. A detailed ablation study demonstrates the
impact of key aspects of the architecture and through extensive qualitative
analysis, we show how the agent exploits its structured internal memory to
achieve higher performance.

Title: The Mimicry Game: Towards Self-recognition in Chatbots
Authors: Yigit Oktar, Erdem Okur, Mehmet Turkan
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  In standard Turing test, a machine has to prove its humanness to the judges.
By successfully imitating a thinking entity such as a human, this machine then
proves that it can also think. However, many objections are raised against the
validity of this argument. Such objections claim that Turing test is not a tool
to demonstrate existence of general intelligence or thinking activity. In this
light, alternatives to Turing test are to be investigated. Self-recognition
tests applied on animals through mirrors appear to be a viable alternative to
demonstrate the existence of a type of general intelligence. Methodology here
constructs a textual version of the mirror test by placing the chatbot (in this
context) as the one and only judge to figure out whether the contacted one is
an other, a mimicker, or oneself in an unsupervised manner. This textual
version of the mirror test is objective, self-contained, and is mostly immune
to objections raised against the Turing test. Any chatbot passing this textual
mirror test should have or acquire a thought mechanism that can be referred to
as the inner-voice, answering the original and long lasting question of Turing
"Can machines think?" in a constructive manner.

Title: The Costs and Benefits of Goal-Directed Attention in Deep Convolutional
  Neural Networks
Authors: Xiaoliang Luo, Brett D. Roads, Bradley C. Love
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Attention in machine learning is largely bottom-up, whereas people also
deploy top-down, goal-directed attention. Motivated by neuroscience research,
we evaluated a plug-and-play, top-down attention layer that is easily added to
existing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). In object recognition
tasks, increasing top-down attention has benefits (increasing hit rates) and
costs (increasing false alarm rates). At a moderate level, attention improves
sensitivity (i.e., increases $d^\prime$) at only a moderate increase in bias
for tasks involving standard images, blended images, and natural adversarial
images. These theoretical results suggest that top-down attention can
effectively reconfigure general-purpose DCNNs to better suit the current task
goal. We hope our results continue the fruitful dialog between neuroscience and
machine learning.

Title: Fast FPGA emulation of analog dynamics in digitally-driven systems
Authors: Steven Herbst, Byong Chan Lim, Mark Horowitz
Categories: cs.AR
Comments: ICCAD '18: Proceedings of the International Conference on
  Computer-Aided Design
DOI: 10.1145/3240765.3240808
\\
  In this paper, we propose an architecture for FPGA emulation of mixed-signal
systems that achieves high accuracy at a high throughput. We represent the
analog output of a block as a superposition of step responses to changes in its
analog input, and the output is evaluated only when needed by the digital
subsystem. Our architecture is therefore intended for digitally-driven systems;
that is, those in which the inputs of analog dynamical blocks change only on
digital clock edges. We implemented a high-speed link transceiver design using
the proposed architecture on a Xilinx FPGA. This design demonstrates how our
approach breaks the link between simulation rate and time resolution that is
characteristic of prior approaches. The emulator is flexible, allowing for the
real-time adjustment of analog dynamics, clock jitter, and various design
parameters. We demonstrate that our architecture achieves 1% accuracy while
running 3 orders of magnitude faster than a comparable high-performance CPU
simulation.

Title: Low Overhead Online Data Flow Tracking for Intermittently Powered
  Non-volatile FPGAs
Authors: Xinyi Zhang, Clay Patterson, Yongpan Liu, Chengmo Yang, Chun Jason
  Xue, Jingtong Hu
Categories: cs.AR
\\
  Energy harvesting is an attractive way to power future IoT devices since it
can eliminate the need for battery or power cables. However, harvested energy
is intrinsically unstable. While FPGAs have been widely adopted in various
embedded systems, it is hard to survive unstable power since all the memory
components in FPGA are based on volatile SRAMs. The emerging non-volatile
memory based FPGAs provide promising potentials to keep configuration data on
the chip during power outages. Few works have considered implementing efficient
runtime intermediate data checkpoint on non-volatile FPGAs. To realize
accumulative computation under intermittent power on FPGA, this paper proposes
a low-cost design framework, Data-Flow-Tracking FPGA (DFT-FPGA), which utilizes
binary counters to track intermediate data flow. Instead of keeping all on-chip
intermediate data, DFT-FPGA only targets on necessary data that is labeled by
off-line analysis and identified by an online tracking system. The evaluation
shows that compared with state-of-the-art techniques, DFT-FPGA can realize
accumulative computing with less off-line workload and significantly reduce
online roll-back time and resource utilization.

Title: A dichotomy for bounded degree graph homomorphisms with nonnegative
  weights
Authors: Artem Govorov, Jin-Yi Cai, Martin Dyer
Categories: cs.CC
\\
  We consider the complexity of counting weighted graph homomorphisms defined
by a symmetric matrix $A$. Each symmetric matrix $A$ defines a graph
homomorphism function $Z_A(\cdot)$, also known as the partition function. Dyer
and Greenhill [10] established a complexity dichotomy of $Z_A(\cdot)$ for
symmetric $\{0, 1\}$-matrices $A$, and they further proved that its #P-hardness
part also holds for bounded degree graphs. Bulatov and Grohe [4] extended the
Dyer-Greenhill dichotomy to nonnegative symmetric matrices $A$. However, their
hardness proof requires graphs of arbitrarily large degree, and whether the
bounded degree part of the Dyer-Greenhill dichotomy can be extended has been an
open problem for 15 years. We resolve this open problem and prove that for
nonnegative symmetric $A$, either $Z_A(G)$ is in polynomial time for all graphs
$G$, or it is #P-hard for bounded degree (and simple) graphs $G$. We further
extend the complexity dichotomy to include nonnegative vertex weights.
Additionally, we prove that the #P-hardness part of the dichotomy by Goldberg
et al. [12] for $Z_A(\cdot)$ also holds for simple graphs, where $A$ is any
real symmetric matrix.

Title: Deep-Learning-Enabled Simulated Annealing for Topology Optimization
Authors: Changyu Deng, Can Qin, Wei Lu
Categories: cs.CE cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Topology optimization by distributing materials in a domain requires
stochastic optimizers to solve highly complicated problems. However, solving
such problems requires millions of finite element calculations with hundreds of
design variables or more involved , whose computational cost is huge and often
unacceptable. To speed up computation, here we report a method to integrate
deep learning into stochastic optimization algorithm. A Deep Neural Network
(DNN) learns and substitutes the objective function by forming a loop with
Generative Simulated Annealing (GSA). In each iteration, GSA uses DNN to
evaluate the objective function to obtain an optimized solution, based on which
new training data are generated; thus, DNN enhances its accuracy and GSA could
accordingly improve its solution in next iteration until convergence. Our
algorithm was tested by compliance minimization problems and reduced
computational time by over two orders of magnitude. This approach sheds light
on solving large multi-dimensional optimization problems.

\\
  We introduce a physics-guided signal processing approach to extract a
damage-sensitive and domain-invariant (DS & DI) feature from acceleration
response data of a vehicle traveling over a bridge to assess bridge health.
Motivated by indirect sensing methods' benefits, such as low-cost and
low-maintenance, vehicle-vibration-based bridge health monitoring has been
studied to efficiently monitor bridges in real-time. Yet applying this approach
is challenging because 1) physics-based features extracted manually are
generally not damage-sensitive, and 2) features from machine learning
techniques are often not applicable to different bridges. Thus, we formulate a
vehicle bridge interaction system model and find a physics-guided DS & DI
feature, which can be extracted using the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform
representing non-stationary signals as intrinsic-mode-type components. We
validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature with simulated experiments.
Compared to conventional time- and frequency-domain features, our feature
provides the best damage quantification and localization results across
different bridges in five of six experiments.

Title: Which convex polyhedra can be made by gluing regular hexagons?
Authors: Elena Arseneva and Stefan Langerman
Categories: cs.CG
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Which convex 3D polyhedra can be obtained by gluing several regular hexagons
edge-to-edge? It turns out that there are only 15 possible types of shapes, 5
of which are doubly-covered 2D polygons. We give examples for most of them,
including all simplicial and all flat shapes, and give a characterization for
the latter ones. It is open whether the remaining can be realized.

Title: Aligning the Pretraining and Finetuning Objectives of Language Models
Authors: Nuo Wang Pierse, Jingwen Lu
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures and 6 tables. Submitted to ICML 2020
\\
  We demonstrate that explicitly aligning the pretraining objectives to the
finetuning objectives in language model training significantly improves the
finetuning task performance and reduces the minimum amount of finetuning
examples required. The performance margin gained from objective alignment
allows us to build language models with smaller sizes for tasks with less
available training data. We provide empirical evidence of these claims by
applying objective alignment to concept-of-interest tagging and acronym
detection tasks. We found that, with objective alignment, our 768 by 3 and 512
by 3 transformer language models can reach accuracy of 83.9%/82.5% for
concept-of-interest tagging and 73.8%/70.2% for acronym detection using only
200 finetuning examples per task, outperforming the 768 by 3 model pretrained
without objective alignment by +4.8%/+3.4% and +9.9%/+6.3%. We name finetuning
small language models in the presence of hundreds of training examples or less
"Few Example learning". In practice, Few Example Learning enabled by objective
alignment not only saves human labeling costs, but also makes it possible to
leverage language models in more real-time applications.

\\
  With the rapid proliferation of online media sources and published news,
headlines have become increasingly important for attracting readers to news
articles, since users may be overwhelmed with the massive information. In this
paper, we generate inspired headlines that preserve the nature of news articles
and catch the eye of the reader simultaneously. The task of inspired headline
generation can be viewed as a specific form of Headline Generation (HG) task,
with the emphasis on creating an attractive headline from a given news article.
To generate inspired headlines, we propose a novel framework called
POpularity-Reinforced Learning for inspired Headline Generation (PORL-HG).
PORL-HG exploits the extractive-abstractive architecture with 1) Popular Topic
Attention (PTA) for guiding the extractor to select the attractive sentence
from the article and 2) a popularity predictor for guiding the abstractor to
rewrite the attractive sentence. Moreover, since the sentence selection of the
extractor is not differentiable, techniques of reinforcement learning (RL) are
utilized to bridge the gap with rewards obtained from a popularity score
predictor. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that the
proposed PORL-HG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art headline
generation models in terms of attractiveness evaluated by both human (71.03%)
and the predictor (at least 27.60%), while the faithfulness of PORL-HG is also
comparable to the state-of-the-art generation model.

  Acoustic word embeddings are fixed-dimensional representations of
variable-length speech segments. In settings where unlabelled speech is the
only available resource, such embeddings can be used in "zero-resource" speech
search, indexing and discovery systems. Here we propose to train a single
supervised embedding model on labelled data from multiple well-resourced
languages and then apply it to unseen zero-resource languages. For this
transfer learning approach, we consider two multilingual recurrent neural
network models: a discriminative classifier trained on the joint vocabularies
of all training languages, and a correspondence autoencoder trained to
reconstruct word pairs. We test these using a word discrimination task on six
target zero-resource languages. When trained on seven well-resourced languages,
both models perform similarly and outperform unsupervised models trained on the
zero-resource languages. With just a single training language, the second model
works better, but performance depends more on the particular training--testing
language pair.

Title: A Neural Topical Expansion Framework for Unstructured Persona-oriented
  Dialogue Generation

Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Accepted by ECAI 2020
\\
  Unstructured Persona-oriented Dialogue Systems (UPDS) has been demonstrated
effective in generating persona consistent responses by utilizing predefined
natural language user persona descriptions (e.g., "I am a vegan"). However, the
predefined user persona descriptions are usually short and limited to only a
few descriptive words, which makes it hard to correlate them with the
dialogues. As a result, existing methods either fail to use the persona
description or use them improperly when generating persona consistent
responses. To address this, we propose a neural topical expansion framework,
namely Persona Exploration and Exploitation (PEE), which is able to extend the
predefined user persona description with semantically correlated content before
utilizing them to generate dialogue responses. PEE consists of two main
modules: persona exploration and persona exploitation. The former learns to
extend the predefined user persona description by mining and correlating with
existing dialogue corpus using a variational auto-encoder (VAE) based topic
model. The latter learns to generate persona consistent responses by utilizing
the predefined and extended user persona description. In order to make persona
exploitation learn to utilize user persona description more properly, we also
introduce two persona-oriented loss functions: Persona-oriented Matching
(P-Match) loss and Persona-oriented Bag-of-Words (P-BoWs) loss which
respectively supervise persona selection in encoder and decoder. Experimental
results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, in terms
of both automatic and human evaluations.

  Expressing the polarity of sentiment as 'positive' and 'negative' usually
have limited scope compared with the intensity/degree of polarity. These two
tasks (i.e. sentiment classification and sentiment intensity prediction) are
closely related and may offer assistance to each other during the learning
process. In this paper, we propose to leverage the relatedness of multiple
tasks in a multi-task learning framework. Our multi-task model is based on
convolutional-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) framework, which is further assisted
by a diverse hand-crafted feature set. Evaluation and analysis suggest that
joint-learning of the related tasks in a multi-task framework can outperform
each of the individual tasks in the single-task frameworks.

  Millions of online discussions are generated everyday on social media
platforms. Topic modelling is an efficient way of better understanding large
text datasets at scale. Conventional topic models have had limited success in
online discussions, and to overcome their limitations, we use the discussion
thread tree structure and propose a "popularity" metric to quantify the number
of replies to a comment to extend the frequency of word occurrences, and the
"transitivity" concept to characterize topic dependency among nodes in a nested
discussion thread. We build a Conversational Structure Aware Topic Model
(CSATM) based on popularity and transitivity to infer topics and their
assignments to comments. Experiments on real forum datasets are used to
demonstrate improved performance for topic extraction with six different
measurements of coherence and impressive accuracy for topic assignments.

Title: Mitigating Query-Flooding Parameter Duplication Attack on Regression
  Models with High-Dimensional Gaussian Mechanism
Authors: Xiaoguang Li, Hui Li, Haonan Yan, Zelei Cheng, Wenhai Sun, Hui Zhu
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Public intelligent services enabled by machine learning algorithms are
vulnerable to model extraction attacks that can steal confidential information
of the learning models through public queries. Differential privacy (DP) has
been considered a promising technique to mitigate this attack. However, we find
that the vulnerability persists when regression models are being protected by
current DP solutions. We show that the adversary can launch a query-flooding
parameter duplication (QPD) attack to infer the model information by repeated
queries.
  To defend against the QPD attack on logistic and linear regression models, we
propose a novel High-Dimensional Gaussian (HDG) mechanism to prevent
unauthorized information disclosure without interrupting the intended services.
In contrast to prior work, the proposed HDG mechanism will dynamically generate
the privacy budget and random noise for different queries and their results to
enhance the obfuscation. Besides, for the first time, HDG enables an optimal
privacy budget allocation that automatically determines the minimum amount of
noise to be added per user-desired privacy level on each dimension. We
comprehensively evaluate the performance of HDG using real-world datasets and
shows that HDG effectively mitigates the QPD attack while satisfying the
privacy requirements. We also prepare to open-source the relevant codes to the
community for further research.

\\
  Personal data is a new economic asset that individuals can trade to generate
revenue on the emerging data marketplaces. This paper introduces a
decentralized marketplace for trading personal sensing data, generated by
resource-constrained IoT devices in real-time. To design such a marketplace, we
consider both computing and economic aspects. The computing approach focuses on
creating a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace that ensures the
integrity of trade agreements. We leverage smart contracts to guarantee that
the participants automatically conform to the terms of the agreements without
involving a mediator. The economic approach maximizes the marketplace
participant's utility to improve the sustainability and usability of the
marketplace. To this end, we present a blockchain framework underpinned by an
Energy-Aware Demand Selection and Allocation (EDSA) mechanism that optimizes
the revenue for the seller and fulfills the buyer's demands. We use a
normalized revenue-based greedy algorithm for solving the EDSA problem.
Moreover, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of the blockchain
framework in Ethereum. Through extensive simulations, we separately evaluate
the impact of buyer's demand on the battery drainage of the IoT devices under
different scenarios. We observe that increasing battery capacity for IoT
devices on the seller end is more strongly related to revenue generation than
increasing the number of devices.

Title: Comparison of Decentralization in DPoS and PoW Blockchains
Authors: Chao Li and Balaji Palanisamy
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Decentralization is a key indicator for the evaluation of public blockchains.
While existing works have evaluated the degree of decentralization in
Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains represented by Bitcoin and Ethereum, there have
been few studies on measuring the actual level of decentralization between PoW
blockchains and blockchains powered by other decentralized consensus protocols.
This paper presents a comparison study of the level of decentralization in
Bitcoin and Steem, a leading Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchain. In
Bitcoin, miners with higher computational power generate more blocks. In
contrast, blocks in Steem are equally generated by witnesses while witnesses
are periodically elected by stakeholders. Our study analyzes the process of
stake-weighted election of witnesses in the DPoS consensus protocol and
measures the actual stake invested by each stakeholder in Steem. We then
quantify and compare the actual degree of decentralization in these two
blockchains by computing the Shannon entropy of the distribution of
computational power among miners in Bitcoin and the distribution of invested
stake among stakeholders in Steem. Our measurements indicate that, compared
with Steem, Bitcoin tends to be more decentralized among top miners but less
decentralized in general. Our study is designed to provide insights into the
current state of the degree of decentralization in representative DPoS and PoW
blockchains. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this paper can
facilitate future studies of decentralization in other blockchain systems
employing different consensus protocols.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Boosting in the Local Setting
Authors: Sen Wang, J.Morris Chang
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 11 figures, journal
\\
  In machine learning, boosting is one of the most popular methods that
designed to combine multiple base learners to a superior one. The well-known
Boosted Decision Tree classifier, has been widely adopted in many areas. In the
big data era, the data held by individual and entities, like personal images,
browsing history and census information, are more likely to contain sensitive
information. The privacy concern raises when such data leaves the hand of the
owners and be further explored or mined. Such privacy issue demands that the
machine learning algorithm should be privacy aware. Recently, Local
Differential Privacy is proposed as an effective privacy protection approach,
which offers a strong guarantee to the data owners, as the data is perturbed
before any further usage, and the true values never leave the hands of the
owners. Thus the machine learning algorithm with the private data instances is
of great value and importance. In this paper, we are interested in developing
the privacy-preserving boosting algorithm that a data user is allowed to build
a classifier without knowing or deriving the exact value of each data samples.
Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed boosting
algorithm and the high utility of the learned classifiers.

  BatPay is a proxy scaling solution for the transfer of ERC20 tokens. It is
suitable for micropayments in one-to-many and few-to-many scenarios, including
digital markets and the distribution of rewards and dividends. In BatPay, many
similar operations are bundled together into a single transaction in order to
optimize gas consumption on the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, some costly
verifications are replaced by a challenge game, pushing most of the computing
cost off-chain. This results in a gas reduction of the transfer costs of three
orders of magnitude, achieving around 1700 transactions per second on the
Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, it includes many relevant features, like
meta-transactions for end-user operation without ether, and key-locked payments
for atomic exchange of digital goods.

  One of the most effective threats that targeting cybercriminals to limit
network performance is Denial of Service (DOS) attack. Thus, data security,
completeness and efficiency could be greatly damaged by this type of attacks.
This paper developed a network traffic system that relies on adopted dataset to
differentiate the DOS attacks from normal traffic. The detection model is built
with five Rule-based machine learning classifiers (DecisionTable, JRip, OneR,
PART and ZeroR). The findings have shown that the ICMP variables are
implemented in the identification of ICMP attack, HTTP flood attack, and
Slowloris at a high accuracy of approximately 99.7% using PART classifier. In
addition, PART classifier has succeeded in classifying normal traffic from
different DOS attacks at 100%.

Title: Towards Sharper First-Order Adversary with Quantized Gradients
Authors: Zhuanghua Liu and Ivor W. Tsang
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Despite the huge success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in a wide spectrum of
machine learning and data mining tasks, recent research shows that this
powerful tool is susceptible to maliciously crafted adversarial examples. Up
until now, adversarial training has been the most successful defense against
adversarial attacks. To increase adversarial robustness, a DNN can be trained
with a combination of benign and adversarial examples generated by first-order
methods. However, in state-of-the-art first-order attacks, adversarial examples
with sign gradients retain the sign information of each gradient component but
discard the relative magnitude between components. In this work, we replace
sign gradients with quantized gradients. Gradient quantization not only
preserves the sign information, but also keeps the relative magnitude between
components. Experiments show white-box first-order attacks with quantized
gradients outperform their variants with sign gradients on multiple datasets.
Notably, our BLOB\_QG attack achieves an accuracy of $88.32\%$ on the secret
MNIST model from the MNIST Challenge and it outperforms all other methods on
the leaderboard of white-box attacks.

Title: Towards Designing A Secure Plausibly Deniable System for Mobile Devices
  against Multi-snapshot Adversaries -- A Preliminary Design
Authors: Bo Chen
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Mobile computing devices have been used broadly to store, manage and process
sensitive or even mission critical data. To protect confidentiality of data
stored in mobile devices, major mobile operating systems use full disk
encryption, which relies on traditional encryption mechanisms and requires that
decryption keys will not be disclosed. This however, is not necessarily true,
since an active attacker may coerce victims for decryption keys. Plausibly
deniable encryption (PDE) can defend against such a coercive attacker by
disguising the true secret key with a decoy key. Leveraging concept of PDE,
various deniable storage systems have been built for both PC and mobile
platforms. However, a secure PDE system for mobile devices is still missing
which can be compatible with mainstream mobile devices and, meanwhile, remains
secure when facing a strong multi-snapshot adversary. In this work, we propose
a preliminary PDE system design for mobile computing devices using flash memory
as underlying storage medium. Ours is the first secure PDE system for mobile
devices which has the following new design features: 1) it is compatible with
mainstream mobile devices due to its integration of PDE into flash translation
layer (FTL), the most popular form of flash memory being used by modern mobile
devices; and 2) it can defend against the multi-snapshot adversary by denying
hidden writes (over the flash memory) caused by hidden sensitive data using
random dummy writes.

and uses particle swarm optimization for finding the optimal algorithm
parameters to account for noise. This algorithm achieved state of the art
segmentation accuracy when compared to FCM (Fuzzy C-Means), IFCMPSO (Improved
Fuzzy C-Means with Particle Swarm Optimization), GAIFCM (Genetic Algorithm
Improved Fuzzy C-Means) on noisy MRI images of an adult Brain.
  When using a genetic algorithm or PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) on a
single machine for optimization we witnessed long execution times for practical
clinical usage. Therefore, in the current paper our goal was to speed up the
execution of 3DPIFCM by taking out parts of the algorithm and executing them as
kernels on a GPU. The algorithm was implemented using the CUDA [13] framework
from NVIDIA and experiments where performed on a server containing 64GB RAM , 8
cores and a TITAN X GPU with 3072 SP cores and 12GB of GPU memory.
  Our results show that the parallel version of the algorithm performs up to
27x faster than the original sequential version and 68x faster than GAIFCM
algorithm. We show that the speedup of the parallel version increases as we
increase the size of the image due to better utilization of cores in the GPU.
Also, we show a speedup of up to 5x in our Brainweb experiment compared to
other generic variants such as IFCMPSO and GAIFCM.

Title: 3DPIFCM Segmentation Algorithm for brain MRI
Authors: Arie Agranonik
Categories: cs.CV cs.DC eess.IV
Comments: 44 pages, 20 figures, Master Thesis
\\
  We present a novel algorithm named 3DPIFCM, for automatic segmentation of
noisy MRI Brain images. The algorithm is an extension of a well-known IFCM
(Improved Fuzzy Mean Clustering) algorithm. It performs fuzzy segmentation and
introduces a fitness function that is affected by proximity of the voxels and
by the color intensity in 3D images. The 3DPIFCM algorithm uses PSO (Particle
Swarm Optimization) in order to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the
3DPIFCM uses 3D features of near voxels to better adjust the noisy artifacts.
In our experiments, we evaluate 3DPIFCM on T1 Brainweb dataset with noise
levels ranging from 1% to 20% and on a synthetic dataset with ground truth both
in 3D. The analysis of the segmentation results shows a significant improvement
in the segmentation quality of up to 28% compared to two generic variants in
noisy images and up to 60% when compared to the original FCM (Fuzzy Mean
Clustering). We conducted experiments with the parallel version of the
algorithm to itself in CPU version and also to IFCMPSO (Improved Fuzzy Mean
Clustering using Particle Swarm Optimization), GAIFCM (Genetic Algorithm Fuzzy
Mean Clustering) which are genetic algorithm counterparts of the 3DPIFCM
algorithm. Our purpose was to test for raw execution speed in seconds of each
algorithm given the same hyper parameters and same server. Our speedup results
show that the parallel version of the algorithm performs up to 27x faster than
the original sequential version and 68x faster than GAIFCM algorithm. We show
that the speedup of the parallel version increases as we increase the size of
the image due to better utilization of cores in the GPU. Also, we show a
speedup of up to 5x in our Brainweb experiment compared to other generic
variants such as IFCMPSO and GAIFCM.

Title: Rotation-invariant Mixed Graphical Model Network for 2D Hand Pose
  Estimation
Authors: Deying Kong, Haoyu Ma, Yifei Chen, Xiaohui Xie
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 2020 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)
\\
  In this paper, we propose a new architecture named Rotation-invariant Mixed
Graphical Model Network (R-MGMN) to solve the problem of 2D hand pose
estimation from a monocular RGB image. By integrating a rotation net, the
R-MGMN is invariant to rotations of the hand in the image. It also has a pool
of graphical models, from which a combination of graphical models could be
selected, conditioning on the input image. Belief propagation is performed on
each graphical model separately, generating a set of marginal distributions,
which are taken as the confidence maps of hand keypoint positions. Final
confidence maps are obtained by aggregating these confidence maps together. We
evaluate the R-MGMN on two public hand pose datasets. Experiment results show
our model outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm which is widely used in 2D
hand pose estimation by a noticeable margin.

Title: Residual-Recursion Autoencoder for Shape Illustration Images

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Shape illustration images (SIIs) are common and important in describing the
cross-sections of industrial products. Same as MNIST, the handwritten digit
images, SIIs are gray or binary and containing shapes that are surrounded by
large areas of blanks. In this work, Residual-Recursion Autoencoder (RRAE) has
been proposed to extract low-dimensional features from SIIs while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy as high as possible. RRAE will try to reconstruct the
original image several times and recursively fill the latest residual image to
the reserved channel of the encoder's input before the next trial of
reconstruction. As a kind of neural network training framework, RRAE can wrap
over other autoencoders and increase their performance. From experiment
results, the reconstruction loss is decreased by 86.47% for convolutional
autoencoder with high-resolution SIIs, 10.77% for variational autoencoder and
8.06% for conditional variational autoencoder with MNIST.

Title: Driver Gaze Estimation in the Real World: Overcoming the Eyeglass
  Challenge
Authors: Akshay Rangesh, Bowen Zhang and Mohan M. Trivedi
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  A driver's gaze is critical for determining the driver's attention level,
state, situational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially
and fully automated vehicles. Tracking both the head and eyes (pupils) can
provide reliable estimation of a driver's gaze using face images under ideal
conditions. However, the vehicular environment introduces a variety of
challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh illumination, nighttime
conditions, and reflective/dark eyeglasses. Unfortunately, relying on head pose
alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable owing to significant eye
movements. In this study, we offer solutions to address these problems
encountered in the real world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate
that using an infrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization
usually suffices. To handle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we
adopt the idea of image-to-image translation using generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to pre-process images prior to gaze estimation. To this end, we
propose the Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN). As the name suggests, this
network preserves the driver's gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from
infrared face images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach,
with the addition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for
additional supervision. Our approach exhibits improved performance and
robustness on challenging real-world data spanning 13 subjects and a variety of
driving conditions.

  Due to the increasing availability and functionality of image editing tools,
many forensic techniques such as digital image authentication, source

In this paper, we describe a machine learning based system to address the

automatically learn the intrinsic features from various scanned images. Our
experimental results show that high accuracy can be achieved for source scanner
identification. The proposed system can also generate a reliability map that
indicates the manipulated regions in an scanned image.

Title: An Information-rich Sampling Technique over Spatio-Temporal CNN for
  Classification of Human Actions in Videos
Authors: S.H. Shabbeer Basha, Viswanath Pulabaigari, Snehasis Mukherjee
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  We propose a novel scheme for human action recognition in videos, using a
3-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) based classifier.
Traditionally in deep learning based human activity recognition approaches,
either a few random frames or every $k^{th}$ frame of the video is considered
for training the 3D CNN, where $k$ is a small positive integer, like 4, 5, or
6. This kind of sampling reduces the volume of the input data, which speeds-up
training of the network and also avoids over-fitting to some extent, thus
enhancing the performance of the 3D CNN model. In the proposed video sampling
technique, consecutive $k$ frames of a video are aggregated into a single frame
by computing a Gaussian-weighted summation of the $k$ frames. The resulting
frame (aggregated frame) preserves the information in a better way than the
conventional approaches and experimentally shown to perform better. In this
letter, a 3D CNN architecture is proposed to extract the spatio-temporal
features and follows Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to recognize the human
actions. The proposed 3D CNN architecture is capable of handling the videos
where the camera is placed at a distance from the performer. Experiments are
performed with KTH and WEIZMANN human actions datasets, whereby it is shown to
produce comparable results with the state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: Pose-Aware Instance Segmentation Framework from Cone Beam CT Images for
  Tooth Segmentation

\\
  Individual tooth segmentation from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)
images is an essential prerequisite for an anatomical understanding of
orthodontic structures in several applications, such as tooth reformation
planning and implant guide simulations. However, the presence of severe metal
artifacts in CBCT images hinders the accurate segmentation of each individual
tooth. In this study, we propose a neural network for pixel-wise labeling to
exploit an instance segmentation framework that is robust to metal artifacts.
Our method comprises of three steps: 1) image cropping and realignment by pose
regressions, 2) metal-robust individual tooth detection, and 3) segmentation.
We first extract the alignment information of the patient by pose regression
neural networks to attain a volume-of-interest (VOI) region and realign the
input image, which reduces the inter-overlapping area between tooth bounding
boxes. Then, individual tooth regions are localized within a VOI realigned
image using a convolutional detector. We improved the accuracy of the detector
by employing non-maximum suppression and multiclass classification metrics in
the region proposal network. Finally, we apply a convolutional neural network
(CNN) to perform individual tooth segmentation by converting the pixel-wise
labeling task to a distance regression task. Metal-intensive image augmentation
is also employed for a robust segmentation of metal artifacts. The result shows
that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially
for teeth with metal artifacts. The primary significance of the proposed method
is two-fold: 1) an introduction of pose-aware VOI realignment followed by a
robust tooth detection and 2) a metal-robust CNN framework for accurate tooth
segmentation.

Title: Joint Deep Learning of Facial Expression Synthesis and Recognition
Authors: Yan Yan, Ying Huang, Si Chen, Chunhua Shen, Hanzi Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recently, deep learning based facial expression recognition (FER) methods
have attracted considerable attention and they usually require large-scale
labelled training data. Nonetheless, the publicly available facial expression
databases typically contain a small amount of labelled data. In this paper, to
overcome the above issue, we propose a novel joint deep learning of facial
expression synthesis and recognition method for effective FER. More
specifically, the proposed method involves a two-stage learning procedure.
Firstly, a facial expression synthesis generative adversarial network (FESGAN)
is pre-trained to generate facial images with different facial expressions. To
increase the diversity of the training images, FESGAN is elaborately designed
to generate images with new identities from a prior distribution. Secondly, an
expression recognition network is jointly learned with the pre-trained FESGAN
in a unified framework. In particular, the classification loss computed from
the recognition network is used to simultaneously optimize the performance of
both the recognition network and the generator of FESGAN. Moreover, in order to
alleviate the problem of data bias between the real images and the synthetic
images, we propose an intra-class loss with a novel real data-guided
back-propagation (RDBP) algorithm to reduce the intra-class variations of
images from the same class, which can significantly improve the final
performance. Extensive experimental results on public facial expression
databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with
several state-of-the-art FER methods.

Title: RGB-based Semantic Segmentation Using Self-Supervised Depth Pre-Training
Authors: Jean Lahoud, Bernard Ghanem
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Although well-known large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet, have driven image
understanding forward, most of these datasets require extensive manual
annotation and are thus not easily scalable. This limits the advancement of
image understanding techniques. The impact of these large-scale datasets can be
observed in almost every vision task and technique in the form of pre-training
for initialization. In this work, we propose an easily scalable and
self-supervised technique that can be used to pre-train any semantic RGB
segmentation method. In particular, our pre-training approach makes use of
automatically generated labels that can be obtained using depth sensors. These
labels, denoted by HN-labels, represent different height and normal patches,
which allow mining of local semantic information that is useful in the task of
semantic RGB segmentation. We show how our proposed self-supervised
pre-training with HN-labels can be used to replace ImageNet pre-training, while
using 25x less images and without requiring any manual labeling. We pre-train a
semantic segmentation network with our HN-labels, which resembles our final
task more than pre-training on a less related task, e.g. classification with
ImageNet. We evaluate on two datasets (NYUv2 and CamVid), and we show how the
similarity in tasks is advantageous not only in speeding up the pre-training
process, but also in achieving better final semantic segmentation accuracy than
ImageNet pre-training

Title: Unsupervised Bidirectional Cross-Modality Adaptation via Deeply
  Synergistic Image and Feature Alignment for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Cheng Chen, Qi Dou, Hao Chen, Jing Qin, Pheng Ann Heng
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: IEEE TMI
\\
  Unsupervised domain adaptation has increasingly gained interest in medical
image computing, aiming to tackle the performance degradation of deep neural
networks when being deployed to unseen data with heterogeneous characteristics.
In this work, we present a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework,
named as Synergistic Image and Feature Alignment (SIFA), to effectively adapt a
segmentation network to an unlabeled target domain. Our proposed SIFA conducts
synergistic alignment of domains from both image and feature perspectives. In
particular, we simultaneously transform the appearance of images across domains
and enhance domain-invariance of the extracted features by leveraging
adversarial learning in multiple aspects and with a deeply supervised
mechanism. The feature encoder is shared between both adaptive perspectives to
leverage their mutual benefits via end-to-end learning. We have extensively
evaluated our method with cardiac substructure segmentation and abdominal
multi-organ segmentation for bidirectional cross-modality adaptation between
MRI and CT images. Experimental results on two different tasks demonstrate that
our SIFA method is effective in improving segmentation performance on unlabeled
target images, and outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation
approaches by a large margin.

Title: Looking GLAMORous: Vehicle Re-Id in Heterogeneous Cameras Networks with
  Global and Local Attention
Authors: Abhijit Suprem, Calton Pu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Vehicle re-identification (re-id) is a fundamental problem for modern
surveillance camera networks. Existing approaches for vehicle re-id utilize
global features and local features for re-id by combining multiple subnetworks
and losses. In this paper, we propose GLAMOR, or Global and Local Attention
MOdules for Re-id. GLAMOR performs global and local feature extraction
simultaneously in a unified model to achieve state-of-the-art performance in
vehicle re-id across a variety of adversarial conditions and datasets (mAPs
80.34, 76.48, 77.15 on VeRi-776, VRIC, and VeRi-Wild, respectively). GLAMOR
introduces several contributions: a better backbone construction method that
outperforms recent approaches, group and layer normalization to address
conflicting loss targets for re-id, a novel global attention module for global
feature extraction, and a novel local attention module for self-guided
part-based local feature extraction that does not require supervision.
Additionally, GLAMOR is a compact and fast model that is 10x smaller while
delivering 25% better performance.

Title: Person Re-identification by Contour Sketch under Moderate Clothing
  Change
Authors: Qize Yang, Ancong Wu, Wei-Shi Zheng

DOI: 10.1109/TPAMI.2019.296050
\\
  Person re-identification (re-id), the process of matching pedestrian images
across different camera views, is an important task in visual surveillance.
Substantial development of re-id has recently been observed, and the majority
of existing models are largely dependent on color appearance and assume that
pedestrians do not change their clothes across camera views. This limitation,
however, can be an issue for re-id when tracking a person at different places
and at different time if that person (e.g., a criminal suspect) changes his/her
clothes, causing most existing methods to fail, since they are heavily relying
on color appearance and thus they are inclined to match a person to another
person wearing similar clothes. In this work, we call the person re-id under
clothing change the "cross-clothes person re-id". In particular, we consider
the case when a person only changes his clothes moderately as a first attempt
at solving this problem based on visible light images; that is we assume that a
person wears clothes of a similar thickness, and thus the shape of a person
would not change significantly when the weather does not change substantially
within a short period of time. We perform cross-clothes person re-id based on a
contour sketch of person image to take advantage of the shape of the human body
instead of color information for extracting features that are robust to
moderate clothing change. Due to the lack of a large-scale dataset for
cross-clothes person re-id, we contribute a new dataset that consists of 33698
images from 221 identities. Our experiments illustrate the challenges of
cross-clothes person re-id and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

\\
  The ubiquitous deployment of monitoring devices in urban flow monitoring
systems induces a significant cost for maintenance and operation. A technique
is required to reduce the number of deployed devices, while preventing the
degeneration of data accuracy and granularity. In this paper, we present an
approach for inferring the real-time and fine-grained crowd flows throughout a
city based on coarse-grained observations. This task exhibits two challenges:
the spatial correlations between coarse- and fine-grained urban flows, and the
complexities of external impacts. To tackle these issues, we develop a model
entitled UrbanFM which consists of two major parts: 1) an inference network to
generate fine-grained flow distributions from coarse-grained inputs that uses a
feature extraction module and a novel distributional upsampling module; 2) a
general fusion subnet to further boost the performance by considering the
influence of different external factors. This structure provides outstanding
effectiveness and efficiency for small scale upsampling. However, the
single-pass upsampling used by UrbanFM is insufficient at higher upscaling
rates. Therefore, we further present UrbanPy, a cascading model for progressive
inference of fine-grained urban flows by decomposing the original tasks into
multiple subtasks. Compared to UrbanFM, such an enhanced structure demonstrates
favorable performance for larger-scale inference tasks.

\\
  Image hash algorithms generate compact binary representations that can be
quickly matched by Hamming distance, thus become an efficient solution for
large-scale image retrieval. This paper proposes RV-SSDH, a deep image hash
algorithm that incorporates the classical VLAD (vector of locally aggregated
descriptors) architecture into neural networks. Specifically, a novel neural
network component is formed by coupling a random VLAD layer with a latent hash
layer through a transform layer. This component can be combined with
convolutional layers to realize a hash algorithm. We implement RV-SSDH as a
point-wise algorithm that can be efficiently trained by minimizing
classification error and quantization loss. Comprehensive experiments show this
new architecture significantly outperforms baselines such as NetVLAD and SSDH,
and offers a cost-effective trade-off in the state-of-the-art. In addition, the
proposed random VLAD layer leads to satisfactory accuracy with low complexity,
thus shows promising potentials as an alternative to NetVLAD.

Title: Reliability Validation of Learning Enabled Vehicle Tracking

Categories: cs.CV cs.RO cs.SE
\\
  This paper studies the reliability of a real-world learning-enabled system,
which conducts dynamic vehicle tracking based on a high-resolution wide-area
motion imagery input. The system consists of multiple neural network components
-- to process the imagery inputs -- and multiple symbolic (Kalman filter)
components -- to analyse the processed information for vehicle tracking. It is
known that neural networks suffer from adversarial examples, which make them
lack robustness. However, it is unclear if and how the adversarial examples
over learning components can affect the overall system-level reliability. By
integrating a coverage-guided neural network testing tool, DeepConcolic, with
the vehicle tracking system, we found that (1) the overall system can be
resilient to some adversarial examples thanks to the existence of other
components, and (2) the overall system presents an extra level of uncertainty
which cannot be determined by analysing the deep learning components only. This
research suggests the need for novel verification and validation methods for
learning-enabled systems.

Authors: Brian Choi, Parv Saxena, Ryan Huang, Randal Burns
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  Systems that require high-throughput and fault tolerance, such as key-value
stores and databases, are looking to persistent memory to combine the
performance of in-memory systems with the data-consistent fault-tolerance of
nonvolatile stores. Persistent memory devices provide fast bytea-ddressable
access to non-volatile memory. We analyze the design space when integrating
persistent memory into in-memory key value stores and quantify performance
tradeoffs between throughput, latency, and and recovery time. Previous works
have explored many design choices, but did not quantify the tradeoffs. We
implement persistent memory support in Redis and Memcached, adapting the data
structures of each to work in two modes: (1) with all data in persistent memory
and (2) a hybrid mode that uses persistent memory for key/value data and
non-volatile memory for indexing and metadata. Our experience reveals three
actionable design principles that hold in Redis and Memcached, despite their
very different implementations. We conclude that the hybrid design increases
throughput and decreases latency at a minor cost in recovery time and code
complexity

  We generalize Axel Thue's familiar definition of overlaps in words, and show
that there are no infinite words containing split occurrences of these
generalized overlaps. Along the way we prove a useful theorem about repeated
disjoint occurrences in words -- an interesting natural variation on the

\\
  Let $G(V,E)$ be a simple, undirected and connected graph. A dominating set $S
\subseteq V(G)$ is called a $2$-\textit{secure dominating set} ($2$-SDS) in
$G$, if for every pair of distinct vertices $u_1,u_2 \in V(G)$ there exists a
pair of distinct vertices $v_1,v_2 \in S$ such that $v_1 \in N[u_1]$, $v_2 \in
N[u_2]$ and $(S \setminus \{v_1,v_2\}) \cup \{u_1,u_2 \}$ is a dominating set
in $G$. The $2$\textit{-secure domination number} denoted by $\gamma_{2s}(G)$,
equals the minimum cardinality of a $2$-SDS in $G$. Given a graph $ G$ and a
positive integer $ k,$ the $ 2 $-Secure Domination ($ 2 $-SDM) problem is to
check whether $ G $ has a $ 2 $-secure dominating set of size at most $ k.$ It
is known that $ 2 $-SDM is NP-complete for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we
prove that the $ 2 $-SDM problem is NP-complete for planar graphs and doubly
chordal graphs, a subclass of chordal graphs. We strengthen the NP-complete
result for bipartite graphs, by proving this problem is NP-complete for some
subclasses of bipartite graphs namely, star convex bipartite, comb convex
bipartite graphs. We prove that $ 2 $-SDM is linear time solvable for bounded
tree-width graphs. We also show that the $ 2 $-SDM is W[2]-hard even for split
graphs. The Minimum $ 2 $-Secure Dominating Set (M2SDS) problem is to find a $
2 $-secure dominating set of minimum size in the input graph. We propose a $
\Delta(G)+1 $ $ - $ approximation algorithm for M2SDS, where $ \Delta(G) $ is
the maximum degree of the input graph $ G $ and prove that M2SDS cannot be
approximated within $ (1 - \epsilon) \ln(| V | ) $ for any $ \epsilon > 0 $
unless $ NP \subseteq DTIME(| V |^{ O(\log \log | V | )}) $. % even for
bipartite graphs. A secure dominating set of a graph \textit{defends} one
attack at any vertex of the graph. Finally, we show that the M2SDS is
APX-complete for graphs with $\Delta(G)=4.$

Title: Fair Correlation Clustering
Authors: Sara Ahmadian, Alessandro Epasto, Ravi Kumar, Mohammad Mahdian
Categories: cs.DS cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this paper, we study correlation clustering under fairness constraints.
Fair variants of $k$-median and $k$-center clustering have been studied
recently, and approximation algorithms using a notion called fairlet
decomposition have been proposed. We obtain approximation algorithms for fair
correlation clustering under several important types of fairness constraints.
  Our results hinge on obtaining a fairlet decomposition for correlation
clustering by introducing a novel combinatorial optimization problem. We show
how this problem relates to $k$-median fairlet decomposition and how this
allows us to obtain approximation algorithms for a wide range of fairness
constraints.
  We complement our theoretical results with an in-depth analysis of our
algorithms on real graphs where we show that fair solutions to correlation
clustering can be obtained with limited increase in cost compared to the
state-of-the-art (unfair) algorithms.

Title: Solving Tall Dense Linear Programs in Nearly Linear Time
Authors: Jan van den Brand, Yin Tat Lee, Aaron Sidford, Zhao Song
Categories: cs.DS math.OC
\\
  In this paper we provide an $\tilde{O}(nd+d^{3})$ time randomized algorithm
for solving linear programs with $d$ variables and $n$ constraints with high
probability. To obtain this result we provide a robust, primal-dual
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$-iteration interior point method inspired by the methods
of Lee and Sidford (2014, 2019) and show how to efficiently implement this
method using new data-structures based on heavy-hitters, the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, and inverse maintenance. Interestingly, we obtain
this running time without using fast matrix multiplication and consequently,
barring a major advance in linear system solving, our running time is near
optimal for solving dense linear programs among algorithms that do not use fast
matrix multiplication.

Title: Online Allocation of Reusable Resources: Achieving Optimal Competitive
  Ratio
Authors: Vineet Goyal, Garud Iyengar, Rajan Udwani
Categories: cs.DS
\\
  We study the problem of allocating a given set of resources to sequentially
arriving demand when the resources are reusable i.e., any allocated resource is
used for a stochastic duration after which it is available for re-allocation.
More concretely, we are given resources with fixed reusable inventory.
Customers arrive sequentially and upon arrival reveal their type in the form of
a set of resources they are willing to be matched to or more generally, a
choice model. We must make an irrevocable decision to allocate from the set of
available resources (in the form of a matching or by offering an assortment).
The customer may then select at most one resource and use some of its inventory
for a randomly drawn duration that is distributed i.i.d. according to a
resource dependent usage distribution. The duration of usage is revealed to us
only up on return. Successful allocations generate a resource and usage
duration dependent reward. Our goal is to design online policies to maximize
total expected reward without any knowledge of future customer types
(adversarial demand model). Previously, Gong et al. (2019) showed that the
Greedy algorithm is 1/2 competitive for this problem when compared against the
clairvoyant algorithm that knows the entire customer type sequence in advance
but sees the outcomes of usage durations in real-time.
  We propose a simple and novel algorithm for this problem that addresses
reusability despite being oblivious to usage distributions. For large starting
inventory, we show that our algorithm beats Greedy and achieves the best
possible competitive ratio of $(1-1/e)$ for a broad family of usage
distributions.In addition, our method of analysis introduces a new general
framework for certifying competitiveness w.r.t. clairvoyant algorithms that may
be useful more broadly in other online allocation settings that have
post-allocation stochasticity.

Title: Hybrid Pass Transistor Logic with Dual-Gate Ambipolar CNTFETs
Authors: Xuan Hu, Joseph S. Friedman
Categories: cs.ET
\\
  Pass Transistor Logic (PTL) provides decreased device count relative to
conventional complementary circuit structures, but the buffering inverters
required for cascading PTL gates diminishes this advantage. Dual-gate ambipolar
carbon nanotube transistors (DG-A-CNTFETs) are a natural match for PTL due to
the fact that both require significant use of inverters between logic stages.
This work therefore proposes a hybrid PTL structure with DG-A-CNTFETs that
exploits the compact logic of PTL in concert with the native XNOR gates with
DG-A-CNTFETs. A novel hybrid PTL DG-A-CNTFET full adder is proposed as an
example of this novel logic concept, and simulation results demonstrate
superior performance with a 43% reduction in device count relative to
conventional complementary circuit design with DG-A-CNTFETs.

Title: FibAR: Embedding Optical Fibers in 3D Printed Objects for Active Markers
  in Dynamic Projection Mapping
Authors: Daiki Tone, Daisuke Iwai, Shinsaku Hiura, Kosuke Sato
Categories: cs.GR cs.HC
Comments: 11 pages, 14 figures
ACM-class: H.5.1
\\
  This paper presents a novel active marker for dynamic projection mapping (PM)
that emits a temporal blinking pattern of infrared (IR) light representing its
ID. We used a multi-material three dimensional (3D) printer to fabricate a
projection object with optical fibers that can guide IR light from LEDs
attached on the bottom of the object. The aperture of an optical fiber is
typically very small; thus, it is unnoticeable to human observers under
projection and can be placed on a strongly curved part of a projection surface.
In addition, the working range of our system can be larger than previous
marker-based methods as the blinking patterns can theoretically be recognized
by a camera placed at a wide range of distances from markers. We propose an
automatic marker placement algorithm to spread multiple active markers over the
surface of a projection object such that its pose can be robustly estimated
using captured images from arbitrary directions. We also propose an
optimization framework for determining the routes of the optical fibers in such
a way that collisions of the fibers can be avoided while minimizing the loss of
light intensity in the fibers. Through experiments conducted using three
fabricated objects containing strongly curved surfaces, we confirmed that the
proposed method can achieve accurate dynamic PMs in a significantly wide
working range.

\\
  A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) is a
promising technology for enhancing virtual reality (VR) applications-in
particular, for gaming. We focus on the so-called P300-BCI, a stable and
accurate BCI paradigm relying on the recognition of a positive event-related
potential (ERP) occurring in the EEG about 300 ms post-stimulation. We
implemented a basic version of such a BCI displayed on an ordinary and
affordable smartphone-based head-mounted VR device: that is, a mobile and
passive VR system (with no electronic components beyond the smartphone). The
mobile phone performed the stimuli presentation, EEG synchronization (tagging)
and feedback display. We compared the ERPs and the accuracy of the BCI on the
VR device with a traditional BCI running on a personal computer (PC). We also
evaluated the impact of subjective factors on the accuracy. The study was
within-subjects, with 21 participants and one session in each modality. No
significant difference in BCI accuracy was found between the PC and VR systems,
although the P200 ERP was significantly wider and larger in the VR system as
compared to the PC system.

  Technology development efforts in autonomy and cyber-defense have been
evolving independently of each other, over the past decade. In this paper, we
report our ongoing effort to integrate these two presently distinct areas into
a single framework. To this end, we propose the two-player partially observable
stochastic game formalism to capture both high-level autonomous mission
planning under uncertainty and adversarial decision making subject to imperfect
information. We show that synthesizing sub-optimal strategies for such games is
possible under finite-memory assumptions for both the autonomous decision maker
and the cyber-adversary. We then describe an experimental testbed to evaluate
the efficacy of the proposed framework.

  The "mind-controlling" capability has always been in mankind's fantasy. With
the recent advancements of electroencephalograph (EEG) techniques,
brain-computer interface (BCI) researchers have explored various solutions to
allow individuals to perform various tasks using their minds. However, the
commercial off-the-shelf devices to run accurate EGG signal collection are
usually expensive and the comparably cheaper devices can only present coarse
results, which prevents the practical application of these devices in domestic
services. To tackle this challenge, we propose and develop an end-to-end
solution that enables fine brain-robot interaction (BRI) through embedded
learning of coarse EEG signals from the low-cost devices, namely DeepBrain, so
that people having difficulty to move, such as the elderly, can mildly command
and control a robot to perform some basic household tasks. Our contributions
are two folds: 1) We present a stacked long short term memory (Stacked LSTM)
structure with specific pre-processing techniques to handle the time-dependency
of EEG signals and their classification. 2) We propose personalized design to
capture multiple features and achieve accurate recognition of individual EEG
signals by enhancing the signal interpretation of Stacked LSTM with attention
mechanism. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end
solution with low cost can achieve satisfactory run-time speed, accuracy and
energy-efficiency.

Title: IlluminatedFocus: Vision Augmentation using Spatial Defocusing via Focal

Categories: cs.HC cs.GR
Comments: 11 pages, 21 figures

\\
  Aiming at realizing novel vision augmentation experiences, this paper
proposes the IlluminatedFocus technique, which spatially defocuses real-world
appearances regardless of the distance from the user's eyes to observed real
objects. With the proposed technique, a part of a real object in an image
appears blurred, while the fine details of the other part at the same distance
remain visible. We apply Electrically Focus-Tunable Lenses (ETL) as eyeglasses
and a synchronized high-speed projector as illumination for a real scene. We
periodically modulate the focal lengths of the glasses (focal sweep) at more
than 60 Hz so that a wearer cannot perceive the modulation. A part of the scene
to appear focused is illuminated by the projector when it is in focus of the
user's eyes, while another part to appear blurred is illuminated when it is out
of the focus. As the basis of our spatial focus control, we build mathematical
models to predict the range of distance from the ETL within which real objects
become blurred on the retina of a user. Based on the blur range, we discuss a
design guideline for effective illumination timing and focal sweep range. We
also model the apparent size of a real scene altered by the focal length
modulation. This leads to an undesirable visible seam between focused and
blurred areas. We solve this unique problem by gradually blending the two
areas. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal by implementing
various vision augmentation applications.

Title: Understanding Car-Speak: Replacing Humans in Dealerships

describe their ideal car in "car-speak". Car-speak is abstract language that
pertains to a car's physical attributes. In this paper, we define car-speak. We
also aim to curate a reasonable data set of car-speak language. Finally, we

Title: LightGCN: Simplifying and Powering Graph Convolution Network for
  Recommendation
Authors: Xiangnan He, Kuan Deng, Xiang Wang, Yan Li, Yongdong Zhang and Meng
  Wang
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has become new state-of-the-art for
collaborative filtering. Nevertheless, the reasons of its effectiveness for
recommendation are not well understood. Existing work that adapts GCN to
recommendation lacks thorough ablation analyses on GCN, which is originally
designed for graph classification tasks and equipped with many neural network
operations. However, we empirically find that the two most common designs in
GCNs --- feature transformation and nonlinear activation --- contribute little
to the performance of collaborative filtering. Even worse, including them adds
to the difficulty of training and degrades recommendation performance.
  In this work, we aim to simplify the design of GCN to make it more concise
and appropriate for recommendation. We propose a new model named LightGCN,
including only the most essential component in GCN --- neighborhood aggregation
--- for collaborative filtering. Specifically, LightGCN learns user and item
embeddings by linearly propagating them on the user-item interaction graph, and
uses the weighted sum of the embeddings learned at all layers as the final
embedding. Such simple, linear, and neat model is much easier to implement and
train, exhibiting substantial improvements (about 16.5\% relative improvement
on average) over Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) --- a
state-of-the-art GCN-based recommender model --- under exactly the same
experimental setting. Further analyses are provided towards the rationality of
the simple LightGCN from both analytical and empirical perspectives.

Title: Generating Scientific Question Answering Corpora from Q&A forums
Authors: Andre Lamurias, Diana Sousa and Francisco M. Couto
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  Question Answering (QA) is a natural language processing task that aims at
retrieving relevant answers to user questions. While much progress has been
made in this area, biomedical questions are still a challenge to most QA
approaches, due to the complexity of the domain and limited availability of
training sets. We present a method to automatically extract question-article
pairs from Q&A web forums, which can be used for document retrieval and QA
tasks. The proposed framework extracts questions from selected forums as well
as answers that contain citations that can be mapped to a unique entry of a
digital library. This way, QA systems based on document retrieval can be
developed and evaluated using the question-article pairs annotated by users of
these forums. We generated the SciQA corpus by applying our framework to three
forums, obtaining 5,432 questions and 10,208 question-article pairs. We
evaluated how the number of articles associated with each question and the
number of votes on each answer affects the performance of baseline document
retrieval approaches. Also, we trained a state-of-the-art deep learning model
that obtained higher scores in most test batches than a model trained only on a
dataset manually annotated by experts. The framework described in this paper
can be used to update the SciQA corpus from the same forums as new posts are
made, and from other forums that support their answers with documents.

Title: On Throughput of Compressive Random Access for One Short Message
  Delivery in IoT
Authors: Jinho Choi
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 10 pages; 7 figures; IEEE IoTJ (to be published)
\\
  In this paper, we study compressive random access (CRA) with two stages for
machine-type communication (MTC) in cellular Internet-of-Things (IoT). In
particular, we consider the case that each user (IoT device or sensor) has only
one short message (of the same length) when it is activated to send data in IoT
applications. Two different CRA-based random access schemes are discussed (one
is conventional and the other is new based on a simplified handshaking
process). Based on the throughput analysis, we show that the CRA-based random
access scheme with simplified handshaking process can outperform as its length
of payload is adaptively decided depending on the number of active users.
Simulation results confirm that the derived throughput expressions agree with
them and can be used to design a random access system for MTC with each active
device or sensor that has one short message.

Title: R\'{e}nyi Entropy Bounds on the Active Learning Cost-Performance
  Tradeoff
Authors: Vahid Jamali, Antonia Tulino, Jaime Llorca, and Elza Erkip
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Semi-supervised classification, one of the most prominent fields in machine
learning, studies how to combine the statistical knowledge of the often
abundant unlabeled data with the often limited labeled data in order to
maximize overall classification accuracy. In this context, the process of
actively choosing the data to be labeled is referred to as active learning. In
this paper, we initiate the non-asymptotic analysis of the optimal policy for
semi-supervised classification with actively obtained labeled data. Considering
a general Bayesian classification model, we provide the first characterization
of the jointly optimal active learning and semi-supervised classification
policy, in terms of the cost-performance tradeoff driven by the label query
budget (number of data items to be labeled) and overall classification
accuracy. Leveraging recent results on the R\'enyi Entropy, we derive tight
information-theoretic bounds on such active learning cost-performance tradeoff.

Title: Age of Information in Uncoordinated Unslotted Updating
Authors: Roy D. Yates and Sanjit K. Kaul
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: This has been submitted to ISIT 2020
\\
  Sensor sources submit updates to a monitor through an unslotted,
uncoordinated, unreliable multiple access collision channel. The channel is
unreliable; a collision-free transmission is received successfully at the
monitor with some transmission success probability. For an infinite-user model
in which the sensors collectively transmit updates as a Poisson process and
each update has an independent exponential transmission time, a stochastic
hybrid system (SHS) approach is used to derive the average age of information
(AoI) as a function of the offered load and the transmission success
probability. The analysis is then extended to evaluate the individual age of a
selected source. When the number of sources and update transmission rate grow
large in fixed proportion, the limiting asymptotic individual age is shown to
provide an accurate individual age approximation for a small number of sources.

Title: On Geometry of Information Flow for Causal Inference
Authors: Sudam Surasinghe and Erik M. Bollt
Categories: cs.IT cs.CG math.DS math.IT stat.ML
\\
  Causal inference is perhaps one of the most fundamental concepts in science,
beginning originally from the works of some of the ancient philosophers,
through today, but also weaved strongly in current work from statisticians,
machine learning experts, and scientists from many other fields. This paper
takes the perspective of information flow, which includes the Nobel prize
winning work on Granger-causality, and the recently highly popular transfer
entropy, these being probabilistic in nature. Our main contribution will be to
develop analysis tools that will allow a geometric interpretation of
information flow as a causal inference indicated by positive transfer entropy.
We will describe the effective dimensionality of an underlying manifold as
projected into the outcome space that summarizes information flow. Therefore
contrasting the probabilistic and geometric perspectives, we will introduce a
new measure of causal inference based on the fractal correlation dimension
conditionally applied to competing explanations of future forecasts, which we
will write $GeoC_{y\rightarrow x}$. This avoids some of the boundedness issues
that we show exist for the transfer entropy, $T_{y\rightarrow x}$. We will
highlight our discussions with data developed from synthetic models of
successively more complex nature: then include the H\'{e}non map example, and
finally a real physiological example relating breathing and heart rate
function.

Title: Optimal Centralized Dynamic-Time-Division-Duplex
Authors: Mohsen Mohammadkhani Razlighi, Nikola Zlatanov, Shiva Raj Pokhrel,

Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we derive the optimal centralized dynamic-time-division-duplex
(D-TDD) scheme for a wireless network comprised of $K$ full-duplex nodes
impaired by self-interference and additive white Gaussian noise. As a special
case, we also provide the optimal centralized D-TDD scheme when the nodes are
half-duplex as well as when the wireless network is comprised of both
half-duplex and full-duplex nodes. Thereby, we derive the optimal adaptive
scheduling of the reception, transmission, simultaneous reception and
transmission, and silence at every node in the network in each time slot such
that the rate region of the network is maximized. The performance of the
optimal centralized D-TDD can serve as an upper-bound to any other TDD scheme,
which is useful in qualifying the relative performance of TDD schemes. The
numerical results show that the proposed centralized D-TDD scheme achieves
significant rate gains over existing centralized D-TDD schemes.

Title: On the Age of Information for Multicast Transmission with Hard Deadlines
  in IoT Systems
Authors: Jie Li, Yong Zhou, He Chen
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  We consider the multicast transmission of a real-time Internet of Things
(IoT) system, where a server transmits time-stamped status updates to multiple
IoT devices. We apply a recently proposed metric, named age of information
(AoI), to capture the timeliness of the information delivery. The AoI is
defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the most recently received
status update. Different from the existing studies that considered either
multicast transmission without hard deadlines or unicast transmission with hard
deadlines, we enforce a hard deadline for the service time of multicast
transmission. This is important for many emerging multicast IoT applications,
where the outdated status updates are useless for IoT devices. Specifically,
the transmission of a status update is terminated when either the hard deadline
expires or a sufficient number of IoT devices successfully receive the status
update. We first calculate the distributions of the service time for all
possible reception outcomes at IoT devices, and then derive a closed-form
expression of the average AoI. Simulations validate the performance analysis,
which reveals that: 1) the multicast transmission with hard deadlines achieves
a lower average AoI than that without hard deadlines; and 2) there exists an
optimal value of the hard deadline that minimizes the average AoI.

Title: Generalized Pair Weights of Linear Codes and MacWilliams Extension
  Theorem
Authors: Hongwei Liu, Xu Pan
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalized pair weights of an $[n,
k]$-linear code over a finite field and the notion of pair $r$-equiweight
codes, where $1\le r\le k-1$. We give some properties of generalized pair
weights of linear codes over finite fields. We obtain a necessary and
sufficient condition for an $[n,k]$-linear code to be a pair equiweight code
and characterize the pair $r$-equiweight codes for any $1\le r\le k-1$. In
addition, a relationship between the pair equiweight code and the pair
$r$-equiweight code is also given. Finally, we prove the MacWilliams extension
theorem for the pair weight case.

\\
  A major hurdle in machine learning is scalability to massive datasets.
Approaches to overcome this hurdle include compression of the data matrix and
distributing the computations. \textit{Leverage score sampling} provides a
compressed approximation of a data matrix using an importance weighted subset.
\textit{Gradient coding} has been recently proposed in distributed optimization
to compute the gradient using multiple unreliable worker nodes. By designing
coding matrices, gradient coded computations can be made resilient to
stragglers, which are nodes in a distributed network that degrade system
performance. We present a novel \textit{weighted leverage score} approach, that
achieves improved performance for distributed gradient coding by utilizing an
importance sampling.

Categories: cs.IT math.IT
\\
  In this letter, a novel wireless powered protocol is proposed to maximize the
system throughput of an energy harvesting (EH) based cognitive radio network,
while satisfying a minimum primary user rate requirement. For EH, we exploit
both dedicated wireless power transfer from primary base station as well as
ambient ones available due to wireless information transfer among primary and
secondary users. Specifically, we prove convexity of the optimization problem
and obtain semi-closed-form for globally optimal solution. Numerical results
validate the analysis, and show an average performance improvement of $70\%$
over benchmark scheme for various system parameters.

Title: perm2vec: Graph Permutation Selection for Decoding of Error Correction
  Codes using Self-Attention
Authors: Nir Raviv, Avi Caciularu, Tomer Raviv, Jacob Goldberger and Yair
  Be'ery
Categories: cs.IT cs.LG math.IT
\\
  Error correction codes are integral part of communication applications,
boosting the reliability of transmission. The optimal decoding of transmitted
codewords is the maximum likelihood rule, which is NP-hard due to the curse of
dimensionality. For practical realizations, suboptimal decoding algorithms are
employed; yet limited theoretical insights prevents one from exploiting the
full potential of these algorithms. One such insight is the choice of
permutation in permutation decoding. We present a data-driven framework for
permutation selection, combining domain knowledge with machine learning
concepts such as node embedding and self-attention. Significant and consistent
improvements in the bit error rate are introduced for all simulated codes, over
the baseline decoders. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the
first to leverage the benefits of the neural Transformer networks in physical
layer communication systems.

Comments: 18 pages, 5 figures
MSC-class: 68P30
\\
  Modern distributed computation infrastructures are often plagued by
unavailabilities such as failing or slow servers. These unavailabilities
adversely affect the tail latency of computation in distributed
infrastructures. The simple solution of replicating computation entails
significant resource overhead. Coded computation has emerged as a
resource-efficient alternative, wherein multiple units of data are encoded to
create parity units and the function to be computed is applied to each of these
units on distinct servers. A decoder can use the available function outputs to
decode the unavailable ones. Existing coded computation approaches are resource
efficient only for simple variants of linear functions such as multilinear,
with even the class of low degree polynomials requiring the same multiplicative
overhead as replication for practically relevant straggler tolerance.
  In this paper, we present a new approach to model coded computation via the
lens of locality of codes. We introduce a generalized notion of locality,
denoted computational locality, building upon the locality of an appropriately
defined code. We show that computational locality is equivalent to the required
number of workers for coded computation and leverage results from the
well-studied locality of codes to design coded computation schemes. We show
that recent results on coded computation of multivariate polynomials can be
derived using local recovering schemes for Reed-Muller codes. We present coded
computation schemes for multivariate polynomials that adaptively exploit
locality properties of input data-- an inadmissible technique under existing
frameworks. These schemes require fewer workers than the lower bound under
existing coded computation frameworks, showing that the existing multiplicative
overhead on the number of servers is not fundamental for coded computation of
nonlinear functions.

Title: Mutual Information-based State-Control for Intrinsically Motivated
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Rui Zhao, Volker Tresp, Wei Xu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 8 figures
\\
  In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to reach a set of goals by means
of an external reward signal. In the natural world, intelligent organisms learn
from internal drives, bypassing the need for external signals, which is
beneficial for a wide range of tasks. Motivated by this observation, we propose
to formulate an intrinsic objective as the mutual information between the goal
states and the controllable states. This objective encourages the agent to take
control of its environment. Subsequently, we derive a surrogate objective of
the proposed reward function, which can be optimized efficiently. Lastly, we
evaluate the developed framework in different robotic manipulation and
navigation tasks and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. A video showing
experimental results is available at \url{https://youtu.be/CT4CKMWBYz0}.

Title: A mean-field theory of lazy training in two-layer neural nets: entropic
  regularization and controlled McKean-Vlasov dynamics
Authors: Belinda Tzen and Maxim Raginsky
Categories: cs.LG math.OC math.PR stat.ML
\\
  We consider the problem of universal approximation of functions by two-layer
neural nets with random weights that are "nearly Gaussian" in the sense of
Kullback-Leibler divergence. This problem is motivated by recent works on lazy
training, where the weight updates generated by stochastic gradient descent do
not move appreciably from the i.i.d. Gaussian initialization. We first consider
the mean-field limit, where the finite population of neurons in the hidden
layer is replaced by a continual ensemble, and show that our problem can be
phrased as global minimization of a free-energy functional on the space of
probability measures over the weights. This functional trades off the $L^2$
approximation risk against the KL divergence with respect to a centered
Gaussian prior. We characterize the unique global minimizer and then construct
a controlled nonlinear dynamics in the space of probability measures over
weights that solves a McKean--Vlasov optimal control problem. This control
problem is closely related to the Schr\"odinger bridge (or entropic optimal
transport) problem, and its value is proportional to the minimum of the free
energy. Finally, we show that SGD in the lazy training regime (which can be
ensured by jointly tuning the variance of the Gaussian prior and the entropic
regularization parameter) serves as a greedy approximation to the optimal
McKean--Vlasov distributional dynamics and provide quantitative guarantees on
the $L^2$ approximation error.

Title: Nested Barycentric Coordinate System as an Explicit Feature Map
Authors: Lee-Ad Gottlieb, Eran Kaufman, Aryeh Kontorovich, Gabriel Nivasch, and
  Ofir Pele
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose a new embedding method which is particularly well-suited for
settings where the sample size greatly exceeds the ambient dimension. Our
technique consists of partitioning the space into simplices and then embedding
the data points into features corresponding to the simplices' barycentric
coordinates. We then train a linear classifier in the rich feature space
obtained from the simplices. The decision boundary may be highly non-linear,
though it is linear within each simplex (and hence piecewise-linear overall).
Further, our method can approximate any convex body. We give generalization
bounds based on empirical margin and a novel hybrid sample compression
technique. An extensive empirical evaluation shows that our method consistently
outperforms a range of popular kernel embedding methods.

\\
  Machine learning models have demonstrated vulnerability to adversarial
attacks, more specifically misclassification of adversarial examples. In this
paper, we propose a one-off and attack-agnostic Feature Manipulation
(FM)-Defense to detect and purify adversarial examples in an interpretable and
efficient manner. The intuition is that the classification result of a normal
image is generally resistant to non-significant intrinsic feature changes,
e.g., varying thickness of handwritten digits. In contrast, adversarial
examples are sensitive to such changes since the perturbation lacks
transferability. To enable manipulation of features, a combo-variational
autoencoder is applied to learn disentangled latent codes that reveal semantic
features. The resistance to classification change over the morphs, derived by
varying and reconstructing latent codes, is used to detect suspicious inputs.
Further, combo-VAE is enhanced to purify the adversarial examples with good
quality by considering both class-shared and class-unique features. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of detection and the quality of
purified instance. Our experiments on three datasets show that FM-Defense can
detect nearly $100\%$ of adversarial examples produced by different
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. It achieves more than $99\%$ overall
purification accuracy on the suspicious instances that close the manifold of
normal examples.

Authors: Xiaotian Zhang, Zhe Jia, Zachary E. Ross, and Robert W. Clayton
Categories: cs.LG eess.IV physics.geo-ph stat.ML
\\
  We present a machine-learning approach to classifying the phases of surface
wave dispersion curves. Standard FTAN analysis of surfaces observed on an array
of receivers is converted to an image, of which, each pixel is classified as
fundamental mode, first overtone, or noise. We use a convolutional neural
network (U-net) architecture with a supervised learning objective and
incorporate transfer learning. The training is initially performed with
synthetic data to learn coarse structure, followed by fine-tuning of the
network using approximately 10% of the real data based on human classification.
The results show that the machine classification is nearly identical to the
human picked phases. Expanding the method to process multiple images at once
did not improve the performance. The developed technique will faciliate
automated processing of large dispersion curve datasets.

Title: Few-Shot Learning as Domain Adaptation: Algorithm and Analysis
Authors: Jiechao Guan, Zhiwu Lu, Tao Xiang, Ji-Rong Wen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 13pages
\\
  To recognize the unseen classes with only few samples, few-shot learning
(FSL) uses prior knowledge learned from the seen classes. A major challenge for
FSL is that the distribution of the unseen classes is different from that of
those seen, resulting in poor generalization even when a model is meta-trained
on the seen classes. This class-difference-caused distribution shift can be
considered as a special case of domain shift. In this paper, for the first
time, we propose a domain adaptation prototypical network with attention
(DAPNA) to explicitly tackle such a domain shift problem in a meta-learning
framework. Specifically, armed with a set transformer based attention module,
we construct each episode with two sub-episodes without class overlap on the
seen classes to simulate the domain shift between the seen and unseen classes.
To align the feature distributions of the two sub-episodes with limited
training samples, a feature transfer network is employed together with a margin
disparity discrepancy (MDD) loss. Importantly, theoretical analysis is provided
to give the learning bound of our DAPNA. Extensive experiments show that our
DAPNA outperforms the state-of-the-art FSL alternatives, often by significant
margins.

Title: No-Regret Prediction in Marginally Stable Systems
Authors: Udaya Ghai, Holden Lee, Karan Singh, Cyril Zhang, Yi Zhang
Categories: cs.LG math.OC stat.ML
\\
  We consider the problem of online prediction in a marginally stable linear
dynamical system subject to bounded adversarial or (non-isotropic) stochastic
perturbations. This poses two challenges. Firstly, the system is in general
unidentifiable, so recent and classical results on parameter recovery do not
apply. Secondly, because we allow the system to be marginally stable, the state
can grow polynomially with time; this causes standard regret bounds in online
convex optimization to be vacuous. In spite of these challenges, we show that
the online least-squares algorithm achieves sublinear regret (improvable to
polylogarithmic in the stochastic setting), with polynomial dependence on the
system's parameters. This requires a refined regret analysis, including a
structural lemma showing the current state of the system to be a small linear
combination of past states, even if the state grows polynomially. By applying
our techniques to learning an autoregressive filter, we also achieve
logarithmic regret in the partially observed setting under Gaussian noise, with
polynomial dependence on the memory of the associated Kalman filter.

\\
  In display advertising, predicting the conversion rate, that is, the
probability that a user takes a predefined action on an advertiser's website,
such as purchasing goods is fundamental in estimating the value of displaying
the advertisement. However, there is a relatively long time delay between a
click and its resultant conversion. Because of the delayed feedback, some
positive instances at the training period are labeled as negative because some
conversions have not yet occurred when training data are gathered. As a result,
the conditional label distributions differ between the training data and the
production environment. This situation is referred to as a feedback shift. We
address this problem by using an importance weight approach typically used for
covariate shift correction. We prove its consistency for the feedback shift.
Results in both offline and online experiments show that our proposed method
outperforms the existing method.

applicable to the case of pure imaginary constant \mu=i\eta with \eta<\pi/4 .
For \mu=0.0 and 3.0 , we present the computer simulation results by using the

Title: Minimax Confidence Interval for Off-Policy Evaluation and Policy
  Optimization
Authors: Nan Jiang, Jiawei Huang
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  We study minimax methods for off-policy evaluation (OPE) using
value-functions and marginalized importance weights. Despite that they hold
promises of overcoming the exponential variance in traditional importance
sampling, several key problems remain:
  (1) They require function approximation and are generally biased. For the
sake of trustworthy OPE, is there anyway to quantify the biases?
  (2) They are split into two styles ("weight-learning" vs "value-learning").
Can we unify them?
  In this paper we answer both questions positively. By slightly altering the
derivation of previous methods (one from each style; Uehara and Jiang, 2019),
we unify them into a single confidence interval (CI) that automatically comes
with a special type of double robustness: when either the value-function or
importance weight class is well-specified, the CI is valid and its length
quantifies the misspecification of the other class. We can also tell which
class is misspecified, which provides useful diagnostic information for the
design of function approximation. Our CI also provides a unified view of and
new insights to some recent methods: for example, one side of the CI recovers a
version of AlgaeDICE (Nachum et al., 2019b), and we show that the two sides
need to be used together and either alone may incur doubled approximation error
as a point estimate.
  We further examine the potential of applying these bounds to two
long-standing problems: off-policy policy optimization with poor data coverage
(i.e., exploitation), and efficient exploration. With a well-specified
value-function class, we show that optimizing the lower and the upper bounds
lead to good exploitation and exploration, respectively.

Title: Minimizing Dynamic Regret and Adaptive Regret Simultaneously
Authors: Lijun Zhang, Shiyin Lu, Tianbao Yang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Regret minimization is treated as the golden rule in the traditional study of
online learning. However, regret minimization algorithms tend to converge to
the static optimum, thus being suboptimal for changing environments. To address
this limitation, new performance measures, including dynamic regret and
adaptive regret have been proposed to guide the design of online algorithms.
The former one aims to minimize the global regret with respect to a sequence of
changing comparators, and the latter one attempts to minimize every local
regret with respect to a fixed comparator. Existing algorithms for dynamic
regret and adaptive regret are developed independently, and only target one
performance measure. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing novel
online algorithms that are able to minimize the dynamic regret and adaptive
regret simultaneously. In fact, our theoretical guarantee is even stronger in
the sense that one algorithm is able to minimize the dynamic regret over any
interval.

Title: Secure Social Recommendation based on Secret Sharing
Authors: Chaochao Chen, Liang Li, Bingzhe Wu, Cheng Hong, Li Wang, Jun Zhou

Comments: Accepted by ECAI'20
\\
  Nowadays, privacy preserving machine learning has been drawing much attention
in both industry and academy. Meanwhile, recommender systems have been
extensively adopted by many commercial platforms (e.g. Amazon) and they are
mainly built based on user-item interactions. Besides, social platforms (e.g.
Facebook) have rich resources of user social information. It is well known that
social information, which is rich on social platforms such as Facebook, are
useful to recommender systems. It is anticipated to combine the social
information with the user-item ratings to improve the overall recommendation
performance. Most existing recommendation models are built based on the
assumptions that the social information are available. However, different
platforms are usually reluctant to (or cannot) share their data due to certain
concerns. In this paper, we first propose a SEcure SOcial RECommendation
(SeSoRec) framework which can (1) collaboratively mine knowledge from social
platform to improve the recommendation performance of the rating platform, and
(2) securely keep the raw data of both platforms. We then propose a Secret
Sharing based Matrix Multiplication (SSMM) protocol to optimize SeSoRec and
prove its correctness and security theoretically. By applying minibatch
gradient descent, SeSoRec has linear time complexities in terms of both
computation and communication. The comprehensive experimental results on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SeSoRec and
SSMM.

Title: Faster On-Device Training Using New Federated Momentum Algorithm
Authors: Zhouyuan Huo, Qian Yang, Bin Gu, Lawrence Carin. Heng Huang
Categories: cs.LG cs.DC stat.ML
\\
  Mobile crowdsensing has gained significant attention in recent years and has
become a critical paradigm for emerging Internet of Things applications. The
sensing devices continuously generate a significant quantity of data, which
provide tremendous opportunities to develop innovative intelligent
applications. To utilize these data to train machine learning models while not
compromising user privacy, federated learning has become a promising solution.
However, there is little understanding of whether federated learning algorithms
are guaranteed to converge. We reconsider model averaging in federated learning
and formulate it as a gradient-based method with biased gradients. This novel
perspective assists analysis of its convergence rate and provides a new
direction for more acceleration. We prove for the first time that the federated
averaging algorithm is guaranteed to converge for non-convex problems, without
imposing additional assumptions. We further propose a novel accelerated
federated learning algorithm and provide a convergence guarantee. Simulated
federated learning experiments are conducted to train deep neural networks on
benchmark datasets, and experimental results show that our proposed method
converges faster than previous approaches.

Title: Unbalanced GANs: Pre-training the Generator of Generative Adversarial
  Network using Variational Autoencoder
Authors: Hyungrok Ham, Tae Joon Jun, Daeyoung Kim
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  We propose Unbalanced GANs, which pre-trains the generator of the generative
adversarial network (GAN) using variational autoencoder (VAE). We guarantee the
stable training of the generator by preventing the faster convergence of the
discriminator at early epochs. Furthermore, we balance between the generator
and the discriminator at early epochs and thus maintain the stabilized training
of GANs. We apply Unbalanced GANs to well known public datasets and find that
Unbalanced GANs reduce mode collapses. We also show that Unbalanced GANs
outperform ordinary GANs in terms of stabilized learning, faster convergence
and better image quality at early epochs.

Title: Bridging Ordinary-Label Learning and Complementary-Label Learning
Authors: Yasuhiro Katsura, Masato Uchida
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
MSC-class: 68T10
\\
  Unlike ordinary supervised pattern recognition, in a newly proposed framework
namely complementary-label learning, each label specifies one class that the
pattern does not belong to. In this paper, we propose the natural
generalization of learning from an ordinary label and a complementary label,
specifically focused on one-versus-all and pairwise classification. We assume
that annotation with a bag of complementary labels is equivalent to providing
the rest of all the labels as the candidates of the one true class. Our derived
classification risk is in a comprehensive form that includes those in the
literature, and succeeded to explicitly show the relationship between the
single and multiple ordinary/complementary labels. We further show both
theoretically and experimentally that the classification error bound
monotonically decreases corresponding to the number of complementary labels.
This is consistent because the more complementary labels are provided, the less
supervision becomes ambiguous.

Title: LUNAR: Cellular Automata for Drifting Data Streams
Authors: Jesus L. Lobo, Javier Del Ser, Francisco Herrera

Comments: 36 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables
\\
  With the advent of huges volumes of data produced in the form of fast
streams, real-time machine learning has become a challenge of relevance
emerging in a plethora of real-world applications. Processing such fast streams
often demands high memory and processing resources. In addition, they can be
affected by non-stationary phenomena (concept drift), by which learning methods
have to detect changes in the distribution of streaming data, and adapt to
these evolving conditions. A lack of efficient and scalable solutions is
particularly noted in real-time scenarios where computing resources are
severely constrained, as it occurs in networks of small, numerous,
interconnected processing units (such as the so-called Smart Dust, Utility Fog,
or Swarm Robotics paradigms). In this work we propose LUNAR, a streamified
version of cellular automata devised to successfully meet the aforementioned
requirements. It is able to act as a real incremental learner while adapting to
drifting conditions. Extensive simulations with synthetic and real data will
provide evidence of its competitive behavior in terms of classification
performance when compared to long-established and successful online learning
methods.

\\
  In many cases, neural network classifiers are likely to be exposed to input
data that is outside of their training distribution data. Samples from outside
the distribution may be classified as an existing class with high probability
by softmax-based classifiers; such incorrect classifications affect the
performance of the classifiers and the applications/systems that depend on
them. Previous research aimed at distinguishing training distribution data from
out-of-distribution data (OOD) has proposed detectors that are external to the
classification method. We present Gaussian isolation machine (GIM), a novel
hybrid (generative-discriminative) classifier aimed at solving the problem
arising when OOD data is encountered. The GIM is based on a neural network and
utilizes a new loss function that imposes a distribution on each of the trained
classes in the neural network's output space, which can be approximated by a
Gaussian. The proposed GIM's novelty lies in its discriminative performance and
generative capabilities, a combination of characteristics not usually seen in a
single classifier. The GIM achieves state-of-the-art classification results on
image recognition and sentiment analysis benchmarking datasets and can also
deal with OOD inputs. We also demonstrate the benefits of incorporating part of
the GIM's loss function into standard neural networks as a regularization
method.

\\
  Developmental Dyslexia (DD) is a learning disability related to the
acquisition of reading skills that affects about 5% of the population. DD can
have an enormous impact on the intellectual and personal development of
affected children, so early detection is key to implementing preventive
strategies for teaching language. Research has shown that there may be
biological underpinnings to DD that affect phoneme processing, and hence these
symptoms may be identifiable before reading ability is acquired, allowing for
early intervention. In this paper we propose a new methodology to assess the
risk of DD before students learn to read. For this purpose, we propose a mixed
neural model that calculates risk levels of dyslexia from tests that can be
completed at the age of 5 years. Our method first trains an auto-encoder, and
then combines the trained encoder with an optimized ordinal regression neural
network devised to ensure consistency of predictions. Our experiments show that
the system is able to detect unaffected subjects two years before it can assess
the risk of DD based mainly on phonological processing, giving a specificity of
0.969 and a correct rate of more than 0.92. In addition, the trained encoder
can be used to transform test results into an interpretable subject spatial
distribution that facilitates risk assessment and validates methodology.

\\
  Adversarial examples that can fool deep models are mainly crafted by adding
small perturbations imperceptible to human eyes. There are various
optimization-based methods in the literature to generate adversarial
perturbations, most of which are time-consuming. AdvGAN, a method proposed by
Xiao~\emph{et al.}~in IJCAI~2018, employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
to generate adversarial perturbation with original images as inputs, which is
faster than optimization-based methods at inference time. AdvGAN, however,
fixes the target classes in the training and we find it difficult to train
AdvGAN when it is modified to take original images and target classes as
inputs. In this paper, we propose \mbox{Attack-Inspired} GAN (\mbox{AI-GAN})
with a different training strategy to solve this problem. \mbox{AI-GAN} is a
two-stage method, in which we use projected gradient descent (PGD) attack to
inspire the training of GAN in the first stage and apply standard training of
GAN in the second stage.
  Once trained, the Generator can approximate the conditional distribution of
adversarial instances and generate \mbox{imperceptible} adversarial
perturbations given different target classes. We conduct experiments and
evaluate the performance of \mbox{AI-GAN} on MNIST and \mbox{CIFAR-10}.
Compared with AdvGAN, \mbox{AI-GAN} achieves higher attack success rates with
similar perturbation magnitudes.

  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) became very popular for generation of

discuss methods for evaluating the quality of generated data, and their
comparison with the original real data.

Title: Active learning workflows and integrable deep neural networks for
  representing the free energy functions of alloy
Authors: Gregory Teichert, Anirudh Natarajan, Anton Van der Ven, Krishna
  Garikipati
Categories: cs.LG
\\
  The free energy plays a fundamental role in descriptions of many systems in
continuum physics. Notably, in multiphysics applications, it encodes
thermodynamic coupling between different fields, such as mechanics and
chemistry. It thereby gives rise to driving forces on the dynamics of
interaction between the constituent phenomena. In mechano-chemically
interacting materials systems, even consideration of only compositions, order
parameters and strains can render the free energy to be reasonably
high-dimensional. In proposing free energy functions as a paradigm for scale
bridging, we have previously exploited neural networks for their representation
of such high-dimensional functions. Specifically, we have developed an
integrable deep neural network (IDNN) that can be trained to free energy
derivative data obtained from atomic scale models and statistical mechanics,
then analytically integrated to recover a free energy function. The motivation
comes from the statistical mechanics formalism, in which certain free energy
derivatives are accessible for control of the system, rather than the free
energy itself in its entirety. Our current work combines the IDNN with an
active learning workflow to improve sampling of the free energy derivative data
in a high-dimensional input space. Treated as input-output maps, machine
learning representations accommodate role reversals between independent and
dependent quantities as the mathematical descriptions change across scale
boundaries. As a prototypical material system we focus on Ni-Al. Phase field
simulations using the resulting IDNN representation for the free energy of
Ni-Al demonstrates that the appropriate physics of the material have been
learned.

Title: Product Kanerva Machines: Factorized Bayesian Memory
Authors: Adam Marblestone, Yan Wu, Greg Wayne
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  An ideal cognitively-inspired memory system would compress and organize
incoming items. The Kanerva Machine (Wu et al, 2018) is a Bayesian model that
naturally implements online memory compression. However, the organization of
the Kanerva Machine is limited by its use of a single Gaussian random matrix
for storage. Here we introduce the Product Kanerva Machine, which dynamically
combines many smaller Kanerva Machines. Its hierarchical structure provides a
principled way to abstract invariant features and gives scaling and capacity
advantages over single Kanerva Machines. We show that it can exhibit
unsupervised clustering, find sparse and combinatorial allocation patterns, and
discover spatial tunings that approximately factorize simple images by object.

Piyavskii and Shubert in 1972. Our results hold in a general setting in which
values of f can only be accessed approximately. In particular, they yield
state-of-the-art regret bounds both when f is observed exactly and when
evaluations are perturbed by an independent subgaussian noise.

Title: Optimal Adaptive Matrix Completion
Authors: Ilqar ramazanli, Barnabas Poczos
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: -
\\
  We study the problem of exact completion for $m \times n$ sized matrix of
rank r with the adaptive sampling method. We introduce a relation of the exact
completion problem with the sparsest vector of column and row spaces (which we
call sparsity-number here). Using this relation, we propose matrix completion
algorithms that exactly recovers the target matrix. These algorithms are
superior to previous works in two important ways. First, our algorithms exactly
recover $\mu_0$-coherent column space matrices by probability at least
$1-\epsilon$ using much smaller observations complexity than -
$\mathcal{O}(\mu_0 rn \mathrm{log}\frac{r}{\epsilon})$ - the state of art.
Specifically, many of the previous adaptive sampling methods require to observe
the entire matrix when the column space is highly coherent. However, we show
that our method is still able to recover this type of matrices by observing a
small fraction of entries under many scenarios. Second, we propose an exact
completion algorithm, which requires minimal pre-information as either row or
column space is not being highly coherent. We provide an extension of these
algorithms that is robust to sparse random noise. Besides, we propose an
additional low-rank estimation algorithm that is robust to any small noise by
adaptively studying the shape of column space. At the end of the paper, we
provide experimental results that illustrate the strength of the algorithms
proposed here.

Title: Querying Guarded Fragments via Resolution
Authors: Sen Zheng, Renate A. Schmidt
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  The problem of answering Boolean conjunctive queries over the guarded
fragment is decidable, however, as yet no practical decision procedure exists.
In this paper, we present a resolution-based decision procedure to address this
problem, and further extend the decision procedure to the loosely guarded
fragment. In particular, we show that using a separation rule and
top-variable-based techniques, one can rewrite Boolean conjunctive queries into
a set of (loosely) guarded clauses, so that querying the (loosely) guarded
fragment can be reduced to deciding the (loosely) guarded fragment. As far as
we know, this is the first practical decision procedure for answering Boolean
conjunctive queries over the guarded fragment and the loosely guarded fragment.

Title: Decentralized Socio-technical Services and Applications for the Internet
  of Things -- A Testbed Self-Integration
Authors: Farzam Fanitabasi, Edward Gaere, Evangelos Pournaras
Categories: cs.MA
\\
  The Internet of Things comes along with new challenges for experimenting,
testing, and operating decentralized socio-technical systems at large-scale. In
such systems autonomous agents interact locally with their users and remotely
with other agents, to make intelligent collective choices, via which they
self-regulate the consumption and production of distributed resources. For
instance, self-management of traffic flows in Smart Cities. While such complex
systems are usually deployed and operated using centralized computing
infrastructures, their socio-technical nature requires new value-oriented
design paradigms empowering trust, transparency, and alignment with citizens'
social values, such as privacy preservation, autonomy, and fairness among
citizens' choices. Currently, instruments and tools to study such systems and
guide the prototyping process from simulation, to live deployment, and
ultimately to a robust operation, are missing or not practical. This paper
bridges this gap by introducing a novel testbed architecture for decentralized
socio-technical systems running on IoT. This architecture empowers the seamless
reusability of (i) application-independent decentralized services by an IoT
application, and (ii) different IoT applications by the same decentralized
service. This dual self-integration promises IoT applications that are simpler
to prototype and can interoperate with services during runtime to
self-integrate more complex functionality. Such self-integration provides
stronger validation and improves efficiency of resource utilization:
computational resources are shared, cutting down deployment and operational
costs. Pressure/crash tests during continuous operations of several weeks, with
more than 3000 agents joining/leaving, 150,000 parameter changes, and 3 million
communicated messages/day, confirm the robustness and practicality of the
testbed architecture.

\\
  Recent research on reinforcement learning in pure-conflict and pure-common
interest games has emphasized the importance of population heterogeneity. In
contrast, studies of reinforcement learning in mixed-motive games have
primarily leveraged homogeneous approaches. Given the defining characteristic
of mixed-motive games--the imperfect correlation of incentives between group
members--we study the effect of population heterogeneity on mixed-motive
reinforcement learning. We draw on interdependence theory from social
psychology and imbue reinforcement learning agents with Social Value
Orientation (SVO), a flexible formalization of preferences over group outcome
distributions. We subsequently explore the effects of diversity in SVO on
populations of reinforcement learning agents in two mixed-motive Markov games.
We demonstrate that heterogeneity in SVO generates meaningful and complex
behavioral variation among agents similar to that suggested by interdependence
theory. Empirical results in these mixed-motive dilemmas suggest agents trained
in heterogeneous populations develop particularly generalized, high-performing
policies relative to those trained in homogeneous populations.

  Today's most troublesome population health challenges are often driven by
social and environmental determinants, which are difficult to model using
traditional epidemiological methods. We agree with those who have argued for
the wider adoption of agent-based modelling (ABM) in taking on these
challenges. However, while ABM has been used occasionally in population health,
we argue that for ABM to be most effective in the field it should be used as a
means for answering questions normally inaccessible to the traditional
epidemiological toolkit. In an effort to clearly illustrate the utility of ABM
for population health research, and to clear up persistent misunderstandings
regarding the method's conceptual underpinnings, we offer a detailed
presentation of the core concepts of complex systems theory, and summarise why
simulations are essential to the study of complex systems. We then examine the
current state of the art in ABM for population health, and propose they are
well-suited for the study of the `wicked' problems in population health, and
could make significant contributions to theory and intervention development in
these areas.

Title: Data hiding in speech signal using steganography and encryption

  Data privacy and data security are always on highest priority in the world.
We need a reliable method to encrypt the data so that it reaches the
destination safely. Encryption is a simple yet effective way to protect our
data while transmitting it to a destination. The proposed method has state of
art technology of steganography and encryption. This paper puts forward a
different approach for data hiding in speech signals. A ten-digit number within
speech signal using audio steganography and encrypting it with a unique key for
better security. At the receiver end the same unique key is used to decrypt the
received signal and then hidden numbers are extracted. The proposed approach
performance can be evaluated by PSNR, MSE, SSIM and bit-error rate. The
simulation results give better performance compared to existing approach.

Title: Hybrid CUR-type decomposition of tensors in the Tucker format
Authors: Erna Begovic
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures
MSC-class: 15A69, 15A23, 65F30
\\
  The paper introduces a hybrid approach to the CUR-type decomposition of
tensors in the Tucker format. The idea of the hybrid algorithm is to write a
tensor $\mathcal{X}$ as a product of a core tensor $\mathcal{S}$, a matrix $C$
obtained by extracting mode-$k$ fibers of $\mathcal{X}$, and matrices $U_j$,
$j=1,\ldots,k-1,k+1,\ldots,d$, chosen to minimize the approximation error. The
approximation can easily be modified to preserve the fibers in more than one
mode. The approximation error obtained this way is smaller than the one from
the standard tensor CUR-type method. This difference increases as the tensor
dimension increases. It also increases as the number of modes in which the
original fibers are preserved decreases.

Title: An Iterative Method for Structured Matrix Completion
Authors: Henry Adams, Lara Kassab, Deanna Needell
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  The task of filling-in or predicting missing entries of a matrix, from a
subset of known entries, is known as $\textit{matrix completion}$. In today's
data-driven world, data completion is essential whether it is the main goal or
a pre-processing step. In recent work, a modification to the standard nuclear
norm minimization for matrix completion has been made to take into account
$\textit{structural differences}$ between observed and unobserved entries. One
example of such structural difference is when the probability that an entry is
observed or not depends mainly on the value of the entry. We propose adjusting
an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm for low-rank matrix
completion to take into account $\textit{sparsity-based}$ structure in the
missing entries. We also present an iterative gradient-projection-based
implementation of the algorithm, and present numerical experiments showing that
the proposed method often outperforms the IRLS algorithm in structured
settings.

MSC-class: 65N30, 65N55
\\
  We present a mesh-independent and parameter-robust multigrid solver for the
Scott-Vogelius discretisation of the nearly incompressible linear elasticity
equations on meshes with a macro element structure. The discretisation achieves
exact representation of the limiting divergence constraint at moderate
polynomial degree. Both the relaxation and multigrid transfer operators exploit
the macro structure for robustness and efficiency. For the relaxation, we use
the existence of local Fortin operators on each macro cell to construct a local
space decomposition with parameter-robust convergence. For the transfer, we
construct a robust prolongation operator by performing small local solves over
each coarse macro cell. The necessity of both components of the algorithm is
confirmed by numerical experiments.

Title: Numerical verification for asymmetric solutions of the H\'enon equation

\\
  The H\'enon equation, a generalized form of the Emden equation, admits
symmetry-breaking bifurcation for a certain ratio of the transverse velocity to
the radial velocity. Therefore, it has asymmetric solutions on a symmetric
domain even though the Emden equation has no asymmetric unidirectional solution
on such a domain. We numerically prove the existence of asymmetric solutions of
the H\'enon equation for several parameters representing the ratio of
transverse to radial velocity. As a result, we find a set of solutions with
three peaks. The bifurcation curves of such solutions are shown for a square
domain.

Title: Low Rank Triple Decomposition and Tensor Recovery
Authors: Liqun Qi, Yannan Chen, Mayank Bakshi and Xinzhen Zhang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  A simple approach for matrix completion and recovery is via low rank matrix
decomposition. Recently, low rank matrix decomposition was extended to third
order tensors, by T-product, then used in tensor completion and recovery. In
this approach, a third order tensor is decomposed as the T-product of two low
rank third order tensors. The three modes of the third order tensor are not
balanced in this approach. This may cause some problems in applications where
three modes have different meanings. The innovation of this paper is to
decompose a third order tensor to three low rank third tensors in a balanced
way. We call such a decomposition the triple decomposition, and the
corresponding rank the triple rank. Numerical tests show that third order
tensor data from practical applications such as internet traffic and video
image are of low triple ranks. A tensor recovery method is proposed based on
such low rank triple decomposition. Comparing with some main methods for tensor
recovery, this method has its own merits, and can be a new choice for practical
users.

Title: A $C^1$ Petrov-Galerkin method and Gauss collocation method for 1D
  general elliptic problems and superconvergence
Authors: Waixiang Cao, Lueling Jia, Zhimin Zhang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  In this paper, we present and study $C^1$ Petrov-Galerkin and Gauss
collocation methods with arbitrary polynomial degree $k$ ($\ge 3$) for
one-dimensional elliptic equations. We prove that, the solution and its
derivative approximations converge with rate $2k-2$ at all grid points; and the
solution approximation is superconvergent at all interior roots of a special
Jacobi polynomial of degree $k+1$ in each element, the first-order derivative
approximation is superconvergent at all interior $k-2$ Lobatto points, and the
second-order derivative approximation is superconvergent at $k-1$ Gauss points,
with an order of $k+2$, $k+1$, and $k$, respectively. As a by-product, we prove
that both the Petrov-Galerkin solution and the Gauss collocation solution are
superconvergent towards a particular Jacobi projection of the exact solution in
$H^2$, $H^1$, and $L^2$ norms. All theoretical findings are confirmed by
numerical experiments.

Title: Optimal Control of Sliding Droplets using the Contact Angle Distribution
Authors: Henning Bonart and Christian Kahle
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.AP math.OC
\\
  Controlling the shape and position of moving and pinned droplets on a solid
surface is an important feature often found in microfluidic applications. In
this work, we consider a well investigated phase field model including contact
line dynamics as the state system for an (open-loop) optimal control problem.
Here the spatially and temporally changeable contact angles between droplet and
solid are considered as the control variables. We consider a suitable, energy
stable, time discrete version of the state equation in our optimal control
problem. We discuss regularity of the solution to the time discrete state
equation and its continuity and differentiability properties. Furthermore, we
show existence of solutions and state first order optimality conditions to the
optimal control problem. We illustrate our results by actively pushing a
droplet uphill against gravity in an optimal way.

  We analyse a Eulerian Finite Element method, combining a Eulerian
time-stepping scheme applied to the time-dependent Stokes equations using the
CutFEM approach with inf-sup stable Taylor-Hood elements for the spatial
discretisation. This is based on the method introduced by Lehrenfeld \&

convection-diffusion problems on moving domains, and extended to the
non-stationary Stokes problem on moving domains by Burman, Frei \& Massing
[arXiv:1910.03054 [math.NA]] using stabilised equal-order elements. The
analysis includes the geometrical error made by integrating over approximated
levelset domains in the discrete CutFEM setting. The method is implemented and
the theoretical results are illustrated using numerical examples.

Title: Existence of dynamical low rank approximations for random semi-linear
  evolutionary equations on the maximal interval
Authors: Yoshihito Kazashi, Fabio Nobile
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.AP
\\
  An existence result is presented for the dynamical low rank (DLR)
approximation for random semi-linear evolutionary equations. The DLR solution
approximates the true solution at each time instant by a linear combination of
products of deterministic and stochastic basis functions, both of which evolve
over time. A key to our proof is to find a suitable equivalent formulation of
the original problem. The so-called Dual Dynamically Orthogonal formulation
turns out to be convenient. Based on this formulation, the DLR approximation is
recast to an abstract Cauchy problem in a suitable linear space, for which
existence and uniqueness of the solution in the maximal interval are
established.

MSC-class: 65N12 65N15 65N30 49M25
\\
  This article discusses nonconforming finite element methods for convex
minimization problems and systematically derives dual mixed formulations.
Duality relations lead to simple error estimates that avoid an explicit
treatment of nonconformity errors. A reconstruction formula provides the
discrete solution of the dual problem via a simple postprocessing procedure
which implies a strong duality relation and is of interest in a posteriori
error estimation. The framework applies to differentiable and nonsmooth
problems, examples include $p$-Laplace, total-variation regularized, and
obstacle problems. Numerical experiments illustrate advantages of nonconforming
over standard conforming methods.

  We analyze the global convergence of the power iterates for the computation
of a general mixed-subordinate matrix norm. We prove a new global convergence
theorem for a class of entrywise nonnegative matrices that generalizes and
improves a well-known results for mixed-subordinate $\ell^p$ matrix norms. In
particular, exploiting the Birkoff--Hopf contraction ratio of nonnegative
matrices, we obtain novel and explicit global convergence guarantees for a
range of matrix norms whose computation has been recently proven to be NP-hard
in the general case, including the case of mixed-subordinate norms induced by
the vector norms made by the sum of different $\ell^p$-norms of subsets of
entries. Finally, we use the new results combined with hypercontractive
inequalities to prove a new lower bound on the logarithmic Sobolev constant of
a Markov chain.

\\
  Deep learning (DL)-based solutions have recently been developed for
communication protocol design. Such learning-based solutions can avoid manual
efforts to tune individual protocol parameters. While these solutions look
promising, they are hard to interpret due to the black-box nature of the ML
techniques. To this end, we propose a novel DRL-based framework to
systematically design and evaluate networking protocols. While other proposed
ML-based methods mainly focus on tuning individual protocol parameters (e.g.,
adjusting contention window), our main contribution is to decouple a protocol
into a set of parametric modules, each representing a main protocol
functionality and is used as DRL input to better understand the generated
protocols design optimization and analyze them in a systematic fashion. As a
case study, we introduce and evaluate DeepMAC a framework in which a MAC
protocol is decoupled into a set of blocks across popular flavors of 802.11
WLANs (e.g., 802.11a/b/g/n/ac). We are interested to see what blocks are
selected by DeepMAC across different networking scenarios and whether DeepMAC
is able to adapt to network dynamics.

Title: Capacity-Aware Edge Caching in Fog Computing Networks
Authors: Qiang Li, Yuanmei Zhang, Yingyu Li, Yong Xiao, and Xiaohu Ge
Categories: cs.NI eess.SP
\\
  This paper studies edge caching in fog computing networks, where a
capacity-aware edge caching framework is proposed by considering both the
limited fog cache capacity and the connectivity capacity of base stations
(BSs). By allowing cooperation between fog nodes and cloud data center, the
average-download-time (ADT) minimization problem is formulated as a multi-class
processor queuing process. We prove the convexity of the formulated problem and
propose an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm
that can achieve the minimum ADT and converge much faster than existing
algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the allocation of fog cache
capacity and connectivity capacity of BSs needs to be balanced according to the
network status. While the maximization of the edge-cache-hit-ratio (ECHR) by
utilizing all available fog cache capacity is helpful when the BS connectivity
capacity is sufficient, it is preferable to keep a lower ECHR and allocate more
traffic to the cloud when the BS connectivity capacity is deficient.

  There is a semantic gap between the high-level intents of network operators
and the low-level configurations that achieve the intents. Previous works tried
to bridge the gap using verification or synthesis techniques, both requiring
formal specifications of the intended behavior which are rarely available or
even known in the real world. This paper discusses an alternative approach for
bridging the gap, namely to infer the high-level intents from the low-level
network behavior. Specifically, we provide Anime, a framework and a tool that
given a set of observed forwarding behavior, automatically infers a set of
possible intents that best describe all observations. Our results show that
Anime can infer high-quality intents from the low-level forwarding behavior
with acceptable performance.

  The polarized SILL programming language uniformly integrates functional
programming and session-based concurrency. It supports recursion, asynchronous
and synchronous communication, and higher-order programs that communicate
processes. We build on work by Atkey to give the first denotational semantics
for a language with these features. Session types are interpreted as domains of
bidirectional communications. We use polarity to naturally relate these to
pairs of domains of unidirectional communications. Processes denote continuous
functions between domains of unidirectional communication. Semantic composition
of processes is given by a trace operator. Our semantics validates many
expected program equivalences.

\\
  At the heart of deep learning training and inferencing are computationally
intensive primitives such as convolutions which form the building blocks of
deep neural networks. Researchers have taken two distinct approaches to
creating high performance implementations of deep learning kernels, namely, 1)
library development exemplified by Intel MKL-DNN for CPUs, 2) automatic
compilation represented by the TensorFlow XLA compiler. The two approaches have
their drawbacks: even though a custom built library can deliver very good
performance, the cost and time of development of the library can be high.
Automatic compilation of kernels is attractive but in practice, till date,
automatically generated implementations lag expert coded kernels in performance
by orders of magnitude.
  In this paper, we develop a hybrid solution to the development of deep
learning kernels that achieves the best of both worlds: the expert coded
microkernels are utilized for the innermost loops of kernels and we use the
advanced polyhedral technology to automatically tune the outer loops for
performance. We design a novel polyhedral model based data reuse algorithm to
optimize the outer loops of the kernel. Through experimental evaluation on an
important class of deep learning primitives namely convolutions, we demonstrate
that the approach we develop attains the same levels of performance as Intel
MKL-DNN, a hand coded deep learning library.

Authors: Ruben P. Pieters and Tom Schrijvers
Categories: cs.PL
\\
  This paper presents PaSe, an extensible and inspectable DSL embedded in
Haskell for expressing micro-animations. The philosophy of PaSe is to compose
animations based on sequential and parallel composition of smaller animations.
This differs from other animation libraries that focus more on sequential
composition and have only limited forms of parallel composition. To provide
similar flexibility as other animation libraries, PaSe features extensibility
of operations and inspectability of animations. We present the features of PaSe
with a to-do list application, discuss the PaSe implementation, and argue that
the callback style of extensibility is detrimental for correctly combining PaSe
features. We contrast with the GreenSock Animation Platform, a
professional-grade and widely used JavaScript animation library, to illustrate
this point.

\\
  Optimizing programs to run efficiently on modern parallel hardware is hard
but crucial for many applications. The predominantly used imperative languages
- like C or OpenCL - force the programmer to intertwine the code describing
functionality and optimizations. This results in a nightmare for portability
which is particularly problematic given the accelerating trend towards
specialized hardware devices to further increase efficiency.
  Many emerging DSLs used in performance demanding domains such as deep
learning, automatic differentiation, or image processing attempt to simplify or
even fully automate the optimization process. Using a high-level - often
functional - language, programmers focus on describing functionality in a
declarative way. In some systems such as Halide or TVM, a separate schedule
specifies how the program should be optimized. Unfortunately, these schedules
are not written in well-defined programming languages. Instead, they are
implemented as a set of ad-hoc predefined APIs that the compiler writers have
exposed.
  In this paper, we present Elevate: a functional language for describing
optimization strategies. Elevate follows a tradition of prior systems used in
different contexts that express optimization strategies as composition of
rewrites. In contrast to systems with scheduling APIs, in Elevate programmers
are not restricted to a set of built-in optimizations but define their own
optimization strategies freely in a composable way. We show how user-defined
optimization strategies in Elevate enable the effective optimization of
programs expressed in a functional data-parallel language demonstrating
competitive performance with Halide and TVM.

Title: Learning Probabilistic Intersection Traffic Models for Trajectory
  Prediction
Authors: Andrew Patterson, Aditya Gahlawat, Naira Hovakimyan
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
\\
  Autonomous agents must be able to safely interact with other vehicles to
integrate into urban environments. The safety of these agents is dependent on
their ability to predict collisions with other vehicles' future trajectories
for replanning and collision avoidance. The information needed to predict
collisions can be learned from previously observed vehicle trajectories in a
specific environment, generating a traffic model. The learned traffic model can
then be incorporated as prior knowledge into any trajectory estimation method
being used in this environment. This work presents a Gaussian process based
probabilistic traffic model that is used to quantify vehicle behaviors in an
intersection. The Gaussian process model provides estimates for the average
vehicle trajectory, while also capturing the variance between the different
paths a vehicle may take in the intersection. The method is demonstrated on a
set of time-series position trajectories. These trajectories are reconstructed
by removing object recognition errors and missed frames that may occur due to
data source processing. To create the intersection traffic model, the
reconstructed trajectories are clustered based on their source and destination
lanes. For each cluster, a Gaussian process model is created to capture the
average behavior and the variance of the cluster. To show the applicability of
the Gaussian model, the test trajectories are classified with only partial
observations. Performance is quantified by the number of observations required
to correctly classify the vehicle trajectory. Both the intersection traffic
modeling computations and the classification procedure are timed. These times
are presented as results and demonstrate that the model can be constructed in a
reasonable amount of time and the classification procedure can be used for
online applications.

Title: Fast and Safe Path-Following Control using a State-Dependent Directional
  Metric
Authors: Zhichao Li, Omur Arslan, Nikolay Atanasov
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  This paper considers the problem of fast and safe autonomous navigation in
partially known environments. Our main contribution is a control policy design
based on ellipsoidal trajectory bounds obtained from a quadratic
state-dependent distance metric. The ellipsoidal bounds are used to embed
directional preference in the control design, leading to system behavior that
is adapted to the local environment geometry, carefully considering medial
obstacles while paying less attention to lateral ones. We use a virtual
reference governor system to adaptively follow a desired navigation path,
slowing down when system safety may be violated and speeding up otherwise. The
resulting controller is able to navigate complex environments faster than
common Euclidean-norm and Lyapunov-function-based designs, while retaining
stability and collision avoidance guarantees.

\\
  Lessons learned from the increasing diversity of road trial deployments of
autonomous vehicles have made clear that guaranteeing safety of driving
decisions is a crucial bottleneck on the path towards wider adoption. A
promising direction is to pose safety requirements as planning constraints in
nonlinear optimization problems for motion synthesis. However, many
implementations of this approach are limited by uncertain convergence and local
optimality of the solutions achieved, affecting overall robustness. In this
paper, we propose a novel two-stage optimization framework: in the first stage,
we find a global but approximate solution to a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) formulation of the motion synthesis problem, the output of which
initializes a second Nonlinear Programming (NLP) stage. The MILP stage enforces
hard constraints including safety and road rules, while the NLP stage refines
that solution within safety bounds to make it feasible with respect to vehicle
dynamics and smoothness. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework through
experiments in complex driving situations, showing it outperforms a state of
the art baseline in terms of convergence, comfort and progress metrics.

Title: Integrating Planning and Interpretable Goal Recognition for Autonomous
  Driving
Authors: Stefano V. Albrecht, Cillian Brewitt, John Wilhelm, Francisco Eiras,

Categories: cs.RO
\\
  The ability to predict the intentions and driving trajectories of other
vehicles is a key problem for autonomous driving. We propose an integrated
planning and prediction system which leverages the computational benefit of
using a finite space of maneuvers, and extend the approach to planning and
prediction of sequences (plans) of maneuvers via rational inverse planning to
recognise the goals of other vehicles. Goal recognition informs a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to plan optimal maneuvers for the ego vehicle.
Inverse planning and MCTS utilise a shared set of defined maneuvers to
construct plans which are explainable by means of rationality, i.e. plans are
optimal in given metrics. Evaluation in simulations of four urban driving
scenarios demonstrate the system's ability to robustly recognise the goals of
other vehicles while generating near-optimal plans. In each scenario we extract
intuitive explanations for the recognised goals and maneuver predictions which
justify the system's decisions.

Title: Smoother Position-Drift Compensation for Time Domain Passivity Approach
  based Teleoperation

Journal-ref: 2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and
  Systems (IROS), Madrid, 2018, pp. 5525-5532
DOI: 10.1109/IROS.2018.8594125
\\
  Despite being one of the most robust methods in bilateral teleoperation, Time
Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA) presents the drawback of accumulating position
drift between master and slave devices. The lack of position synchronization
poses an obstacle to the performance of teleoperation and may prevent the
successful accomplishment of such tasks. Several techniques have been developed
in order to solve the position-drift problem in TDPA-based teleoperation.
However, they either present poor transparency by over-conservatively
constraining force feedback or add high impulse-like force signals that can be
harmful to the hardware and to the human operator. We propose a new approach to
compensate position drift in TDPA-based teleoperation in a smoother way, which
keeps the forces within the normal range of the teleoperation task while
preserving the level of transparency and the robust stability of energy-based
TDPA. We also add a way of tuning the compensator to behave in accordance with
the task being performed, whether it requires faster or smoother compensation.
The feasibility and performance of the method were experimentally validated.
Good position tracking and regular-amplitude forces are demonstrated with up to
500 ms round-trip constant and variable delays for hard-wall contacts.

Title: Scalable and Probabilistically Complete Planning for Robotic Spatial
  Extrusion
Authors: Caelan Reed Garrett, Yijiang Huang, Tom\'as Lozano-P\'erez, and
  Caitlin Tobin Mueller
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI
\\
  There is increasing demand for automated systems that can fabricate 3D
structures. Robotic spatial extrusion has become an attractive alternative to
traditional layer-based 3D printing due to a manipulator's flexibility to print
large, directionally-dependent structures. However, existing extrusion planning
algorithms require a substantial amount of human input, do not scale to large
instances, and lack theoretical guarantees. In this work, we present a rigorous
formalization of robotic spatial extrusion planning and provide several
efficient and probabilistically complete planning algorithms. The key planning
challenge is, throughout the printing process, satisfying both stiffness
constraints that limit the deformation of the structure and geometric
constraints that ensure the robot does not collide with the structure. We show
that, although these constraints often conflict with each other, a greedy
backward state-space search guided by a stiffness-aware heuristic is able to
successfully balance both constraints. We empirically compare our methods on a
benchmark of over 40 simulated extrusion problems. Finally, we apply our
approach to 3 real-world extrusion problems.

Title: The utility of tactile force to autonomous learning of in-hand
  manipulation is task-dependent
Authors: Romina Mir, Ali Marjaninejad, Francisco J. Valero-Cuevas
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
Comments: 4 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Tactile sensors provide information that can be used to learn and execute
manipulation tasks. Different tasks, however, might require different levels of
sensory information; which in turn likely affect learning rates and
performance. This paper evaluates the role of tactile information on autonomous
learning of manipulation with a simulated 3-finger tendon-driven hand. We
compare the ability of the same learning algorithm (Proximal Policy
Optimization, PPO) to learn two manipulation tasks (rolling a ball about the
horizontal axis with and without rotational stiffness) with three levels of
tactile sensing: no sensing, 1D normal force, and 3D force vector.
Surprisingly, and contrary to recent work on manipulation, adding 1D
force-sensing did not always improve learning rates compared to no
sensing---likely due to whether or not normal force is relevant to the task.
Nonetheless, even though 3D force-sensing increases the dimensionality of the
sensory input---which would in general hamper algorithm convergence---it
resulted in faster learning rates and better performance. We conclude that, in
general, sensory input is useful to learning only when it is relevant to the
task---as is the case of 3D force-sensing for in-hand manipulation against
gravity. Moreover, the utility of 3D force-sensing can even offset the added
computational cost of learning with higher-dimensional sensory input.

Title: An Additive Decomposition in S-Primitive Towers

\\
  We consider the additive decomposition problem in primitive towers and
present an algorithm to decompose a function in an S-primitive tower as a sum
of a derivative in the tower and a remainder which is minimal in some sense.
Special instances of S-primitive towers include differential fields generated
by finitely many logarithmic functions and logarithmic integrals. A function in
an S-primitive tower is integrable in the tower if and only if the remainder is
equal to zero. The additive decomposition is achieved by viewing our towers not
as a traditional chain of extension fields, but rather as a direct sum of
certain subrings. Furthermore, we can determine whether or not a function in an
S-primitive tower has an elementary integral without solving any differential
equations. We also show that a kind of S-primitive towers, known as logarithmic
towers, can be embedded into a particular extension where we can obtain a finer
remainder.

\\
  Source separation is the task to separate an audio recording into individual
sound sources. Source separation is fundamental for computational auditory
scene analysis. Previous work on source separation has focused on separating
particular sound classes such as speech and music. Many of previous work
require mixture and clean source pairs for training. In this work, we propose a
source separation framework trained with weakly labelled data. Weakly labelled
data only contains the tags of an audio clip, without the occurrence time of
sound events. We first train a sound event detection system with AudioSet. The
trained sound event detection system is used to detect segments that are mostly
like to contain a target sound event. Then a regression is learnt from a
mixture of two randomly selected segments to a target segment conditioned on
the audio tagging prediction of the target segment. Our proposed system can
separate 527 kinds of sound classes from AudioSet within a single system. A
U-Net is adopted for the separation system and achieves an average SDR of 5.67
dB over 527 sound classes in AudioSet.

\\
  Automatic music generation is an interdisciplinary research topic that
combines computational creativity and semantic analysis of music to create
automatic machine improvisations. An important property of such a system is
allowing the user to specify conditions and desired properties of the generated
music. In this paper we designed a model for composing melodies given a user
specified symbolic scenario combined with a previous music context. We add
manual labeled vectors denoting external music quality in terms of chord
function that provides a low dimensional representation of the harmonic tension
and resolution. Our model is capable of generating long melodies by regarding
8-beat note sequences as basic units, and shares consistent rhythm pattern
structure with another specific song. The model contains two stages and
requires separate training where the first stage adopts a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (C-VAE) to build a bijection between note sequences and
their latent representations, and the second stage adopts long short-term
memory networks (LSTM) with structural conditions to continue writing future
melodies. We further exploit the disentanglement technique via C-VAE to allow
melody generation based on pitch contour information separately from
conditioning on rhythm patterns. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model using
quantitative analysis of rhythm and the subjective listening study. Results
show that the music generated by our model tends to have salient repetition
structures, rich motives, and stable rhythm patterns. The ability to generate
longer and more structural phrases from disentangled representations combined
with semantic scenario specification conditions shows a broad application of
our model.

Title: Design of the Inspection Process Using the GitHub Flow in Project Based
  Learning for Software Engineering and Its Practice
Authors: Yutsuki Miyashita, Yuki Yamada, Hiroaki Hashiura, and Atsuo Hazeyama
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Project based learning (PBL) for software development (we call it software
development PBL) has garnered attention as a practical educational method. A
number of studies have reported on the introduction of social coding tools such
as GitHub, in software development PBL. In education, it is important to give
feedback (advice, error corrections, and so on) to learners, especially in
software development PBL because almost all learners tackle practical software
development from the viewpoint of technical and managerial aspects for the
first time. This study regards inspection that is conducted in general software
development activities as an opportunity to provide feedback and proposes the
inspection process using the pull request on GitHub. By applying the proposed
process to an actual software development PBL, we enable giving feedback to the
accurate locations of artifacts the learners created.

  Context:Quality requirements (QRs) describe the desired quality of software,
and they play an important role in the success of software projects. In agile
software development (ASD), QRs are often ill-defined and not well addressed
due to the focus on quickly delivering functionality. Rapid software
development (RSD) approaches (e.g., continuous delivery and continuous
deployment), which shorten delivery times, are more prone to neglect QRs.
Despite the significance of QRs in both ASD and RSD, there is limited
synthesized knowledge on their management in those approaches. Objective:This
study aims to synthesize state-of-the-art knowledge about QR management in ASD
and RSD, focusing on three aspects: bibliometric, strategies, and challenges.
Research method:Using a systematic mapping study with a snowballing search
strategy, we identified and structured the literature on QR management in ASD
and RSD. Check the PDF file to see the full abstract and document.

Title: A Dataset for GitHub Repository Deduplication

Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure, 1 listing
\\
  GitHub projects can be easily replicated through the site's fork process or
through a Git clone-push sequence. This is a problem for empirical software
engineering, because it can lead to skewed results or mistrained machine
learning models. We provide a dataset of 10.6 million GitHub projects that are
copies of others, and link each record with the project's ultimate parent. The
ultimate parents were derived from a ranking along six metrics. The related
projects were calculated as the connected components of an 18.2 million node
and 12 million edge denoised graph created by directing edges to ultimate
parents. The graph was created by filtering out more than 30 hand-picked and
2.3 million pattern-matched clumping projects. Projects that introduced
unwanted clumping were identified by repeatedly visualizing shortest path
distances between unrelated important projects. Our dataset identified 30
thousand duplicate projects in an existing popular reference dataset of 1.8
million projects. An evaluation of our dataset against another created
independently with different methods found a significant overlap, but also
differences attributed to the operational definition of what projects are
considered as related.

Title: Message Passing for Query Answering over Knowledge Graphs
Authors: Daniel Daza and Michael Cochez
Categories: cs.SI cs.LG
\\
  Logic-based systems for query answering over knowledge graphs return only
answers that rely on information explicitly represented in the graph. To
improve recall, recent works have proposed the use of embeddings to predict
additional information like missing links, or labels. These embeddings enable
scoring entities in the graph as the answer a query, without being fully
dependent on the graph structure. In its simplest case, answering a query in
such a setting requires predicting a link between two entities. However, link
prediction is not sufficient to address complex queries that involve multiple
entities and variables. To solve this task, we propose to apply a message
passing mechanism to a graph representation of the query, where nodes
correspond to variables and entities. This results in an embedding of the
query, such that answering entities are close to it in the embedding space. The
general formulation of our method allows it to encode a more diverse set of
query types in comparison to previous work. We evaluate our method by answering
queries that rely on edges not seen during training, obtaining competitive
performance. In contrast with previous work, we show that our method can
generalize from training for the single-hop, link prediction task, to answering
queries with more complex structures. A qualitative analysis reveals that the
learned embeddings successfully capture the notion of different entity types.

Title: Compositional Abstraction-based Synthesis for Interconnected Systems: An
  Approximate Composition Approach
Authors: Adnane Saoud and Pushpak Jagtap and Majid Zamani and Antoine Girard
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 18 pages, 8 figures
\\
  In this paper, we consider the problem of abstraction-based controller
synthesis for interconnected control systems. In general, the conventional
methods for the construction of discrete abstractions and synthesis become
computationally expensive due to the state and input spaces dimensions while
dealing with large interconnected systems. The results in this paper focus on
relaxing this issue by providing a compositional framework for the construction
of abstractions for interconnected systems. First, we propose a notion of
approximate composition which makes it possible to compute an abstraction of
the global interconnected system from the abstractions of its components.
Second, we propose an incremental procedure for the synthesis of controllers
enforcing safety specifications. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed results on two case studies (viz., DC microgrid and traffic
network) by comparing them with different abstraction and controller synthesis
schemes.

Title: Turnpike Properties in Discrete-Time Mixed-Integer Optimal Control
Authors: Timm Faulwasser and Alexander Murray
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.OC
\\
  This note discusses properties of parametric discrete-time Mixed-Integer
Optimal Control Problems (MIOCPs) as they often arise in mixed-integer NMPC. We
argue that in want for a handle on similarity properties of parametric MIOCPs
the classical turnpike notion from optimal control is helpful. We provide
sufficient turnpike conditions based on a dissipativity notion of MIOCPs, and
we show that the turnpike property allows specific and accurate guesses for the
integer-valued controls. Moreover, we show how the turnpike property can be
used to derive efficient node-weighted branch-and-bound schemes tailored to
parametric MIOCPs. We draw upon numerical examples to illustrate our findings.

  Batteries

\\
  One of the most crucial challenges faced by the Li-ion battery community
concerns the search for the minimum time charging without irreversibly damaging
the cells. This can fall into solving large-scale nonlinear optimal control
problems according to a battery model. Within this context, several model-based
techniques have been proposed in the literature.However, the effectiveness of
such strategies is significantly limited by model complexity and uncertainty.
Additionally, it is difficult to track parameters related to aging and re-tune
the model-based control policy. With the aim of overcoming these limitations,
in this paper we propose a fast-charging strategy subject to safety constraints
which relies on a model-free reinforcement learning framework. In particular,
we focus on the policy gradient-based actor-critic algorithm, i.e., deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), in order to deal with continuous sets of
actions and sets. The validity of the proposal is assessed in simulation when a
reduced electrochemical model is considered as the real plant. Finally, the
online adaptability of the proposed strategy in response to variations of the
environment parameters is highlighted with consideration of state reduction.

\\
  We consider the problem of energy management in microgrid networks. A
microgrid is capable of generating a limited amount of energy from a renewable
resource and is responsible for handling the demands of its dedicated
customers. Owing to the variable nature of renewable generation and the demands
of the customers, it becomes imperative that each microgrid optimally manages
its energy. This involves intelligently scheduling the demands at the customer
side, selling (when there is a surplus) and buying (when there is a deficit)
the power from its neighboring microgrids depending on its current and future
needs. Typically, the transaction of power among the microgrids happens at a
pre-decided price by the central grid. In this work, we formulate the problems
of demand and battery scheduling, energy trading and dynamic pricing (where we
allow the microgrids to decide the price of the transaction depending on their
current configuration of demand and renewable energy) in the framework of
stochastic games. Subsequently, we propose a novel approach that makes use of
independent learners Deep Q-learning algorithm to solve this problem. Through
extensive empirical evaluation, we show that our proposed framework is more
beneficial to the majority of the microgrids and we provide a detailed analysis
of the results.

models of their subsystems. Given a simulation model from which finite traces
of state trajectories of the subsystems can be collected, our algorithm
involves the following tasks: first, a set of data that satisfies certain
properties is collected by performing simulation experiments, second, multiple
Lyapunov functions are designed from the above data and a set of relevant
scalars is computed from these functions, and third, a stabilizing minimum
dwell time is determined as a function of these scalars. A numerical example is
presented to demonstrate the proposed algorithm.

  Robot Swarms
Authors: Ting-Kuei Hu, Fernando Gama, Zhangyang Wang, Alejandro Ribeiro, Brian
  M. Sadler
Categories: eess.SY cs.CV cs.SY
\\
  Despite the popularity of decentralized controller learning, very few
successes have been demonstrated on learning to control large robot swarms
using raw visual observations. To fill in this gap, we present Vision-based
Graph Aggregation and Inference (VGAI), a decentralized learning-to-control
framework that directly maps raw visual observations to agent actions, aided by
sparse local communication among only neighboring agents. Our framework is
implemented by an innovative cascade of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
and one graph neural network (GNN), addressing agent-level visual perception
and feature learning, as well as swarm-level local information aggregation and
agent action inference, respectively. Using the application example of drone
flocking, we show that VGAI yields comparable or more competitive performance
with other decentralized controllers, and even the centralized controller that
learns from global information. Especially, it shows substantial scalability to
learn over large swarms (e.g., 50 agents), thanks to the integration between
visual perception and local communication.

  This paper presents a computationally efficient algorithm for eco-driving
over long prediction horizons. The eco-driving problem is formulated as a
bi-level program, where the bottom level is solved offline, pre-optimizing gear
as a function of longitudinal velocity and acceleration. The top level is
solved online, optimizing a nonlinear dynamic program with travel time, kinetic
energy and acceleration as state variables. To further reduce computational
effort, the travel time is adjoined to the objective by applying necessary
Pontryagin Maximum Principle conditions, and the nonlinear program is solved
using real-time iteration sequential quadratic programming scheme in a model
predictive control framework. Compared to standard cruise control, the energy
savings of using the proposed algorithm is up to 15.71%.

Title: A homotopy approach to coherent quantum LQG control synthesis using

  This paper is concerned with linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control for a
field-mediated feedback connection of a plant and a coherent (measurement-free)
controller. Both the plant and the controller are multimode open quantum
harmonic oscillators governed by linear quantum stochastic differential
equations. The control objective is to make the closed-loop system internally
stable and to minimize the infinite-horizon quadratic cost involving the plant
variables and the controller output subject to quantum physical realizability
(PR) constraints. This coherent quantum LQG (CQLQG) control problem, which has
been of active research interest for over ten years, does not admit a solution
in the form of separation principle and independent Riccati equations known for
its classical counterpart. We apply variational techniques to a family of
discounted CQLQG control problems parameterized by an effective time horizon.
This gives rise to a homotopy algorithm, which is initialized with a PR (but
not necessarily stabilizing) controller and aims at a locally optimal
stabilizing controller for the original problem in the limit.

Title: Exploring Maximum Entropy Distributions with Evolutionary Algorithms
Authors: Raul Rojas

\\
  This paper shows how to evolve numerically the maximum entropy probability
distributions for a given set of constraints, which is a variational calculus
problem. An evolutionary algorithm can obtain approximations to some well-known
analytical results, but is even more flexible and can find distributions for
which a closed formula cannot be readily stated. The numerical approach handles
distributions over finite intervals. We show that there are two ways of
conducting the procedure: by direct optimization of the Lagrangian of the
constrained problem, or by optimizing the entropy among the subset of
distributions which fulfill the constraints. An incremental evolutionary
strategy easily obtains the uniform, the exponential, the Gaussian, the
log-normal, the Laplace, among other distributions, once the constrained
problem is solved with any of the two methods. Solutions for mixed ("chimera")
distributions can be also found. We explain why many of the distributions are
symmetrical and continuous, but some are not.

Title: An Analysis of Adversarial Attacks and Defenses on Autonomous Driving
  Models
Authors: Yao Deng, Xi Zheng, Tianyi Zhang, Chen Chen, Guannan Lou, Miryung Kim
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  Nowadays, autonomous driving has attracted much attention from both industry
and academia. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a key component in
autonomous driving, which is also increasingly adopted in pervasive computing
such as smartphones, wearable devices, and IoT networks. Prior work shows
CNN-based classification models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However,
it is uncertain to what extent regression models such as driving models are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the effectiveness of existing defense
techniques, and the defense implications for system and middleware builders.
This paper presents an in-depth analysis of five adversarial attacks and four
defense methods on three driving models. Experiments show that, similar to
classification models, these models are still highly vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. This poses a big security threat to autonomous driving and thus should
be taken into account in practice. While these defense methods can effectively
defend against different attacks, none of them are able to provide adequate
protection against all five attacks. We derive several implications for system
and middleware builders: (1) when adding a defense component against
adversarial attacks, it is important to deploy multiple defense methods in
tandem to achieve a good coverage of various attacks, (2) a blackbox attack is
much less effective compared with a white-box attack, implying that it is
important to keep model details (e.g., model architecture, hyperparameters)
confidential via model obfuscation, and (3) driving models with a complex
architecture are preferred if computing resources permit as they are more
resilient to adversarial attacks than simple models.

Title: Global Convergence of Frank Wolfe on One Hidden Layer Networks

Categories: math.OC cs.AI
\\
  We derive global convergence bounds for the Frank Wolfe algorithm when
training one hidden layer neural networks. When using the ReLU activation
function, and under tractable preconditioning assumptions on the sample data
set, the linear minimization oracle used to incrementally form the solution can
be solved explicitly as a second order cone program. The classical Frank Wolfe
algorithm then converges with rate $O(1/T)$ where $T$ is both the number of
neurons and the number of calls to the oracle.

Title: FPGA Acceleration of Sequence Alignment: A Survey
Authors: Sahand Salamat and Tajana Rosing
Categories: q-bio.QM cs.AR q-bio.GN
\\
  Genomics is changing our understanding of humans, evolution, diseases, and
medicines to name but a few. As sequencing technology is developed collecting
DNA sequences takes less time thereby generating more genetic data every day.
Today the rate of generating genetic data is outpacing the rate of computation
power growth. Current sequencing machines can sequence 50 humans genome per
day; however, aligning the read sequences against a reference genome and
assembling the genome will take 1300 CPU hours. The main step in constructing
the genome is aligning the reads against a reference genome. Numerous
accelerators have been proposed to accelerate the DNA alignment process.
Providing massive parallelism, FPGA-based accelerators have shown great
performance in accelerating DNA alignment algorithms. Additionally, FPGA-based
accelerators provide better energy efficiency than general-purpose processors.
In this survey, we introduce three main DNA alignment algorithms and FPGA-based
implementation of these algorithms to accelerate the DNA alignment. We also,
compare these three alignment categories and show how accelerators are
developing during the time.

Title: On flips in planar matchings
Authors: Marcel Milich, Torsten M\"utze, Martin Pergel
Categories: math.CO cs.CG cs.DM
\\
  In this paper we investigate the structure of a flip graph on non-crossing
perfect matchings in the plane. Consider the set of all non-crossing
straight-line perfect matchings on a set of $2n$ points that are placed
equidistantly on the unit circle. The graph $\mathcal{H}_n$ has those matchings
as vertices, and an edge between any two matchings that differ in replacing two
matching edges that span an empty quadrilateral with the other two edges of the
quadrilateral, provided that the quadrilateral contains the center of the unit
circle. We show that the graph $\mathcal{H}_n$ is connected for odd $n$, but
has exponentially many small connected components for even $n$, which we
characterize and count via Catalan and generalized Narayana numbers. For odd
$n$, we also prove that the diameter of $\mathcal{H}_n$ is at least linear and
at most log-linear in $n$. Furthermore, we determine the minimum and maximum
degree of $\mathcal{H}_n$ for all $n$, and characterize and count the
corresponding vertices. Our results imply the non-existence of certain rainbow
cycles, and they answer several open questions and conjectures raised in a
recent paper by Felsner, Kleist, M\"utze, and Sering.

Title: StegColNet: Steganalysis based on an ensemble colorspace approach
Authors: Shreyank N Gowda, Chun Yuan
Categories: eess.IV cs.CR cs.CV
\\
  Image steganography refers to the process of hiding information inside
images. Steganalysis is the process of detecting a steganographic image. We
introduce a steganalysis approach that uses an ensemble color space model to
obtain a weighted concatenated feature activation map. The concatenated map
helps to obtain certain features explicit to each color space. We use a
levy-flight grey wolf optimization strategy to reduce the number of features
selected in the map. We then use these features to classify the image into one
of two classes: whether the given image has secret information stored or not.
Extensive experiments have been done on a large scale dataset extracted from
the Bossbase dataset. Also, we show that the model can be transferred to
different datasets and perform extensive experiments on a mixture of datasets.
Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms the recent state of the
art deep learning steganalytical approaches by 2.32 percent on average for 0.2
bits per channel (bpc) and 1.87 percent on average for 0.4 bpc.

\\
  Intracranial tumors are groups of cells that usually grow uncontrollably. One
out of four cancer deaths is due to brain tumors. Early detection and
evaluation of brain tumors is an essential preventive medical step that is
performed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many segmentation techniques
exist for this purpose. Low segmentation accuracy is the main drawback of
existing methods. In this paper, we use a deep learning method to boost the
accuracy of tumor segmentation in MR images. Cascade approach is used with
multiple scales of images to induce both local and global views and help the
network to reach higher accuracies. Our experimental results show that using
multiple scales and the utilization of two cascade networks is advantageous.

Title: Block Distributed Majorize-Minimize Memory Gradient Algorithm and its
  application to 3D image restoration
Authors: Mathieu Chalvidal and Emilie Chouzenoux
Categories: math.OC cs.DC
Comments: Submitted to ICIP 2020
\\
  Modern 3D image recovery problems require powerful optimization frameworks to
handle high dimensionality while providing reliable numerical solutions in a
reasonable time. In this perspective, asynchronous parallel optimization
algorithms have received an increasing attention by overcoming memory
limitation issues and communication bottlenecks. In this work, we propose a
block distributed Majorize-Minorize Memory Gradient (BD3MG) optimization
algorithm for solving large scale non-convex differentiable optimization
problems. Assuming a distributed memory environment, the algorithm casts the
efficient 3MG scheme into smaller dimension subproblems where blocks of
variables are addressed in an asynchronous manner. Convergence of the sequence
built by the proposed BD3MG method is established under mild assumptions.
Application to the restoration of 3D images degraded by a depth-variant blur
shows that our method yields significant computational time reduction compared
to several synchronous and asynchronous competitors, while exhibiting great
scalability potential.

Title: Recognizing Cartesian products of matrices and polytopes
Authors: Manuel Aprile, Michele Conforti, Yuri Faenza, Samuel Fiorini, Tony

Categories: math.CO cs.DM
MSC-class: 05B20
\\
  The 1-product of matrices $S_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{m_1 \times n_1}$ and $S_2 \in
\mathbb{R}^{m_2 \times n_2}$ is the matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{(m_1+m_2) \times
(n_1n_2)}$ whose columns are the concatenation of each column of $S_1$ with
each column of $S_2$. Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm for the
following problem: given a matrix $S$, is $S$ a 1-product, up to permutation of
rows and columns? Our main motivation is a close link between the 1-product of
matrices and the Cartesian product of polytopes, which goes through the concept
of slack matrix. Determining whether a given matrix is a slack matrix is an
intriguing problem whose complexity is unknown, and our algorithm reduces the
problem to irreducible instances. Our algorithm is based on minimizing a
symmetric submodular function that expresses mutual information in information
theory. We also give a polynomial time algorithm to recognize a more
complicated matrix product, called the 2-product. Finally, as a corollary of
our 1-product and 2-product recognition algorithms, we obtain a polynomial time
algorithm to recognize slack matrices of $2$-level matroid base polytopes.

Title: Classical Simulation of High Temperature Quantum Ising Models
Authors: Elizabeth Crosson, Samuel Slezak
Categories: quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech cs.DS
Comments: 7 pages, appendices to later be expanded
\\
  We consider generalized quantum Ising models, including those which could
describe disordered materials or quantum annealers, and we prove that for all
temperatures above a system-size independent threshold the path integral Monte
Carlo method based on worldline heat-bath updates always mixes to stationarity
in time $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ for an $n$ qubit system, and therefore provides
a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the partition function. This
result holds whenever the temperature is greater than four plus twice the
maximum interaction degree (valence) over all qubits, measured in units of the
local coupling strength. For example, this implies that the classical
simulation of the thermal state of a superconducting device modeling a
frustrated quantum Ising model with maximum valence of 6 and coupling strengths
of 1 GHz is always possible at temperatures above 800 mK. Despite the quantum
system being at high temperature, the classical spin system resulting from the
quantum-to-classical mapping contains strong couplings which cause the
single-site Glauber dynamics to mix slowly, therefore this result depends on
the use of worldline updates (which are a form of cluster updates that can be
implemented efficiently). This result places definite constraints on the
temperatures required for a quantum advantage in analog quantum simulation with
various NISQ devices based on equilibrium states of quantum Ising models.

Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: To appear at the 45th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech,
  and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2020), 5 pages, 5 figures
\\
  An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), consisting of reconfigurable
metamaterials, can be used to partially control the radio environment and
thereby bring new features to wireless communications. Previous works on IRS
have particularly studied the range extension use case and under what
circumstances the new technology can beat relays. In this paper, we study
another use case that might have a larger impact on the channel capacity: rank
improvement. One of the classical bottlenecks of point-to-point MIMO
communications is that the capacity gains provided by spatial multiplexing are
only large at high SNR, and high SNR channels are mainly appearing in
line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios where the channel matrix has low rank and
therefore does not support spatial multiplexing. We demonstrate how an IRS can
be used and optimized in such scenarios to increase the rank of the channel
matrix, leading to substantial capacity gains.

Comments: In memory of Gilles Lachaud. This article has been submitted with an

  We introduce in this article a new method to estimate the minimum distance of
codes from algebraic surfaces. This lower bound is generic, i.e. can be applied
to any surface, and turns out to be "liftable" under finite morphisms, paving
the way toward the construction of good codes from towers of surfaces. In the
same direction, we establish a criterion for a surface with a fixed finite set
of closed points $\mathcal P$ to have an infinite tower of $\ell$-\'etale
covers in which $\mathcal P$ splits totally. We conclude by stating several
open problems. In particular, we relate the existence of asymptotically good
codes from general type surfaces with a very ample canonical class to the
behaviour of their number of rational points with respect to their $K^2$ and
coherent Euler characteristic.

Comments: The ViWi dataset is available at https://www.viwi-dataset.net
\\
  Vision-aided wireless communication is motivated by the recent advances in
deep learning and computer vision as well as the increasing dependence on
line-of-sight links in millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz systems. By
leveraging vision, this new research direction enables an interesting set of
new capabilities such as vision-aided mmWave beam and blockage prediction,
proactive hand-off, and resource allocation among others. These capabilities
have the potential of reliably supporting highly-mobile applications such as
vehicular/drone communications and wireless virtual/augmented reality in mmWave
and terahertz systems. Investigating these interesting applications, however,
requires the development of special dataset and machine learning tasks. Based
on the Vision-Wireless (ViWi) dataset generation framework [1], this paper
develops an advanced and realistic scenario/dataset that features multiple base
stations, mobile users, and rich dynamics. Enabled by this dataset, the paper
defines the vision-wireless mmWave beam tracking task (ViWi-BT) and proposes a
baseline solution that can provide an initial benchmark for the future ViWi-BT
algorithms.

Authors: Henry B.Moss, Vatsal Aggarwal, Nishant Prateek, Javier Gonz\'alez,

Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML
\\
  We present BOFFIN TTS (Bayesian Optimization For FIne-tuning Neural Text To
Speech), a novel approach for few-shot speaker adaptation. Here, the task is to
fine-tune a pre-trained TTS model to mimic a new speaker using a small corpus
of target utterances. We demonstrate that there does not exist a
one-size-fits-all adaptation strategy, with convincing synthesis requiring a
corpus-specific configuration of the hyper-parameters that control fine-tuning.
By using Bayesian optimization to efficiently optimize these hyper-parameter
values for a target speaker, we are able to perform adaptation with an average
30% improvement in speaker similarity over standard techniques. Results
indicate, across multiple corpora, that BOFFIN TTS can learn to synthesize new
speakers using less than ten minutes of audio, achieving the same naturalness
as produced for the speakers used to train the base model.

Comments: Accepted for presentation at International Symposium on Biomedical

\\
  Lung cancer has a high rate of recurrence in early-stage patients. Predicting
the post-surgical recurrence in lung cancer patients has traditionally been
approached using single modality information of genomics or radiology images.
We investigate the potential of multimodal fusion for this task. By combining
computed tomography (CT) images and genomics, we demonstrate improved
prediction of recurrence using linear Cox proportional hazards models with
elastic net regularization. We work on a recent non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) radiogenomics dataset of 130 patients and observe an increase in
concordance-index values of up to 10%. Employing non-linear methods from the
neural network literature, such as multi-layer perceptrons and visual-question
answering fusion modules, did not improve performance consistently. This
indicates the need for larger multimodal datasets and fusion techniques better
adapted to this biological setting.

Title: Detecting Changes in Asset Co-Movement Using the Autoencoder
  Reconstruction Ratio
Authors: Bryan Lim, Stefan Zohren, Stephen Roberts
Categories: q-fin.ST cs.LG q-fin.PM stat.ML
\\
  Detecting changes in asset co-movements is of much importance to financial
practitioners, with numerous risk management benefits arising from the timely
detection of breakdowns in historical correlations. In this article, we propose
a real-time indicator to detect temporary increases in asset co-movements, the
Autoencoder Reconstruction Ratio, which measures how well a basket of asset
returns can be modelled using a lower-dimensional set of latent variables. The
ARR uses a deep sparse denoising autoencoder to perform the dimensionality
reduction on the returns vector, which replaces the PCA approach of the
standard Absorption Ratio, and provides a better model for non-Gaussian
returns. Through a systemic risk application on forecasting on the CRSP US
Total Market Index, we show that lower ARR values coincide with higher
volatility and larger drawdowns, indicating that increased asset co-movement
does correspond with periods of market weakness. We also demonstrate that
short-term (i.e. 5-min and 1-hour) predictors for realised volatility and
market crashes can be improved by including additional ARR inputs.

Title: Predicting Bank Loan Default with Extreme Gradient Boosting
Authors: Rising Odegua
Categories: q-fin.ST cs.LG
Comments: 5 pages, 3 Figures, 4 Tables
\\
  Loan default prediction is one of the most important and critical problems
faced by banks and other financial institutions as it has a huge effect on
profit. Although many traditional methods exist for mining information about a
loan application, most of these methods seem to be under-performing as there
have been reported increases in the number of bad loans. In this paper, we use
an Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm called XGBoost for loan default
prediction. The prediction is based on a loan data from a leading bank taking
into consideration data sets from both the loan application and the demographic
of the applicant. We also present important evaluation metrics such as
Accuracy, Recall, precision, F1-Score and ROC area of the analysis. This paper
provides an effective basis for loan credit approval in order to identify risky
customers from a large number of loan applications using predictive modeling.

Title: Fixed smooth convolutional layer for avoiding checkerboard artifacts in

\\
  In this paper, we propose a fixed convolutional layer with an order of
smoothness not only for avoiding checkerboard artifacts in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) but also for enhancing the performance of CNNs, where the
smoothness of its filter kernel can be controlled by a parameter. It is
well-known that a number of CNNs generate checkerboard artifacts in both of two
process: forward-propagation of upsampling layers and backward-propagation of
strided convolutional layers. The proposed layer can perfectly prevent
checkerboard artifacts caused by strided convolutional layers or upsampling
layers including transposed convolutional layers. In an image-classification
experiment with four CNNs: a simple CNN, VGG8, ResNet-18, and ResNet-101,
applying the fixed layers to these CNNs is shown to improve the classification
performance of all CNNs. In addition, the fixed layer are applied to generative
adversarial networks (GANs), for the first time. From image-generation results,
a smoother fixed convolutional layer is demonstrated to enable us to improve
the quality of images generated with GANs.

Title: Uncovering differential equations from data with hidden variables

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG nlin.CD physics.ao-ph
\\
  Finding a set of differential equations to model dynamical systems is a
difficult task present in many branches of science and engineering. We propose
a method to learn systems of differential equations directly from data. Our
method is based on solving a tailor-made $\ell_1-$regularised least-squares
problem and can deal with latent variables by adding higher-order derivatives
to account for the lack of information. Extensive numerical studies show that
our method can recover useful representations of the dynamical system that
generated the data even when some variables are not observed. Moreover, being
based on solving a convex optimisation problem, our method is much faster than
competing approaches based on solving combinatorial problems. Finally, we apply
our methodology to a real data-set of temperature time series.

Title: Near-optimal Reinforcement Learning in Factored MDPs: Oracle-Efficient
  Algorithms for the Non-episodic Setting
Authors: Ziping Xu and Ambuj Tewari
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to ICML
\\
  We study reinforcement learning in factored Markov decision processes (FMDPs)
in the non-episodic setting. We focus on regret analyses providing both upper
and lower bounds. We propose two near-optimal and oracle-efficient algorithms
for FMDPs. Assuming oracle access to an FMDP planner, they enjoy a Bayesian and
a frequentist regret bound respectively, both of which reduce to the
near-optimal bound $\widetilde{O}(DS\sqrt{AT})$ for standard non-factored MDPs.
Our lower bound depends on the span of the bias vector rather than the diameter
$D$ and we show via a simple Cartesian product construction that FMDPs with a
bounded span can have an arbitrarily large diameter, which suggests that bounds
with a dependence on diameter can be extremely loose. We, therefore, propose
another algorithm that only depends on span but relies on a computationally
stronger oracle. Our algorithms outperform the previous near-optimal algorithms
on computer network administrator simulations.

Title: Robust $k$-means Clustering for Distributions with Two Moments
Authors: Yegor Klochkov, Alexey Kroshnin, and Nikita Zhivotovskiy
Categories: math.ST cs.LG stat.TH
Comments: 25 pages
\\
  We consider the robust algorithms for the $k$-means clustering problem where
a quantizer is constructed based on $N$ independent observations. Our main
results are median of means based non-asymptotic excess distortion bounds that
hold under the two bounded moments assumption in a general separable Hilbert
space. In particular, our results extend the renowned asymptotic result of
Pollard, 1981 who showed that the existence of two moments is sufficient for
strong consistency of an empirically optimal quantizer in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In a
special case of clustering in $\mathbb{R}^d$, under two bounded moments, we
prove matching (up to constant factors) non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds
on the excess distortion, which depend on the probability mass of the lightest
cluster of an optimal quantizer. Our bounds have the sub-Gaussian form, and the
proofs are based on the versions of uniform bounds for robust mean estimators.

Title: Macroscopic Traffic Flow Modeling with Physics Regularized Gaussian
  Process: A New Insight into Machine Learning Applications
Authors: Yun Yuan, Xianfeng Terry Yang, Zhao Zhang, Shandian Zhe
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 30 pages, 13 figures
\\
  Despite the wide implementation of machine learning (ML) techniques in
traffic flow modeling recently, those data-driven approaches often fall short
of accuracy in the cases with a small or noisy dataset. To address this issue,
this study presents a new modeling framework, named physics regularized machine
learning (PRML), to encode classical traffic flow models (referred as physical
models) into the ML architecture and to regularize the ML training process.
More specifically, a stochastic physics regularized Gaussian process (PRGP)
model is developed and a Bayesian inference algorithm is used to estimate the
mean and kernel of the PRGP. A physical regularizer based on macroscopic
traffic flow models is also developed to augment the estimation via a shadow GP
and an enhanced latent force model is used to encode physical knowledge into
stochastic processes. Based on the posterior regularization inference
framework, an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm is also developed to
maximize the evidence lowerbound of the system likelihood. To prove the
effectiveness of the proposed model, this paper conducts empirical studies on a
real-world dataset which is collected from a stretch of I-15 freeway, Utah.
Results show the new PRGP model can outperform the previous compatible methods,
such as calibrated pure physical models and pure machine learning methods, in
estimation precision and input robustness.

Title: End-to-End Models for the Analysis of Pupil Size Variations and
  Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease
Authors: Dario Zanca, Alessandra Rufa, Andrea Canessa, Silvio Sabatini
Categories: eess.IV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  It is well known that a systematic analysis of the pupil size variations,
recorded by means of an eye-tracker, is a rich source of information about a
subject's cognitive state. In this work we present end-to-end models for the
diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) based on the raw pupil size signal.
Long-range registration (10 minutes) of the pupil size were collected in
scotopic conditions (complete darkness, 0 lux) on 21 healthy subjects and 15
subjects diagnosed with PD. 1-D convolutional neural network models are trained
for classification of short-range sequences (10 to 60 seconds of registration).
The model provides prediction with high average accuracy on a hold out test
set. A temporal analysis of the model performance allowed the characterization
of pupil's size variations in PD and healthy subjects during a resting state.
Dataset and codes are released for reproducibility and benchmarking purposes.

Title: Over-the-Air Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Based Modulation
  Classifier over Wireless Channels
Authors: Brian Kim and Yalin E. Sagduyu and Kemal Davaslioglu and Tugba Erpek
  and Sennur Ulukus
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG cs.NI stat.ML
\\
  We consider a wireless communication system that consists of a transmitter, a
receiver, and an adversary. The transmitter transmits signals with different
modulation types, while the receiver classifies its received signals to
modulation types using a deep learning-based classifier. In the meantime, the
adversary makes over-the-air transmissions that are received as superimposed
with the transmitter's signals to fool the classifier at the receiver into
making errors. While this evasion attack has received growing interest
recently, the channel effects from the adversary to the receiver have been
ignored so far such that the previous attack mechanisms cannot be applied under
realistic channel effects. In this paper, we present how to launch a realistic
evasion attack by considering channels from the adversary to the receiver. Our
results show that modulation classification is vulnerable to an adversarial
attack over a wireless channel that is modeled as Rayleigh fading with path
loss and shadowing. We present various adversarial attacks with respect to
availability of information about channel, transmitter input, and classifier
architecture. First, we present two types of adversarial attacks, namely a
targeted attack (with minimum power) and non-targeted attack that aims to
change the classification to a target label or to any other label other than
the true label, respectively. Both are white-box attacks that are transmitter
input-specific and use channel information. Then we introduce an algorithm to
generate adversarial attacks using limited channel information where the
adversary only knows the channel distribution. Finally, we present a black-box
universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) attack where the adversary has limited
knowledge about both channel and transmitter input.

  During the past five years the Bayesian deep learning community has developed
increasingly accurate and efficient approximate inference procedures that allow
for Bayesian inference in deep neural networks. However, despite this
algorithmic progress and the promise of improved uncertainty quantification and
sample efficiency there are---as of early 2020---no publicized deployments of
Bayesian neural networks in industrial practice. In this work we cast doubt on
the current understanding of Bayes posteriors in popular deep neural networks:
we demonstrate through careful MCMC sampling that the posterior predictive
induced by the Bayes posterior yields systematically worse predictions compared
to simpler methods including point estimates obtained from SGD. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that predictive performance is improved significantly through the
use of a "cold posterior" that overcounts evidence. Such cold posteriors
sharply deviate from the Bayesian paradigm but are commonly used as heuristic
in Bayesian deep learning papers. We put forward several hypotheses that could
explain cold posteriors and evaluate the hypotheses through experiments. Our
work questions the goal of accurate posterior approximations in Bayesian deep
learning: If the true Bayes posterior is poor, what is the use of more accurate
approximations? Instead, we argue that it is timely to focus on understanding
the origin of the improved performance of cold posteriors.

Title: Near-Optimal Algorithms for Minimax Optimization
Authors: Tianyi Lin, Chi Jin and Michael. I. Jordan
Categories: math.OC cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 40 pages
\\
  This paper resolves a longstanding open question pertaining to the design of
near-optimal first-order algorithms for smooth and
strongly-convex-strongly-concave minimax problems. Current state-of-the-art
first-order algorithms find an approximate Nash equilibrium using
$\tilde{O}(\kappa_{\mathbf x}+\kappa_{\mathbf y})$ or
$\tilde{O}(\min\{\kappa_{\mathbf x}\sqrt{\kappa_{\mathbf y}},
\sqrt{\kappa_{\mathbf x}}\kappa_{\mathbf y}\})$ gradient evaluations, where
$\kappa_{\mathbf x}$ and $\kappa_{\mathbf y}$ are the condition numbers for the
strong-convexity and strong-concavity assumptions. A gap remains between these
results and the best existing lower bound $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\kappa_{\mathbf
x}\kappa_{\mathbf y}})$. This paper presents the first algorithm with
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa_{\mathbf x}\kappa_{\mathbf y}})$ gradient complexity,
matching the lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Our new algorithm is
designed based on an accelerated proximal point method and an accelerated
solver for minimax proximal steps. It can be easily extended to the settings of
strongly-convex-concave, convex-concave, nonconvex-strongly-concave, and
nonconvex-concave functions. This paper also presents algorithms that match or
outperform all existing methods in these settings in terms of gradient
complexity, up to logarithmic factors.

  Normalizing flows are a powerful tool for building expressive distributions
in high dimensions. So far, most of the literature has concentrated on learning
flows on Euclidean spaces. Some problems however, such as those involving
angles, are defined on spaces with more complex geometries, such as tori or
spheres. In this paper, we propose and compare expressive and numerically
stable flows on such spaces. Our flows are built recursively on the dimension
of the space, starting from flows on circles, closed intervals or spheres.

Categories: gr-qc cs.NA hep-th math.NA
Comments: 14 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Dynamical aspects of cosmological model in an extended gravity theory have
been investigated in the present work. We have adopted a simplified approach to
obtain cosmic features, which in fact requires more involved calculations. A
cosmological model is constructed using a hybrid scale factor that simulates a
cosmic transit behaviour. The deceleration parameter and energy conditions have
been obtained for the constructed model. Scalar fields have been reconstructed
from the present model in the extended gravity. Different diagnostic methods
have been applied to analyse the viability of the constructed model. The
present model almost looks like a cosmological constant for a substantial
cosmic time zone and does not show any slowing down feature in near future.

  There is a strong nexus between the network size and the computational
resources available, which may impede a neuroscience study. In the meantime,
rescaling the network while maintaining its behavior is not a trivial mission.
Additionally, modeling patterns of connections under topographic organization
presents an extra challenge: to solve the network boundaries or mingled with an
unwished behavior. This behavior, for example, could be an inset oscillation
due to the torus solution; or a blend with/of unbalanced neurons due to a lack
(or overdose) of connections. We detail the network rescaling method able to
sustain behavior statistical utilized in Romaro et al. (2018) and present a
boundary solution method based on the previous statistics recoup idea.

\\
  A vast number of multicriteria decision making methods have been developed to
deal with the problem of ranking a set of alternatives evaluated in a
multicriteria fashion. Very often, these methods assume that the evaluation
among criteria is statistically independent. However, in actual problems, the
observed data may comprise dependent criteria, which, among other problems, may
result in biased rankings. In order to deal with this issue, we propose a novel
approach whose aim is to estimate, from the observed data, a set of independent
latent criteria, which can be seen as an alternative representation of the
original decision matrix. A central element of our approach is to formulate the
decision problem as a blind source separation problem, which allows us to apply
independent component analysis techniques to estimate the latent criteria.
Moreover, we consider TOPSIS-based approaches to obtain the ranking of
alternatives from the latent criteria. Results in both synthetic and actual
data attest the relevance of the proposed approach.

Title: Interlayer link prediction in multiplex social networks: an iterative
  degree penalty algorithm
Authors: Rui Tang, Shuyu Jiang, Xingshu Chen, Haizhou Wang, Wenxian Wang, Wei

Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.SI
\\
  Online social network (OSN) applications provide different experiences; for
example, posting a short text on Twitter and sharing photographs on Instagram.
Multiple OSNs constitute a multiplex network. For privacy protection and usage
purposes, accounts belonging to the same user in different OSNs may have
different usernames, photographs, and introductions. Interlayer link prediction
in multiplex network aims at identifying whether the accounts in different OSNs
belong to the same person, which can aid in tasks including cybercriminal
behavior modeling and customer interest analysis. Many real-world OSNs exhibit
a scale-free degree distribution; thus, neighbors with different degrees may
exert different influences on the node matching degrees across different OSNs.
We developed an iterative degree penalty (IDP) algorithm for interlayer link
prediction in the multiplex network. First, we proposed a degree penalty
principle that assigns a greater weight to a common matched neighbor with fewer
connections. Second, we applied node adjacency matrix multiplication for
efficiently obtaining the matching degree of all unmatched node pairs.
Thereafter, we used the approved maximum value method to obtain the interlayer
link prediction results from the matching degree matrix. Finally, the
prediction results were inserted into the priori interlayer node pair set and
the above processes were performed iteratively until all unmatched nodes in one
layer were matched or all matching degrees of the unmatched node pairs were
equal to 0. Experiments demonstrated that our advanced IDP algorithm
significantly outperforms current network structure-based methods when the
multiplex network average degree and node overlapping rate are low.

Title: Controllability Analysis and Optimal Control of Mixed Traffic Flow with
  Human-driven and Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Jiawei Wang, Yang Zheng, Qing Xu, Jianqiang Wang, Keqiang Li
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 14 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have a great potential to improve
traffic efficiency in mixed traffic systems, which has been demonstrated by
multiple numerical simulations and field experiments. However, some fundamental
properties of mixed traffic flow, including controllability and
stabilizability, have not been well understood. This paper analyzes the
controllability of mixed traffic systems and designs a system-level optimal
control strategy. Using the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) criterion, we prove
for the first time that a ring-road mixed traffic system with one CAV and
multiple heterogeneous human-driven vehicles is not completely controllable,
but is stabilizable under a very mild condition. Then, we formulate the design
of a system-level control strategy for the CAV as a structured optimal control
problem, where the CAV's communication ability is explicitly considered.
Finally, we derive an upper bound for reachable traffic velocity via
controlling the CAV. Extensive numerical experiments verify the effectiveness
of our analytical results and the proposed control strategy. Our results
validate the possibility of utilizing CAVs as mobile actuators to smooth
traffic flow actively.

Title: Acyclicity in finite groups and groupoids
Authors: Martin Otto
Categories: math.CO cs.DM math.GR
Comments: An error in (v1) invalidated a more direct reduction of the
  groupoidal case to the group case. The extension of the argument in the
  present version aims to repair that. In light of a serious mistake in the
  technical precursors of [arXiv:1709.00031], this new route to the
  construction of N-acyclic groupoids is meant to safeguard their applications
  discussed there. See acknowledgements
