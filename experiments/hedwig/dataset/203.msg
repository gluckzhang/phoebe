Title: The Efficiency of Human Cognition Reflects Planned Information
  Processing
Authors: Mark K. Ho, David Abel, Jonathan D. Cohen, Michael L. Littman, Thomas

  Planning is useful. It lets people take actions that have desirable long-term
consequences. But, planning is hard. It requires thinking about consequences,
which consumes limited computational and cognitive resources. Thus, people
should plan their actions, but they should also be smart about how they deploy
resources used for planning their actions. Put another way, people should also
"plan their plans". Here, we formulate this aspect of planning as a
meta-reasoning problem and formalize it in terms of a recursive Bellman
objective that incorporates both task rewards and information-theoretic
planning costs. Our account makes quantitative predictions about how people
should plan and meta-plan as a function of the overall structure of a task,
which we test in two experiments with human participants. We find that people's
reaction times reflect a planned use of information processing, consistent with
our account. This formulation of planning to plan provides new insight into the
function of hierarchical planning, state abstraction, and cognitive control in
both humans and machines.

Title: Extended Markov Games to Learn Multiple Tasks in Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Borja G. Le\'on and Francesco Belardinelli
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO cs.MA
Comments: Long version of the correspondent ECAI 2020 paper
\\
  The combination of Formal Methods with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
recently attracted interest as a way for single-agent RL to learn multiple-task
specifications. In this paper we extend this convergence to multi-agent
settings and formally define Extended Markov Games as a general mathematical
model that allows multiple RL agents to concurrently learn various
non-Markovian specifications. To introduce this new model we provide formal
definitions and proofs as well as empirical tests of RL algorithms running on
this framework. Specifically, we use our model to train two different
logic-based multi-agent RL algorithms to solve diverse settings of
non-Markovian co-safe LTL specifications.

Title: Bayesian Learning of Causal Relationships for System Reliability
Authors: Xuewen Yu, Jim Q. Smith and Linda Nichols
Categories: cs.AI math.ST stat.TH
Comments: 8 pages, 4 Figures
\\
  Causal theory is now widely developed with many applications to medicine and
public health. However within the discipline of reliability, although causation
is a key concept in this field, there has been much less theoretical attention.
In this paper, we will demonstrate how some aspects of established causal
methodology can be translated via trees, and more specifically chain event
graphs, into domain of reliability theory to help the probability modeling of
failures. We further show how various domain specific concepts of causality
particular to reliability can be imported into more generic causal algebras and
so demonstrate how these disciplines can inform each other. This paper is
informed by a detailed analysis of maintenance records associated with a large
electrical distribution company. Causal hypotheses embedded within these
natural language texts are extracted and analyzed using the new graphical
framework we introduced here.

Title: Analyzing Differentiable Fuzzy Logic Operators
Authors: Emile van Krieken, Erman Acar, Frank van Harmelen
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO
Comments: 45 pages, 19 figures
\\
  In recent years there has been a push to integrate symbolic AI and deep
learning, as it is argued that the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches
are complementary. One such trend in the literature are weakly supervised
learning techniques that use operators from fuzzy logics. They employ prior
background knowledge described in logic to benefit the training of a neural
network from unlabeled and noisy data. By interpreting logical symbols using
neural networks, this background knowledge can be added to regular loss
functions used in deep learning to integrate reasoning and learning. In this
paper, we analyze how a large collection of logical operators from the fuzzy
logic literature behave in a differentiable setting. We find large differences
between the formal properties of these operators that are of crucial importance
in a differentiable learning setting. We show that many of these operators,
including some of the best known, are highly unsuitable for use in a
differentiable learning setting. A further finding concerns the treatment of
implication in these fuzzy logics, with a strong imbalance between gradients
driven by the antecedent and the consequent of the implication. Finally, we
empirically show that it is possible to use Differentiable Fuzzy Logics for
semi-supervised learning. However, to achieve the most significant performance
improvement over a supervised baseline, we have to resort to non-standard
combinations of logical operators which perform well in learning, but which no
longer satisfy the usual logical laws. We end with a discussion on extensions
to large-scale problems.

Title: RL agents Implicitly Learning Human Preferences
Authors: Nevan Wichers
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG
\\
  In the real world, RL agents should be rewarded for fulfilling human
preferences. We show that RL agents implicitly learn the preferences of humans
in their environment. Training a classifier to predict if a simulated human's
preferences are fulfilled based on the activations of a RL agent's neural
network gets .93 AUC. Training a classifier on the raw environment state gets
only .8 AUC. Training the classifier off of the RL agent's activations also
does much better than training off of activations from an autoencoder. The
human preference classifier can be used as the reward function of an RL agent
to make RL agent more beneficial for humans.

  Recent research in artificial intelligence and machine learning has largely

Title: On the Edge Crossings of the Greedy Spanner
Authors: David Eppstein, Hadi Khodabandeh
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  $t$-spanners are used to approximate the pairwise distances between a set of
points in a metric space. They have only a few edges compared to the total
number of pairs and they provide a $t$-approximation on the distance of any two
arbitrary points. There are many ways to construct such graphs and one of the
most efficient ones, in terms of weight and the number of edges of the
resulting graph, is the greedy spanner. In this paper, we study the edge
crossings of the greedy spanner for points in the Euclidean plane. We prove a
constant upper bound for the number of intersections with larger edges that
only depends on the stretch factor of the spanner, $t$, and we show there can
be more than a bounded number of intersections with smaller edges. Our results
imply that greedy spanners for points in the plane have separators of size
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt n)$, that their planarizations have linear size, and that a
separator hierarchy for these graphs can be constructed from their
planarizations in linear time.

Title: Kinetic Geodesic Voronoi Diagrams in a Simple Polygon
Authors: Matias Korman, Andr\'e van Renssen, Marcel Roeloffzen, Frank Staals
Categories: cs.CG
\\
  We study the geodesic Voronoi diagram of a set $S$ of $n$ linearly moving
sites inside a static simple polygon $P$ with $m$ vertices. We identify all
events where the structure of the Voronoi diagram changes, bound the number of
such events, and then develop a kinetic data structure (KDS) that maintains the
geodesic Voronoi diagram as the sites move. To this end, we first analyze how
often a single bisector, defined by two sites, or a single Voronoi center,
defined by three sites, can change. For both these structures we prove that the
number of such changes is at most $O(m^3)$, and that this is tight in the worst
case. Moreover, we develop compact, responsive, local, and efficient kinetic
data structures for both structures. Our data structures use linear space and
process a worst-case optimal number of events. Our bisector KDS handles each
event in $O(\log m)$ time, and our Voronoi center handles each event in
$O(\log^2 m)$ time. Both structures can be extended to efficiently support
updating the movement of the sites as well. Using these data structures as
building blocks we obtain a compact KDS for maintaining the full geodesic
Voronoi diagram.

Title: HULK: An Energy Efficiency Benchmark Platform for Responsible Natural
  Language Processing
Authors: Xiyou Zhou, Zhiyu Chen, Xiaoyong Jin, William Yang Wang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Computation-intensive pretrained models have been taking the lead of many
natural language processing benchmarks such as GLUE. However, energy efficiency
in the process of model training and inference becomes a critical bottleneck.
We introduce HULK, a multi-task energy efficiency benchmarking platform for
responsible natural language processing. With HULK, we compare pretrained
models' energy efficiency from the perspectives of time and cost. Baseline
benchmarking results are provided for further analysis. The fine-tuning
efficiency of different pretrained models can differ a lot among different
tasks and fewer parameter number does not necessarily imply better efficiency.
We analyzed such phenomenon and demonstrate the method of comparing the
multi-task efficiency of pretrained models. Our platform is available at

Title: Transformers as Soft Reasoners over Language
Authors: Peter Clark, Oyvind Tafjord, Kyle Richardson
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  AI has long pursued the goal of having systems reason over *explicitly
provided* knowledge, but building suitable representations has proved
challenging. Here we explore whether transformers can similarly learn to reason
(or emulate reasoning), but using rules expressed in language, thus bypassing a
formal representation. We provide the first demonstration that this is
possible, and characterize the extent of this capability. To do this, we use a
collection of synthetic datasets that test increasing levels of reasoning
complexity (number of rules, presence of negation, and depth of chaining). We
find transformers appear to learn rule-based reasoning with high (99%) accuracy
on these datasets, and in a way that generalizes to test data requiring
substantially deeper chaining than in the training data (95%+ scores). We also
demonstrate that the models transfer well to two hand-authored rulebases, and
to rulebases paraphrased into more natural language. These findings are
significant as it suggests a new role for transformers, namely as a limited
"soft theorem prover" operating over explicit theories in language. This in
turn suggests new possibilities for explainability, correctability, and
counterfactual reasoning in question-answering. All datasets and a live demo
are available at http://rule-reasoning.apps.allenai.org/

Title: Understanding patient complaint characteristics using contextual
  clinical BERT embeddings
Authors: Budhaditya Saha, Sanal Lisboa, Shameek Ghosh
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: This paper has been communicated to 42nd IEEE Annual Conference of
  Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, Montreal, Canada. It is 5 pages
  long. It has 2 figures
ACM-class: I.2.7
\\
  In clinical conversational applications, extracted entities tend to capture
the main subject of a patient's complaint, namely symptoms or diseases.
However, they mostly fail to recognize the characterizations of a complaint
such as the time, the onset, and the severity. For example, if the input is "I
have a headache and it is extreme", state-of-the-art models only recognize the
main symptom entity - headache, but ignore the severity factor of "extreme",
that characterizes headache. In this paper, we design a two-stage approach to
detect the characterizations of entities like symptoms presented by general
users in contexts where they would describe their symptoms to a clinician. We
use Word2Vec and BERT to encode clinical text given by the patients. We
transform the output and re-frame the task as multi-label classification
problem. Finally, we combine the processed encodings with the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm to classify the characterizations of the
main entity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 40-50%
improvement on the accuracy over the state-of-the-art models.

Title: Zero-Resource Cross-Domain Named Entity Recognition
Authors: Zihan Liu, Genta Indra Winata, Pascale Fung
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Existing models for cross-domain named entity recognition (NER) rely on
numerous unlabeled corpus or labeled NER training data in target domains.
However, collecting data for low-resource target domains is not only expensive
but also time-consuming. Hence, we propose a cross-domain NER model that does
not use any external resources. We first introduce Multi-Task Learning (MTL) by
adding a new objective function to detect whether tokens are named entities or
not. We then introduce a framework called Mixture of Entity Experts (MoEE) to
improve the robustness for zero-resource domain adaptation. Finally,
experimental results show that our model outperforms strong unsupervised
cross-domain sequence labeling models, and the performance of our model is
close to that of the state-of-the-art model which leverages extensive
resources.

Title: A Data Efficient End-To-End Spoken Language Understanding Architecture
Authors: Marco Dinarelli, Nikita Kapoor, Bassam Jabaian, and Laurent Besacier
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: Accepted to ICASSP 2020
\\
  End-to-end architectures have been recently proposed for spoken language
understanding (SLU) and semantic parsing. Based on a large amount of data,
those models learn jointly acoustic and linguistic-sequential features. Such
architectures give very good results in the context of domain, intent and slot
detection, their application in a more complex semantic chunking and tagging
task is less easy. For that, in many cases, models are combined with an
external language model to enhance their performance.
  In this paper we introduce a data efficient system which is trained
end-to-end, with no additional, pre-trained external module. One key feature of
our approach is an incremental training procedure where acoustic, language and
semantic models are trained sequentially one after the other. The proposed
model has a reasonable size and achieves competitive results with respect to
state-of-the-art while using a small training dataset. In particular, we reach
24.02% Concept Error Rate (CER) on MEDIA/test while training on MEDIA/train
without any additional data.

Title: Integrating Discrete and Neural Features via Mixed-feature

\\
  There has been a long recognition that discrete features (n-gram features)
and neural network based features have complementary strengths for language
models (LMs). Improved performance can be obtained by model interpolation,
which is, however, a suboptimal two-step integration of discrete and neural
features. The trans-dimensional random field (TRF) framework has the potential
advantage of being able to flexibly integrate a richer set of features.
However, either discrete or neural features are used alone in previous TRF LMs.
This paper develops a mixed-feature TRF LM and demonstrates its advantage in
integrating discrete and neural features. Various LMs are trained over PTB and
Google one-billion-word datasets, and evaluated in N-best list rescoring
experiments for speech recognition. Among all single LMs (i.e. without model
interpolation), the mixed-feature TRF LMs perform the best, improving over both
discrete TRF LMs and neural TRF LMs alone, and also being significantly better
than LSTM LMs. Compared to interpolating two separately trained models with
discrete and neural features respectively, the performance of mixed-feature TRF
LMs matches the best interpolated model, and with simplified one-step training
process and reduced training time.

\\
  This work investigates the embeddings for representing dialog history in
spoken language understanding (SLU) systems. We focus on the scenario when the
semantic information is extracted directly from the speech signal by means of a
single end-to-end neural network model. We proposed to integrate dialogue
history into an end-to-end signal-to-concept SLU system. The dialog history is
represented in the form of dialog history embedding vectors (so-called
h-vectors) and is provided as an additional information to end-to-end SLU
models in order to improve the system performance. Three following types of
h-vectors are proposed and experimentally evaluated in this paper: (1)
supervised-all embeddings predicting bag-of-concepts expected in the answer of
the user from the last dialog system response; (2) supervised-freq embeddings
focusing on predicting only a selected set of semantic concept (corresponding
to the most frequent errors in our experiments); and (3) unsupervised
embeddings. Experiments on the MEDIA corpus for the semantic slot filling task
demonstrate that the proposed h-vectors improve the model performance.

Comments: Also published in ICLR2020

  We describe a novel way of representing a symbolic knowledge base (KB) called
a sparse-matrix reified KB. This representation enables neural modules that are
fully differentiable, faithful to the original semantics of the KB, expressive
enough to model multi-hop inferences, and scalable enough to use with
realistically large KBs. The sparse-matrix reified KB can be distributed across
multiple GPUs, can scale to tens of millions of entities and facts, and is
orders of magnitude faster than naive sparse-matrix implementations. The
reified KB enables very simple end-to-end architectures to obtain competitive
performance on several benchmarks representing two families of tasks: KB
completion, and learning semantic parsers from denotations.

  Transformer has been widely used thanks to its ability to capture sequence
information in an efficient way. However, recent developments, such as BERT and
GPT-2, deliver only heavy architectures with a focus on effectiveness. In this
paper, we explore three carefully-designed light Transformer architectures to
figure out whether the Transformer with less computations could produce
competitive results. Experimental results on language model benchmark datasets
hint that such trade-off is promising, and the light Transformer reduces 70%
parameters at best, while obtains competitive perplexity compared to standard
Transformer. The source code is publicly available.

through which cyber attacks can be launched. In this paper, we first design an

Then, we compare the expected output found via the identifier with the real one
coming through the feedback link. Any difference greater than a threshold is
deemed to be an anomaly. To compensate, once the IDS flags a change in the
loop, we restart the system identification to find the new transfer function.
With the estimation of the new transfer function at hand, a new controller is
designed to keep the system stable. To test the idea, we took a DC motor as the
plant and employed ARX identifier. MATLAB Simulink environment was used to test
the proposed intrusion detection and compensation framework. We applied a set
of deception attacks to the forward channel in our experiments. The obtained
results prove that our detection strategy works well and timely reacts to
anomalies. Moreover, they show that the compensation strategy is also effective
and keeps the system stable under such attacks.

  We present a privacy system that leverages differential privacy to protect
LinkedIn members' data while also providing audience engagement insights to
enable marketing analytics related applications. We detail the differentially
private algorithms and other privacy safeguards used to provide results that
can be used with existing real-time data analytics platforms, specifically with
the open sourced Pinot system. Our privacy system provides user-level privacy

Title: MAGNETO: Fingerprinting USB Flash Drives via Unintentional Magnetic
  Emissions
Authors: Omar Adel Ibrahim, Savio Sciancalepore, Gabriele Oligeri, Roberto Di
  Pietro
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Universal Serial Bus (USB) Flash Drives are nowadays one of the most
convenient and diffused means to transfer files, especially when no Internet
connection is available. However, USB flash drives are also one of the most
common attack vectors used to gain unauthorized access to host devices. For
instance, it is possible to tamper with or replace a USB drive so that when the
USB key is connected, it would install passwords stealing tools, root-kit
software, and other disrupting malware. In such a way, an attacker can steal
sensitive information via the USB-connected devices, as well as inject any kind
of malicious software into the host.
  To face the above-cited raising threats, we propose MAGNETO, an efficient,
non-interactive, and privacy-preserving framework to verify the authenticity of
a USB flash drive, rooted in the analysis of its unintentional magnetic
emissions. We show that the magnetic emissions radiated during boot operations
on a specific host are unique for each device, and sufficient to uniquely
fingerprint either the brand and the model of the USB flash drive, or the
specific USB device, depending on the used equipment. Our investigation on 23
different USB flash drives, including the top brands purchased on Amazon in
mid-2019, reveals a minimum classification accuracy of 97.5% and zero false
positives, accompanied by a negligible time and computational overhead.
Overall, MAGNETO proves that unintentional magnetic emissions can be considered
as a viable and reliable mean to fingerprint read-only USB flash drives.

Title: An LSTM-Based Autonomous Driving Model Using Waymo Open Dataset
Authors: Zhicheng Li, Zhihao Gu, Xuan Di, Rongye Shi
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO
\\
  The Waymo Open Dataset has been released recently, providing a platform to
crowdsource some fundamental challenges for automated vehicles (AVs), such as
3D detection and tracking. While the dataset provides a large amount of
high-quality and multi-source driving information, people in academia are more
interested in the underlying driving policy programmed in Waymo self-driving
cars, which is inaccessible due to AV manufacturers' proprietary protection.
Accordingly, academic researchers have to make various assumptions to implement
AV components in their models or simulations, which may not represent the
realistic interactions in real-world traffic. Thus, this paper introduces an
approach to learn an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model for imitating
the behavior of Waymo's self-driving model. The proposed model has been
evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The experimental results show
that our model outperforms several baseline models in driving action
prediction. Also, a visualization tool is presented for verifying the
performance of the model.

Title: Liver Segmentation in Abdominal CT Images via Auto-Context Neural
  Network and Self-Supervised Contour Attention
Authors: Minyoung Chung, Jingyu Lee, Jeongjin Lee, and Yeong-Gil Shin
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 10 pages, 8 figures
MSC-class: 68U10
\\
  Accurate image segmentation of the liver is a challenging problem owing to
its large shape variability and unclear boundaries. Although the applications
of fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown groundbreaking
results, limited studies have focused on the performance of generalization. In
this study, we introduce a CNN for liver segmentation on abdominal computed
tomography (CT) images that shows high generalization performance and accuracy.
To improve the generalization performance, we initially propose an auto-context
algorithm in a single CNN. The proposed auto-context neural network exploits an
effective high-level residual estimation to obtain the shape prior. Identical
dual paths are effectively trained to represent mutual complementary features
for an accurate posterior analysis of a liver. Further, we extend our network
by employing a self-supervised contour scheme. We trained sparse contour
features by penalizing the ground-truth contour to focus more contour
attentions on the failures. The experimental results show that the proposed
network results in better accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art
networks by reducing 10.31% of the Hausdorff distance. We used 180 abdominal CT
images for training and validation. Two-fold cross-validation is presented for
a comparison with the state-of-the-art neural networks. Novel multiple N-fold
cross-validations are conducted to verify the performance of generalization.
The proposed network showed the best generalization performance among the
networks. Additionally, we present a series of ablation experiments that
comprehensively support the importance of the underlying concepts.

Title: A Survey on 3D Skeleton-Based Action Recognition Using Learning Method
Authors: Bin Ren, Mengyuan Liu, Runwei Ding, Hong Liu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures
\\
  3D skeleton-based action recognition, owing to the latent advantages of
skeleton, has been an active topic in computer vision. As a consequence, there
are lots of impressive works including conventional handcraft feature based and
learned feature based have been done over the years. However, previous surveys
about action recognition mostly focus on the video or RGB data dominated
methods, and the scanty existing reviews related to skeleton data mainly
indicate the representation of skeleton data or performance of some classic
techniques on a certain dataset. Besides, though deep learning methods has been
applied to this field for years, there is no related reserach concern about an
introduction or review from the perspective of deep learning architectures. To
break those limitations, this survey firstly highlight the necessity of action
recognition and the significance of 3D-skeleton data. Then a comprehensive
introduction about Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)-based, Convolutional Neural
Network(CNN)-based and Graph Convolutional Network(GCN)-based main stream
action recognition techniques are illustrated in a data-driven manner. Finally,
we give a brief talk about the biggest 3D skeleton dataset NTU-RGB+D and its
new edition called NTU-RGB+D 120, accompanied with several existing top rank
algorithms within those two datasets. To our best knowledge, this is the first
research which give an overall discussion over deep learning-based action
recognitin using 3D skeleton data.

Title: End-to-end Learning of Object Motion Estimation from Retinal Events for
  Event-based Object Tracking
Authors: Haosheng Chen, David Suter, Qiangqiang Wu, Hanzi Wang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Event cameras, which are asynchronous bio-inspired vision sensors, have shown
great potential in computer vision and artificial intelligence. However, the
application of event cameras to object-level motion estimation or tracking is
still in its infancy. The main idea behind this work is to propose a novel deep
neural network to learn and regress a parametric object-level motion/transform
model for event-based object tracking. To achieve this goal, we propose a
synchronous Time-Surface with Linear Time Decay (TSLTD) representation, which
effectively encodes the spatio-temporal information of asynchronous retinal
events into TSLTD frames with clear motion patterns. We feed the sequence of
TSLTD frames to a novel Retinal Motion Regression Network (RMRNet) to perform
an end-to-end 5-DoF object motion regression. Our method is compared with
state-of-the-art object tracking methods, that are based on conventional
cameras or event cameras. The experimental results show the superiority of our
method in handling various challenging environments such as fast motion and low
illumination conditions.

Title: Counting dense objects in remote sensing images
Authors: Guangshuai Gao, Qingjie Liu, Yunhong Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Estimating accurate number of interested objects from a given image is a
challenging yet important task. Significant efforts have been made to address
this problem and achieve great progress, yet counting number of ground objects
from remote sensing images is barely studied. In this paper, we are interested
in counting dense objects from remote sensing images. Compared with object
counting in natural scene, this task is challenging in following factors: large
scale variation, complex cluttered background and orientation arbitrariness.
More importantly, the scarcity of data severely limits the development of
research in this field. To address these issues, we first construct a
large-scale object counting dataset based on remote sensing images, which
contains four kinds of objects: buildings, crowded ships in harbor,
large-vehicles and small-vehicles in parking lot. We then benchmark the dataset
by designing a novel neural network which can generate density map of an input
image. The proposed network consists of three parts namely convolution block
attention module (CBAM), scale pyramid module (SPM) and deformable convolution
module (DCM). Experiments on the proposed dataset and comparisons with state of
the art methods demonstrate the challenging of the proposed dataset, and
superiority and effectiveness of our method.

Title: Multi-Level Feature Fusion Mechanism for Single Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Jiawen Lyn
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Convolution neural network (CNN) has been widely used in Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) so that SISR has been a great success recently. As the
network deepens, the learning ability of network becomes more and more
powerful. However, most SISR methods based on CNN do not make full use of
hierarchical feature and the learning ability of network. These features cannot
be extracted directly by subsequent layers, so the previous layer hierarchical
information has little impact on the output and performance of subsequent
layers relatively poor. To solve above problem, a novel Multi-Level Feature
Fusion network (MLRN) is proposed, which can take full use of global
intermediate features. We also introduce Feature Skip Fusion Block (FSFblock)
as basic module. Each block can be extracted directly to the raw multiscale
feature and fusion multi-level feature, then learn feature spatial correlation.
The correlation among the features of the holistic approach leads to a
continuous global memory of information mechanism. Extensive experiments on
public datasets show that the method proposed by MLRN can be implemented, which
is favorable performance for the most advanced methods.

\\
  Trajectory prediction in urban mixed-traffic zones is critical for many AI
systems, such as traffic management, social robots and autonomous
driving.However, there are many challenges to predict the trajectories of
heterogeneous road agents (pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles) at a
microscopic-level. For example, an agent might be able to choose multiple
plausible paths in complex interactions with other agents in varying
environments. To this end, we propose an approach named Context Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CCVAE) that encodes both past and future scene
context, interaction context and motion information to capture the variations
of the future trajectories using a set of stochastic latent variables. We
predict multi-path trajectories conditioned on past information of the target
agent by sampling the latent variable multiple times. Through experiments on
several datasets of varying scenes, our method outperforms the recent
state-of-the-art methods for mixed traffic trajectory prediction by a large
margin and more robust in a very challenging environment.

\\
  Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) captures the temporal dynamics
of neural activity as a function of spatial location in the brain. Thus, fMRI
scans are represented as 4-Dimensional (3-space + 1-time) tensors. And it is
widely believed that the spatio-temporal patterns in fMRI manifests as
behaviour and clinical symptoms. Because of the high dimensionality ($\sim$ 1
Million) of fMRI, and the added constraints of limited cardinality of data
sets, extracting such patterns are challenging. A standard approach to overcome
these hurdles is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by either summarizing
activation over time or space at the expense of possible loss of useful
information. Here, we introduce an end-to-end algorithm capable of extracting
spatiotemporal features from the full 4-D data using 3-D CNNs and 3-D
Convolutional LSTMs. We evaluate our proposed model on the publicly available
ABIDE dataset to demonstrate the capability of our model to classify Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from resting-state fMRI data. Our results show that the
proposed model achieves state of the art results on single sites with F1-scores
of 0.78 and 0.7 on NYU and UM sites, respectively.

\\
  Particle competition and cooperation (PCC) is a graph-based semi-supervised
learning approach. When PCC is applied to interactive image segmentation tasks,
pixels are converted into network nodes, and each node is connected to its
k-nearest neighbors, according to the distance between a set of features
extracted from the image. Building a proper network to feed PCC is crucial to
achieve good segmentation results. However, some features may be more important
than others to identify the segments, depending on the characteristics of the
image to be segmented. In this paper, an index to evaluate candidate networks
is proposed. Thus, building the network becomes a problem of optimizing some
feature weights based on the proposed index. Computer simulations are performed
on some real-world images from the Microsoft GrabCut database, and the
segmentation results related in this paper show the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Title: Layer-wise Pruning and Auto-tuning of Layer-wise Learning Rates in
  Fine-tuning of Deep Networks
Authors: Youngmin Ro, Jin Young Choi
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Existing fine-tuning methods use a single learning rate over all layers. In
this paper, first, we discuss that trends of layer-wise weight variations by
fine-tuning using a single learning rate do not match the well-known notion
that lower-level layers extract general features and higher-level layers
extract specific features. Based on our discussion, we propose an algorithm
that improves fine-tuning performance and reduces network complexity through
layer-wise pruning and auto-tuning of layer-wise learning rates. Through
in-depth experiments on image retrieval (CUB-200-2011, Stanford online
products, and Inshop) and fine-grained classification (Stanford cars, Aircraft)
datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified.

\\
  The massive amounts of digitized historical documents acquired over the last
decades naturally lend themselves to automatic processing and exploration.
Research work seeking to automatically process facsimiles and extract
information thereby are multiplying with, as a first essential step, document
layout analysis. If the identification and categorization of segments of
interest in document images have seen significant progress over the last years
thanks to deep learning techniques, many challenges remain with, among others,
the use of finer-grained segmentation typologies and the consideration of
complex, heterogeneous documents such as historical newspapers. Besides, most
approaches consider visual features only, ignoring textual signal. In this
context, we introduce a multimodal approach for the semantic segmentation of
historical newspapers that combines visual and textual features. Based on a
series of experiments on diachronic Swiss and Luxembourgish newspapers, we
investigate, among others, the predictive power of visual and textual features
and their capacity to generalize across time and sources. Results show
consistent improvement of multimodal models in comparison to a strong visual
baseline, as well as better robustness to high material variance.

  Recently, the progress of learning-by-synthesis has proposed a training model
for synthetic images, which can effectively reduce the cost of human and
material resources. However, due to the different distribution of synthetic
images compared to real images, the desired performance cannot be achieved.
Real images consist of multiple forms of light orientation, while synthetic
images consist of a uniform light orientation. These features are considered to
be characteristic of outdoor and indoor scenes, respectively. To solve this
problem, the previous method learned a model to improve the realism of the
synthetic image. Different from the previous methods, this paper try to purify
real image by extracting discriminative and robust features to convert outdoor
real images to indoor synthetic images. In this paper, we first introduce the
segmentation masks to construct RGB-mask pairs as inputs, then we design a
attention-guided style transfer network to learn style features separately from
the attention and bkgd(background) region , learn content features from full
and attention region. Moreover, we propose a novel region-level task-guided
loss to restrain the features learnt from style and content. Experiments were
performed using mixed studies (qualitative and quantitative) methods to
demonstrate the possibility of purifying real images in complex directions. We
evaluate the proposed method on three public datasets, including LPW, COCO and
MPIIGaze. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is
effective and achieves the state-of-the-art results.

Categories: cs.DB
\\
  This paper studies the effectiveness of pushing parts of DBMS analytics
queries into the Simple Storage Service (S3) engine of Amazon Web Services
(AWS), using a recently released capability called S3 Select. We show that some
DBMS primitives (filter, projection, aggregation) can always be
cost-effectively moved into S3. Other more complex operations (join, top-K,
group-by) require reimplementation to take advantage of S3 Select and are often
candidates for pushdown. We demonstrate these capabilities through
experimentation using a new DBMS that we developed, PushdownDB. Experimentation
with a collection of queries including TPC-H queries shows that PushdownDB is
on average 30% cheaper and 6.7X faster than a baseline that does not use S3
Select.

Title: Online Process Monitoring Using Incremental State-Space Expansion: An
  Exact Algorithm
Authors: Daniel Schuster and Sebastiaan van Zelst
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  The execution of (business) processes generates valuable traces of event data
in the information systems employed within companies. Recently, approaches for
monitoring the correctness of the execution of running processes have been
developed in the area of process mining, i.e., online conformance checking. The
advantages of monitoring a process' conformity during its execution are clear,
i.e., deviations are detected as soon as they occur and countermeasures can
immediately be initiated to reduce the possible negative effects caused by
process deviations. Existing work in online conformance checking only allows
for obtaining approximations of non-conformity, e.g., overestimating the actual
severity of the deviation. In this paper, we present an exact, parameter-free,
online conformance checking algorithm that computes conformance checking
results on the fly. Our algorithm exploits the fact that the conformance
checking problem can be reduced to a shortest path problem, by incrementally
expanding the search space and reusing previously computed intermediate
results. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms comparable
state-of-the-art approximation algorithms.

Title: Cleaning Denial Constraint Violations through Relaxation
Authors: Stella Giannakopoulou, Manos Karpathiotakis, Anastasia Ailamaki
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  Data cleaning is a time-consuming process which depends on the data analysis
that users perform. Existing solutions treat data cleaning as a separate,
offline process, that takes place before analysis starts. Applying data
cleaning before analysis assumes a priori knowledge of the inconsistencies and
the query workload, thereby requiring effort on understanding and cleaning data
unnecessary for the analysis. This paper proposes an approach that performs
probabilistic repairing of denial constraint violations on-demand, driven by
the exploratory analysis that users perform. It introduces Daisy, a system that
integrates data cleaning seamlessly into the analysis by relaxing query
results. Daisy executes analytical query workloads over dirty data by weaving
cleaning operators into the query plan. Our evaluation shows that Daisy adapts
to the workload, and outperforms traditional offline cleaning on both synthetic
and real-world workloads.

Title: Hoplite: Efficient Collective Communication for Task-Based Distributed
  Systems

\\
  Collective communication systems such as MPI offer high performance group
communication primitives at the cost of application flexibility. Today, an
increasing number of distributed applications (e.g, reinforcement learning)
require flexibility in expressing dynamic and asynchronous communication
patterns. To accommodate these applications, task-based distributed computing
frameworks (e.g., Ray, Dask, Hydro) have become popular as they allow
applications to dynamically specify communication by invoking tasks, or
functions, at runtime. This design makes efficient collective communication
challenging because (1) the group of communicating processes is chosen at
runtime, and (2) processes may not all be ready at the same time.
  We design and implement Hoplite, a communication layer for task-based
distributed systems that achieves high performance collective communication
without compromising application flexibility. The key idea of Hoplite is to use
distributed protocols to compute a data transfer schedule on the fly. This
enables the same optimizations used in traditional collective communication,
but for applications that specify the communication incrementally. We show that
Hoplite can achieve similar performance compared with a traditional collective
communication library, MPICH. We port a popular distributed computing
framework, Ray, on atop of Hoplite. We show that Hoplite can speed up
asynchronous parameter server and distributed reinforcement learning workloads
that are difficult to execute efficiently with traditional collective
communication by up to 8.1x and 3.9x, respectively.

Title: DSCEP: An Infrastructure for Distributed Semantic Complex Event
  Processing
Authors: Vitor Pinheiro de Almeida and Sukanya Bhowmik and Markus Endler and
  Kurt Rothermel
Categories: cs.DC cs.DB
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  Today most applications continuously produce information under the form of
streams, due to the advent of the means of collecting data. Sensors and social
networks collect an immense variety and volume of data, from different
real-life situations and at a considerable velocity. Increasingly, applications
require processing of heterogeneous data streams from different sources
together with large background knowledge. To use only the information on the
data stream is not enough for many use cases. Semantic Complex Event Processing
(CEP) systems have evolved from the classical rule-based CEP systems, by
integrating high-level knowledge representation and RDF stream processing using
both the data stream and background static knowledge. Additionally, CEP
approaches lack the capability to semantically interpret and analyze data,
which Semantic CEP (SCEP) attempts to address. SCEP has several limitations;
one of them is related to their high processing time. This paper provides a
conceptual model and an implementation of an infrastructure for distributed
SCEP, where each SCEP operator can process part of the data and send it to
other SCEP operators in order to achieves some answer. We show that by
splitting the RDF stream processing and the background knowledge using the
concept of SCEP operators, it's possible to considerably reduce processing
time.

Title: eSPICE: Probabilistic Load Shedding from Input Event Streams in Complex
  Event Processing
Authors: Ahmad Slo, Sukanya Bhowmik, Kurt Rothermel
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: 13 pages
DOI: 10.1145/3361525.3361548
\\
  Complex event processing systems process the input event streams on-the-fly.
Since input event rate could overshoot the system's capabilities and results in
violating a defined latency bound, load shedding is used to drop a portion of
the input event streams. The crucial question here is how many and which events
to drop so the defined latency bound is maintained and the degradation in the
quality of results is minimized. In stream processing domain, different load
shedding strategies have been proposed but they mainly depend on the importance
of individual tuples (events). However, as complex event processing systems
perform pattern detection, the importance of events is also influenced by other
events in the same pattern. In this paper, we propose a load shedding framework
called eSPICE for complex event processing systems. eSPICE depends on building
a probabilistic model that learns about the importance of events in a window.
The position of an event in a window and its type are used as features to build
the model. Further, we provide algorithms to decide when to start dropping
events and how many events to drop. Moreover, we extensively evaluate the
performance of eSPICE on two real-world datasets.

Title: Algebraic Structure of Blockchains: A Group-Theoretical Primer
Authors: Dongfang Zhao
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Although recent advances of blockchain systems, notably in the form of
cryptocurrency, have drawn tremendous interests from both researchers and
practitioners, limited studies existed toward the theoretical foundation of
blockchains. This paper presents the first study on the algebraic structure of
blockchains with an emphasis on the internal properties under algebraic groups.
We axiomatically construct a blockchain group and derive some interesting
properties that can be potentially taken into the design space and parametric
analysis of real-world blockchain systems.

Title: High-Performance High-Order Stencil Computation on FPGAs Using OpenCL
Authors: Hamid Reza Zohouri, Artur Podobas, Satoshi Matsuoka
Categories: cs.DC
Comments: Published at RAW'18: 25th Anniversary of Reconfigurable Architectures
  Workshop held in conjunction with IPDPS'18
DOI: 10.1109/IPDPSW.2018.00027
\\
  In this paper we evaluate the performance of FPGAs for high-order stencil
computation using High-Level Synthesis. We show that despite the higher
computation intensity and on-chip memory requirement of such stencils compared
to first-order ones, our design technique with combined spatial and temporal
blocking remains effective. This allows us to reach similar, or even higher,
compute performance compared to first-order stencils. We use an OpenCL-based
design that, apart from parameterizing performance knobs, also parameterizes
the stencil radius. Furthermore, we show that our performance model exhibits
the same accuracy as first-order stencils in predicting the performance of
high-order ones. On an Intel Arria 10 GX 1150 device, for 2D and 3D star-shaped
stencils, we achieve over 700 and 270 GFLOP/s of compute performance,
respectively, up to a stencil radius of four. These results outperform the
state-of-the-art YASK framework on a modern Xeon for 2D and 3D stencils, and
outperform a modern Xeon Phi for 2D stencils, while achieving competitive
performance in 3D. Furthermore, our FPGA design achieves better power
efficiency in almost all cases.

Title: A Breezing Proof of the KMW Bound
Authors: Corinna Coupette and Christoph Lenzen
Categories: cs.DC cs.CC cs.DM cs.DS
Comments: 21 pages, 6 figures
\\
  In their seminal paper from 2004, Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer (KMW)
proved a hardness result for several fundamental graph problems in the LOCAL
model: For any (randomized) algorithm, there are input graphs with $n$ nodes
and maximum degree $\Delta$ on which $\Omega(\min\{\sqrt{\log n/\log \log
n},\log \Delta/\log \log \Delta\})$ (expected) communication rounds are
required to obtain polylogarithmic approximations to a minimum vertex cover,
minimum dominating set, or maximum matching, respectively. Via reduction, this
hardness extends to symmetry breaking tasks like finding maximal independent
sets or maximal matchings. Today, more than $15$ years later, there is still no
proof of this result that is easy on the reader. Setting out to change this, in
this work, we provide a fully self-contained and \emph{simple} proof of the KMW
lower bound. The key argument is algorithmic, and it relies on an invariant
that can be readily verified from the generation rules of the lower bound
graphs.

Title: Consistency Analysis of Replication-Based Probabilistic Key-Value Stores
Authors: Ramy E. Ali
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Partial quorum systems are widely used in distributed key-value stores due to
their latency benefits at the expense of providing weaker consistency
guarantees. The probabilistically bounded staleness framework (PBS) studied the
latency-consistency trade-off of Dynamo-style partial quorum systems through
Monte Carlo event-based simulations. In this paper, we study the
latency-consistency trade-off for such systems analytically and derive a
closed-form expression for the inconsistency probability. Our approach allows
fine-tuning of latency and consistency guarantees in key-value stores, which is
intractable using Monte Carlo event-based simulations.

\\
  Shared high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, such as those provided by
XSEDE and Compute Canada, enable researchers to carry out large-scale
computational experiments at a fraction of the cost of the cloud. Most systems
require the use of distributed filesystems (e.g. Lustre) for providing a highly
multi-user, large capacity storage environment. These suffer performance
penalties as the number of files increases due to network contention and
metadata performance. We demonstrate how a combination of two technologies,
Singularity and SquashFS, can help developers, integrators, architects, and
scientists deploy large datasets (O(10M) files) on these shared systems with
minimal performance limitations. The proposed integration enables more
efficient access and indexing than normal file-based dataset installations,
while providing transparent file access to users and processes. Furthermore,
the approach does not require administrative privileges on the target system.
While the examples studied here have been taken from the field of neuroimaging,
the technologies adopted are not specific to that field. Currently, this
solution is limited to read-only datasets. We propose the adoption of this
technology for the consumption and dissemination of community datasets across
shared computing resources.

  Background: Biomedical research projects deal with data management
requirements from multiple sources like funding agencies' guidelines, publisher
policies, discipline best practices, and their own users' needs. We describe
functional and quality requirements based on many years of experience
implementing data management for the CRC 1002 and CRC 1190. A fully equipped
data management software should improve documentation of experiments and
materials, enable data storage and sharing according to the FAIR Guiding
Principles while maximizing usability, information security, as well as
software sustainability and reusability. Results: We introduce the modular web
portal software menoci for data collection, experiment documentation, data
publication, sharing, and preservation in biomedical research projects. Menoci
modules are based on the Drupal content management system which enables
lightweight deployment and setup, and creates the possibility to combine
research data management with a customisable project home page or collaboration
platform. Conclusions: Management of research data and digital research
artefacts is transforming from individual researcher or groups best practices
towards project- or organisation-wide service infrastructures. To enable and
support this structural transformation process, a vital ecosystem of open
source software tools is needed. Menoci is a contribution to this ecosystem of
research data management tools that is specifically designed to support
biomedical research projects.

Title: Online Algorithms for Multi-shop Ski Rental with Machine Learned
  Predictions
Authors: Shufan Wang, Jian Li, Shiqiang Wang
Categories: cs.DS cs.LG
\\
  We study the problem of augmenting online algorithms with machine learned
(ML) predictions. In particular, we consider the \emph{multi-shop ski rental}
(MSSR) problem, which is a generalization of the classical ski rental problem.
In MSSR, each shop has different prices for buying and renting a pair of skis,
and a skier has to make decisions on when and where to buy. We obtain both
deterministic and randomized online algorithms with provably improved
performance when either a single or multiple ML predictions are used to make
decisions. These online algorithms have no knowledge about the quality or the
prediction error type of the ML predictions. The performance of these online
algorithms are robust to the poor performance of the predictors, but improve
with better predictions. We numerically evaluate the performance of our
proposed online algorithms in practice.

Title: A Simple 1-1/e Approximation for Oblivious Bipartite Matching
Authors: Zhihao Gavin Tang, Xiaowei Wu, Yuhao Zhang
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 5 pages
\\
  We study the oblivious matching problem, which aims at finding a maximum
matching on a graph with unknown edge set. Any algorithm for the problem
specifies an ordering of the vertex pairs. The matching is then produced by
probing the pairs following the ordering, and including a pair if both of them
are unmatched and there exists an edge between them. The unweighted (Chan et
al. (SICOMP 2018)) and the vertex-weighted (Chan et al. (TALG 2018)) versions
of the problem are well studied.
  In this paper, we consider the edge-weighted oblivious matching problem on
bipartite graphs, which generalizes the stochastic bipartite matching problem.
Very recently, Gamlath et al. (SODA 2019) studied the stochastic bipartite
matching problem, and proposed an (1-1/e)-approximate algorithm. We give a very
simple algorithm adapted from the Ranking algorithm by Karp et al. (STOC 1990),
and show that it achieves the same (1-1/e) approximation ratio for the
oblivious matching problem on bipartite graph.

Comments: 22 pages, 3 figurse

\\
  We study the complexity of the problems of finding, given a graph $G$, a
largest induced subgraph of $G$ with all degrees odd (called an odd subgraph),
and the smallest number of odd subgraphs that partition $V(G)$. We call these
parameters ${\sf mos}(G)$ and $\chi_{{\sf odd}}(G)$, respectively. We prove
that deciding whether $\chi_{{\sf odd}}(G) \leq q$ is polynomial-time solvable
if $q \leq 2$, and NP-complete otherwise. We provide algorithms in time
$2^{O({\sf rw})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ and $2^{O(q \cdot {\sf rw})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$
to compute ${\sf mos}(G)$ and to decide whether $\chi_{{\sf odd}}(G) \leq q$ on
$n$-vertex graphs of rank-width at most ${\sf rw}$, respectively, and we prove
that the dependency on rank-width is asymptotically optimal under the ETH.
Finally, we give some tight bounds for these parameters on restricted graph
classes or in relation to other parameters.

Categories: cs.ET
\\
  During the last years, a well studied biological substrate, namely Physarum
polycephalum, has been proven efficient on finding appropriate and efficient
solutions in hard to solve complex mathematical problems. The plasmodium of P.
polycephalum is a single-cell that serves as a prosperous bio-computational
example. Consequently, it has been successfully utilized in the past to solve a
variety of path problems in graphs and combinatorial problems. In this work,
this interesting behaviour is mimicked by a robust unconventional computational
model, drawing inspiration from the notion of Cellular and Learning Automata.
Namely, we employ principles of Cellular Automata (CAs) enriched with learning
capabilities to develop a robust computational model, able of modelling
appropriately the aforementioned biological substrate and, thus, capturing its
computational capabilities. CAs are very efficient in modelling biological
systems and solving scientific problems, owing to their ability of incarnating
essential properties of a system where global behaviour arises as an effect of
simple components, interacting locally. The resulting computational tool, after
combining CAs with learning capabilities, should be appropriate for modelling
the behaviour of living organisms. Thus, the inherent abilities and
computational characteristics of the proposed bio-inspired model are stressed
towards the experimental verification of Physarum's ability to model Logic
Gates, while trying to find minimal paths in properly configured mazes with
food sources. The presented simulation results for various Logic Gates are
found in good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the
corresponding experimental results, proving the efficacy of this unconventional
bio-inspired model and providing useful insights for its enhanced usage in
various computing applications.

Authors: S. Akshay, Paul Gastin, S Krishna, Sparsa Roychowdhury
Categories: cs.FL
Comments: 19 pages, Conference TACAS 2020, 2 tables , 1 Figure
\\
  Boolean programs with multiple recursive threads can be captured as pushdown
automata with multiple stacks. This model is Turing complete, and hence, one is
often interested in analyzing a restricted class that still captures useful
behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new class of bounded under
approximations for multi-pushdown systems, which subsumes most existing
classes. We develop an efficient algorithm for solving the under-approximate
reachability problem, which is based on efficient fix-point computations. We
implement it in our tool BHIM and illustrate its applicability by generating a
set of relevant benchmarks and examining its performance. As an additional
takeaway, BHIM solves the binary reachability problem in pushdown automata. To
show the versatility of our approach, we then extend our algorithm to the timed
setting and provide the first implementation that can handle timed
multi-pushdown automata with closed guards.

Title: Pointfilter: Point Cloud Filtering via Encoder-Decoder Modeling
Authors: Dongbo Zhang, Xuequan Lu, Hong Qin and Ying He
Categories: cs.GR
\\
  Point cloud filtering is a fundamental problem in geometry modeling and
processing. Despite of advancement in recent years, the existing methods still
suffer from two issues: they are either designed without preserving sharp
features or less robust in preserving geometric features; they usually have
many parameters and require tedious parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose
a novel deep learning approach that automatically and robustly filters point
clouds with removing noise and preserving sharp features and geometric details.
Our point-wise learning architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder. The
encoder directly takes points (a point and its neighbors) as input, and learns
a latent representation vector which is gone through the decoder and related to
the ground-truth position. Our trained network can automatically infer a
corresponding quality point set to a noisy point cloud input. Extensive
evaluations show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art deep
learning techniques in terms of visual quality and error metrics. We will make
our code and dataset publicly available.

Title: Approximating Voting Rules from Truncated Ballots

Categories: cs.GT
Comments: 17 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Classical voting rules assume that ballots are complete preference orders
over candidates. However, when the number of candidates is large enough, it is
too costly to ask the voters to rank all candidates. We suggest to fix a rank
k, to ask all voters to specify their best k candidates, and then to consider
"top-k approximations" of rules, which take only into account the top-k
candidates of each ballot. We consider two measures of the quality of the
approximation: the probability of selecting the same winner as the original
rule, and the score ratio. We do a worst-case study (for the latter measure
only), and for both measures, an average-case study and a study from real data
sets.

  Teleoperation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has recently become an
noteworthly research topic in the field of human robot interaction. Each year,
a variety of devices is being studied to design adapted interface for diverse
purpose such as view taking, search and rescue operation or suveillance. New
interfaces have to be precise, simple and intuitive even for complex path
planning. Moreover, when teleoperation involves long distance control, user
needs to get proper feedbacks and avoid motion sickness. In order to overcome
all these challenges, a new interaction metaphor named DrEAM (Drone Exocentric
Advanced Metaphor) was designed. User can see the UAV he is controlling in a
virtual environment mapped to the real world. He can interact with it as a
simple object in a classical virtual world. An experiment was lead in order to
evaluate the perfomances of this metaphor, comparing performance of novice user
using either a direct-view joystick control or using DrEAM.

Title: How to cluster nearest unique nodes from different classes using

Comments: A new type of clustering algorithm is proposed
\\
  The work of finding the best place according to user preference is a tedious
task. It needs manual research and lot of intuitive process to find the best
location according to some earlier knowledge about the place. It is mainly
about accessing publicly available spatial data, applying a simple algorithm to
summarize the data according to given preferences, and visualizing the result
on a map. We introduced JJCluster to eliminate the rigorous way of researching
about a place and visualizing the location in real time. This algorithm
successfully finds the heart of a city when used in Wisp application. The main
purpose of designing Wisp application is used for finding the perfect location
for a trip to unknown place which is nearest to a set of preferences. We also
discussed the various optimization algorithms that are pioneer of today's
dynamic programming and the need for visualization to find patterns when the
data is cluttered. Yet, this general clustering algorithm can be used in other
areas where we can explore every possible preference to maximize its utility.

agile SV is feasible. That is, liveness boosted participants' engagement when
programming an SV, and so, the sessions were highly interactive and
participants were willing to spend much time using our toolkit (i.e., median >=
1.5 hours). Participants used our integrated toolkit to deal with data
transformations, visual mappings, and view transformations without leaving the
immersive environment. Finally, participants benefited from our expressive
toolkit and employed multiple of the available features when programming an SV.

Title: Eat4Thought: A Design of Food Journaling
Authors: Yixuan Zhang and Andrea G. Parker
Categories: cs.HC
Comments: 8 pages
DOI: 10.1145/3334480.3383044
\\
  Food journaling is an effective method to help people identify their eating
patterns and encourage healthy eating habits as it requires self-reflection on
eating behaviors. Current tools have predominately focused on tracking food
intake, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. Other factors,
such as contextual information and momentary thoughts and feelings that are
internal to an individual, are also essential to help people reflect upon and
change attitudes about eating behaviors. However, current dietary tracking
tools rarely support capturing these elements as a way to foster deep
reflection. In this work, we present Eat4Thought -- a food journaling
application that allows users to track their emotional, sensory, and
spatio-temporal elements of meals as a means of supporting self-reflection. The
application enables vivid documentation of experiences and self-reflection on
the past through video recording. We describe our design process and an initial
evaluation of the application. We also provide design recommendations for
future work on food journaling.

Title: Docking Haptics: Extending the Reach of Haptics by Dynamic Combinations
  of Grounded and Worn Devices
Authors: Anthony Steed, Sebastian Friston, Vijay Pawar, David Swapp
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Grounded haptic devices can provide a variety of forces but have limited
working volumes. Wearable haptic devices operate over a large volume but are
relatively restricted in the types of stimuli they can generate. We propose the
concept of docking haptics, in which different types of haptic devices are
dynamically docked at run time. This creates a hybrid system, where the
potential feedback depends on the user's location. We show a prototype docking
haptic workspace, combining a grounded six degree-of-freedom force feedback arm
with a hand exoskeleton. We are able to create the sensation of weight on the
hand when it is within reach of the grounded device, but away from the grounded
device, hand-referenced force feedback is still available. A user study
demonstrates that users can successfully discriminate weight when using docking
haptics, but not with the exoskeleton alone. Such hybrid systems would be able
to change configuration further, for example docking two grounded devices to a
hand in order to deliver twice the force, or extend the working volume. We
suggest that the docking haptics concept can thus extend the practical utility
of haptics in user interfaces.

  The increasingly rapid growth of data production and the consequent need to
explore data to obtain answers to the most varied questions have promoted the
development of tools to facilitate the manipulation and construction of data
visualizations. However, building useful data visualizations is not a trivial
task: it may involve a large number of subtle decisions that require experience
from their designer. In this paper, we present VisMaker, a visualization
recommender tool that uses a set of rules to present visualization
recommendations organized and described through questions, in order to
facilitate the understanding of the recommendations and assisting the visual
exploration process. We carried out two studies comparing our tool with Voyager
2 and analyzed some aspects of the use of tools. We collected feedback from
participants to identify the advantages and disadvantages of our recommendation
approach. As a result, we gathered comments to help improve the development of
tools in this domain.

Categories: cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  In this paper, we introduce an Augmented Lagrangian based method to
incorporate the multiple objectives (MO) in a search ranking algorithm.
Optimizing MOs is an essential and realistic requirement for building ranking
models in production. The proposed method formulates MO in constrained
optimization and solves the problem in the popular Boosting framework -- a
novel contribution of our work. Furthermore, we propose a procedure to set up
all optimization parameters in the problem. The experimental results show that
the method successfully achieves MO criteria much more efficiently than
existing methods.

Title: Cooperative NOMA for Downlink Asymmetric Interference Cancellation

  for publication
DOI: 10.1109/LWC.2020.2974206
\\
  This letter advances the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique for
cellular downlink co-channel interference mitigation, via exploiting the
(limited) cooperation among base stations (BSs). Specifically, we consider a
simplified but practically relevant scenario of two co-channel cells with
asymmetric interference, i.e., only the user in one cell receives the strong
interference from the BS in the other cell. To mitigate such interference, we
propose a new cooperative NOMA scheme, where the interfered user's serving BS
sends a superposed signal comprising both the desired message and the
co-channel user's message (shared by the interfering BS). The co-channel user's
signal is aimed to add constructively with the interfering BS's signal at the
interfered user's receiver so that the combined interference with enhanced
power can be effectively decoded and cancelled. This thus leads to a new
problem on how to optimally allocate the transmit power for the two superposed
messages. We provide the closed-form solution to this problem and investigate
the conditions under which the performance of the proposed scheme is superior
over the existing schemes.

Title: Degrees of Freedom of Cache-Aided Wireless Cellular Networks
Authors: Youlong Cao, Meixia Tao
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Part of this work was presented at IEEE WCNC 2019
\\
  This work investigates the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a downlink cache-aided
cellular network where the locations of base stations (BSs) are modeled as a
grid topology and users within a grid cell can only communicate with four
nearby BSs. We adopt a cache placement method with uncoded prefetching tailored
for the network with partial connectivity. According to the overlapped degree
of cached contents among BSs, we propose transmission schemes with no BS
cooperation, partial BS cooperation, and full BS cooperation, respectively, for
different cache sizes. In specific, the common cached contents among BSs are
utilized to cancel some undesired signals by interference neutralization while
interference alignment is used to coordinate signals of distinct cached
contents. Our achievable results indicate that the reciprocal of per-user DoF
of the cellular network decreases piecewise linearly with the normalized cache
size $\mu$ at each BS, and the gain of BS caching is more significant for the
small cache region. Under the given cache placement scheme, we also provide an
upper bound of per-user DoF and show that our achievable DoF is optimal when
$\mu\in\left[\frac{1}{2},1\right]$, and within an additive gap of
$\frac{4}{39}$ to the optimum when
$\mu\in\left[\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2}\right)$.

Title: Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Massive MIMO Communications
Authors: Zhaorui Wang, Liang Liu, and Shuguang Cui
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: Invited paper, submitted to SPAWC 2020
\\
  In a practical massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system, the
number of antennas at a base station (BS) is constrained by the space and cost
factors, which limits the throughput gain promised by theoretical analysis.
This paper studies the feasibility of adopting intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS) for further improving the beamforming gain and throughput of the uplink
communications in a massive MIMO system. Specifically, we show that the
favorable propagation property for the conventional massive MIMO system without
IRS, i.e., the channels of arbitrary two users are orthogonal, no longer holds
for the IRS-assisted massive MIMO system, because of the correlated user
channels arising from the fact that each IRS element reflects the signals from
all the users to the BS via the same channel. As a result, the maximal-ratio
combining (MRC) receive beamforming strategy leads to strong inter-user
interference and thus low user rates. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
novel zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming strategy to efficiently null the
interference, under which the user achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratios (SINRs) are characterized in closed-form and shown to be significantly
larger than those achieved by the conventional massive MIMO system without IRS.
Despite the increased channel estimation overhead and thus reduced data
transmission time, numerical results show that the IRS-assisted massive MIMO
system can achieve higher throughput compared to its counterpart without IRS
thanks to the substantial SINR gain.

\\
  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a proposing technology in 6G to
enhance the performance of wireless networks by smartly reconfiguring the
propagation environment with a large number of passive reflecting elements.
However, current works mainly focus on single IRS-empowered wireless networks,
where the channel rank deficiency problem has emerged. In this paper, we
propose a distributed IRS-empowered communication network architecture, where
multiple source-destination pairs communicate through multiple distributed
IRSs. We further contribute to maximize the achievable sum-rates in this
network via jointly optimizing the transmit power vector at the sources and the
phase shift matrix with passive beamforming at all distributed IRSs.
Unfortunately, this problem turns out to be non-convex and highly intractable,
for which an alternating approach is developed via solving the resulting
fractional programming problems alternatively. In particular, the closed-form
expressions are proposed for coordinated passive beamforming at IRSs. The
numerical results will demonstrate the algorithmic advantages and desirable
performances of the distributed IRS-empowered communication network.

\\
  One of the key challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to sustainably
power the large number of IoT devices in real-time. In this paper, we consider
a wireless power transfer (WPT) scenario between an energy transmitter (ET)
capable of retrodirective WPT and an energy receiver (ER) capable of ambient
backscatter in the presence of an ambient source (AS). The ER requests WPT by
backscattering signals from an AS towards the ET, which then retrodirectively
beamforms an energy signal towards the ER. To remove the inherent direct-link
ambient interference, we propose a scheme of ambient backscatter training.
Specifically, the ER varies the reflection coefficient multiple times while
backscattering each ambient symbol according to a certain pattern called the
training sequence, whose design criterion we also present. To evaluate the
system performance, we derive an analytical expression for the average
harvested power at the ER. Our numerical results show that with the proposed
scheme, the ER harvests tens of $\mu$W of power, without any CSI estimation or
active transmission from the ER, which is a significant improvement for
low-power and low-cost ambient backscatter devices.

Title: Mobile Communications, Computing and Caching Resources Optimization for
  Coded Caching with Device Computing
Authors: Yingjiao Li, Zhiyong Chen, and Meixia Tao
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: the short version of this paper is to appear in IEEE ICC 2020
\\
  Edge caching and computing have been regarded as an efficient approach to
tackle the wireless spectrum crunch problem. In this paper, we design a general
coded caching with device computing strategy for content computation, e.g.,
virtual reality (VR) rendering, to minimize the average transmission bandwidth
with the caching capacity and the energy constraints of each mobile device, and
the maximum tolerable delay constraint of each task. The key enabler is that
because both coded data and stored data can be the data before or after
computing, the proposed scheme has numerous edge computing and caching paths
corresponding to different bandwidth requirement. We thus formulate a joint
coded caching and computing optimization problem to decide whether the mobile
devices cache the input data or the output data, which tasks to be coded cached
and which tasks to compute locally. The optimization problem is shown to be 0-1
nonconvex nonsmooth programming and can be decomposed into the computation
programming and the coded caching programming. We prove the convergence of the
computation programming problem by utilizing the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM), and a stationary point can be obtained. For the coded
cache programming, we design a low complexity algorithm to obtain an acceptable
solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides a
significant bandwidth saving by taking full advantage of the caching and
computing capability of mobile devices.

Title: Limits of Transmit and Receive Array Gain in Massive MIMO

Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
Comments: To be published in the Proceedings of the 2020 IEEE Wireless
  Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)
\\
  In this paper, we consider the transmit and receive antenna array gain of
massive MIMO systems. In particular, we look at their dependence on the number
of antennas in the array, and the antenna spacing for uniform linear and
uniform circular arrays. It is known that the transmit array gain saturates at
a certain antenna spacing, but the receive array gain had not been considered.
With our physically consistent analysis based on the Multiport Communication
Theory, we show that the receive array gain does not saturate, but that there
is a peak at a certain antenna spacing when there is no decoupling network at
the receiver. As implementing a decoupling network for massive MIMO would be
almost impossible, this is a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we analyze how
the array gain changes depending on the antenna spacing and the size of the
antenna array and derive design recommendations.

Title: Multiple Metric Learning for Structured Data
Authors: Nicolo Colombo
Categories: cs.LG math.MG stat.AP stat.ML
Comments: 24 pages, 6 figures
\\
  We address the problem of merging graph and feature-space information while
learning a metric from structured data. Existing algorithms tackle the problem
in an asymmetric way, by either extracting vectorized summaries of the graph
structure or adding hard constraints to feature-space algorithms. Following a
different path, we define a metric regression scheme where we train
metric-constrained linear combinations of dissimilarity matrices. The idea is
that the input matrices can be pre-computed dissimilarity measures obtained
from any kind of available data (e.g. node attributes or edge structure). As
the model inputs are distance measures, we do not need to assume the existence
of any underlying feature space. Main challenge is that metric constraints
(especially positive-definiteness and sub-additivity), are not automatically
respected if, for example, the coefficients of the linear combination are
allowed to be negative. Both positive and sub-additive constraints are linear
inequalities, but the computational complexity of imposing them scales as
O(D3), where D is the size of the input matrices (i.e. the size of the data
set). This becomes quickly prohibitive, even when D is relatively small. We
propose a new graph-based technique for optimizing under such constraints and
show that, in some cases, our approach may reduce the original computational
complexity of the optimization process by one order of magnitude. Contrarily to
existing methods, our scheme applies to any (possibly non-convex)
metric-constrained objective function.

Title: Harvesting Ambient RF for Presence Detection Through Deep Learning

Comments: Source code and datasets are available at Github:
  https://github.com/bigtreeyanger/presence_detection_cnn
\\
  This paper explores the use of ambient radio frequency (RF) signals for human
presence detection through deep learning. Using WiFi signal as an example, we
demonstrate that the channel state information (CSI) obtained at the receiver
contains rich information about the propagation environment. Through judicious
pre-processing of the estimated CSI followed by deep learning, reliable
presence detection can be achieved. Several challenges in passive RF sensing
are addressed. With presence detection, how to collect training data with human
presence can have a significant impact on the performance. This is in contrast
to activity detection when a specific motion pattern is of interest. A second
challenge is that RF signals are complex-valued. Handling complex-valued input
in deep learning requires careful data representation and network architecture
design. Finally, human presence affects CSI variation along multiple
dimensions; such variation, however, is often masked by system impediments such
as timing or frequency offset. Addressing these challenges, the proposed
learning system uses pre-processing to preserve human motion induced channel
variation while insulating against other impairments. A convolutional neural
network (CNN) properly trained with both magnitude and phase information is
then designed to achieve reliable presence detection. Extensive experiments are
conducted. Using off-the-shelf WiFi devices, the proposed deep learning based
RF sensing achieves near perfect presence detection during multiple extended
periods of test and exhibits superior performance compared with leading edge
passive infrared sensors. The learning based passive RF sensing thus provides a
viable and promising alternative for presence or occupancy detection.

Title: Variational Conditional-Dependence Hidden Markov Models for Human Action
  Recognition
Authors: Konstantinos P. Panousis, Sotirios Chatzis, Sergios Theodoridis
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: Under review ICML 2020
\\
  Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a powerful generative approach for modeling
sequential data and time-series in general. However, the commonly employed
assumption of the dependence of the current time frame to a single or multiple
immediately preceding frames is unrealistic; more complicated dynamics
potentially exist in real world scenarios. Human Action Recognition constitutes
such a scenario, and has attracted increased attention with the advent of
low-cost 3D sensors. The naturally arising variations and complex temporal
dependencies have established this task as a challenging problem in the
community. This paper revisits conventional sequential modeling approaches,
aiming to address the problem of capturing time-varying temporal dependency
patterns. To this end, we propose a different formulation of HMMs, whereby the
dependence on past frames is dynamically inferred from the data. Specifically,
we introduce a hierarchical extension by postulating an additional latent
variable layer; therein, the (time-varying) temporal dependence patterns are
treated as latent variables over which inference is performed. We leverage
solid arguments from the Variational Bayes framework and derive a tractable
inference algorithm based on the forward-backward algorithm. As we
experimentally show using benchmark datasets, our approach yields competitive
recognition accuracy and can effectively handle data with missing values.

the inherent constraints in the problem. The key idea of E2Efold is to directly
predict the RNA base-pairing matrix, and use an unrolled algorithm for
constrained programming as the template for deep architectures to enforce
constraints. With comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate the superior performance of E2Efold: it predicts significantly
better structures compared to previous SOTA (especially for pseudoknotted
structures), while being as efficient as the fastest algorithms in terms of
inference time.

Title: Clustering based on Point-Set Kernel
Authors: Kai Ming Ting, Jonathan R. Wells and Ye Zhu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Measuring similarity between two objects is the core operation in existing
cluster analyses in grouping similar objects into clusters. Cluster analyses
have been applied to a number of applications, including image segmentation,
social network analysis, and computational biology. This paper introduces a new
similarity measure called point-set kernel which computes the similarity
between an object and a sample of objects generated from an unknown
distribution. The proposed clustering procedure utilizes this new measure to
characterize both the typical point of every cluster and the cluster grown from
the typical point. We show that the new clustering procedure is both effective
and efficient such that it can deal with large scale datasets. In contrast,
existing clustering algorithms are either efficient or effective; and even
efficient ones have difficulty dealing with large scale datasets without
special hardware. We show that the proposed algorithm is more effective and
runs orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art density-peak
clustering and scalable kernel k-means clustering when applying to datasets of
millions of data points, on commonly used computing machines.

Title: Frequency-based Search-control in Dyna
Authors: Yangchen Pan, Jincheng Mei, Amir-massoud Farahmand
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Accepted to ICLR 2020
\\
  Model-based reinforcement learning has been empirically demonstrated as a
successful strategy to improve sample efficiency. In particular, Dyna is an
elegant model-based architecture integrating learning and planning that
provides huge flexibility of using a model. One of the most important
components in Dyna is called search-control, which refers to the process of
generating state or state-action pairs from which we query the model to acquire
simulated experiences. Search-control is critical in improving learning
efficiency. In this work, we propose a simple and novel search-control strategy
by searching high frequency regions of the value function. Our main intuition
is built on Shannon sampling theorem from signal processing, which indicates
that a high frequency signal requires more samples to reconstruct. We
empirically show that a high frequency function is more difficult to
approximate. This suggests a search-control strategy: we should use states from
high frequency regions of the value function to query the model to acquire more
samples. We develop a simple strategy to locally measure the frequency of a
function by gradient and hessian norms, and provide theoretical justification
for this approach. We then apply our strategy to search-control in Dyna, and
conduct experiments to show its property and effectiveness on benchmark
domains.

proven to be a useful constraint, both theoretically--to prove convergence and
optimality guarantees--and empirically--as an inductive bias. Deep metric
learning architectures that respect the triangle inequality rely, almost
exclusively, on Euclidean distance in the latent space. Though effective, this
fails to model two broad classes of subadditive distances, common in graphs and
reinforcement learning: asymmetric metrics, and metrics that cannot be embedded
into Euclidean space. To address these problems, we introduce novel
architectures that are guaranteed to satisfy the triangle inequality. We prove
our architectures universally approximate norm-induced metrics on
$\mathbb{R}^n$, and present a similar result for modified Input Convex Neural
Networks. We show that our architectures outperform existing metric approaches
when modeling graph distances and have a better inductive bias than non-metric
approaches when training data is limited in the multi-goal reinforcement
learning setting.

Title: Statistical Learning with Conditional Value at Risk
Authors: Tasuku Soma and Yuichi Yoshida
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  We propose a risk-averse statistical learning framework wherein the
performance of a learning algorithm is evaluated by the conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR) of losses rather than the expected loss. We devise
algorithms based on stochastic gradient descent for this framework. While
existing studies of CVaR optimization require direct access to the underlying
distribution, our algorithms make a weaker assumption that only i.i.d.\ samples
are given. For convex and Lipschitz loss functions, we show that our algorithm
has $O(1/\sqrt{n})$-convergence to the optimal CVaR, where $n$ is the number of
samples. For nonconvex and smooth loss functions, we show a generalization
bound on CVaR. By conducting numerical experiments on various machine learning
tasks, we demonstrate that our algorithms effectively minimize CVaR compared
with other baseline algorithms.

Title: Graph Prolongation Convolutional Networks: Explicitly Multiscale Machine
  Learning on Graphs, with Applications to Modeling of Biological Systems
Authors: C.B. Scott and Eric Mjolsness
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: ICML 2020 Submission
\\
  We define a novel type of ensemble Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model.
Using optimized linear projection operators to map between spatial scales of
graph, this ensemble model learns to aggregate information from each scale for
its final prediction. We calculate these linear projection operators as the
infima of an objective function relating the structure matrices used for each
GCN. Equipped with these projections, our model (a Graph
Prolongation-Convolutional Network) outperforms other GCN ensemble models at
predicting the potential energy of monomer subunits in a coarse-grained
mechanochemical simulation of microtubule bending. We demonstrate these
performance gains by measuring an estimate of the FLOPs spent to train each
model, as well as wall-clock time. Because our model learns at multiple scales,
it is possible to train at each scale according to a predetermined schedule of
coarse vs. fine training. We examine several such schedules adapted from the
Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) literature, and quantify the computational benefit of
each. Finally, we demonstrate how under certain assumptions, our graph
prolongation layers may be decomposed into a matrix outer product of smaller
GCN operations.

Title: Deep S$^3$PR: Simultaneous Source Separation and Phase Retrieval Using

Authors: Christopher A. Metzler and Gordon Wetzstein
Categories: cs.LG eess.IV stat.ML
\\
  This paper introduces and solves the simultaneous source separation and phase
retrieval (S$^3$PR) problem. S$^3$PR shows up in a number application domains,
most notably computational optics, where one has multiple independent coherent
sources whose phase is difficult to measure. In general, S$^3$PR is highly
under-determined, non-convex, and difficult to solve. In this work, we
demonstrate that by restricting the solutions to lie in the range of a deep
generative model, we can constrain the search space sufficiently to solve
S$^3$PR.

Title: Learning to rank for uplift modeling
Authors: Floris Devriendt, Tias Guns and Wouter Verbeke
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Uplift modeling has effectively been used in fields such as marketing and
customer retention, to target those customers that are most likely to respond
due to the campaign or treatment. Uplift models produce uplift scores which are
then used to essentially create a ranking. We instead investigate to learn to
rank directly by looking into the potential of learning-to-rank techniques in
the context of uplift modeling. We propose a unified formalisation of different
global uplift modeling measures in use today and explore how these can be
integrated into the learning-to-rank framework. Additionally, we introduce a
new metric for learning-to-rank that focusses on optimizing the area under the
uplift curve called the promoted cumulative gain (PCG). We employ the
learning-to-rank technique LambdaMART to optimize the ranking according to PCG
and show improved results over standard learning-to-rank metrics and equal to
improved results when compared with state-of-the-art uplift modeling. Finally,
we show how learning-to-rank models can learn to optimize a certain targeting
depth, however, these results do not generalize on the test set.

Title: Deep learning of dynamical attractors from time series measurements
Authors: William Gilpin
Categories: cs.LG nlin.CD physics.data-an q-bio.QM stat.ML
Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, plus appendices
\\
  Experimental measurements of physical systems often have a finite number of
independent channels, causing essential dynamical variables to remain
unobserved. However, many popular methods for unsupervised inference of latent
dynamics from experimental data implicitly assume that the measurements have
higher intrinsic dimensionality than the underlying system---making coordinate
identification a dimensionality reduction problem. Here, we study the opposite
limit, in which hidden governing coordinates must be inferred from only a
low-dimensional time series of measurements. Inspired by classical techniques
for studying the strange attractors of chaotic systems, we introduce a general
embedding technique for time series, consisting of an autoencoder trained with
a novel latent-space loss function. We first apply our technique to a variety
of synthetic and real-world datasets with known strange attractors, and we use
established and novel measures of attractor fidelity to show that our method
successfully reconstructs attractors better than existing techniques. We then
use our technique to discover dynamical attractors in datasets ranging from
patient electrocardiograms, to household electricity usage, to eruptions of the
Old Faithful geyser---demonstrating diverse applications of our technique for
exploratory data analysis.

Title: Learning Functionally Decomposed Hierarchies for Continuous Control
  Tasks

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO stat.ML
Comments: Preprint under review
\\
  Solving long-horizon sequential decision making tasks in environments with
sparse rewards is a longstanding problem in reinforcement learning (RL)
research. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) has held the promise to
enhance the capabilities of RL agents via operation on different levels of
temporal abstraction. Despite the success of recent works in dealing with
inherent nonstationarity and sample complexity, it remains difficult to
generalize to unseen environments and to transfer different layers of the
policy to other agents. In this paper, we propose a novel HRL architecture,
Hierarchical Decompositional Reinforcement Learning (HiDe), which allows
decomposition of the hierarchical layers into independent subtasks, yet allows
for joint training of all layers in end-to-end manner. The main insight is to
combine a control policy on a lower level with an image-based planning policy
on a higher level. We evaluate our method on various complex continuous control
tasks, demonstrating that generalization across environments and transfer of
higher level policies, such as from a simple ball to a complex humanoid, can be
achieved. See videos https://sites.google.com/view/hide-rl.

Title: Query2box: Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs in Vector Space using Box
  Embeddings
Authors: Hongyu Ren, Weihua Hu, Jure Leskovec
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL stat.ML
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  Answering complex logical queries on large-scale incomplete knowledge graphs
(KGs) is a fundamental yet challenging task. Recently, a promising approach to
this problem has been to embed KG entities as well as the query into a vector
space such that entities that answer the query are embedded close to the query.
However, prior work models queries as single points in the vector space, which
is problematic because a complex query represents a potentially large set of
its answer entities, but it is unclear how such a set can be represented as a
single point. Furthermore, prior work can only handle queries that use
conjunctions ($\wedge$) and existential quantifiers ($\exists$). Handling
queries with logical disjunctions ($\vee$) remains an open problem. Here we
propose query2box, an embedding-based framework for reasoning over arbitrary
queries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, and $\exists$ operators in massive and
incomplete KGs. Our main insight is that queries can be embedded as boxes
(i.e., hyper-rectangles), where a set of points inside the box corresponds to a
set of answer entities of the query. We show that conjunctions can be naturally
represented as intersections of boxes and also prove a negative result that
handling disjunctions would require embedding with dimension proportional to
the number of KG entities. However, we show that by transforming queries into a
Disjunctive Normal Form, query2box is capable of handling arbitrary logical
queries with $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\exists$ in a scalable manner. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of query2box on three large KGs and show that query2box
achieves up to 25% relative improvement over the state of the art.

  Payment card fraud causes multibillion dollar losses for banks and merchants
worldwide, often fueling complex criminal activities. To address this, many
real-time fraud detection systems use tree-based models, demanding complex
feature engineering systems to efficiently enrich transactions with historical
data while complying with millisecond-level latencies.
  In this work, we do not require those expensive features by using recurrent
neural networks and treating payments as an interleaved sequence, where the
history of each card is an unbounded, irregular sub-sequence. We present a
complete RNN framework to detect fraud in real-time, proposing an efficient ML
pipeline from preprocessing to deployment.
  We show that these feature-free, multi-sequence RNNs outperform
state-of-the-art models saving millions of dollars in fraud detection and using
fewer computational resources.

Title: Skip Connections Matter: On the Transferability of Adversarial Examples
  Generated with ResNets
Authors: Dongxian Wu, Yisen Wang, Shu-Tao Xia, James Bailey, Xingjun Ma
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: ICLR 2020 conference paper (spotlight)
\\
  Skip connections are an essential component of current state-of-the-art deep
neural networks (DNNs) such as ResNet, WideResNet, DenseNet, and ResNeXt.
Despite their huge success in building deeper and more powerful DNNs, we
identify a surprising security weakness of skip connections in this paper. Use
of skip connections allows easier generation of highly transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, in ResNet-like (with skip connections) neural networks,
gradients can backpropagate through either skip connections or residual
modules. We find that using more gradients from the skip connections rather
than the residual modules according to a decay factor, allows one to craft
adversarial examples with high transferability. Our method is termed Skip
Gradient Method(SGM). We conduct comprehensive transfer attacks against
state-of-the-art DNNs including ResNets, DenseNets, Inceptions,
Inception-ResNet, Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) and robustly trained
DNNs. We show that employing SGM on the gradient flow can greatly improve the
transferability of crafted attacks in almost all cases. Furthermore, SGM can be
easily combined with existing black-box attack techniques, and obtain high
improvements over state-of-the-art transferability methods. Our findings not
only motivate new research into the architectural vulnerability of DNNs, but
also open up further challenges for the design of secure DNN architectures.

Title: Adversarial Distributional Training for Robust Deep Learning
Authors: Zhijie Deng, Yinpeng Dong, Tianyu Pang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML
\\
  Adversarial training (AT) is among the most effective techniques to improve
model robustness by augmenting training data with adversarial examples.
However, the adversarially trained models do not perform well enough on test
data or under other attack algorithms unseen during training, which remains to
be improved. In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial distributional
training (ADT) framework for learning robust models. Specifically, we formulate
ADT as a minimax optimization problem, where the inner maximization aims to
learn an adversarial distribution to characterize the potential adversarial
examples around a natural one, and the outer minimization aims to train robust
classifiers by minimizing the expected loss over the worst-case adversarial
distributions. We conduct a theoretical analysis on how to solve the minimax
problem, leading to a general algorithm for ADT. We further propose three
different approaches to parameterize the adversarial distributions. Empirical
results on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of ADT compared with
the state-of-the-art AT methods.

\\
  Large-scale distributed training of deep neural networks results in models
with worse generalization performance as a result of the increase in the
effective mini-batch size. Previous approaches attempt to address this problem
by varying the learning rate and batch size over epochs and layers, or ad hoc
modifications of batch normalization. We propose Scalable and Practical Natural
Gradient Descent (SP-NGD), a principled approach for training models that
allows them to attain similar generalization performance to models trained with
first-order optimization methods, but with accelerated convergence.
Furthermore, SP-NGD scales to large mini-batch sizes with a negligible
computational overhead as compared to first-order methods. We evaluated SP-NGD
on a benchmark task where highly optimized first-order methods are available as
references: training a ResNet-50 model for image classification on ImageNet. We
demonstrate convergence to a top-1 validation accuracy of 75.4% in 5.5 minutes
using a mini-batch size of 32,768 with 1,024 GPUs, as well as an accuracy of
74.9% with an extremely large mini-batch size of 131,072 in 873 steps of
SP-NGD.

\\
  We propose a reinforcement learning agent to solve hard exploration games by
learning a range of directed exploratory policies. We construct an episodic
memory-based intrinsic reward using k-nearest neighbors over the agent's recent
experience to train the directed exploratory policies, thereby encouraging the
agent to repeatedly revisit all states in its environment. A self-supervised
inverse dynamics model is used to train the embeddings of the nearest neighbour
lookup, biasing the novelty signal towards what the agent can control. We
employ the framework of Universal Value Function Approximators (UVFA) to
simultaneously learn many directed exploration policies with the same neural
network, with different trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. By
using the same neural network for different degrees of
exploration/exploitation, transfer is demonstrated from predominantly
exploratory policies yielding effective exploitative policies. The proposed
method can be incorporated to run with modern distributed RL agents that
collect large amounts of experience from many actors running in parallel on
separate environment instances. Our method doubles the performance of the base
agent in all hard exploration in the Atari-57 suite while maintaining a very
high score across the remaining games, obtaining a median human normalised
score of 1344.0%. Notably, the proposed method is the first algorithm to
achieve non-zero rewards (with a mean score of 8,400) in the game of Pitfall!
without using demonstrations or hand-crafted features.

  We derive an unbiased estimator for expectations over discrete random
variables based on sampling without replacement, which reduces variance as it
avoids duplicate samples. We show that our estimator can be derived as the
Rao-Blackwellization of three different estimators. Combining our estimator
with REINFORCE, we obtain a policy gradient estimator and we reduce its
variance using a built-in control variate which is obtained without additional
model evaluations. The resulting estimator is closely related to other gradient
estimators. Experiments with a toy problem, a categorical Variational
Auto-Encoder and a structured prediction problem show that our estimator is the
only estimator that is consistently among the best estimators in both high and
low entropy settings.

\\
  Fraud detection is essential in financial services, with the potential of
greatly reducing criminal activities and saving considerable resources for
businesses and customers. We address online fraud detection, which consists of
classifying incoming transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent in
real-time. Modern fraud detection systems consist of a machine learning model
and rules defined by human experts. Often, the rules performance degrades over
time due to concept drift, especially of adversarial nature. Furthermore, they
can be costly to maintain, either because they are computationally expensive or
because they send transactions for manual review. We propose ARMS, an automated
rules management system that evaluates the contribution of individual rules and
optimizes the set of active rules using heuristic search and a user-defined
loss-function. It complies with critical domain-specific requirements, such as
handling different actions (e.g., accept, alert, and decline), priorities,
blacklists, and large datasets (i.e., hundreds of rules and millions of
transactions). We use ARMS to optimize the rule-based systems of two real-world
clients. Results show that it can maintain the original systems' performance
(e.g., recall, or false-positive rate) using only a fraction of the original
rules (~ 50% in one case, and ~ 20% in the other).

Title: Multi-variate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting via Conditioned
  Normalizing Flows
Authors: Kashif Rasul, Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Ingmar Schuster, Urs Bergmann,
  Roland Vollgraf
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Time series forecasting is often fundamental to scientific and engineering
problems and enables decision making. With ever increasing data set sizes, a
trivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between
interacting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve
accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are
well suited for this problem, but multi-variate models often assume a simple
parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we
model the multi-variate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive
deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a
conditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of
autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the
future, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional
distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it
improves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data
sets with several thousand interacting time-series.

  A hybrid machine learning and process-based-modeling (PBM) approach is
proposed and evaluated at a handful of AmeriFlux sites to simulate the
top-layer soil moisture state. The Hybrid-PBM (HPBM) employed here uses the
Noah land-surface model integrated with Gaussian Processes. It is designed to
correct the model only in climatological situations similar to the training
data else it reverts to the PBM. In this way, our approach avoids bad
predictions in scenarios where similar training data is not available and
incorporates our physical understanding of the system. Here we assume an
autoregressive model and obtain out-of-sample results with upwards of a 3-fold
reduction in the RMSE using a one-year leave-one-out cross-validation at each
of the selected sites. A path is outlined for using hybrid modeling to build
global land-surface models with the potential to significantly outperform the

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML

  We address two fundamental questions about graph neural networks (GNNs).
First, we prove that several important graph properties cannot be computed by
GNNs that rely entirely on local information. Such GNNs include the standard
message passing models, and more powerful spatial variants that exploit local
graph structure (e.g., via relative orientation of messages, or local port
ordering) to distinguish neighbors of each node. Our treatment includes a novel
graph-theoretic formalism. Second, we provide the first data dependent
generalization bounds for message passing GNNs. This analysis explicitly
accounts for the local permutation invariance of GNNs. Our bounds are much
tighter than existing VC-dimension based guarantees for GNNs, and are
comparable to Rademacher bounds for recurrent neural networks.

Title: The Goal-Gradient Hypothesis in Stack Overflow
Authors: Nicholas Hoernle and Gregory Kehne and Ariel D. Procaccia and Kobi Gal
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  According to the goal-gradient hypothesis, people increase their efforts
toward a reward as they close in on the reward. This hypothesis has recently
been used to explain users' behavior in online communities that use badges as
rewards for completing specific activities. In such settings, users exhibit a
"steering effect," a dramatic increase in activity as the users approach a
badge threshold, thereby following the predictions made by the goal-gradient
hypothesis. This paper provides a new probabilistic model of users' behavior,
which captures users who exhibit different levels of steering. We apply this
model to data from the popular Q&A site, Stack Overflow, and study users who
achieve one of the badges available on this platform. Our results show that
only a fraction (20%) of all users strongly experience steering, whereas the
activity of more than 40% of badge achievers appears not to be affected by the
badge. In particular, we find that for some of the population, an increased
activity in and around the badge acquisition date may reflect a statistical
artifact rather than steering, as was previously thought in prior work. These
results are important for system designers who hope to motivate and guide their
users towards certain actions. We have highlighted the need for further studies

Title: Stochasticity of Deterministic Gradient Descent: Large Learning Rate for
  Multiscale Objective Function
Authors: Lingkai Kong and Molei Tao
Categories: cs.LG cs.NA math.DS math.NA math.OC stat.ML
Comments: Comments are welcome
\\
  This article suggests that deterministic Gradient Descent, which does not use
any stochastic gradient approximation, can still exhibit stochastic behaviors.
In particular, it shows that if the objective function exhibit multiscale
behaviors, then in a large learning rate regime which only resolves the
macroscopic but not the microscopic details of the objective, the deterministic
GD dynamics can become chaotic and convergent not to a local minimizer but to a
statistical distribution. A sufficient condition is also established for
approximating this long-time statistical limit by a rescaled Gibbs
distribution. Both theoretical and numerical demonstrations are provided, and
the theoretical part relies on the construction of a stochastic map that uses
bounded noise (as opposed to discretized diffusions).

Title: Uniform labelled calculi for preferential conditional logics based on
  neighbourhood semantics
Authors: Marianna Girlando and Sara Negri and Nicola Olivetti
Categories: cs.LO
Comments: Submitted for publication. Will be revised after referees report
\\
  The preferential conditional logic PCL, introduced by Burgess, and its
extensions are studied. First, a natural semantics based on neighbourhood
models, which generalise Lewis' sphere models for counterfactual logics, is
proposed. Soundness and completeness of PCL and its extensions with respect to
this class of models are proved directly. Labelled sequent calculi for all
logics of the family are then introduced. The calculi are modular and have
standard proof-theoretical properties, the most important of which is
admissibility of cut, that entails a syntactic proof of completeness of the
calculi. By adopting a general strategy, root-first proof search terminates,
thereby providing a decision procedure for PCL and its extensions. Finally, the
semantic completeness of the calculi is established: from a finite branch in a
failed proof attempt it is possible to extract a finite countermodel of the
root sequent. The latter result gives a constructive proof of the finite model
property of all the logics considered.

Title: Flexible Coinduction in Agda
Authors: Luca Ciccone, Elena Zucca, Francesco Dagnino
Categories: cs.LO
\\
  Theorem provers are tools that help users to write machine readable proofs.
Some of this tools are also interactive. The need of such softwares is
increasing since they provide proofs that are more certified than the hand
written ones. Agda is based on type theory and on the propositions-as-types
correspondence and has a Haskell-like syntax. This means that a proof of a
statement is turned into a function. Inference systems are a way of defining
inductive and coinductive predicates and induction and coinduction principles
are provided to help proving their correctness with respect to a given
specification in terms of soundness and completeness. Generalized inference
systems deal with predicates whose inductive and coinductive interpretations do
not provide the expected set of judgments. In this case inference systems are
enriched by corules that are rules that can be applied at infinite depth in a
proof tree. Induction and coinduction principles cannot be used in case of
generalized inference systems and the bounded coinduction one has been
proposed. We first present how Agda supports inductive and coinductive types
highlighting the fact that data structures and predicates are defined using the
same constructs. Then we move to the main topic of this thesis, which is
investigating how generalized inference systems can be implemented and how
their correctness can be proved.

Title: Satisfiability and Query Answering in Description Logics with Global and
  Local Cardinality Constraints
Authors: Franz Baader, Bartosz Bednarczyk and Sebastian Rudolph
Categories: cs.LO cs.AI
Comments: Technical report for the paper of the same title accepted to ECAI
  2020
\\
  We introduce and investigate the expressive description logic (DL) ALCSCC++,
in which the global and local cardinality constraints introduced in previous
papers can be mixed. On the one hand, we prove that this does not increase the
complexity of satisfiability checking and other standard inference problems. On
the other hand, the satisfiability problem becomes undecidable if inverse roles
are added to the languages. In addition, even without inverse roles,
conjunctive query entailment in this DL turns out to be undecidable. We prove
that decidability of querying can be regained if global and local constraints
are not mixed and the global constraints are appropriately restricted. The
latter result is based on a locally-acyclic model construction, and it reduces
query entailment to ABox consistency in the restricted setting, i.e., to ABox
consistency w.r.t. restricted cardinality constraints in ALCSCC, for which we
can show an ExpTime upper bound.

\\
  This paper presents a model where thermo-hydro-mechanical processes are
coupled to a deformation model for preexisting fractures. The model is
formulated within a discrete-fracture-matrix framework where the rock matrix
and the fractures are considered as individual subdomains, and interaction
between them takes place on the matrix-fracture interfaces. A finite volume
discretisation implemented in the simulation toolbox PorePy is presented and
applied in a simulation showcasing the effects of the different mechanisms on
fracture deformation governed by contact mechanics, as well as their different
timescales.

Title: Active set expansion strategies in MPRGP algorithm
Authors: J. Kruzik, D. Horak, M. Cermak, L. Pospisil, M. Pecha
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.OC
\\
  The paper investigates strategies for expansion of active set that can be
employed by the MPRGP algorithm. The standard MPRGP expansion uses a projected
line search in the free gradient direction with a fixed step length. Such a
scheme is often too slow to identify the active set, requiring a large number
of expansions. We propose to use adaptive step lengths based on the current
gradient, which guarantees the decrease of the unconstrained cost function with
different gradient-based search directions. Moreover, we also propose expanding
the active set by projecting the optimal step for the unconstrained
minimization. Numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits of our expansion
step modifications on two benchmarks -- contact problem of linear elasticity
solved by TFETI and machine learning problems of SVM type, both implemented in
PERMON toolbox.

Title: HDG and CG methods for the Indefinite Time-Harmonic Maxwell's Equations
  under minimal regularity
Authors: Gang Chen, Peter Monk, Yangwen Zhang
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We propose to use a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method combined
with the continuous Galerkin (CG) method to approximate Maxwell's equations. We
make two contributions in this paper. First, even though there are many papers
using HDG methods to approximate Maxwell's equations, to our knowledge they all
assume that the coefficients are smooth (or constant). Here, we derive optimal
convergence estimates for our HGD-CG approximation when the electromagnetic
coefficients are {\em piecewise} smooth. This requires new techniques of
analysis. Second, we use CG elements to approximate the Lagrange multiplier
used to enforce the divergence condition and we obtain a discrete system in
which we can decouple the discrete the Lagrange multiplier. Because we are
using a continuous Lagrange multiplier space, the number of degrees of freedom
devoted to this are less than for other HDG methods. We present numerical
experiments to confirm our theoretical results.

Title: Improving accuracy of the fifth-order WENO scheme by using the
  exponential approximation space
Authors: Youngsoo Ha, Chang Ho Kim, Hyoseon Yang and Jungho Yoon
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  The aim of this study is to develop a novel WENO scheme that improves the
performance of the well-known fifth-order WENO methods. The approximation space
consists of exponential polynomials with a tension parameter that may be
optimized to fit the the specific feature of the data, yielding better results
compared to the polynomial approximation space. However, finding an optimal
tension parameter is a very important and difficult problem, indeed a topic of
active research. In this regard, this study introduces a practical approach to
determine an optimal tension parameter by taking into account the relationship
between the tension parameter and the accuracy of the exponential polynomial
interpolation under the setting of the fifth-order WENO scheme. As a result,
the proposed WENO scheme attains an improved order of accuracy (that is,
sixth-order) better than other fifth-order WENO methods without loss of
accuracy at critical points. A detailed analysis is provided to verify the
improved convergence rate. Further, we present modified nonlinear weights based
on $L^1$-norm approach along with a new global smoothness indicator. The
proposed nonlinear weights reduce numerical dissipation significantly, while
attaining better resolution in smooth regions. Some experimental results for
various benchmark test problems are presented to demonstrate the ability of the
new scheme.

Title: Gender Genetic Algorithm in the Dynamic Optimization Problem
Authors: P.A. Golovinski, S.A. Kolodyazhnyi
Categories: cs.NE
\\
  A general approach to optimizing fast processes using a gender genetic
algorithm is described. Its difference from the more traditional genetic
algorithm it contains division the artificial population into two sexes. Male
subpopulations undergo large mutations and more strong selection compared to
female individuals from another subset. This separation allows combining the
rapid adaptability of the entire population to changes due to the variation of
the male subpopulation with fixation of adaptability in the female part. The
advantage of the effect of additional individual learning in the form of
Boldwin effect in finding optimal solutions is observed in comparison with the
usual gender genetic algorithm. As a promising application of the gender
genetic algorithm with the Boldwin effect, the dynamics of extinguishing
natural fires is pointed.

\\
  Variable selection problems generally present more than a single solution
and, sometimes, it is worth to find as many solutions as possible. The use of
Evolutionary Algorithms applied to this kind of problem proves to be one of the
best methods to find optimal solutions. Moreover, there are variants designed
to find all or almost all local optima, known as Niching Genetic Algorithms
(NGA). There are several different NGA methods developed in order to achieve
this task. The present work compares the behavior of eight different niching
techniques, applied to a climatic database of four weather stations distributed
in Tucuman, Argentina. The goal is to find different sets of input variables
that have been used as the input variable by the estimation method. Final
results were evaluated based on low estimation error and low dispersion error,
as well as a high number of different results and low computational time. A
second experiment was carried out to study the capability of the method to
identify critical variables. The best results were obtained with Deterministic
Crowding. In contrast, Steady State Worst Among Most Similar and Probabilistic
Crowding showed good results but longer processing times and less ability to
determine the critical factors.

Title: Traffic Modelling and Prediction via Symbolic Regression on Road Sensor
  Data
Authors: Alina Patelli, Victoria Lush, Aniko Ekart, Elisabeth Ilie-Zudor
Categories: cs.NE cs.AI eess.SP
\\
  The continuous expansion of the urban traffic sensing infrastructure has led
to a surge in the volume of widely available road related data. Consequently,
increasing effort is being dedicated to the creation of intelligent
transportation systems, where decisions on issues ranging from city-wide road
maintenance planning to improving the commuting experience are informed by
computational models of urban traffic instead of being left entirely to humans.
The automation of traffic management has received substantial attention from
the research community, however, most approaches target highways, produce
predictions valid for a limited time window or require expensive retraining of
available models in order to accurately forecast traffic at a new location. In
this article, we propose a novel and accurate traffic flow prediction method
based on symbolic regression enhanced with a lag operator. Our approach
produces robust models suitable for the intricacies of urban roads, much more
difficult to predict than highways. Additionally, there is no need to retrain
the model for a period of up to 9 weeks. Furthermore, the proposed method
generates models that are transferable to other segments of the road network,
similar to, yet geographically distinct from the ones they were initially
trained on. We demonstrate the achievement of these claims by conducting
extensive experiments on data collected from the Darmstadt urban
infrastructure.

Title: AoI-Delay Tradeoff in Mobile Edge Caching with Freshness-Aware Content
  Refreshing
Authors: Shan Zhang, Liudi Wang, Hongbin Luo, Xiao Ma, Sheng Zhou
Categories: cs.NI cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Submitted to IEEE for possible publication
\\
  Mobile edge caching can effectively reduce service delay but may introduce
information staleness, calling for timely content refreshing. However, content
refreshing consumes additional transmission resources and may degrade the delay
performance of mobile systems. In this work, we propose a freshness-aware
refreshing scheme to balance the service delay and content freshness measured
by Age of Information (AoI). Specifically, the cached content items will be
refreshed to the up-to-date version upon user requests if the AoI exceeds a
certain threshold (named as refreshing window). The average AoI and service
delay are derived in closed forms approximately, which reveals an AoI-delay
tradeoff relationship with respect to the refreshing window. In addition, the
refreshing window is optimized to minimize the average delay while meeting the
AoI requirements, and the results indicate to set a smaller refreshing window
for the popular content items. Extensive simulations are conducted on the
OMNeT++ platform to validate the analytical results. The results indicate that
the proposed scheme can restrain frequent refreshing as the request arrival
rate increases, whereby the average delay can be reduced by around 80% while
maintaining the AoI below one second in heavily-loaded scenarios.

Title: Performance Modeling of Epidemic Routing in Mobile Social Networks with
  Emphasis on Scalability
Authors: Leila Rashidi, Amir Dalili-Yazdi, Reza Entezari-Maleki, Leonel Sousa,
  and Ali Movaghar
Categories: cs.NI cs.PF
\\
  This paper investigates the performance of epidemic routing in mobile social
networks. It first analyzes the time taken for a node to meet the first node of
a set of nodes restricted to move in a specific subarea. Afterwards, a
monolithic Stochastic Reward Net (SRN) is proposed to evaluate the delivery
delay and the average number of transmissions under epidemic routing by
considering skewed location visiting preferences. This model is not scalable
enough, in terms of the number of nodes and frequently visited locations. In
order to achieve higher scalability, the folding technique is applied to the
monolithic model, and an approximate folded SRN is proposed to evaluate
performance of epidemic routing. Discrete-event simulation is used to validate
the proposed models. Both SRN models show high accuracy in predicting the
performance of epidemic routing. We also propose an Ordinary Differential
Equation (ODE) model for epidemic routing and compare it with the folded model.
Obtained results show that the folded model is more accurate than the ODE
model. Moreover, it is proved that the number of transmissions by the time of
delivery follows uniform distribution, in a general class of networks, where
positions of nodes are always independent and identically distributed.

  Internet of things (IoT) produces massive data from devices embedded with
sensors. The IoT data allows creating profitable services using machine
learning. However, previous research does not address the problem of optimal
pricing and bundling of machine learning-based IoT services. In this paper, we
define the data value and service quality from a machine learning perspective.
We present an IoT market model which consists of data vendors selling data to
service providers, and service providers offering IoT services to customers.
Then, we introduce optimal pricing schemes for the standalone and bundled
selling of IoT services. In standalone service sales, the service provider
optimizes the size of bought data and service subscription fee to maximize its
profit. For service bundles, the subscription fee and data sizes of the grouped
IoT services are optimized to maximize the total profit of cooperative service
providers. We show that bundling IoT services maximizes the profit of service
providers compared to the standalone selling. For profit sharing of bundled
services, we apply the concepts of core and Shapley solutions from cooperative
game theory as efficient and fair allocations of payoffs among the cooperative
service providers in the bundling coalition.

\\
  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered as a promising
solution for improving the spectrum efficiency of next-generation wireless
networks. In this paper, the performance of a p-persistent slotted ALOHA system
in support of NOMA transmissions is investigated. Specifically, wireless users
can choose to use high or low power for data transmissions with certain
probabilities. To achieve the maximum network throughput, an analytical
framework is developed to analyze the successful transmission probability of
NOMA and long term average throughput of users involved in the non-orthogonal
transmissions. The feasible region of the maximum number of concurrent users
using high and low power to ensure successful NOMA transmissions are
quantified. Based on the analysis, an algorithm is proposed to find the optimal
transmission probabilities for users to choose high and low power to achieve
the maximum system throughput. In addition, the impact of power settings on the
network performance is further investigated. Simulations are conducted to
validate the analysis.

  FPGAs excel in low power and high throughput computations, but they are
challenging to program. Traditionally, developers rely on hardware description
languages like Verilog or VHDL to specify the hardware behavior at the
register-transfer level. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) raises the level of
abstraction, but still requires FPGA design knowledge. Programmers usually
write pragma-annotated C\C++ programs to define the hardware architecture of an
application. However, each hardware vendor extends its own C dialect using its
own vendor-specific set of pragmas. This prevents portability across different
vendors. Furthermore, pragmas are not first-class citizens in the language.
This makes it hard to use them in a modular way or design proper abstractions.
  In this paper, we present AnyHLS, a library to synthesize FPGA designs in a
modular and abstract way. AnyHLS resorts to standard programming language
features such as types and higher-order functions to accomplish this as
follows: First, partial evaluation specializes and optimizes the user
application based on a library of abstractions. Ultimately, the backend of
AnyHLS generates vendor-specific HLS code for Intel and Xilinx FPGAs. To
validate the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented an image processing
library on top of AnyHLS. We show that the performance of this library is on
par with or exceeds the one achieved with existing full-blown domain-specific
compilers.

Title: Functional Programming in Pattern-Match-Oriented Programming Style
Authors: Satoshi Egi (Rakuten Institute of Technology, Japan), Yuichi Nishiwaki
  (The University of Tokyo, Japan)
Categories: cs.PL
Journal-ref: The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020, Vol. 4,

\\
  Throughout the history of functional programming, recursion has emerged as a
natural method for describing loops in programs. However, there does often
exist a substantial cognitive distance between the recursive definition and the
simplest explanation of an algorithm even for the basic list processing
functions such as map, concat, or unique; when we explain these functions, we
seldom use recursion explicitly as we do in functional programming. For
example, map is often explained as follows: the map function takes a function
and a list and returns a list of the results of applying the function to all
the elements of the list.
  This paper advocates a new programming paradigm called pattern-match-oriented
programming for filling this gap. An essential ingredient of our method is
utilizing pattern matching for non-free data types. Pattern matching for
non-free data types features non-linear pattern matching with backtracking and
extensibility of pattern-matching algorithms. Several non-standard pattern
constructs, such as not-patterns, loop patterns, and sequential patterns, are
derived from this pattern-matching facility. Based on that result, this paper
introduces many programming techniques that replace explicit recursions with an
intuitive pattern by confining recursions inside patterns. We classify these
techniques as pattern-match-oriented programming design patterns.
  These programming techniques allow us to redefine not only the most basic
functions for list processing such as map, concat, or unique more elegantly
than the traditional functional programming style, but also more practical
mathematical algorithms and software such as a SAT solver, computer algebra
system, and database query language that we had not been able to implement
concisely.

classic conceptualisation of a scientific paradigm as a dominant world view,
which supersedes its predecessors through superior explanatory power.
Furthermore, it is not at all clear how programming paradigms are to be
characterised and differentiated. Indeed, on closer inspection, apparently
disparate programming paradigms are very strongly connected. Rather, they
should be viewed as different traditions of a unitary Computer Science paradigm
of Turing complete computation complemented by Computational Thinking.

Title: Generating a Generic Fluent API in Java
Authors: Tomoki Nakamaru (The University of Tokyo, Japan), Shigeru Chiba (The
  University of Tokyo, Japan)
Categories: cs.PL
Journal-ref: The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020, Vol. 4,
  Issue 3, Article 9
DOI: 10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/9
\\
  Context: The algorithms for generating a safe fluent API are actively studied
these years. A safe fluent API is the fluent API that reports incorrect
chaining of the API methods as a type error to the API users. Although such a
safe property improves the productivity of its users, the construction of a
safe fluent API is too complicated for the developers. The generation
algorithms are studied to reduce the development cost of a safe fluent API. The
study on the generation would benefit a number of programmers since a fluent
API is a popular design in the real world.
  Inquiry: The generation of a generic fluent API has been left untackled. A
generic fluent API refers to the fluent API that provides generic methods
(methods that contain type parameters in their definitions). The Stream API in
Java is an example of such a generic API. The recent research on the safe
fluent API generation rather focuses on the grammar class that the algorithm
can deal with for syntax checking. The key idea of the previous study is to use
nested generics to represent a stack structure for the parser built on top of
the type system. In that idea, the role of a type parameter was limited to
internally representing a stack element of that parser on the type system. The
library developers could not use type parameters to include a generic method in
their API so that the semantic constraints for their API would be statically
checked, for example, the type constraint on the items passed through a stream.
  Approach: We propose an algorithm to generate a generic fluent API. Our
translation algorithm is modeled as the construction of deterministic finite
automaton (DFA) with type parameter information. Each state of the DFA holds
information about which type parameters are already bound in that state. This
information is used to identify whether a method invocation in a chain newly
binds a type to a type parameter, or refers to a previously bound type. The
identification is required since a type parameter in a chain is bound at a
particular method invocation, and that bound type is referred to in the
following method invocations. Our algorithm constructs the DFA by analyzing the
binding time of type parameters and their propagation among the states in a DFA
that is naively constructed from the given grammar.
  Knowledge and Importance: Our algorithm helps library developers to develop a
generic fluent API. The ability to generate a generic fluent API is essential
to bring the safe fluent API generation to the real world since the use of type
parameters is a common technique in the library API design. By our algorithm,
the generation of a safe fluent API will be ready for practical use.
  Grounding: We implemented a generator named Protocool to demonstrate our
algorithm. We also generated several libraries using Protocool to show the
ability and the limitations of our algorithm.

Title: Bacat\'a: Notebooks for DSLs, Almost for Free
Authors: Mauricio Verano Merino (Eindhoven University of Technology,
  Netherlands), Jurgen Vinju (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica - TU Eindhoven,
  Netherlands), Tijs van der Storm (CWI - University of Groningen, Netherlands)
Categories: cs.PL
Journal-ref: The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020, Vol. 4,
  Issue 3, Article 11
DOI: 10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/11
\\
  Context: Computational notebooks are a contemporary style of literate
programming, in which users can communicate and transfer knowledge by
interleaving executable code, output, and prose in a single rich document. A
Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is an artificial software language tailored for
a particular application domain. Usually, DSL users are domain experts that may
not have a software engineering background. As a consequence, they might not be
familiar with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Thus, the development
of tools that offer different interfaces for interacting with a DSL is
relevant.
  Inquiry: However, resources available to DSL designers are limited. We would
like to leverage tools used to interact with general purpose languages in the
context of DSLs. Computational notebooks are an example of such tools. Then,
our main question is: What is an efficient and effective method of designing
and implementing notebook interfaces for DSLs? By addressing this question we
might be able to speed up the development of DSL tools, and ease the
interaction between end-users and DSLs.
  Approach: In this paper, we present Bacat\'a, a mechanism for generating
notebook interfaces for DSLs in a language parametric fashion. We designed this
mechanism in a way in which language engineers can reuse as many language
components (e.g., language processors, type checkers, code generators) as
possible.
  Knowledge: Our results show that notebook interfaces generated by Bacat\'a
can be automatically generated with little manual configuration. There are few
considerations and caveats that should be addressed by language engineers that
rely on language design aspects. The creation of a notebook for a DSL with
Bacat\'a becomes a matter of writing the code that wires existing language
components in the Rascal language workbench with the Jupyter platform.
  Grounding: We evaluate Bacat\'a by generating functional computational
notebook interfaces for three different non-trivial DSLs, namely: a small
subset of Halide (a DSL for digital image processing), SweeterJS (an extended
version of JavaScript), and QL (a DSL for questionnaires). Additionally, it is
relevant to generate notebook implementations rather than implementing them
manually. We measured and compared the number of Source Lines of Code (SLOCs)
that we reused from existing implementations of those languages.
  Importance: The adoption of notebooks by novice-programmers and end-users has
made them very popular in several domains such as exploratory programming, data
science, data journalism, and machine learning. Why are they popular? In (data)
science, it is essential to make results reproducible as well as
understandable. However, notebooks are only available for GPLs. This paper
opens up the notebook metaphor for DSLs to improve the end-user experience when
interacting with code and to increase DSLs adoption.

Title: Sub-method, partial behavioral reflection with Reflectivity: Looking
  back on 10 years of use
Authors: Steven Costiou (INRIA, France), Vincent Aranega (INRIA, France),
  Marcus Denker (INRIA, France)
Categories: cs.PL
Journal-ref: The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020, Vol. 4,
  Issue 3, Article 5
DOI: 10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/5
\\
  Context. Refining or altering existing behavior is the daily work of every
developer, but that cannot be always anticipated, and software sometimes cannot
be stopped. In such cases, unanticipated adaptation of running systems is of
interest for many scenarios, ranging from functional upgrades to on-the-fly
debugging or monitoring of critical applications.
  Inquiry. A way of altering software at run time is using behavioral
reflection, which is particularly well-suited for unanticipated adaptation of
real-world systems. Partial behavioral reflection is not a new idea, and for
years many efforts have been made to propose a practical way of expressing it.
All these efforts resulted in practical solutions, but which introduced a
semantic gap between the code that requires adaptation and the expression of
the partial behavior. For example, in Aspect-Oriented Programming, a pointcut
description is expressed in another language, which introduces a new distance
between the behavior expression (the Advice) and the source code in itself.
  Approach. Ten years ago, the idea of closing the gap between the code and the
expression of the partial behavior led to the implementation of the
Reflectivity framework. Using Reflectivity, developers annotate Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) nodes with meta-behavior which is taken into account by the compiler
to produce behavioral variations. In this paper, we present Reflectivity, its
API, its implementation and its usage in Pharo. We reflect on ten years of use
of Reflectivity, and show how it has been used as a basic building block of
many innovative ideas.
  Knowledge. Reflectivity brings a practical way of working at the AST level,
which is a high-level representation of the source code manipulated by software
developers. It enables a powerful way of dynamically add and modify behavior.
Reflectivity is also a flexible mean to bridge the gap between the expression
of the meta-behavior and the source code. This ability to apply unanticipated
adaptation and to provide behavioral reflection led to many experiments and
projects during this last decade by external users. Existing work use
Reflectivity to implement reflective libraries or languages extensions,
featherweight code instrumentation, dynamic software update, debugging tools
and visualization and software analysis tools.
  Grounding. Reflectivity is actively used in research projects. During the
past ten years, it served as a support, either for implementation or as a
fundamental base, for many research work including PhD theses, conference,
journal and workshop papers. Reflectivity is now an important library of the
Pharo language, and is integrated at the heart of the platform.
  Importance. Reflectivity exposes powerful abstractions to deal with partial
behavioral adaptation, while providing a mature framework for unanticipated,
non-intrusive and partial behavioral reflection based on AST annotation.
Furthermore, even if Reflectivity found its home inside Pharo, it is not a pure
Smalltalk-oriented solution. As validation over the practical use of
Reflectivity in dynamic object-oriented languages, the API has been ported to
Python. Finally, the AST annotation feature of Reflectivity opens new
experimentation opportunities about the control that developers could gain on
the behavior of their own software.

Title: Constructing Hybrid Incremental Compilers for Cross-Module Extensibility
  with an Internal Build System
Authors: Jeff Smits (Delft University of Technology, Netherlands), Gabri\"el
  D.P. Konat (Delft University of Technology, Netherlands), Eelco Visser (Delft
  University of Technology, Netherlands)
Categories: cs.PL
Journal-ref: The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020, Vol. 4,
  Issue 3, Article 16
DOI: 10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/16
\\
  Context: Compilation time is an important factor in the adaptability of a
software project. Fast recompilation enables cheap experimentation with changes
to a project, as those changes can be tested quickly. Separate and incremental
compilation has been a topic of interest for a long time to facilitate fast
recompilation.
  Inquiry: Despite the benefits of an incremental compiler, such compilers are
usually not the default. This is because incrementalization requires
cross-cutting, complicated, and error-prone techniques such as dependency
tracking, caching, cache invalidation, and change detection. Especially in
compilers for languages with cross-module definitions and integration,
correctly and efficiently implementing an incremental compiler can be a
challenge. Retrofitting incrementality into a compiler is even harder. We
address this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts
of an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an
incremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling
difficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging.
  Approach: We use the compiler design approach presented in this paper to
develop an incremental compiler for the Stratego term-rewriting language. This
language has a set of features that at first glance look incompatible with
incremental compilation. Therefore, we treat Stratego as our critical case to
demonstrate the approach on. We show how this approach decomposes the original
compiler and has a solution to compile Stratego incrementally. The key idea on
which we build our incremental compiler is to internally use an incremental
build system to wire together the components we extract from the original
compiler.
  Knowledge: The resulting compiler is already in use as a replacement of the
original whole-program compiler. We find that the incremental build system
inside the compiler is a crucial component of our approach. This allows a
compiler writer to think in multiple steps of compilation, and combine that
into a incremental compiler almost effortlessly. Normally, separate compilation
\`a la C is facilitated by an external build system, where the programmer is
responsible for managing dependencies between files. We reuse an existing sound
and optimal incremental build system, and integrate its dependency tracking
into the compiler.
  Grounding: The incremental compiler for Stratego is available as an artefact
along with this article. We evaluate it on a large Stratego project to test its
performance. The benchmark replays edits to the Stratego project from version
control. These benchmarks are part of the artefact, packaged as a virtual
machine image for easy reproducibility.
  Importance: Although we demonstrate our design approach on the Stratego
programming language, we also describe it generally throughout this paper. Many
currently used programming languages have a compiler that is much slower than
necessary. Our design provides an approach to change this, by reusing an
existing compiler and making it incremental within a reasonable amount of time.

Title: Implementing a Language for Distributed Systems: Choices and Experiences
  with Type Level and Macro Programming in Scala
Authors: Pascal Weisenburger (TU Darmstadt, Germany), Guido Salvaneschi (TU
  Darmstadt, Germany)

\\
  Multitier programming languages reduce the complexity of developing
distributed systems by developing the distributed system in a single coherent
code base. The compiler or the runtime separate the code for the components of
the distributed system, enabling abstraction over low level implementation
details such as data representation, serialization and network protocols. Our
ScalaLoci language allows developers to declare the different components and
their architectural relation at the type level, allowing static reasoning about
about distribution and remote communication and guaranteeing static type safety
across components. The compiler splits the multitier program into the
component-specific code and automatically generates the communication
boilerplate. Communication between components can be modeled by declaratively
specifying data flows between components using reactive programming.
  In this paper, we report on the implementation of our design and our
experience with embedding our language features into Scala as a host language.
We show how a combination of Scala's advanced type level programming and its
macro system can be used to enrich the language with new abstractions. We
comment on the challenges we encountered and the solutions we developed for our
current implementation and outline suggestions for an improved macro system to
support the such use cases of embedding of domain-specific abstractions.

\\
  Microservices architectures allow for short deployment cycles and immediate
effects but offer no safety mechanisms when service contracts need to be
changed. Maintaining the soundness of microservice architectures is an
error-prone task that is only accessible to the most disciplined development
teams. We present a microservice management system that statically verifies
service interfaces and supports the seamless evolution of compatible
interfaces. We define a compatibility relation that captures real evolution
patterns and embodies known good practices on the evolution of interfaces.
Namely, we allow for the addition, removal, and renaming of data fields of a
producer module without breaking or needing to upgrade consumer services. The
evolution of interfaces is supported by runtime generated proxy components that
dynamically adapt data exchanged between services to match with the statically
checked service code.The model was instantiated in a core language whose
semantics is defined by a labeled transition system and a type system that
prevents breaking changes from being deployed. Standard soundness results for
the core language entail the existence of adapters, hence the absence of
adaptation errors and the correctness of the management model. This adaptive
approach allows for gradual deployment of modules, without halting the whole
system and avoiding losing or misinterpreting data exchanged between system
nodes. Experimental data shows that an average of 69% of deployments that would
require adaptation and recompilation are safe under our approach.

Title: Reusing Static Analysis across Different Domain-Specific Languages using
  Reference Attribute Grammars
Authors: Johannes Mey (TU Dresden, Germany), Thomas K\"uhn (Karlsruhe Institute
  of Technology, Germany), Ren\'e Sch\"one (TU Dresden, Germany), Uwe
  A{\ss}mann (TU Dresden, Germany)
Categories: cs.PL

  Issue 3, Article 15
DOI: 10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/15
\\
  Context: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) enable domain experts to specify
tasks and problems themselves, while enabling static analysis to elucidate
issues in the modelled domain early. Although language workbenches have
simplified the design of DSLs and extensions to general purpose languages,
static analyses must still be implemented manually.
  Inquiry: Moreover, static analyses, e.g., complexity metrics, dependency
analysis, and declaration-use analysis, are usually domain-dependent and cannot
be easily reused. Therefore, transferring existing static analyses to another
DSL incurs a huge implementation overhead. However, this overhead is not always
intrinsically necessary: in many cases, while the concepts of the DSL on which
a static analysis is performed are domain-specific, the underlying algorithm
employed in the analysis is actually domain-independent and thus can be reused
in principle, depending on how it is specified. While current approaches either
implement static analyses internally or with an external Visitor, the
implementation is tied to the language's grammar and cannot be reused easily.
Thus far, a commonly used approach that achieves reusable static analysis
relies on the transformation into an intermediate representation upon which the
analysis is performed. This, however, entails a considerable additional
implementation effort.
  Approach: To remedy this, it has been proposed to map the necessary
domain-specific concepts to the algorithm's domain-independent data structures,
yet without a practical implementation and the demonstration of reuse. Thus, to
make static analysis reusable again, we employ relational Reference Attribute
Grammars (RAGs) by creating such a mapping to a domain-independent overlay
structure using higher-order attributes.
  Knowledge: We describe how static analysis can be specified on
analysis-specific data structures, how relational RAGs can help with the
specification, and how a mapping from the domain-specific language can be
performed. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a static analysis for a DSL can be
externalized and reused in another general purpose language.
  Grounding: The approach was evaluated using the RAG system JastAdd. To
illustrate reusability, we implemented two analyses with two addressed
languages each: a cycle detection analysis used in a small state machine DSL
and for detecting circular dependencies in Java types and packages, and an
analysis of variable shadowing, applied to both Java and the Modelica modelling
language. Thereby, we demonstrate the reuse of two analysis algorithms in three
completely different domains. Additionally, we use the cycle detection analysis
to evaluate the efficiency by comparing our external analysis to an internal
reference implementation analysing all Java programs in the Qualitas Corpus and
thereby are able to show that an externalized analysis incurs only minimal
overhead.
  Importance: We make static analysis reusable, again, showing the practicality
and efficiency of externalizing static analysis for both DSLs and general
purpose languages using relational RAGs.

  Developing web applications requires dealing with their distributed nature
and the natural asynchronicity of user input and network communication. For
facilitating this, different researchers have explored the combination of a
multi-tier programming language and functional reactive programming. However,
existing proposals take this approach only part of the way (some parts of the
application remain imperative) or remain naive, with no regard for avoiding
glitches across network communication, network traffic overhead, compatibility
with common APIs like XMLHttpRequest etc. In this paper, we present Gavial: the
first mature design and implementation of multi-tier FRP that allows
constructing an entire web application as a functionally reactive program. By
applying a number of new ideas, we demonstrate that multi-tier FRP can in fact
deal realistically with important practical aspects of building web
applications. At the same time, we retain the declarative nature of FRP, where
behaviors and events have an intuitive, compositional semantics and a clear
dependency structure.

  Issue 3, Article 8
DOI: 10.22152/programming-journal.org/2020/4/8
\\
  Context: A growing amount of code is written to explore and analyze data,
often by data analysts who do not have a traditional background in programming,
for example by journalists.
  Inquiry: The way such data anlysts write code is different from the way
software engineers do so. They use few abstractions, work interactively and
rely heavily on external libraries. We aim to capture this way of working and
build a programming environment that makes data exploration easier by providing
instant live feedback.
  Approach: We combine theoretical and applied approach. We present the
\emph{data exploration calculus}, a formal language that captures the structure
of code written by data analysts. We then implement a data exploration
environment that evaluates code instantly during editing and shows previews of
the results.
  Knowledge: We formally describe an algorithm for providing instant previews
for the data exploration calculus that allows the user to modify code in an
unrestricted way in a text editor. Supporting interactive editing is tricky as
any edit can change the structure of code and fully recomputing the output
would be too expensive.
  Grounding: We prove that our algorithm is correct and that it reuses previous
results when updating previews after a number of common code edit operations.
We also illustrate the practicality of our approach with an empirical
evaluation and a case study.
  Importance: As data analysis becomes an ever more important use of
programming, research on programming languages and tools needs to consider new
kinds of programming workflows appropriate for those domains and conceive new
kinds of tools that can support them. The present paper is one step in this
important direction.

Title: Did JHotDraw respect the Law of Good Style? -- An exploratory deep dive
  into the nature of false positives of bad code smells
Authors: Daniel Speicher (Bonn-Aachen International Center for Information
  Technology, B-IT, Germany)
Categories: cs.PL
Journal-ref: The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2020, Vol. 4,
  Issue 3, Article 14

\\
  Developers need to make a constant effort to improve the quality of their
code if they want to stay productive. Tools that highlight code locations that
could benefit from refactoring are thus highly desirable. The most common name
for such locations is "bad code smell". A number of tools offer such quality
feedback and there is a substantial body of related research. However, all
these tools, including those based on Machine Learning, still produce false
positives. Every single false positive shown to the developer places a
cognitive burden on her and should thus be avoided. The literature discusses
the choice of metric thresholds, the general subjectivity of such a judgment
and the relation to conscious design choices, "design ideas".
  To examine false positives and the relation between bad smells and design
ideas, we designed and conducted an exploratory case study. While previous
research presented a broad overview, we have chosen a narrow setting to reach
for even deeper insights. The framework JHotDraw had been designed so
thoughtfully that most smells may be expected to be false positives. The "Law
of Good Style", better known as the "Law of Demeter" is a rather restrictive
design rule so that we can still expected to find some potential bad smells,
i.e. violations of this "Law".
  This combination led to 1215 potential smells of which at most 70 are true
positives. We found generic as well as specific design ideas that were more
important than the smell. Our confidence in that decision ranged from high
enough to very high. We were surprised to realize that the smell definition
itself required the formulation of constructive design ideas. Finally we found
some smells to be the result of the limitation of the language and one could
introduce auxiliary constructive design ideas to compensate for them.
  The decision whether a potential smell occurrence is actually a true positive
was made very meticulously. For that purpose we took three qualities that the
smell could affect negatively into account and we discussed the result of the
recommended refactorings. If we were convinced to have found a false positive,
we described relations to design ideas.
  The realization that not only general design ideas but as well specific
design ideas have an influence on whether a potential smell is a true positive
turns the problem of false positives from a scientific problem ("What is the
true definition of the smell?") to a engineering problem ("How can we
incorporate design ideas into smell definitions?"). We recommend to add
adaptations points to the smell definitions. Higher layers may then adapt the
smell for specific contexts. After adaptation the tool may provide continuously
distinct and precise quality feedback, reducing the cognitive load for the
developer and preventing habituation. Furthermore, the schema for the
discussion of potential smells may be used to elaborate more sets of true and
false smell occurrences. Finally, it follows that smell detection based on
machine learning should take as well signs of design ideas into account.

Title: An Improved Wrist Kinematic Model for Human-Robot Interaction
Authors: Ningbo Yu, Chang Xu
Categories: cs.RO cs.HC
Comments: 8 pages, 9 figures
\\
  Human kinematics is of fundamental importance for rehabilitation and
assistive robotic systems that physically interact with human. The wrist plays
an essential role for dexterous human-robot interaction, but its conventional
kinematic model is oversimplified with intrinsic inaccuracies and its
biomechanical model is too complicated for robotic applications. In this work,
we establish an improved kinematic model of the wrist. In vivo kinematic
behavior of the wrist was investigated through noninvasive marker-less optical
tracking. Data analysis demonstrated the existence of measurable dynamic axes
in carpal rotation, justifying inevitable misalignment between the wrist and
robotic representation if using the conventional wrist model. A novel wrist
kinematic model was then proposed with rigid body transformation in fusion with
a varying prismatic term indicating the dynamic axes location. Accurate and
real-time estimation of this term has been achieved through coupled wrist
angles with nonlinear regression. The proposed model is not only accurate but
also conveniently applicable for translating anatomical behaviors into robotic

  A challenge in using fully autonomous robots in human-robot interaction (HRI)
is to design behavior that is engaging enough to encourage voluntary, long-term
interaction, yet robust to the perturbations induced by human interaction. Here
we evaluate if an intrinsically motivated, physical robot can address this
challenge. We use predictive information maximization as an intrinsic
motivation, as simulated experiments showed that this leads to playful,
exploratory behavior that is robust to changes in the robot's morphology and
environment. To the authors' knowledge there are no previous HRI studies that
evaluate the effect of intrinsically motivated behavior in robots on the human
perception of those robots. We present a game-like study design, which allows
us to focus on the interplay between the robot and the human participant. In
contrast to a study design where participants order or control a robot to do a
specific task, the robot and the human participants in our study design explore
their behaviors without knowledge about any specific goals. We conducted a
within-subjects study (N=24) were participants interacted with a fully
autonomous Sphero BB8 robot with different behavioral regimes: one realizing an
adaptive, intrinsically motivated behavior and the other being reactive, but
not adaptive. A quantitative analysis of post-interaction questionnaires showed
a significantly higher perception (r=.555, p=.007) of the dimension "Warmth"
compared to the baseline behavior. Warmth is considered a primary dimension for
social attitude formation in human cognition. A human perceived as warm (i.e.
friendly and trustworthy) experiences more positive social interactions. If
future work demonstrates that this transfers to human-robot social cognition,
then the generic methods presented here could be used to imbue robots with
behavior leading to positive perception by humans.

Title: Inner Attention Supported Adaptive Cooperation for Heterogeneous Multi
  Robots Teaming based on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Chao Huang, Rui Liu

\\
  Humans can selectively focus on different information based on different
tasks requirements, other people's abilities and availability. Therefore, they
can adapt quickly to a completely different and complex environments. If, like
people, robot could obtain the same abilities, then it would greatly increase
their adaptability to new and unexpected situations. Recent efforts in
Heterogeneous Multi Robots Teaming have try to achieve this ability, such as
the methods based on communication and multi-modal information fusion
strategies. However, these methods will not only suffer from the exponential
explosion problem with the increase of robots number but also need huge
computational resources. To that end, we introduce an inner attention
actor-critic method that replicates aspects of human flexibly cooperation. By
bringing attention mechanism on computer vision, natural language process into
the realm of multi-robot cooperation, our attention method is able to
dynamically select which robots to attend to. In order to test the
effectiveness of our proposed method, several simulation experiments have been
designed. And the results show that inner attention mechanism can enable
flexible cooperation and lower resources consuming in rescuing tasks.

Title: Sound Event Detection by Multitask Learning of Sound Events and Scenes
  with Soft Scene Labels

\\
  Sound event detection (SED) and acoustic scene classification (ASC) are major
tasks in environmental sound analysis. Considering that sound events and scenes
are closely related to each other, some works have addressed joint analyses of
sound events and acoustic scenes based on multitask learning (MTL), in which
the knowledge of sound events and scenes can help in estimating them mutually.
The conventional MTL-based methods utilize one-hot scene labels to train the
relationship between sound events and scenes; thus, the conventional methods
cannot model the extent to which sound events and scenes are related. However,
in the real environment, common sound events may occur in some acoustic scenes;
on the other hand, some sound events occur only in a limited acoustic scene. In
this paper, we thus propose a new method for SED based on MTL of SED and ASC
using the soft labels of acoustic scenes, which enable us to model the extent
to which sound events and scenes are related. Experiments conducted using TUT
Sound Events 2016/2017 and TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016 datasets show that the
proposed method improves the SED performance by 3.80% in F-score compared with
conventional MTL-based SED.

\\
  Multichannel processing is widely used for speech enhancement but several
limitations appear when trying to deploy these solutions to the real-world.
Distributed sensor arrays that consider several devices with a few microphones
is a viable alternative that allows for exploiting the multiple devices
equipped with microphones that we are using in our everyday life. In this
context, we propose to extend the distributed adaptive node-specific signal
estimation approach to a neural networks framework. At each node, a local
filtering is performed to send one signal to the other nodes where a mask is
estimated by a neural network in order to compute a global multi-channel Wiener
filter. In an array of two nodes, we show that this additional signal can be
efficiently taken into account to predict the masks and leads to better speech
enhancement performances than when the mask estimation relies only on the local
signals.

Title: Hodge and Podge: Hybrid Supervised Sound Event Detection with Multi-Hot
  MixMatch and Composition Consistence Training
Authors: Ziqiang Shi and Liu Liu and Huibin Lin and Rujie Liu
Categories: cs.SD eess.AS
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1907.07398
\\
  In this paper, we propose a method called Hodge and Podge for sound event
detection. We demonstrate Hodge and Podge on the dataset of Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2019 Challenge Task 4.
This task aims to predict the presence or absence and the onset and offset
times of sound events in home environments. Sound event detection is
challenging due to the lack of large scale real strongly labeled data. Recently
deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be effective in modeling with
weakly labeled and unlabeled data. This work explores how to extend deep SSL to
result in a new, state-of-the-art sound event detection method called Hodge and
Podge. With convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNN) as the backbone
network, first, a multi-scale squeeze-excitation mechanism is introduced and
added to generate a pyramid squeeze-excitation CRNN. The pyramid
squeeze-excitation layer can pay attention to the issue that different sound
events have different durations, and to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise
spectrogram responses. Further, in order to remedy the lack of real strongly
labeled data problem, we propose multi-hot MixMatch and composition consistency
training with temporal-frequency augmentation. Our experiments with the public
DCASE2019 challenge task 4 validation data resulted in an event-based F-score
of 43.4\%, and is about absolutely 1.6\% better than state-of-the-art methods
in the challenge. While the F-score of the official baseline is 25.8\%.

  Speaker recognition systems based on deep speaker embeddings have achieved
significant performance in controlled conditions according to the results
obtained for early NIST SRE (Speaker Recognition Evaluation) datasets. From the
practical point of view, taking into account the increased interest in virtual
assistants (such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, AppleSiri, etc.), speaker
verification on short utterances in uncontrolled noisy environment conditions
is one of the most challenging and highly demanded tasks. This paper presents
approaches aimed to achieve two goals: a) improve the quality of far-field
speaker verification systems in the presence of environmental noise,
reverberation and b) reduce the system qualitydegradation for short utterances.
For these purposes, we considered deep neural network architectures based on
TDNN (TimeDelay Neural Network) and ResNet (Residual Neural Network) blocks. We
experimented with state-of-the-art embedding extractors and their training
procedures. Obtained results confirm that ResNet architectures outperform the
standard x-vector approach in terms of speaker verification quality for both
long-duration and short-duration utterances. We also investigate the impact of
speech activity detector, different scoring models, adaptation and score
normalization techniques. The experimental results are presented for publicly
available data and verification protocols for the VoxCeleb1, VoxCeleb2, and
VOiCES datasets.

\\
  With the continuous growth of the internet market, games are becoming more
and more popular worldwide. However, increased market competition for game
demands developers to write more efficient games in terms of performance,
security, and maintenance. The continuous evolution of software systems and its
increasing complexity may result in bad design decisions. Researchers analyzed
the cognitive, behavioral and social effects of games. Also, gameplay and game
mechanics have been a research area to enhance game playing, but to the extent
of our knowledge, there hardly exists any research work that studies the bad
coding practices in game development. Hence, through our study, we try to
analyze and identify the presence of bad coding practices called code smells
that may cause quality issues in games. To accomplish this, we created a
dataset of 361 web games written in JavaScript. On this dataset, we run a
JavaScript code smell detection tool JSNose to find the occurrence and
distribution of code smell in web games. Further, we did a manual study on 9
web games to find violation of existing game programming patterns. Our results
show that existing tools are mostly language-specific and are not enough in the
context of games as they were not able to detect the anti-patterns or bad
coding practices that are game-specific, motivating the need of game-specific
code smell detection tools.

  Software testing is an essential part of the software lifecycle andrequires a
substantial amount of time and effort. It has been esti-mated that software
developers spend close to 50% of their time ontesting the code they write. For
these reasons, a long standing goalwithin the research community is to
(partially) automate softwaretesting. While several techniques and tools have
been proposedto automatically generate test methods, recent work has
criticizedthe quality and usefulness of the assert statements they
generate.Therefore, we employ a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) basedapproach
calledAtlas(AuTomaticLearning ofAssertStatements)to automatically generate
meaningful assert statements for testmethods. Given a test method and a focal
method (i.e.,the mainmethod under test),Atlascan predict a meaningful assert
state-ment to assess the correctness of the focal method. We appliedAtlasto
thousands of test methods from GitHub projects and itwas able to predict the
exact assert statement manually writtenby developers in 31% of the cases when
only considering the top-1 predicted assert. When considering the top-5
predicted assertstatements,Atlasis able to predict exact matches in 50% of
thecases. These promising results hint to the potential usefulness ofour
approach as (i) a complement to automatic test case generationtechniques, and
(ii) a code completion support for developers, whocan benefit from the
recommended assert statements while writingtest code.

  Much work on social media opinion polarization focuses on identifying
separate or orthogonal beliefs from media traces, thereby missing points of
agreement among different communities. This paper develops a new class of
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms that allow identification of
both agreement and disagreement points when beliefs of different communities
partially overlap. Specifically, we propose a novel Belief Structured Matrix
Factorization algorithm (BSMF) to identify partially overlapping beliefs in
polarized public social media. BSMF is totally unsupervised and considers three
types of information: (i) who posted which opinion, (ii) keyword-level message
similarity, and (iii) empirically observed social dependency graphs (e.g.,
retweet graphs), to improve belief separation. In the space of unsupervised
belief separation algorithms, the emphasis was mostly given to the problem of
identifying disjoint (e.g., conflicting) beliefs. The case when individuals
with different beliefs agree on some subset of points was less explored. We
observe that social beliefs overlap even in polarized scenarios. Our proposed
unsupervised algorithm captures both the latent belief intersections and
dissimilarities. We discuss the properties of the algorithm and conduct
extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets. The
results show that our model outperforms all compared baselines by a great
margin.

Title: Fairness through Experimentation: Inequality in A/B testing as an
  approach to responsible design
Authors: Guillaume Saint-Jacques, Amir Sepehri, Nicole Li, Igor Perisic
Categories: cs.SI econ.EM
\\
  As technology continues to advance, there is increasing concern about
individuals being left behind. Many businesses are striving to adopt
responsible design practices and avoid any unintended consequences of their
products and services, ranging from privacy vulnerabilities to algorithmic
bias. We propose a novel approach to fairness and inclusiveness based on
experimentation. We use experimentation because we want to assess not only the
intrinsic properties of products and algorithms but also their impact on
people. We do this by introducing an inequality approach to A/B testing,
leveraging the Atkinson index from the economics literature. We show how to
perform causal inference over this inequality measure. We also introduce the
concept of site-wide inequality impact, which captures the inclusiveness impact
of targeting specific subpopulations for experiments, and show how to conduct
statistical inference on this impact. We provide real examples from LinkedIn,
as well as an open-source, highly scalable implementation of the computation of
the Atkinson index and its variance in Spark/Scala. We also provide over a
year's worth of learnings -- gathered by deploying our method at scale and
analyzing thousands of experiments -- on which areas and which kinds of product
innovations seem to inherently foster fairness through inclusiveness.

Title: Diffusion and Consensus in a Weakly Coupled Network of Networks

Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We study diffusion and consensus dynamics in a Network of Networks model. In
this model, there is a collection of sub-networks, connected to one another
using a small number of links. We consider a setting where the links between
networks have small weights, or are used less frequently than links within each
sub-network. Using spectral perturbation theory, we analyze the diffusion rate
and convergence rate of the investigated systems. Our analysis shows that the
first order approximation of the diffusion and convergence rates is independent
of the topologies of the individual graphs; the rates depend only on the number
of nodes in each graph and the topology of the connecting edges. The second
order analysis shows a relationship between the diffusion and convergence rates
and the information centrality of the connecting nodes within each sub-network.
We further highlight these theoretical results through numerical examples.

Title: Providing a Link Prediction Model based on Structural and Homophily
  Similarity in Social Networks
Authors: Alireza Eshaghpour, Mostafa Salehi, Vahid Ranjbar
Categories: cs.SI
Comments: in Farsi. Quarterly Journal Signal and Data Processing (JSDP), 2020
\\
  In recent years, with the growing number of online social networks, these
networks have become one of the best markets for advertising and commerce, so
studying these networks is very important. Forecasting new edges in online
social networks can give us a better understanding of the growth of these
networks. There have been many studies of link prediction in the field of
engineering and humanities. Scientists attribute the existence of a new
relationship between two individuals for two reasons: 1) Proximity to the graph
(structure) 2) Similar properties of the two individuals (Homophile law).
However, studying the impact of the two approaches working together to create
new edges remains an open problem. Similarity metrics can also be divided into
two categories; Neighborhood-based and path-based. So far, the above two
theoretical approaches (proximity and homophile) have not been found together
in the neighborhood-based metrics. In this paper, we first attempt to provide a
solution to determine importance of the proximity to the graph and similar
features in the connectivity of the graphs. Then obtained weights are assigned
to both proximity and homophile. Then the best similarity metric in each
approach are obtained. Finally, the selected metric of homophily similarity and
structural similarity are combined with the obtained weights. The results of
this study were evaluated on two datasets; Zanjan University Graduate School of
Social Sciences and Pokec online Social Network. The first data set was
collected for this study and then the questionnaires and data collection
methods were filled out. Since this dataset is one of the few Iranian datasets
that has been compiled with its users' specifications, it can be of great
value. In this paper, we have been able to increase the accuracy of
Neighborhood-based similarity metric by using two proximity in graph and
homophily approaches.

Title: Risk Sensitive Rendezvous Algorithm for Heterogeneous Agents in Urban
  Environments
Authors: Gabriel Barsi Haberfeld and Aditya Gahlawat and Naira Hovakimyan
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Demand for fast and inexpensive parcel deliveries in urban environments has
risen considerably in recent years. A framework is envisioned to enforce
efficient last mile delivery in urban environments by leveraging a network of
ride-sharing vehicles, where Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) drop packages on
said vehicles which then cover the majority of the distance to finally be
picked up by another UAS for delivery. This approach presents many engineering
challenges, including the safe rendezvous of both agents: the UAS and the
human-operated ground vehicle. In this paper, we introduce a framework to
minimize the risk of failure, while allowing for optimal usage of the
controlled agent. We formulate a compact fast planner to drive a UAS to a
passive ground vehicle with inexact behavior, while providing intuitive and
meaningful procedures to guarantee safety with minimal sacrifice of optimality.
The resulting algorithm is shown to be fast and implementable in real-time via
numerical tests.

Title: Optimal Freewheeling Control of a Heavy-Duty Vehicle Using Mixed Integer
  Quadratic Programming
Authors: Manne Held and Oscar Fl\"ardh and Fredrik Roos and Jonas
  M{\aa}rtensson
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Submitted to IFAC World Congress 2020
\\
  Improving the powertrain control of heavy-duty vehicles can be an efficient
way to reduce the fuel consumption and thereby reduce both the operating cost
and the environmental impact. One way of doing so is by using information about
the upcoming driving conditions, known as look-ahead information, in order to
coast with a gear engaged or to use freewheeling. Controllers using such
techniques today mainly exist for vehicles in highway driving. This paper
therefore targets how such control can be applied to vehicles with more
variations in their velocity, such as distribution vehicles. The driving
mission of such a vehicle is here formulated as an optimal control problem. The
control variables are the tractive force, the braking force, and a Boolean
variable representing closed or open powertrain. The problem is solved by a
Model Predictive Controller, which at each iteration solves a Mixed Integer
Quadratic Program. The fuel consumption is compared for four different control
policies: a benchmark following the reference of the driving cycle, look-ahead
control without freewheeling, freewheeling with the engine idling, and
freewheeling with the engine turned off. Simulations on a driving cycle
typically used for testing distribution vehicles show the potential of saving
10%, 16%, and 20\% respectively for the control policies compared with the
benchmark, in all cases without increasing the trip time.

Title: Resource-Aware Control via Dynamic Pricing for Congestion Game with
  Finite-Time Guarantees
Authors: Ezra Tampubolon and Haris Ceribasic and Holger Boche
Categories: eess.SY cs.GT cs.MA cs.SY
\\
  Congestion game is a widely used model for modern networked applications. A
central issue in such applications is that the selfish behavior of the
participants may result in resource overloading and negative externalities for
the system participants. In this work, we propose a pricing mechanism that
guarantees the sub-linear increase of the time-cumulative violation of the
resource load constraints. The feature of our method is that it is
resource-centric in the sense that it depends on the congestion state of the
resources and not on specific characteristics of the system participants. This
feature makes our mechanism scalable, flexible, and privacy-preserving.
Moreover, we show by numerical simulations that our pricing mechanism has no
significant effect on the agents' welfare in contrast to the improvement of the
capacity violation.

Title: A low cost small reconfigurable autonomous vehicle for research, testing

Authors: Walter Grotz and Santiago Moreno Gelabert and Emanuel Trabes and

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  We present a small autonomous vehicle, with the purpose of aiding teachers
and researchers to easily deploy different approaches to guidance, control and
positioning systems, without the hassle to develop the entire modules required
for such endeavor. The design was mainly guided to accomplish a very small
cost, along with easy accessibility of the parts used. One of the main problems
of using low cost parts is the difficulty of modeling its dynamics, mainly
because they lack proper documentation and also because the time varying nature
of its characteristics, due to degradation caused by usage. At the same time,
any change made to the physical design of the vehicle must be reflected in the
mathematical model. We develop a methodology for easy reconfiguration of the
vehicle, being able to obtain detailed dynamic mathematical models of the
system, as well as a the statistical models needed when implementing stochastic
methods such as Kalman Filtering. Baseline example implementations of guidance,
control and positioning systems are provided. The hole system is autonomous and
self-contained and was tested in a low cost embedded system.

  Text-based representations of chemicals and proteins can be thought of as
unstructured languages codified by humans to describe domain-specific
knowledge. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) methodologies in the
processing of spoken languages accelerated the application of NLP to elucidate
hidden knowledge in textual representations of these biochemical entities and
then use it to construct models to predict molecular properties or to design
novel molecules. This review outlines the impact made by these advances on drug
discovery and aims to further the dialogue between medicinal chemists and
computer scientists.

Title: Unsupervised Speaker Adaptation using Attention-based Speaker Memory for
  End-to-End ASR
Authors: Leda Sar{\i}, Niko Moritz, Takaaki Hori, Jonathan Le Roux
Categories: eess.AS cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD
Comments: To appear in Proc. ICASSP 2020
\\
  We propose an unsupervised speaker adaptation method inspired by the neural
Turing machine for end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR). The
proposed model contains a memory block that holds speaker i-vectors extracted
from the training data and reads relevant i-vectors from the memory through an
attention mechanism. The resulting memory vector (M-vector) is concatenated to
the acoustic features or to the hidden layer activations of an E2E neural
network model. The E2E ASR system is based on the joint connectionist temporal
classification and attention-based encoder-decoder architecture. M-vector and
i-vector results are compared for inserting them at different layers of the
encoder neural network using the WSJ and TED-LIUM2 ASR benchmarks. We show that
M-vectors, which do not require an auxiliary speaker embedding extraction
system at test time, achieve similar word error rates (WERs) compared to
i-vectors for single speaker utterances and significantly lower WERs for
utterances in which there are speaker changes.

Title: ACEnet: Anatomical Context-Encoding Network for Neuroanatomy
  Segmentation
Authors: Yuemeng Li, Hongming Li, Yong Fan

Comments: Submitted manuscript to TMI
\\
  Segmentation of brain structures from magnetic resonance (MR) scans plays an
important role in the quantification of brain morphology. Since 3D deep
learning models suffer from high computational cost, 2D deep learning methods
are favored for their computational efficiency. However, existing 2D deep
learning methods are not equipped to effectively capture 3D spatial contextual
information that is needed to achieve accurate brain structure segmentation. In
order to overcome this limitation, we develop an Anatomical Context-Encoding
Network (ACEnet) to incorporate 3D spatial and anatomical contexts in 2D
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for efficient and accurate segmentation of
brain structures from MR scans, consisting of 1) an anatomical context encoding
module to incorporate anatomical information in 2D CNNs, 2) a spatial context
encoding module to integrate 3D image information in 2D CNNs, and 3) a skull
stripping module to guide 2D CNNs to attend to the brain. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art alternative methods for brain structure segmentation in terms
of both computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy.

Title: Remove Appearance Shift for Ultrasound Image Segmentation via Fast and

\\
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) suffer from the performance degradation when
image appearance shift occurs, especially in ultrasound (US) image
segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel and intuitive framework to
remove the appearance shift, and hence improve the generalization ability of
DNNs. Our work has three highlights. First, we follow the spirit of universal
style transfer to remove appearance shifts, which was not explored before for
US images. Without sacrificing image structure details, it enables the
arbitrary style-content transfer. Second, accelerated with Adaptive Instance
Normalization block, our framework achieved real-time speed required in the
clinical US scanning. Third, an efficient and effective style image selection
strategy is proposed to ensure the target-style US image and testing content US
image properly match each other. Experiments on two large US datasets
demonstrate that our methods are superior to state-of-the-art methods on making
DNNs robust against various appearance shifts.

Title: SemI2I: Semantically Consistent Image-to-Image Translation for Domain
  Adaptation of Remote Sensing Data
Authors: Onur Tasar, S L Happy, Yuliya Tarabalka, Pierre Alliez
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  Although convolutional neural networks have been proven to be an effective
tool to generate high quality maps from remote sensing images, their
performance significantly deteriorates when there exists a large domain shift
between training and test data. To address this issue, we propose a new data
augmentation approach that transfers the style of test data to training data
using generative adversarial networks. Our semantic segmentation framework
consists in first training a U-net from the real training data and then
fine-tuning it on the test stylized fake training data generated by the
proposed approach. Our experimental results prove that our framework
outperforms the existing domain adaptation methods.

Title: A network perspective on intermedia agenda-setting
Authors: Samuel Stern, Giacomo Livan, Robert E. Smith
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.CY cs.SI
\\
  In Communication Theory, intermedia agenda-setting refers to the influence
that different news sources may have on each other, and how this subsequently
affects the breadth of information that is presented to the public. Several
studies have attempted to quantify the impact of intermedia agenda-setting in
specific countries or contexts, but a large-scale, data-driven investigation is
still lacking. Here, we operationalise intermedia agenda-setting by putting
forward a methodology to infer networks of influence between different news
sources on a given topic, and apply it on a large dataset of news articles
published by globally and locally prominent news organisations in 2016. We find
influence to be significantly topic-dependent, with the same news sources
acting as agenda-setters (i.e., central nodes) with respect to certain topics
and as followers (i.e., peripheral nodes) with respect to others. At the same
time, we find that the influence networks associated to most topics exhibit
small world properties, which we find to play a significant role towards the
overall diversity of sentiment expressed about the topic by the news sources in
the network. In particular, we find clustering and density of influence
networks to act as competing forces in this respect, with the former increasing
and the latter reducing diversity.

Title: Relationship of $k$-Bend and Monotonic $\ell$-Bend Edge Intersection
  Graphs of Paths on a Grid
Authors: Eranda Cela and Elisabeth Gaar
Categories: math.CO cs.DM
MSC-class: 05C62
\\
  If a graph $G$ can be represented by means of paths on a grid, such that each
vertex of $G$ corresponds to one path on the grid and two vertices of $G$ are
adjacent if and only if the corresponding paths share a grid edge, then this
graph is called EPG and the representation is called EPG representation. A
$k$-bend EPG representation is an EPG representation in which each path has at
most $k$ bends. The class of all graphs that have a $k$-bend EPG representation
is denoted by $B_k$. $B_\ell^m$ is the class of all graphs that have a
monotonic (each path is ascending in both columns and rows) $\ell$-bend EPG
representation.
  It is known that $B_k^m \subsetneqq B_k$ holds for $k=1$. We prove that
$B_k^m \subsetneqq B_k$ holds also for $k \in \{2, 3, 5\}$ and for $k \geqslant
7$ by investigating the $B_k$-membership and $B_k^m$-membership of complete
bipartite graphs. In particular we derive necessary conditions for this
membership that have to be fulfilled by $m$, $n$ and $k$, where $m$ and $n$ are
the number of vertices on the two partition classes of the bipartite graph. We
conjecture that $B_{k}^{m} \subsetneqq B_{k}$ holds also for $k\in \{4,6\}$.
  Furthermore we show that $B_k \not\subseteq B_{2k-9}^m$ holds for all
$k\geqslant 5$. This implies that restricting the shape of the paths can lead
to a significant increase of the number of bends needed in an EPG
representation. So far no bounds on the amount of that increase were known. We
prove that $B_1 \subseteq B_3^m$ holds, providing the first result of this
kind.

Title: Abstract rewriting internalized
Authors: Maxime Lucas
Categories: math.CT cs.DM
Comments: 14 pages
MSC-class: 18D35
\\
  In traditional rewriting theory, one studies a set of terms up to a set of
rewriting relations. In algebraic rewriting, one instead studies a vector space
of terms, up to a vector space of relations. Strikingly, although both theories
are very similar, most results (such as Newman's Lemma) require different
proofs in these two settings. In this paper, we develop rewriting theory
internally to a category $\mathcal C$ satisfying some mild properties. In this
general setting, we define the notions of termination, local confluence and
confluence using the notion of reduction strategy, and prove an analogue of
Newman's Lemma. In the case of $\mathcal C= \operatorname{Set}$ or $\mathcal C
= \operatorname{Vect}$ we recover classical results of abstract and algebraic
rewriting in a slightly more general form, closer to von Oostrom's notion of
decreasing diagrams.

Title: Minimax Theorem for Latent Games or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying
  about Mixed-Nash and Love Neural Nets
Authors: Gauthier Gidel, David Balduzzi, Wojciech Marian Czarnecki, Marta
  Garnelo and Yoram Bachrach
Categories: stat.ML cs.GT cs.LG
Comments: 15 pages
\\
  Adversarial training, a special case of multi-objective optimization, is an
increasingly useful tool in machine learning. For example, two-player zero-sum
games are important for generative modeling (GANs) and for mastering games like
Go or Poker via self-play. A classic result in Game Theory states that one must
mix strategies, as pure equilibria may not exist. Surprisingly, machine
learning practitioners typically train a \emph{single} pair of agents --
instead of a pair of mixtures -- going against Nash's principle. Our main
contribution is a notion of limited-capacity-equilibrium for which, as capacity
grows, optimal agents -- not mixtures -- can learn increasingly expressive and
realistic behaviors. We define \emph{latent games}, a new class of game where
agents are mappings that transform latent distributions. Examples include
generators in GANs, which transform Gaussian noise into distributions on
images, and StarCraft II agents, which transform sampled build orders into
policies. We show that minimax equilibria in latent games can be approximated
by a \emph{single} pair of dense neural networks. Finally, we apply our latent
game approach to solve differentiable Blotto, a game with an infinite strategy
space.

Title: Optimal estimation of high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures
Authors: Natalie Doss and Yihong Wu and Pengkun Yang and Harrison H. Zhou
Categories: math.ST cs.IT math.IT stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  This paper studies the optimal rate of estimation in a finite Gaussian
location mixture model in high dimensions without separation conditions. We
assume that the number of components $k$ is bounded and that the centers lie in
a ball of bounded radius, while allowing the dimension $d$ to be as large as
the sample size $n$. Extending the one-dimensional result of Heinrich and Kahn
\cite{HK2015}, we show that the minimax rate of estimating the mixing
distribution in Wasserstein distance is $\Theta((d/n)^{1/4} + n^{-1/(4k-2)})$,
achieved by an estimator computable in time $O(nd^2+n^{5/4})$. Furthermore, we
show that the mixture density can be estimated at the optimal parametric rate
$\Theta(\sqrt{d/n})$ in Hellinger distance; however, no computationally
efficient algorithm is known to achieve the optimal rate.
  Both the theoretical and methodological development rely on a careful
application of the method of moments. Central to our results is the observation
that the information geometry of finite Gaussian mixtures is characterized by
the moment tensors of the mixing distribution, whose low-rank structure can be
exploited to obtain a sharp local entropy bound.

Title: A Low-Complexity Framework for Joint User Pairing and Power Control for
  Cooperative NOMA in 5G and Beyond Cellular Networks
Authors: Phuc Dinh, Mohamed Amine Arfaoui, Sanaa Sharafeddine, Chadi Assi, Ali
  Ghrayeb
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  This paper investigates the performance of cooperative non-orthogonal
multiple access (C-NOMA) in a cellular downlink system. The system model
consists of a base station (BS) serving multiple users, where users with good
channel quality can assist the transmissions between the BS and users with poor
channel quality through either half-duplex (HD) or full-duplex (FD)
device-to-device (D2D) communications. We formulate and solve a novel
optimization problem that jointly determines the optimal D2D user pairing and
the optimal power control scheme, where the objective is maximizing the
achievable sum rate of the whole system while guaranteeing a certain quality of
service (QoS) for all users. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer
non-linear program (MINLP) which is generally NPhard. To overcome this issue,
we reconstruct the original problem into a bi-level optimization problem that
can be decomposed into two sub-problems to be solved independently. The outer
problem is a linear assignment problem which can be efficiently handled by the
well-known Hungarian method. The inner problem is still a non-convex
optimization problem for which finding the optimal solution is challenging.
However, we derive the optimal power control policies for both the HD and the
FD schemes in closedform expressions, which makes the computational complexity
of the inner problems polynomial for every possible pairing configurations.
These findings solve ultimately the original MILNP in a timely manner that
makes it suitable for real-time and low latency applications. Our simulation
results show that the proposed framework outperforms a variety of proposed
schemes in the literature and that it can obtain the optimal pairing and power
control policies for a network with 100 users in a negligible computational
time.

Title: A Unifying Network Architecture for Semi-Structured Deep Distributional
  Learning
Authors: David R\"ugamer, Chris Kolb, Nadja Klein
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME
\\
  We propose a unifying network architecture for deep distributional learning
in which entire distributions can be learned in a general framework of
interpretable regression models and deep neural networks. Previous approaches
that try to combine advanced statistical models and deep neural networks embed
the neural network part as a predictor in an additive regression model. In
contrast, our approach estimates the statistical model part within a unifying
neural network by projecting the deep learning model part into the orthogonal
complement of the regression model predictor. This facilitates both estimation
and interpretability in high-dimensional settings. We identify appropriate
default penalties that can also be treated as prior distribution assumptions in
the Bayesian version of our network architecture. We consider several use-cases
in experiments with synthetic data and real world applications to demonstrate
the full efficacy of our approach.

Title: Reinforcement-Learning based Portfolio Management with Augmented Asset
  Movement Prediction States
Authors: Yunan Ye, Hengzhi Pei, Boxin Wang, Pin-Yu Chen, Yada Zhu, Jun Xiao, Bo

Categories: q-fin.PM cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  Portfolio management (PM) is a fundamental financial planning task that aims
to achieve investment goals such as maximal profits or minimal risks. Its
decision process involves continuous derivation of valuable information from
various data sources and sequential decision optimization, which is a
prospective research direction for reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper,
we propose SARL, a novel State-Augmented RL framework for PM. Our framework
aims to address two unique challenges in financial PM: (1) data heterogeneity
-- the collected information for each asset is usually diverse, noisy and
imbalanced (e.g., news articles); and (2) environment uncertainty -- the
financial market is versatile and non-stationary. To incorporate heterogeneous
data and enhance robustness against environment uncertainty, our SARL augments
the asset information with their price movement prediction as additional
states, where the prediction can be solely based on financial data (e.g., asset
prices) or derived from alternative sources such as news. Experiments on two
real-world datasets, (i) Bitcoin market and (ii) HighTech stock market with
7-year Reuters news articles, validate the effectiveness of SARL over existing
PM approaches, both in terms of accumulated profits and risk-adjusted profits.
Moreover, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the importance of
our proposed state augmentation, providing new insights and boosting
performance significantly over standard RL-based PM method and other baselines.

Title: Improving S&P stock prediction with time series stock similarity

models. We tested five different similarities functions and found
co-integration similarity to have the best improvement on the prediction model.
We evaluate the models on seven S&P stocks from various industries over five
years period. The prediction model we trained on similar stocks had
significantly better results with 0.55 mean accuracy, and 19.782 profit compare
to the state of the art model with an accuracy of 0.52 and profit of 6.6.

\\
  Computational intelligence in finance has been a very popular topic for both
academia and financial industry in the last few decades. Numerous studies have
been published resulting in various models. Meanwhile, within the Machine
Learning (ML) field, Deep Learning (DL) started getting a lot of attention
recently, mostly due to its outperformance over the classical models. Lots of
different implementations of DL exist today, and the broad interest is
continuing. Finance is one particular area where DL models started getting
traction, however, the playfield is wide open, a lot of research opportunities
still exist. In this paper, we tried to provide a state-of-the-art snapshot of
the developed DL models for financial applications, as of today. We not only
categorized the works according to their intended subfield in finance but also
analyzed them based on their DL models. In addition, we also aimed at
identifying possible future implementations and highlighted the pathway for the
ongoing research within the field.

Title: Gaussian process imputation of multiple financial series
Authors: Taco de Wolff, Alejandro Cuevas, Felipe Tobar
Categories: q-fin.ST cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML
Comments: Accepted at IEEE ICASSP 2020
\\
  In Financial Signal Processing, multiple time series such as financial
indicators, stock prices and exchange rates are strongly coupled due to their
dependence on the latent state of the market and therefore they are required to
be jointly analysed. We focus on learning the relationships among financial
time series by modelling them through a multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP)
with expressive covariance functions. Learning these market dependencies among
financial series is crucial for the imputation and prediction of financial
observations. The proposed model is validated experimentally on two real-world
financial datasets for which their correlations across channels are analysed.
We compare our model against other MOGPs and the independent Gaussian process
on real financial data.

\\
  This paper investigates a self-adaptation method for speech enhancement using
auxiliary speaker-aware features; we extract a speaker representation used for
adaptation directly from the test utterance. Conventional studies of deep
neural network (DNN)--based speech enhancement mainly focus on building a
speaker independent model. Meanwhile, in speech applications including speech
recognition and synthesis, it is known that model adaptation to the target
speaker improves the accuracy. Our research question is whether a DNN for
speech enhancement can be adopted to unknown speakers without any auxiliary
guidance signal in test-phase. To achieve this, we adopt multi-task learning of
speech enhancement and speaker identification, and use the output of the final
hidden layer of speaker identification branch as an auxiliary feature. In
addition, we use multi-head self-attention for capturing long-term dependencies
in the speech and noise. Experimental results on a public dataset show that our
strategy achieves the state-of-the-art performance and also outperform
conventional methods in terms of subjective quality.

\\
  Improving subjective sound quality of enhanced signals is one of the most
important missions in speech enhancement. For evaluating the subjective
quality, several methods related to perceptually-motivated objective sound
quality assessment (OSQA) have been proposed such as PESQ (perceptual
evaluation of speech quality). However, direct use of such measures for
training deep neural network (DNN) is not allowed in most cases because popular
OSQAs are non-differentiable with respect to DNN parameters. Therefore, the
previous study has proposed to approximate the score of OSQAs by an auxiliary
DNN so that its gradient can be used for training the primary DNN. One problem
with this approach is instability of the training caused by the approximation
error of the score. To overcome this problem, we propose to use stabilization
techniques borrowed from reinforcement learning. The experiments, aimed to
increase the score of PESQ as an example, show that the proposed method (i) can
stably train a DNN to increase PESQ, (ii) achieved the state-of-the-art PESQ
score on a public dataset, and (iii) resulted in better sound quality than
conventional methods based on subjective evaluation.

  An isolated system of interacting quantum particles is described by a
Hamiltonian operator. Hamiltonian models underpin the study and analysis of
physical and chemical processes throughout science and industry, so it is
crucial they are faithful to the system they represent. However, formulating
and testing Hamiltonian models of quantum systems from experimental data is
difficult because it is impossible to directly observe which interactions the
quantum system is subject to. Here, we propose and demonstrate an approach to
retrieving a Hamiltonian model from experiments, using unsupervised machine
learning. We test our methods experimentally on an electron spin in a
nitrogen-vacancy interacting with its spin bath environment, and numerically,
finding success rates up to 86%. By building agents capable of learning
science, which recover meaningful representations, we can gain further insight
on the physics of quantum systems.

Authors: Kai Yang, Svetlana Roudenko, Yanxiang Zhao
Categories: math.AP cs.NA math.NA
\\
  We study stable blow-up dynamics in the generalized Hartree equation with
radial symmetry, a Schr\"odinger-type equation with a nonlocal,
convolution-type nonlinearity: $iu_t+\Delta u +\left(|x|^{-(d-2)} \ast |u|^{p}
\right) |u|^{p-2}u = 0, x \in \mathbb{R}^d$. First, we consider the
$L^2$-critical case in dimensions d=3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and obtain that a generic
blow-up has a self-similar structure and exhibits not only the square root
blowup rate but also the log-log correction (via asymptotic analysis and
functional fitting). In this setting we also study blow-up profiles and show
that generic blow-up solutions converge to the rescaled $Q$, a ground state
solution of the elliptic equation $-\Delta Q+Q- \left(|x|^{-(d-2)} \ast |Q|^p
\right) |Q|^{p-2} Q =0$.
  We also consider the $L^2$-supercritical case in dimensions d=3,4. We derive
the profile equation for the self-similar blow-up and establish the existence
and local uniqueness of its solutions. As in the NLS $L^2$-supercritical
regime, the profile equation exhibits branches of non-oscillating, polynomially
decaying (multi-bump) solutions. A numerical scheme of putting constraints into
solving the corresponding ODE is applied during the process of finding the
multi-bump solutions. Direct numerical simulation of solutions to the
generalized Hartree equation by the dynamic rescaling method indicates that the
$Q_{1,0}$ is the profile for the stable blow-up. In this supercritical case, we
obtain the blow-up rate without any correction. This blow-up happens at the
focusing level $10^{-5}$, and thus, numerically observable (unlike the
$L^2$-critical case).
  In summary, we find that the results are similar to the behavior of stable
blowup dynamics in the corresponding NLS settings. Consequently, one may expect
that the form of the nonlinearity in the Schr\"odinger-type equations is not
essential in stable blow-up.

Title: A kinetic traffic network model and its macroscopic limit: merging lanes
Authors: Raul Borsche and Axel Klar
Categories: math.AP cs.NA math.NA
MSC-class: 35LXX, 35L6X
\\
  In this paper we propose coupling conditions for a kinetic two velocity model
for vehicular traffic on networks. These conditions are based on the
consideration of the free space on the respective roads. The macroscopic limit
of the kinetic relaxation system is a classical scalar conservation law for
traffic flow. Similar to the asymptotic limit of boundary value problems for
kinetic models, we consider here the limit of the full network problem
including the coupling conditions at the nodes. An asymptotic analysis of the
interface layers at the nodes and a matching procedure using half-Riemann
problems for the limit conservation law are used to derive coupling conditions
for classical macroscopic traffic models on the network from the kinetic ones.

Title: Approximation Bounds for Random Neural Networks and Reservoir Systems
Authors: Lukas Gonon, Lyudmila Grigoryeva, and Juan-Pablo Ortega
Categories: math.PR cs.NE cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 44 pages
\\
  This work studies approximation based on single-hidden-layer feedforward and
recurrent neural networks with randomly generated internal weights. These
methods, in which only the last layer of weights and a few hyperparameters are
optimized, have been successfully applied in a wide range of static and dynamic
learning problems. Despite the popularity of this approach in empirical tasks,
important theoretical questions regarding the relation between the unknown
function, the weight distribution, and the approximation rate have remained
open. In this work it is proved that, as long as the unknown function,
functional, or dynamical system is sufficiently regular, it is possible to draw
the internal weights of the random (recurrent) neural network from a generic
distribution (not depending on the unknown object) and quantify the error in
terms of the number of neurons and the hyperparameters. In particular, this
proves that echo state networks with randomly generated weights are capable of
approximating a wide class of dynamical systems arbitrarily well and thus
provides the first mathematical explanation for their empirically observed
success at learning dynamical systems.

Title: Consistency-aware multi-channel speech enhancement using deep neural
  networks
Authors: Yoshiki Masuyama, Masahito Togami, Tatsuya Komatsu
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: To appear at the 45th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech,
  and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2020)
\\
  This paper proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-based multi-channel speech
enhancement system in which a DNN is trained to maximize the quality of the
enhanced time-domain signal. DNN-based multi-channel speech enhancement is
often conducted in the time-frequency (T-F) domain because spatial filtering
can be efficiently implemented in the T-F domain. In such a case, ordinary
objective functions are computed on the estimated T-F mask or spectrogram.
However, the estimated spectrogram is often inconsistent, and its amplitude and
phase may change when the spectrogram is converted back to the time-domain.
That is, the objective function does not evaluate the enhanced time-domain
signal properly. To address this problem, we propose to use an objective
function defined on the reconstructed time-domain signal. Specifically, speech
enhancement is conducted by multi-channel Wiener filtering in the T-F domain,
and its result is converted back to the time-domain. We propose two objective
functions computed on the reconstructed signal where the first one is defined
in the time-domain, and the other one is defined in the T-F domain. Our
experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system comparing to
T-F masking and mask-based beamforming.

Title: Phase reconstruction based on recurrent phase unwrapping with deep
  neural networks
Authors: Yoshiki Masuyama, Kohei Yatabe, Yuma Koizumi, Yasuhiro Oikawa, Noboru

  and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2020)
\\
  Phase reconstruction, which estimates phase from a given amplitude
spectrogram, is an active research field in acoustical signal processing with
many applications including audio synthesis. To take advantage of rich
knowledge from data, several studies presented deep neural network (DNN)--based
phase reconstruction methods. However, the training of a DNN for phase
reconstruction is not an easy task because phase is sensitive to the shift of a
waveform. To overcome this problem, we propose a DNN-based two-stage phase
reconstruction method. In the proposed method, DNNs estimate phase derivatives
instead of phase itself, which allows us to avoid the sensitivity problem.
Then, phase is recursively estimated based on the estimated derivatives, which
is named recurrent phase unwrapping (RPU). The experimental results confirm
that the proposed method outperformed the direct phase estimation by a DNN.

Title: Real-time speech enhancement using equilibriated RNN

\\
  We propose a speech enhancement method using a causal deep neural
network~(DNN) for real-time applications. DNN has been widely used for
estimating a time-frequency~(T-F) mask which enhances a speech signal. One
popular DNN structure for that is a recurrent neural network~(RNN) owing to its
capability of effectively modelling time-sequential data like speech. In
particular, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is often used to alleviate the
vanishing/exploding gradient problem which makes the training of an RNN
difficult. However, the number of parameters of LSTM is increased as the price
of mitigating the difficulty of training, which requires more computational
resources. For real-time speech enhancement, it is preferable to use a smaller
network without losing the performance. In this paper, we propose to use the
equilibriated recurrent neural network~(ERNN) for avoiding the
vanishing/exploding gradient problem without increasing the number of
parameters. The proposed structure is causal, which requires only the
information from the past, in order to apply it in real-time. Compared to the
uni- and bi-directional LSTM networks, the proposed method achieved the similar
performance with much fewer parameters.

Title: Design and Implementation of a High-Accuracy Positioning System Using
  RTK on Smartphones
Authors: Geng Shi and Ziqiang Ying and Rongtao Xu and Kan Zheng
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  In recent years, with the development of the Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS), the satellite navigation technology has played a crucial role in
smartphone navigation. To solve the problem of the low positioning accuracy in
the smartphones based on GNSS, this paper proposes to apply real-time dynamic
carrier phase difference technique (RTK) in the smartphones, and a real-time
positioning system for smartphones based on RTK is implemented. This paper
presents the implementation and experimental results of this system. This
system is mainly composed of the GNSS reference station, the NTRIP system and
the smartphones. The experimental results show that the system effectively
improves the positioning accuracy of smartphones
