Title: Fake News Detection by means of Uncertainty Weighted Causal Graphs
Authors: Eduardo C. Garrido-Merch\'an, Cristina Puente, Rafael Palacios
Categories: cs.AI cs.CL
\\
  Society is experimenting changes in information consumption, as new
information channels such as social networks let people share news that do not
necessarily be trust worthy. Sometimes, these sources of information produce
fake news deliberately with doubtful purposes and the consumers of that
information share it to other users thinking that the information is accurate.
This transmission of information represents an issue in our society, as can
influence negatively the opinion of people about certain figures, groups or
ideas. Hence, it is desirable to design a system that is able to detect and
classify information as fake and categorize a source of information as trust
worthy or not. Current systems experiment difficulties performing this task, as
it is complicated to design an automatic procedure that can classify this
information independent on the context. In this work, we propose a mechanism to
detect fake news through a classifier based on weighted causal graphs. These
graphs are specific hybrid models that are built through causal relations
retrieved from texts and consider the uncertainty of causal relations. We take
advantage of this representation to use the probability distributions of this
graph and built a fake news classifier based on the entropy and KL divergence
of learned and new information. We believe that the problem of fake news is
accurately tackled by this model due to its hybrid nature between a symbolic
and quantitative methodology. We describe the methodology of this classifier
and add empirical evidence of the usefulness of our proposed approach in the
form of synthetic experiments and a real experiment involving lung cancer.

Title: Bridging the Gap: Providing Post-Hoc Symbolic Explanations for
  Sequential Decision-Making Problems with Black Box Simulators
Authors: Sarath Sreedharan, Utkash Soni, Mudit Verma, Siddharth Srivastava,
  Subbarao Kambhampati
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  As more and more complex AI systems are introduced into our day-to-day lives,
it becomes important that everyday users can work and interact with such
systems with relative ease. Orchestrating such interactions require the system
to be capable of providing explanations and rationale for its decisions and be
able to field queries about alternative decisions. A significant hurdle to
allowing for such explanatory dialogue could be the mismatch between the
complex representations that the systems use to reason about the task and the
terms in which the user may be viewing the task. This paper introduces methods
that can be leveraged to provide contrastive explanations in terms of
user-specified concepts for deterministic sequential decision-making settings
where the system dynamics may be best represented in terms of black box
simulators. We do this by assuming that system dynamics can at least be partly
captured in terms of symbolic planning models, and we provide explanations in
terms of these models. We implement this method using a simulator for a popular
Atari game (Montezuma's Revenge) and perform user studies to verify whether
people would find explanations generated in this form useful.

Title: Neuro-evolutionary Frameworks for Generalized Learning Agents
Authors: Thommen George Karimpanal
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: 13 pages
\\
  The recent successes of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning have
firmly established their statuses as state-of-the-art artificial learning
techniques. However, longstanding drawbacks of these approaches, such as their
poor sample efficiencies and limited generalization capabilities point to a
need for re-thinking the way such systems are designed and deployed. In this
paper, we emphasize how the use of these learning systems, in conjunction with
a specific variation of evolutionary algorithms could lead to the emergence of
unique characteristics such as the automated acquisition of a variety of
desirable behaviors and useful sets of behavior priors. This could pave the way
for learning to occur in a generalized and continual manner, with minimal
interactions with the environment. We discuss the anticipated improvements from
such neuro-evolutionary frameworks, along with the associated challenges, as
well as its potential for application to a number of research areas.

Title: A Difference-of-Convex Programming Approach With Parallel
  Branch-and-Bound For Sentence Compression Via A Hybrid Extractive Model
Authors: Yi-Shuai Niu, Yu You, Wenxu Xu, Wentao Ding, Junpeng Hu

\\
  Sentence compression is an important problem in natural language processing
with wide applications in text summarization, search engine and human-AI
interaction system etc. In this paper, we design a hybrid extractive sentence
compression model combining a probability language model and a parse tree
language model for compressing sentences by guaranteeing the syntax correctness
of the compression results. Our compression model is formulated as an integer
linear programming problem, which can be rewritten as a Difference-of-Convex
(DC) programming problem based on the exact penalty technique. We use a well
known efficient DC algorithm -- DCA to handle the penalized problem for local
optimal solutions. Then a hybrid global optimization algorithm combining DCA
with a parallel branch-and-bound framework, namely PDCABB, is used for finding
global optimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that our sentence
compression model can provide excellent compression results evaluated by
F-score, and indicate that PDCABB is a promising algorithm for solving our
sentence compression model.

Title: TLB and Pagewalk Performance in Multicore Architectures with Large
  Die-Stacked DRAM Cache
Authors: Adarsh Patil
Categories: cs.AR
\\
  In this work we study the overheads of virtual-to-physical address
translation in processor architectures, like x86-64, that implement paged
virtual memory using a radix tree which are walked in hardware. Translation
Lookaside Buffers are critical to system performance, particularly as
applications demand larger memory footprints and with the adoption of
virtualization; however the cost of a TLB miss potentially results in multiple
memory accesses to retrieve the translation. Architectural support for
superpages has been introduced to increase TLB hits but are limited by the
operating systems ability to find contiguous memory. Numerous prior studies
have proposed TLB designs to lower miss rates and reduce page walk overhead;
however, these studies have modeled the behavior analytically. Further, to
eschew the paging overhead for big-memory workloads and virtualization, Direct
Segment maps part of a process linear virtual address space with segment
registers albeit requiring a few application and operating system
modifications. The recently evolved die-stacked DRAM technology promises a high
bandwidth and large last-level cache, in the order of Gigabytes, closer to the
processors. With such large caches the amount of data that can be accessed
without causing a TLB fault - the reach of a TLB, is inadequate. TLBs are on
the critical path for data accesses and incurring an expensive page walk can
hinder system performance, especially when the data being accessed is a cache
hit in the LLC. Hence, we are interested in exploring novel address translation
mechanisms, commensurate to the size and latency of stacked DRAM. By accurately
simulating the multitude of multi-level address translation structures using
the QEMU based MARSSx86 full system simulator, we perform detailed study of
TLBs in conjunction with the large LLCs using multi-programmed and
multi-threaded workloads.

Title: Synthesizing Compact Hardware for Accelerating Inference from Physical
  Signals in Sensors
Authors: Vasileios Tsoutsouras, Max Vigdorchik, Phillip Stanley-Marbell
Categories: cs.AR eess.SP
\\
  We present dimensional circuit synthesis, a new method for generating digital
logic circuits that improve the efficiency of training and inference of machine
learning models from sensor data. The hardware accelerators that the method
generates are compact enough (a few thousand gates) to allow integration within
low-cost miniaturized sensor integrated circuits, right next to the sensor
transducer. The method takes as input a description of physical properties of
relevant signals in the sensor transduction process and generates as output a
Verilog register transfer level (RTL) description for a circuit that computes
low-level features that exploit the units of measure of the signals in the
system.
  We implement dimensional circuit synthesis as a backend to the compiler for
Newton, a language for describing physical systems. We evaluate the backend
implementation and the hardware it generates, on descriptions of 7 physical
systems. The results show that our implementation of dimensional circuit
synthesis generates circuits of as little as 1662 logic cells / 1239 gates for
the systems we evaluate.
  We synthesize the designs generated by the dimensional circuit synthesis
compilation backend for a low-power miniature FPGA targeted by its manufacturer
at sensor interface applications. The circuits which the method generated use
as little as 27% of the resources of the 2.15x2.5 mm FPGA. We measure the power
dissipation of the FPGA's isolated core supply rail and show that, driven with
a pseudorandom signal input stream, the synthesized designs use as little as
1.0 mW and no more than 5.8 mW. These results show the feasibility of
integrating physics-inspired machine learning methods within low-cost
miniaturized sensor integrated circuits, right next to the sensor transducer.

Title: A Double Exponential Lower Bound for the Distinct Vectors Problem
Authors: Marcin Pilipczuk, Manuel Sorge
Categories: cs.CC cs.DM
\\
  In the (binary) Distinct Vectors problem we are given a binary matrix A with
pairwise different rows and want to select at most k columns such that,
restricting the matrix to these columns, all rows are still pairwise different.
A result by Froese et al. [JCSS] implies a 2^2^(O(k)) * poly(|A|)-time
brute-force algorithm for Distinct Vectors. We show that this running time
bound is essentially optimal by showing that there is a constant c such that
the existence of an algorithm solving Distinct Vectors with running time
2^(O(2^(ck))) * poly(|A|) would contradict the Exponential Time Hypothesis.

Title: Properties of $\Delta$-modular simplicies and "close" polyhedrons.
  $O(\Delta \cdot polylog(\Delta))$-algorithm for knapsack, proximity and
  sparsity
Authors: D.V. Gribanov
Categories: cs.CC cs.DM cs.DS
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1712.06309
\\
  In this work we consider properties of square and "close"-square
$\Delta$-modular systems of linear inequalities $A x \leq b$. More precisely,
we study some class $\mathscr{P}$ of "local" polyhedrons defined by
$\Delta$-modular systems of the type $A x \leq b$ that includes simplicies,
simple cones, parallelotopes (affine images of cubes) and some more general
polyhedrons. We show that for $P \in \mathscr{P}$ the Integer Linear
Programming (the ILP) problem $\max\{c^\top x \colon x \in P \cap
\mathbb{Z}^n\}$ can be solved by an algorithm with the complexity $$O(\Delta
\cdot \log \Delta \cdot M + poly(n,s)),$$ where $M = (m-n) \cdot mult(\log
\Delta) + mult(\log \|c\|_\infty)$, $s$ is input size and $mult(t)$ is the
complexity of $t$-bit integers multiplication. Additionally, we give estimates
on proximity and sparsity of a solution, and show that for fixed $A$, with high
probability, the system $A x \leq b$ defines polyhedron from $\mathscr{P}$.
  Another ingredient is a lemma that states equality of rank minors of
matricies with orthogonal columns. This lemma gives us an opportunity to
transform the systems of the type $A x = b,\, x \geq 0$ to systems of the type
$A x \leq b$ and vise verse, such that structure of sub-determinants states the
same. By this way, using the mentioned results about properties of the family
$\mathscr{P}$, we give an algorithm for the unbounded knapsack problem with the
complexity $$O(\Delta \cdot \log \Delta \cdot M + poly(n,s)),$$ where $\Delta =
\|a\|_\infty$, $M = mult(\log \Delta) + mult(\log \|c\|_\infty)$. Additionally,
we give estimates on the proximity and sparsity of a solution.
  Finally, using close technics, we show that the number of unimodular
equivalence classes of $\Delta$-modular integrally-empty simplicies is bounded
by the function $O(\Delta^{3+\log \Delta} \cdot (2n)^\Delta)$. And give an
efficient algorithm to enumerate them.

Title: On the generation of periodic discrete structures with identical
  two-point correlation
Authors: Mauricio Fern\'andez, Felix Fritzen
Categories: cs.CE
Comments: 28 pages
MSC-class: 74A40 (Primary), 68U10 (Secondary), 62P30
\\
  Strategies for the generation of periodic discrete structures with identical
two-point correlation are developed. Starting from a pair of root structures,
which are not related by translation, phase inversion or axis reflections,
child structures of arbitrary resolution (i.e., pixel or voxel numbers) and
number of phases (i.e., material phases/species) can be generated by means of
trivial embedding based phase extension, application of kernels and/or phase
coalescence, such that the generated structures inherit the
two-point-correlation equivalence. Proofs of the inheritance property are
provided by means of the Discrete Fourier Transform theory. A Python 3
implementation of the results is offered by the authors through the Github
repository https://github.com/DataAnalyticsEngineering/EQ2PC in order to make
the provided results reproducible and useful for all interested readers.
Examples for the generation of structures are demonstrated, together with
applications in the homogenization theory of periodic media.

Title: Detecting Fake News with Capsule Neural Networks
Authors: Mohammad Hadi Goldani, Saeedeh Momtazi, Reza Safabakhsh
Categories: cs.CL cs.CY
Comments: 25 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Fake news is dramatically increased in social media in recent years. This has
prompted the need for effective fake news detection algorithms. Capsule neural
networks have been successful in computer vision and are receiving attention
for use in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper aims to use capsule
neural networks in the fake news detection task. We use different embedding
models for news items of different lengths. Static word embedding is used for
short news items, whereas non-static word embeddings that allow incremental
up-training and updating in the training phase are used for medium length or
large news statements. Moreover, we apply different levels of n-grams for
feature extraction. Our proposed architectures are evaluated on two recent
well-known datasets in the field, namely ISOT and LIAR. The results show
encouraging performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 7.8% on
ISOT and 3.1% on the validation set, and 1% on the test set of the LIAR
dataset.

Title: On the interaction between supervision and self-play in emergent
  communication
Authors: Ryan Lowe, Abhinav Gupta, Jakob Foerster, Douwe Kiela, Joelle Pineau
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA stat.ML
Comments: The first two authors contributed equally. Accepted at ICLR 2020
\\
  A promising approach for teaching artificial agents to use natural language
involves using human-in-the-loop training. However, recent work suggests that
current machine learning methods are too data inefficient to be trained in this
way from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two
categories of learning signals with the ultimate goal of improving sample
efficiency: imitating human language data via supervised learning, and
maximizing reward in a simulated multi-agent environment via self-play (as done
in emergent communication), and introduce the term supervised self-play (S2P)
for algorithms using both of these signals. We find that first training agents
via supervised learning on human data followed by self-play outperforms the
converse, suggesting that it is not beneficial to emerge languages from
scratch. We then empirically investigate various S2P schedules that begin with
supervised learning in two environments: a Lewis signaling game with symbolic
inputs, and an image-based referential game with natural language descriptions.
Lastly, we introduce population based approaches to S2P, which further improves
the performance over single-agent methods.

Title: Variational Template Machine for Data-to-Text Generation
Authors: Rong Ye, Wenxian Shi, Hao Zhou, Zhongyu Wei, Lei Li
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  How to generate descriptions from structured data organized in tables?
Existing approaches using neural encoder-decoder models often suffer from
lacking diversity. We claim that an open set of templates is crucial for
enriching the phrase constructions and realizing varied generations. Learning
such templates is prohibitive since it often requires a large paired <table,
description> corpus, which is seldom available. This paper explores the problem
of automatically learning reusable "templates" from paired and non-paired data.
We propose the variational template machine (VTM), a novel method to generate
text descriptions from data tables. Our contributions include: a) we carefully
devise a specific model architecture and losses to explicitly disentangle text
template and semantic content information, in the latent spaces, and b)we
utilize both small parallel data and large raw text without aligned tables to
enrich the template learning. Experiments on datasets from a variety of
different domains show that VTM is able to generate more diversely while
keeping a good fluency and quality.

Title: Syntactically Look-Ahead Attention Network for Sentence Compression
Authors: Hidetaka Kamigaito, Manabu Okumura
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  Sentence compression is the task of compressing a long sentence into a short
one by deleting redundant words. In sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) based
models, the decoder unidirectionally decides to retain or delete words. Thus,
it cannot usually explicitly capture the relationships between decoded words
and unseen words that will be decoded in the future time steps. Therefore, to
avoid generating ungrammatical sentences, the decoder sometimes drops important
words in compressing sentences. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
Seq2Seq model, syntactically look-ahead attention network (SLAHAN), that can
generate informative summaries by explicitly tracking both dependency parent
and child words during decoding and capturing important words that will be
decoded in the future. The results of the automatic evaluation on the Google
sentence compression dataset showed that SLAHAN achieved the best
kept-token-based-F1, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores of 85.5, 79.3, 71.3
and 79.1, respectively. SLAHAN also improved the summarization performance on
longer sentences. Furthermore, in the human evaluation, SLAHAN improved
informativeness without losing readability.

Title: Dynamic Knowledge Routing Network For Target-Guided Open-Domain
  Conversation
Authors: Jinghui Qin, Zheng Ye, Jianheng Tang, Xiaodan Liang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 8 pages, 2 figues, 6tables, AAAI2020
\\
  Target-guided open-domain conversation aims to proactively and naturally
guide a dialogue agent or human to achieve specific goals, topics or keywords
during open-ended conversations. Existing methods mainly rely on single-turn
datadriven learning and simple target-guided strategy without considering
semantic or factual knowledge relations among candidate topics/keywords. This
results in poor transition smoothness and low success rate. In this work, we
adopt a structured approach that controls the intended content of system
responses by introducing coarse-grained keywords, attains smooth conversation
transition through turn-level supervised learning and knowledge relations
between candidate keywords, and drives an conversation towards an specified
target with discourse-level guiding strategy. Specially, we propose a novel
dynamic knowledge routing network (DRKN) which considers semantic knowledge
relations among candidate keywords for accurate next topic prediction of next
discourse. With the help of more accurate keyword prediction, our
keyword-augmented response retrieval module can achieve better retrieval
performance and more meaningful conversations. Besides, we also propose a novel
dual discourse-level target-guided strategy to guide conversations to reach
their goals smoothly with higher success rate. Furthermore, to push the
research boundary of target-guided open-domain conversation to match real-world
scenarios better, we introduce a new large-scale Chinese target-guided
open-domain conversation dataset (more than 900K conversations) crawled from
Sina Weibo. Quantitative and human evaluations show our method can produce
meaningful and effective target-guided conversations, significantly improving
over other state-of-the-art methods by more than 20% in success rate and more
than 0.6 in average smoothness score.

Title: Arabic Diacritic Recovery Using a Feature-Rich biLSTM Model
Authors: Kareem Darwish, Ahmed Abdelali, Hamdy Mubarak, Mohamed Eldesouki
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Diacritics (short vowels) are typically omitted when writing Arabic text, and
readers have to reintroduce them to correctly pronounce words. There are two
types of Arabic diacritics: the first are core-word diacritics (CW), which
specify the lexical selection, and the second are case endings (CE), which
typically appear at the end of the word stem and generally specify their
syntactic roles. Recovering CEs is relatively harder than recovering core-word
diacritics due to inter-word dependencies, which are often distant. In this
paper, we use a feature-rich recurrent neural network model that uses a variety
of linguistic and surface-level features to recover both core word diacritics
and case endings. Our model surpasses all previous state-of-the-art systems
with a CW error rate (CWER) of 2.86\% and a CE error rate (CEER) of 3.7% for
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and CWER of 2.2% and CEER of 2.5% for Classical
Arabic (CA). When combining diacritized word cores with case endings, the
resultant word error rate is 6.0% and 4.3% for MSA and CA respectively. This
highlights the effectiveness of feature engineering for such deep neural
models.

  Human language and thought are characterized by the ability to systematically
generate a potentially infinite number of complex structures (e.g., sentences)
from a finite set of familiar components (e.g., words). Recent works in
emergent communication have discussed the propensity of artificial agents to
develop a systematically compositional language through playing co-operative
referential games. The degree of structure in the input data was found to
affect the compositionality of the emerged communication protocols. Thus, we
explore various structural priors in multi-agent communication and propose a
novel graph referential game. We compare the effect of structural inductive
bias (bag-of-words, sequences and graphs) on the emergence of compositional
understanding of the input concepts measured by topographic similarity and
generalization to unseen combinations of familiar properties. We empirically
show that graph neural networks induce a better compositional language prior
and a stronger generalization to out-of-domain data. We further perform
ablation studies that show the robustness of the emerged protocol in graph
referential games.

  This paper gives an overview of the Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking
task of the 8th Dialogue System Technology Challenge. The goal of this task is
to develop dialogue state tracking models suitable for large-scale virtual
assistants, with a focus on data-efficient joint modeling across domains and
zero-shot generalization to new APIs. This task provided a new dataset
consisting of over 16000 dialogues in the training set spanning 16 domains to
highlight these challenges, and a baseline model capable of zero-shot
generalization to new APIs. Twenty-five teams participated, developing a range
of neural network models, exceeding the performance of the baseline model by a
very high margin. The submissions incorporated a variety of pre-trained
encoders and data augmentation techniques. This paper describes the task
definition, dataset and evaluation methodology. We also summarize the approach
and results of the submitted systems to highlight the overall trends in the
state-of-the-art.

Title: Compositional Languages Emerge in a Neural Iterated Learning Model
Authors: Yi Ren, Shangmin Guo, Matthieu Labeau, Shay B. Cohen, Simon Kirby
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG
Journal-ref: ICLR-2020
\\
  The principle of compositionality, which enables natural language to
represent complex concepts via a structured combination of simpler ones, allows
us to convey an open-ended set of messages using a limited vocabulary. If
compositionality is indeed a natural property of language, we may expect it to
appear in communication protocols that are created by neural agents in language
games. In this paper, we propose an effective neural iterated learning (NIL)
algorithm that, when applied to interacting neural agents, facilitates the
emergence of a more structured type of language. Indeed, these languages
provide learning speed advantages to neural agents during training, which can
be incrementally amplified via NIL. We provide a probabilistic model of NIL and
an explanation of why the advantage of compositional language exist. Our
experiments confirm our analysis, and also demonstrate that the emerged
languages largely improve the generalizing power of the neural agent
communication.

Title: Plague Dot Text: Text mining and annotation of outbreak reports of the
  Third Plague Pandemic (1894-1952)
Authors: Arlene Casey, Mike Bennett, Richard Tobin, Claire Grover, Iona Walker,
  Lukas Engelmann, Beatrice Alex
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  The design of models that govern diseases in population is commonly built on
information and data gathered from past outbreaks. However, epidemic outbreaks
are never captured in statistical data alone but are communicated by
narratives, supported by empirical observations. Outbreak reports discuss
correlations between populations, locations and the disease to infer insights
into causes, vectors and potential interventions. The problem with these
narratives is usually the lack of consistent structure or strong conventions,
which prohibit their formal analysis in larger corpora. Our interdisciplinary
research investigates more than 100 reports from the third plague pandemic
(1894-1952) evaluating ways of building a corpus to extract and structure this
narrative information through text mining and manual annotation. In this paper
we discuss the progress of our ongoing exploratory project, how we enhance
optical character recognition (OCR) methods to improve text capture, our
approach to structure the narratives and identify relevant entities in the
reports. The structured corpus is made available via Solr enabling search and
analysis across the whole collection for future research dedicated, for
example, to the identification of concepts. We show preliminary visualisations
of the characteristics of causation and differences with respect to gender as a
result of syntactic-category-dependent corpus statistics. Our goal is to
develop structured accounts of some of the most significant concepts that were
used to understand the epidemiology of the third plague pandemic around the
globe. The corpus enables researchers to analyse the reports collectively
allowing for deep insights into the global epidemiological consideration of
plague in the early twentieth century.

Title: From Topic Networks to Distributed Cognitive Maps: Zipfian Topic
  Universes in the Area of Volunteered Geographic Information
Authors: Alexander Mehler and R\"udiger Gleim and Regina Gaitsch and Wahed
  Hemati and Tolga Uslu
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 65 pages, 27 figures
\\
  Are nearby places (e.g. cities) described by related words? In this article
we transfer this research question in the field of lexical encoding of
geographic information onto the level of intertextuality. To this end, we
explore Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) to model texts addressing
places at the level of cities or regions with the help of so-called topic
networks. This is done to examine how language encodes and networks geographic
information on the aboutness level of texts. Our hypothesis is that the
networked thematizations of places are similar - regardless of their distances
and the underlying communities of authors. To investigate this we introduce
Multiplex Topic Networks (MTN), which we automatically derive from Linguistic
Multilayer Networks (LMN) as a novel model, especially of thematic networking
in text corpora. Our study shows a Zipfian organization of the thematic
universe in which geographical places (especially cities) are located in online
communication. We interpret this finding in the context of cognitive maps, a
notion which we extend by so-called thematic maps. According to our
interpretation of this finding, the organization of thematic maps as part of
cognitive maps results from a tendency of authors to generate shareable content
that ensures the continued existence of the underlying media. We test our
hypothesis by example of special wikis and extracts of Wikipedia. In this way
we come to the conclusion: Places, whether close to each other or not, are
located in neighboring places that span similar subnetworks in the topic
universe.

Title: Semantic Search of Memes on Twitter
Authors: Jesus Perez-Martin, Benjamin Bustos, Magdalena Saldana
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 70th International Communication Association Conference
\\
  Memes are becoming a useful source of data for analyzing behavior on social
media. However, a problem to tackle is how to correctly identify a meme. As the
number of memes published every day on social media is huge, there is a need
for automatic methods for classifying and searching in large meme datasets.
This paper proposes and compares several methods for automatically classifying
images as memes. Also, we propose a method that allows us to implement a system
for retrieving memes from a dataset using a textual query. We experimentally
evaluate the methods using a large dataset of memes collected from Twitter
users in Chile, which was annotated by a group of experts. Though some of the
evaluated methods are effective, there is still room for improvement.

Title: Differentially Private k-Means Clustering with Guaranteed Convergence
Authors: Zhigang Lu, Hong Shen
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG
\\
  Iterative clustering algorithms help us to learn the insights behind the
data. Unfortunately, this may allow adversaries to infer the privacy of
individuals with some background knowledge. In the worst case, the adversaries
know the centroids of an arbitrary iteration and the information of n-1 out of
n items. To protect individual privacy against such an inference attack,
preserving differential privacy (DP) for the iterative clustering algorithms
has been extensively studied in the interactive settings. However, existing
interactive differentially private clustering algorithms suffer from a
non-convergence problem, i.e., these algorithms may not terminate without a
predefined number of iterations. This problem severely impacts the clustering
quality and the efficiency of a differentially private algorithm. To resolve
this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel differentially private
clustering framework in the interactive settings which controls the orientation
of the movement of the centroids over the iterations to ensure the convergence
by injecting DP noise in a selected area. We prove that, in the expected case,
algorithm under our framework converges in at most twice the iterations of
Lloyd's algorithm. We perform experimental evaluations on real-world datasets
to show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art of the interactive
differentially private clustering algorithms with guaranteed convergence and
better clustering quality to meet the same DP requirement.

Title: BRIGHTNESS: Leaking Sensitive Data from Air-Gapped Workstations via
  Screen Brightness

\\
  Air-gapped computers are systems that are kept isolated from the Internet
since they store or process sensitive information.
  In this paper, we introduce an optical covert channel in which an attacker
can leak (or, exfiltlrate) sensitive information from air-gapped computers
through manipulations on the screen brightness. This covert channel is
invisible and it works even while the user is working on the computer. Malware
on a compromised computer can obtain sensitive data (e.g., files, images,
encryption keys and passwords), and modulate it within the screen brightness,
invisible to users. The small changes in the brightness are invisible to humans
but can be recovered from video streams taken by cameras such as a local
security camera, smartphone camera or a webcam. We present related work and
discuss the technical and scientific background of this covert channel. We
examined the channel's boundaries under various parameters, with different
types of computer and TV screens, and at several distances. We also tested
different types of camera receivers to demonstrate the covert channel. Lastly,
we present relevant countermeasures to this type of attack. Lastly, we present
relevant countermeasures to this type of attack.

Title: Measuring and Preventing Supply Chain Attacks on Package Managers
Authors: Ruian Duan, Omar Alrawi, Ranjita Pai Kasturi, Ryan Elder, Brendan
  Saltaformaggio, Wenke Lee
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Package managers have become a vital part of the modern software development
process. They allow developers to reuse third-party code, share their own code,
minimize their codebase, and simplify the build process. However, recent
reports showed that hundreds of malware have sneaked into package managers,
which have been downloaded millions of times, posing significant security risks
to developers as well as end-users. For example, eslint-scope, a package with
millions of weekly downloads in Npm, was compromised to steal credentials from
developers.
  To understand the attacks on package managers and the misplaced trust that
makes them possible, we propose a comparative framework to study the package
managers for interpreted languages. By systematically analyzing the recent
attacks using our framework, we can identify security gaps and broken trust in
the package manager ecosystem. Based on these insights, we propose and
implement a vetting pipeline, MalOSS, to perform metadata, static and dynamic
analysis on packages and flag the suspicious ones. Through iterative labeling,
we identified and reported 339 malware to package manager maintainers. 278 (82
percent) of them have been confirmed and removed, and 3 of them with more than
100,000 downloads have been assigned CVEs. To help secure the ecosystem, we
propose actionable security improvements for package manager maintainers and
suggestions for other stakeholders.

Title: Physical Zero-Knowledge Proof for Numberlink
Authors: Suthee Ruangwises, Toshiya Itoh
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Numberlink is a logic puzzle for which the player has to connect all pairs of
cells with the same numbers by non-crossing paths in a rectangular grid. In
this paper, we propose a physical protocol of zero-knowledge proof for
Numberlink using a deck of cards, which allows a player to physically show that
he/she knows a solution without revealing it. In particular, we develop a
physical protocol to count the number of elements in a list that are equal to a
given secret value without revealing that value, the positions of elements in
the list that are equal to it, or the value of any other element in the list.
Our protocol can also be applied to verify the existence of vertex-disjoint
paths connecting all given pairs of endpoints in any graph.

Title: Local Bitcoin Network Simulator for Performance Evaluation using
  Lightweight Virtualization
Authors: Lina Alsahan, Noureddine Lasla, Mohamed Abdallah
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  This paper presents a new blockchain network simulator that uses bitcoin's
original reference implementation as its main application. The proposed
simulator leverages the use of lightweight virtualization technology to build a
fine tuned local testing network. To enable fast simulation of a large scale
network without disabling mining service, the simulator can adjust the bitcoin
mining difficulty level to below the default minimum value. In order to assess
the performance of blockchain under different network conditions, the simulator
allows to define different network topologies, and integrates Linux kernel
traffic control (tc) tool to apply distinct delay or packet loss on the network
nodes. Moreover, to validate the efficiency of our simulator we conduct a set
of experiments and study the impact of the computation power and network delay
on the network's consistency in terms of number of forks and mining revenues.
The impact of applying different mining difficulty levels is also studied and
the block time as well as fork occurrences are evaluated. Furthermore, a
comprehensive survey and taxonomy of existing blockchain simulators are
provided along with a discussion justifying the need of new simulator. As part
of our contribution, we have made the simulator available on Github
(https://github.com/noureddinel/core-bitcoin-net-simulator) for the community
to use and improve it.

\\
  Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is a trending topic in the computing
world. Notably, IoT devices have strict design requirements and are often
referred to as constrained devices. Therefore, security techniques and
primitives that are lightweight are more suitable for such devices, e.g.,
Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). SRAM PUF is an intrinsic security primitive
that is seeing widespread adoption in the IoT segment. ECC is a public-key
algorithm technique that has been gaining popularity among constrained IoT
devices. The popularity is due to using significantly smaller operands when
compared to other public-key techniques such as RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman).
This paper shows the design, development, and evaluation of an
application-specific secure communication architecture based on SRAM PUF
technology and ECC for constrained IoT devices. More specifically, it
introduces an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) public-key based
cryptographic protocol that utilizes PUF-derived keys as the root-of-trust for
silicon authentication. Also, it proposes a design of a modular hardware
architecture that supports the protocol. Finally, to analyze the practicality
as well as the feasibility of the proposed protocol, we demonstrate the
solution by prototyping and verifying a protocol variant on the commercial
Xilinx Zynq-7000 APSoC device.

\\
  Twitter is a web application playing dual roles of online social networking
and micro-blogging. The popularity and open structure of Twitter have attracted
a large number of automated programs, known as bots. Legitimate bots generate a
large amount of benign contextual content, i.e., tweets delivering news and
updating feeds, while malicious bots spread spam or malicious contents. To
assist human users in identifying who they are interacting with, this paper
focuses on the classification of human and spambot accounts on Twitter, by
employing recurrent neural networks, specifically bidirectional Long Short-term
Memory (BiLSTM), to efficiently capture features across tweets. To the best of
our knowledge, our work is the first that develops a recurrent neural model
with word embeddings to distinguish Twitter bots from human accounts, that
requires no prior knowledge or assumption about users' profiles, friendship
networks, or historical behavior on the target account. Moreover, our model
does not require any handcrafted features. The preliminary simulation results
are very encouraging. Experiments on the cresci-2017 dataset show that our
approach can achieve competitive performance compared with existing
state-of-the-art bot detection systems.

Authors: Zhengyu Zhao, Zhuoran Liu, Martha Larson
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Code available at https://github.com/ZhengyuZhao/AdvCF
\\
  We propose Adversarial Color Filtering (AdvCF), an approach that uses a
differentiable color filter to create adversarial images. The color filter
allows us to introduce large perturbations into images, while still maintaining
or enhancing their photographic quality and appeal. AdvCF is motivated by
properties that are necessary if adversarial images are to be used to protect
the content of images shared online from unethical machine learning
classifiers: First, perturbations must be imperceptible and adversarial images
must look realistic to the human eye. Second, adversarial impact must be
maintained in the face of classifiers unknown when the perturbations are
generated (transferability). The paper presents evidence that AdvCF has these
two properties, and also points out that AdvCF has the potential for further
improvement if image semantics are taken into account.

Title: Efficient 2D neuron boundary segmentation with local topological
  constraints
Authors: Thanuja D. Ambegoda and Matthew Cook
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Presented at the Connectomics Workshop - Neural Information
  Processing Systems (NIPS), December 10th, 2016 - Barcelona, Spain
\\
  We present a method for segmenting neuron membranes in 2D electron microscopy
imagery. This segmentation task has been a bottleneck to reconstruction efforts
of the brain's synaptic circuits. One common problem is the misclassification
of blurry membrane fragments as cell interior, which leads to merging of two
adjacent neuron sections into one via the blurry membrane region. Human
annotators can easily avoid such errors by implicitly performing gap
completion, taking into account the continuity of membranes.
  Drawing inspiration from these human strategies, we formulate the
segmentation task as an edge labeling problem on a graph with local topological
constraints. We derive an integer linear program (ILP) that enforces membrane
continuity, i.e. the absence of gaps. The cost function of the ILP is the
pixel-wise deviation of the segmentation from a priori membrane probabilities
derived from the data.
  Based on membrane probability maps obtained using random forest classifiers
and convolutional neural networks, our method improves the neuron boundary
segmentation accuracy compared to a variety of standard segmentation
approaches. Our method successfully performs gap completion and leads to fewer
topological errors. The method could potentially also be incorporated into
other image segmentation pipelines with known topological constraints.

\\
  We propose a novel model named Multi-Channel Attention Selection Generative
Adversarial Network (SelectionGAN) for guided image-to-image translation, where
we translate an input image into another while respecting an external semantic
guidance. The proposed SelectionGAN explicitly utilizes the semantic guidance
information and consists of two stages. In the first stage, the input image and
the conditional semantic guidance are fed into a cycled semantic-guided
generation network to produce initial coarse results. In the second stage, we
refine the initial results by using the proposed multi-scale spatial pooling \&
channel selection module and the multi-channel attention selection module.
Moreover, uncertainty maps automatically learned from attention maps are used
to guide the pixel loss for better network optimization. Exhaustive experiments
on four challenging guided image-to-image translation tasks (face, hand, body
and street view) demonstrate that our SelectionGAN is able to generate
significantly better results than the state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, the
proposed framework and modules are unified solutions and can be applied to
solve other generation tasks, such as semantic image synthesis. The code is
available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/SelectionGAN.

Comments: Preprint. Under review
\\
  The lack of interpretability in current deep learning models causes serious
concerns as they are extensively used for various life-critical applications.
Hence, it is of paramount importance to develop interpretable deep learning
models. In this paper, we consider the problem of blind deconvolution and
propose a novel model-aware deep architecture that allows for the recovery of
both the blur kernel and the sharp image from the blurred image. In particular,
we propose the Deep Unfolded Richardson-Lucy (Deep-URL) framework -- an

improvement compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

Title: Multistage Model for Robust Face Alignment Using Deep Neural Networks

Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  An ability to generalize unconstrained conditions such as severe occlusions
and large pose variations remains a challenging goal to achieve in face
alignment. In this paper, a multistage model based on deep neural networks is
proposed which takes advantage of spatial transformer networks, hourglass
networks and exemplar-based shape constraints. First, a spatial transformer -
generative adversarial network which consists of convolutional layers and
residual units is utilized to solve the initialization issues caused by face
detectors, such as rotation and scale variations, to obtain improved face
bounding boxes for face alignment. Then, stacked hourglass network is employed
to obtain preliminary locations of landmarks as well as their corresponding
scores. In addition, an exemplar-based shape dictionary is designed to
determine landmarks with low scores based on those with high scores. By
incorporating face shape constraints, misaligned landmarks caused by occlusions
or cluttered backgrounds can be considerably improved. Extensive experiments
based on challenging benchmark datasets are performed to demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art
methods.

Title: Object Instance Mining for Weakly Supervised Object Detection
Authors: Chenhao Lin, Siwen Wang, Dongqi Xu, Yu Lu, Wayne Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) using only image-level annotations
has attracted growing attention over the past few years. Existing approaches
using multiple instance learning easily fall into local optima, because such
mechanism tends to learn from the most discriminative object in an image for
each category. Therefore, these methods suffer from missing object instances
which degrade the performance of WSOD. To address this problem, this paper
introduces an end-to-end object instance mining (OIM) framework for weakly
supervised object detection. OIM attempts to detect all possible object
instances existing in each image by introducing information propagation on the
spatial and appearance graphs, without any additional annotations. During the
iterative learning process, the less discriminative object instances from the
same class can be gradually detected and utilized for training. In addition, we
design an object instance reweighted loss to learn larger portion of each
object instance to further improve the performance. The experimental results on
two publicly available databases, VOC 2007 and 2012, demonstrate the efficacy
of proposed approach.

  Image aesthetic quality assessment has got much attention in recent years,
but not many works have been done on a specific genre of photos: Group
photograph. In this work, we designed a set of high-level features based on the
experience and principles of group photography: Opened-eye, Gaze, Smile,
Occluded faces, Face Orientation, Facial blur, Character center. Then we
combined them and 83 generic aesthetic features to build two aesthetic
assessment models. We also constructed a large dataset of group photographs -
GPD- annotated with the aesthetic score. The experimental result shows that our
features perform well for categorizing professional photos and snapshots and
predicting the distinction of multiple group photographs of diverse human
states under the same scene.

Title: Improved dual channel pulse coupled neural network and its application
  to multi-focus image fusion
Authors: Huai-Shui Tong, Xiao-Jun Wu, Hui Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 15 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables
\\
  This paper presents an improved dual channel pulse coupled neural network
(IDC-PCNN) model for image fusion. The model can overcome some defects of
standard PCNN model. In this fusion scheme, the multiplication rule is replaced
by addition rule in the information fusion pool of dual channel PCNN (DC-PCNN)
model. Meanwhile the sum of modified Laplacian (SML) measure is adopted, which
is better than other focus measures. This method not only inherits the good
characteristics of the standard PCNN model but also enhances the computing
efficiency and fusion quality. The performance of the proposed method is
evaluated by using four criteria including average cross entropy, root mean
square error, peak value signal to noise ratio and structure similarity index.
Comparative studies show that the proposed fusion algorithm outperforms the
standard PCNN method and the DC-PCNN method.

Title: To-sequence:Multi-label Relation Modeling in Facial Action Units
  Detection
Authors: Xianpeng Ji, Yu Ding, Lincheng Li, Yu Chen, Changjie Fan
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
\\
  Facial Action Units Detection (FAUD), one of the main approaches for facial
expression measurement, based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), makes
the subtlety of human emotions available in the various applications, such as
micro-expression recognition, expression generation. Therefore, FAUD has
recently become a popular research field. Inspired by the recent advance in
text multi-label classification task, we adapt the sequence-to-sequence method
for multi-label text classification, which directly models the relationship
between labels to treat the multiple activated AUs as a sequence in the context
of data representation, thus transforming the multi-label classification task
into a sequence modeling task. We implement the above algorithm on the data set
released by the competition FG-2020 Competition:Affective Behavior Analysis
in-the-wild (ABAW).

Title: Selective Segmentation Networks Using Top-Down Attention
Authors: Mahdi Biparva, John Tsotsos
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Convolutional neural networks model the transformation of the input sensory
data at the bottom of a network hierarchy to the semantic information at the
top of the visual hierarchy. Feedforward processing is sufficient for some
object recognition tasks. Top-Down selection is potentially required in
addition to the Bottom-Up feedforward pass. It can, in part, address the
shortcoming of the loss of location information imposed by the hierarchical
feature pyramids. We propose a unified 2-pass framework for object segmentation
that augments Bottom-Up \convnets with a Top-Down selection network. We utilize
the top-down selection gating activities to modulate the bottom-up hidden
activities for segmentation predictions. We develop an end-to-end multi-task
framework with loss terms satisfying task requirements at the two ends of the
network. We evaluate the proposed network on benchmark datasets for semantic
segmentation, and show that networks with the Top-Down selection capability
outperform the baseline model. Additionally, we shed light on the superior
aspects of the new segmentation paradigm and qualitatively and quantitatively
support the efficiency of the novel framework over the baseline model that
relies purely on parametric skip connections.

Title: 3D ResNet with Ranking Loss Function for Abnormal Activity Detection in
  Videos
Authors: Shikha Dubey, Abhijeet Boragule, Moongu Jeon
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Abnormal activity detection is one of the most challenging tasks in the field
of computer vision. This study is motivated by the recent state-of-art work of
abnormal activity detection, which utilizes both abnormal and normal videos in
learning abnormalities with the help of multiple instance learning by providing
the data with video-level information. In the absence of temporal-annotations,
such a model is prone to give a false alarm while detecting the abnormalities.
For this reason, in this paper, we focus on the task of minimizing the false
alarm rate while performing an abnormal activity detection task. The mitigation
of these false alarms and recent advancement of 3D deep neural network in video
action recognition task collectively give us motivation to exploit the 3D
ResNet in our proposed method, which helps to extract spatial-temporal features
from the videos. Afterwards, using these features and deep multiple instance
learning along with the proposed ranking loss, our model learns to predict the
abnormality score at the video segment level. Therefore, our proposed method 3D
deep Multiple Instance Learning with ResNet (MILR) along with the new proposed
ranking loss function achieves the best performance on the UCF-Crime benchmark
dataset, as compared to other state-of-art methods. The effectiveness of our
proposed method is demonstrated on the UCF-Crime dataset.

Title: Classification of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Using Coupled CNNs
Authors: Renlong Hang, Zhu Li, Pedram Ghamisi, Danfeng Hong, Guiyu Xia, and

Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Journal-ref: IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 2020
DOI: 10.1109/TGRS.2020.2969024
\\
  In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective framework to fuse
hyperspectral and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data using two coupled
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). One CNN is designed to learn
spectral-spatial features from hyperspectral data, and the other one is used to
capture the elevation information from LiDAR data. Both of them consist of
three convolutional layers, and the last two convolutional layers are coupled
together via a parameter sharing strategy. In the fusion phase, feature-level
and decision-level fusion methods are simultaneously used to integrate these
heterogeneous features sufficiently. For the feature-level fusion, three
different fusion strategies are evaluated, including the concatenation
strategy, the maximization strategy, and the summation strategy. For the
decision-level fusion, a weighted summation strategy is adopted, where the
weights are determined by the classification accuracy of each output. The
proposed model is evaluated on an urban data set acquired over Houston, USA,
and a rural one captured over Trento, Italy. On the Houston data, our model can
achieve a new record overall accuracy of 96.03%. On the Trento data, it
achieves an overall accuracy of 99.12%. These results sufficiently certify the
effectiveness of our proposed model.

Title: Adversarially Robust Frame Sampling with Bounded Irregularities
Authors: Hanhan Li, Pin Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In recent years, video analysis tools for automatically extracting meaningful
information from videos are widely studied and deployed. Because most of them
use deep neural networks which are computationally expensive, feeding only a
subset of video frames into such algorithms is desired. Sampling the frames
with fixed rate is always attractive for its simplicity, representativeness,
and interpretability. For example, a popular cloud video API generated video
and shot labels by processing only the first frame of every second in a video.
However, one can easily attack such strategies by placing chosen frames at the
sampled locations. In this paper, we present an elegant solution to this
sampling problem that is provably robust against adversarial attacks and
introduces bounded irregularities as well.

Title: Simultaneous Enhancement and Super-Resolution of Underwater Imagery for
  Improved Visual Perception
Authors: Md Jahidul Islam, Peigen Luo and Junaed Sattar
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO eess.IV
\\
  In this paper, we introduce and tackle the simultaneous enhancement and
super-resolution (SESR) problem for underwater robot vision and provide an
efficient solution for near real-time applications. We present Deep SESR, a
residual-in-residual network-based generative model that can learn to restore
perceptual image qualities at 2x, 3x, or 4x higher spatial resolution. We
supervise its training by formulating a multi-modal objective function that
addresses the chrominance-specific underwater color degradation, lack of image
sharpness, and loss in high-level feature representation. It is also supervised
to learn salient foreground regions in the image, which in turn guides the
network to learn global contrast enhancement. We design an end-to-end training
pipeline to jointly learn the saliency prediction and SESR on a shared
hierarchical feature space for fast inference. Moreover, we present UFO-120,
the first dataset to facilitate large-scale SESR learning; it contains over
1500 training samples and a benchmark test set of 120 samples. By thorough
experimental evaluation on the UFO-120 and other standard datasets, we
demonstrate that Deep SESR outperforms the existing solutions for underwater
image enhancement and super-resolution. We also validate its generalization
performance on several test cases that include underwater images with diverse
spectral and spatial degradation levels, and also terrestrial images with
unseen natural objects. Lastly, we analyze its computational feasibility for
single-board deployments and demonstrate its operational benefits for
visually-guided underwater robots. The model and dataset information will be

\\
  In this paper, we suggest a new neural network architecture for vanishing
point detection in images. The key element is the use of the direct and
transposed Fast Hough Transforms separated by convolutional layer blocks with
activation functions. It allows us to get the answer in the coordinates of the
input image at the output of the network and thus to calculate the coordinates
of the vanishing point by simply selecting the maximum. The use of integral
operators enables the neural network to rely on global rectilinear features in
the image, and so it is ideal for detecting vanishing points. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we use a set of images from a
DVR and show its superiority over existing methods. Note, in addition, that the
proposed neural network architecture essentially repeats the process of direct
and back projection used, for example, in computed tomography.

Title: Lane Detection in Low-light Conditions Using an Efficient Data
  Enhancement : Light Conditions Style Transfer
Authors: Tong Liu, Zhaowei Chen, Yi Yang, Zehao Wu and Haowei Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 6 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IV 2020
\\
  Nowadays, deep learning techniques are widely used for lane detection, but
application in low-light conditions remains a challenge until this day.
Although multi-task learning and contextual information based methods have been
proposed to solve the problem, they either require additional manual
annotations or introduce extra inference computation respectively. In this
paper, we propose a style-transfer-based data enhancement method, which uses
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images in low-light
conditions, that increases the environmental adaptability of the lane detector.
Our solution consists of three models: the proposed Better-CycleGAN, light
conditions style transfer network and lane detection network. It does not
require additional manual annotations nor extra inference computation. We
validated our methods on the lane detection benchmark CULane using ERFNet.
Empirically, lane detection model trained using our method demonstrated
adaptability in low-light conditions and robustness in complex scenarios. Our
code for this paper will be publicly available.

Title: Unsupervised Multiple Person Tracking using AutoEncoder-Based Lifted
  Multicuts
Authors: Kalun Ho, Janis Keuper, Margret Keuper
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a long-standing task in computer vision.
Current approaches based on the tracking by detection paradigm either require
some sort of domain knowledge or supervision to associate data correctly into
tracks. In this work, we present an unsupervised multiple object tracking
approach based on visual features and minimum cost lifted multicuts. Our method
is based on straight-forward spatio-temporal cues that can be extracted from
neighboring frames in an image sequences without superivison. Clustering based
on these cues enables us to learn the required appearance invariances for the
tracking task at hand and train an autoencoder to generate suitable latent
representation. Thus, the resulting latent representations can serve as robust
appearance cues for tracking even over large temporal distances where no
reliable spatio-temporal features could be extracted. We show that, despite
being trained without using the provided annotations, our model provides
competitive results on the challenging MOT Benchmark for pedestrian tracking.

Title: Selective Convolutional Network: An Efficient Object Detector with
  Ignoring Background
Authors: Hefei Ling, Yangyang Qin, Li Zhang, Yuxuan Shi, Ping Li
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at ICASSP 2020
\\
  It is well known that attention mechanisms can effectively improve the
performance of many CNNs including object detectors. Instead of refining
feature maps prevalently, we reduce the prohibitive computational complexity by
a novel attempt at attention. Therefore, we introduce an efficient object
detector called Selective Convolutional Network (SCN), which selectively
calculates only on the locations that contain meaningful and conducive
information. The basic idea is to exclude the insignificant background areas,
which effectively reduces the computational cost especially during the feature
extraction. To solve it, we design an elaborate structure with negligible
overheads to guide the network where to look next. It's end-to-end trainable
and easy-embedding. Without additional segmentation datasets, we explores two
different train strategies including direct supervision and indirect
supervision. Extensive experiments assess the performance on PASCAL VOC2007 and
MS COCO detection datasets. Results show that SSD and Pelee integrated with our
method averagely reduce the calculations in a range of 1/5 and 1/3 with slight
loss of accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of SCN.

  Maps
Authors: Tom Roussel, Punarjay Chakravarty, Gaurav Pandey, Tinne Tuytelaars,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  We describe a Deep-Geometric Localizer that is able to estimate the full 6
Degree of Freedom (DoF) global pose of the camera from a single image in a
previously mapped environment. Our map is a topo-metric one, with discrete
topological nodes whose 6 DoF poses are known. Each topo-node in our map also
comprises of a set of points, whose 2D features and 3D locations are stored as
part of the mapping process. For the mapping phase, we utilise a stereo camera
and a regular stereo visual SLAM pipeline. During the localization phase, we
take a single camera image, localize it to a topological node using Deep
Learning, and use a geometric algorithm (PnP) on the matched 2D features (and
their 3D positions in the topo map) to determine the full 6 DoF globally
consistent pose of the camera. Our method divorces the mapping and the
localization algorithms and sensors (stereo and mono), and allows accurate 6
DoF pose estimation in a previously mapped environment using a single camera.
With potential VR/AR and localization applications in single camera devices
such as mobile phones and drones, our hybrid algorithm compares favourably with
the fully Deep-Learning based Pose-Net that regresses pose from a single image
in simulated as well as real environments.

Comments: Accepted by AAAI 2020
\\
  Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and attention mechanism are two
main approaches used in recent scene text recognition works. Compared with
attention-based methods, CTC decoder has a much shorter inference time, yet a
lower accuracy. To design an efficient and effective model, we propose the
guided training of CTC (GTC), where CTC model learns a better alignment and
feature representations from a more powerful attentional guidance. With the
benefit of guided training, CTC model achieves robust and accurate prediction
for both regular and irregular scene text while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Moreover, to further leverage the potential of CTC decoder, a graph
convolutional network (GCN) is proposed to learn the local correlations of
extracted features. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that our end-to-end model achieves a new state-of-the-art for regular and
irregular scene text recognition and needs 6 times shorter inference time than
attentionbased methods.

\\
  Worldwide, sewer networks are designed to transport wastewater to a
centralized treatment plant to be treated and returned to the environment. This
process is critical for the current society, preventing waterborne illnesses,
providing safe drinking water and enhancing general sanitation. To keep a sewer
network perfectly operational, sampling inspections are performed constantly to
identify obstructions. Typically, a Closed-Circuit Television system is used to
record the inside of pipes and report the obstruction level, which may trigger
a cleaning operative. Currently, the obstruction level assessment is done
manually, which is time-consuming and inconsistent. In this work, we design a
methodology to train a Convolutional Neural Network for identifying the level
of obstruction in pipes, thus reducing the human effort required on such a
frequent and repetitive task. We gathered a database of videos that are
explored and adapted to generate useful frames to fed into the model. Our
resulting classifier obtains deployment ready performances. To validate the
consistency of the approach and its industrial applicability, we integrate the
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation explainability technique, which enables us to
further understand the behavior of the neural network for this task. In the
end, the proposed system can provide higher speed, accuracy, and consistency in
the process of sewer examination. Our analysis also uncovers some guidelines on
how to further improve the quality of the data gathering methodology.

\\
  In this paper, we propose a novel method to precisely match two aerial images
that were obtained in different environments via a two-stream deep network. By
internally augmenting the target image, the network considers the two-stream
with the three input images and reflects the additional augmented pair in the
training. As a result, the training process of the deep network is regularized
and the network becomes robust for the variance of aerial images. Furthermore,
we introduce an ensemble method that is based on the bidirectional network,
which is motivated by the isomorphic nature of the geometric transformation. We
obtain two global transformation parameters without any additional network or
parameters, which alleviate asymmetric matching results and enable significant
improvement in performance by fusing two outcomes. For the experiment, we adopt
aerial images from Google Earth and the International Society for
Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS). To quantitatively assess our result,
we apply the probability of correct keypoints (PCK) metric, which measures the
degree of matching. The qualitative and quantitative results show the sizable
gap of performance compared to the conventional methods for matching the aerial
images. All code and our trained model, as well as the dataset are available

DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-01258-8_4
\\
  We present a new combined approach for monocular model-based 3D tracking. A
preliminary object pose is estimated by using a keypoint-based technique. The
pose is then refined by optimizing the contour energy function. The energy
determines the degree of correspondence between the contour of the model
projection and the image edges. It is calculated based on both the intensity
and orientation of the raw image gradient. For optimization, we propose a
technique and search area constraints that allow overcoming the local optima
and taking into account information obtained through keypoint-based pose
estimation. Owing to its combined nature, our method eliminates numerous issues
of keypoint-based and edge-based approaches. We demonstrate the efficiency of
our method by comparing it with state-of-the-art methods on a public benchmark

Title: Action Graphs: Weakly-supervised Action Localization with Graph
  Convolution Networks
Authors: Maheen Rashid, Hedvig Kjellstr\"om, Yong Jae Lee
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted at WACV 2020
\\
  We present a method for weakly-supervised action localization based on graph
convolutions. In order to find and classify video time segments that correspond
to relevant action classes, a system must be able to both identify
discriminative time segments in each video, and identify the full extent of
each action. Achieving this with weak video level labels requires the system to
use similarity and dissimilarity between moments across videos in the training
data to understand both how an action appears, as well as the sub-actions that
comprise the action's full extent. However, current methods do not make
explicit use of similarity between video moments to inform the localization and
classification predictions. We present a novel method that uses graph
convolutions to explicitly model similarity between video moments. Our method
utilizes similarity graphs that encode appearance and motion, and pushes the
state of the art on THUMOS '14, ActivityNet 1.2, and Charades for weakly
supervised action localization.

Title: Measuring the Utilization of Public Open Spaces by Deep Learning: a
  Benchmark Study at the Detroit Riverfront
Authors: Peng Sun, Rui Hou, Jerome Lynch
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Physical activities and social interactions are essential activities that
ensure a healthy lifestyle. Public open spaces (POS), such as parks, plazas and
greenways, are key environments that encourage those activities. To evaluate a
POS, there is a need to study how humans use the facilities within it. However,
traditional approaches to studying use of POS are manual and therefore time and
labor intensive. They also may only provide qualitative insights. It is
appealing to make use of surveillance cameras and to extract user-related
information through computer vision. This paper proposes a proof-of-concept
deep learning computer vision framework for measuring human activities
quantitatively in POS and demonstrates a case study of the proposed framework
using the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy (DRFC) surveillance camera network. A
custom image dataset is presented to train the framework; the dataset includes
7826 fully annotated images collected from 18 cameras across the DRFC park
space under various illumination conditions. Dataset analysis is also provided
as well as a baseline model for one-step user localization and activity
recognition. The mAP results are 77.5\% for {\it pedestrian} detection and
81.6\% for {\it cyclist} detection. Behavioral maps are autonomously generated
by the framework to locate different POS users and the average error for
behavioral localization is within 10 cm.

  Humans reason with concepts and metaconcepts: we recognize red and green from
visual input; we also understand that they describe the same property of
objects (i.e., the color). In this paper, we propose the visual
concept-metaconcept learner (VCML) for joint learning of concepts and
metaconcepts from images and associated question-answer pairs. The key is to
exploit the bidirectional connection between visual concepts and metaconcepts.
Visual representations provide grounding cues for predicting relations between
unseen pairs of concepts. Knowing that red and green describe the same property
of objects, we generalize to the fact that cube and sphere also describe the
same property of objects, since they both categorize the shape of objects.
Meanwhile, knowledge about metaconcepts empowers visual concept learning from
limited, noisy, and even biased data. From just a few examples of purple cubes
we can understand a new color purple, which resembles the hue of the cubes
instead of the shape of them. Evaluation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets validates our claims.

Title: Privacy-Preserving Image Sharing via Sparsifying Layers on Convolutional

\\
  We propose a practical framework to address the problem of privacy-aware
image sharing in large-scale setups. We argue that, while compactness is always
desired at scale, this need is more severe when trying to furthermore protect
the privacy-sensitive content. We therefore encode images, such that, from one
hand, representations are stored in the public domain without paying the huge
cost of privacy protection, but ambiguated and hence leaking no discernible
content from the images, unless a combinatorially-expensive guessing mechanism
is available for the attacker. From the other hand, authorized users are
provided with very compact keys that can easily be kept secure. This can be
used to disambiguate and reconstruct faithfully the corresponding
access-granted images. We achieve this with a convolutional autoencoder of our
design, where feature maps are passed independently through sparsifying
transformations, providing multiple compact codes, each responsible for
reconstructing different attributes of the image. The framework is tested on a
large-scale database of images with public implementation available.

Title: Data Market Platforms: Trading Data Assets to Solve Data Problems
  [Vision Paper]
Authors: Raul Castro Fernandez, Pranav Subramaniam, Michael J. Franklin
Categories: cs.DB
\\
  Data only generates value for a few organizations with expertise and
resources to make data shareable, discoverable, and easy to integrate. Sharing
data that is easy to discover and integrate is hard because data owners lack
information (who needs what data) and they do not have incentives to prepare
the data in a way that is easy to consume by others.
  In this paper, we propose data market platforms to address the lack of
information and incentives and tackle the problems of data sharing, discovery,
and integration. In a data market platform, data owners want to share data
because they will be rewarded if they do so. Consumers are encouraged to share
their data needs because the market will solve the discovery and integration
problem for them in exchange for some form of currency.
  We consider internal markets that operate within organizations to bring down
data silos, as well as external markets that operate across organizations to
increase the value of data for everybody. We outline a research agenda that
revolves around two problems. The problem of market design, or how to design
rules that lead to the outcomes we want, and the systems problem, how to
implement the market and enforce the rules. Treating data as a first-class
asset is sorely needed to extend the value of data to more organizations, and
we propose data market platforms as one mechanism to achieve this goal.

Title: Using Positional Sequence Patterns to Estimate the Selectivity of SQL
  LIKE Queries
Authors: Mehmet Aytimur and Ali Cakmak
Categories: cs.DB cs.DS
\\
  With the dramatic increase in the amount of the text-based data which
commonly contains misspellings and other errors, querying such data with
flexible search patterns becomes more and more commonplace. Relational
databases support the LIKE operator to allow searching with a particular
wildcard predicate (e.g., LIKE 'Sub%', which matches all strings starting with
'Sub'). Due to the large size of text data, executing such queries in the most
optimal way is quite critical for database performance. While building the most
efficient execution plan for a LIKE query, the query optimizer requires the
selectivity estimate for the flexible pattern-based query predicate. Recently,
SPH algorithm is proposed which employs a sequence pattern-based histogram
structure to estimate the selectivity of LIKE queries. A drawback of the SPH
approach is that it often overestimates the selectivity of queries. In order to
alleviate the overestimation problem, in this paper, we propose a novel
sequence pattern type, called positional sequence patterns. The proposed
patterns differentiate between sequence item pairs that appear next to each
other in all pattern occurrences from those that may have other items between
them. Besides, we employ redundant pattern elimination based on pattern
information content during histogram construction. Finally, we propose a
partitioning-based matching scheme during the selectivity estimation. The
experimental results on a real dataset from DBLP show that the proposed
approach outperforms the state of the art by around 20% improvement in error
rates.

Title: Secure Payment System Utilizing MANET for Disaster Areas

Journal-ref: in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems,
  vol. 49, no. 12, pp. 2651-2663, Dec. 2019
DOI: 10.1109/TSMC.2017.2752203
\\
  Mobile payment system in a disaster area have the potential to provide
electronic transactions for people purchasing recovery goods like foodstuffs,
clothes, and medicine. Conversely, to enable transactions in a disaster area,
current payment systems need communication infrastructures (such as wired
networks and cellular networks) which may be ruined during such disasters as
large-scale earthquakes and flooding and thus cannot be depended on in a
disaster area. In this paper, we introduce a new mobile payment system
utilizing infrastructureless MANETs to enable transactions that permit users to
shop in disaster areas. Specifically, we introduce an endorsement-based
mechanism to provide payment guarantees for a customer-to-merchant transaction
and a multilevel endorsement mechanism with a lightweight scheme based on Bloom
filter and Merkle tree to reduce communication overheads. Our mobile payment
system achieves secure transaction by adopting various schemes such as
location-based mutual monitoring scheme and blind signature, while our newly
introduce event chain mechanism prevents double spending attacks. As validated
by simulations, the proposed mobile payment system is useful in a disaster
area, achieving high transaction completion ratio, 65% - 90% for all scenario
tested, and is storage-efficient for mobile devices with an overall average of
7MB merchant message size.

Title: Ant Routing scalability for the Lightning Network
Authors: Cyril Grunspan, Gabriel Leh\'ericy, Ricardo P\'erez-Marco
Categories: cs.DC cs.CR
Comments: 26 pagew, 3 figures
\\
  The ambition of the Lightning Network is to provide a second layer to the
Bitcoin network to enable transactions confirmed instantly, securely and
anonymously with a world scale capacity using a decentralized protocol. Some of
the current propositions and implementations present some difficulties in
anonymity, scaling and decentalization. The Ant Routing algorithm for the
Lightning Network was proposed in \cite{GrunspanPerez} for maximal
decentralization, anonymity and potential scaling. It solves several problems
of current implementation, such as channel information update and
centralization by beacon nodes. Ant Routing nodes play all the same role and
don't require any extra information on the network topology beside for their
immediate neighbors. The goal of LN transactions are completed instantaneously
and anonymously. We study the scaling of the Ant Routing protocol. We propose a
precise implementation, with efficient memory management using AVL trees. We
evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm and we estimate the memory usage of
nodes by local node workload simulations. We prove that the number of
transactions per second that Ant Routing can sustain is of the order of several
thousands which is enough for a global payment network.

Title: HiveMind: A Scalable and Serverless Coordination Control Platform for
  UAV Swarms
Authors: Justin Hu, Ariana Bruno, Brian Ritchken, Brendon Jackson, Mateo
  Espinosa, Aditya Shah, Christina Delimitrou
Categories: cs.DC cs.NI
\\
  Swarms of autonomous devices are increasing in ubiquity and size. There are
two main trains of thought for controlling devices in such swarms; centralized
and distributed control. Centralized platforms achieve higher output quality
but result in high network traffic and limited scalability, while decentralized
systems are more scalable, but less sophisticated.
  In this work we present HiveMind, a centralized coordination control platform
for IoT swarms that is both scalable and performant. HiveMind leverages a
centralized cluster for all resource-intensive computation, deferring
lightweight and time-critical operations, such as obstacle avoidance to the
edge devices to reduce network traffic. HiveMind employs an event-driven
serverless framework to run tasks on the cluster, guarantees fault tolerance
both in the edge devices and serverless functions, and handles straggler tasks
and underperforming devices. We evaluate HiveMind on a swarm of 16 programmable
drones on two scenarios; searching for given items, and counting unique people
in an area. We show that HiveMind achieves better performance and battery
efficiency compared to fully centralized and fully decentralized platforms,
while also handling load imbalances and failures gracefully, and allowing edge
devices to leverage the cluster to collectively improve their output quality.

Title: Faster Binary Mean Computation Under Dynamic Time Warping
Authors: Nathan Schaar, Vincent Froese, Rolf Niedermeier
Categories: cs.DM
\\
  Many consensus string problems are based on Hamming distance. We replace
Hamming distance by the more flexible (e.g., easily coping with different input
string lengths) dynamic time warping distance, best known from applications in
time series mining. Doing so, we study the problem of finding a mean string
that minimizes the sum of (squared) dynamic time warping distances to a given
set of input strings. While this problem is known to be NP-hard (even for
strings over a three-element alphabet), we address the binary alphabet case
which is known to be polynomial-time solvable. We significantly improve on a
previously known algorithm in terms of worst-case running time. Moreover, we
also show the practical usefulness of one of our algorithms in experiments with
real-world and synthetic data. Finally, we identify special cases solvable in
linear time (e.g., finding a mean of only two binary input strings) and report
some empirical findings concerning combinatorial properties of optimal means.

Title: Removing Connected Obstacles in the Plane is FPT
Authors: Eduard Eiben and Daniel Lokshtanov
Categories: cs.DS cs.CG cs.DM
\\
  Given two points in the plane, a set of obstacles defined by closed curves,
and an integer $k$, does there exist a path between the two designated points
intersecting at most $k$ of the obstacles? This is a fundamental and
well-studied problem arising naturally in computational geometry, graph theory,
wireless computing, and motion planning. It remains $\textsf{NP}$-hard even
when the obstacles are very simple geometric shapes (e.g., unit-length line
segments). In this paper, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable
($\textsf{FPT}$) parameterized by $k$, by giving an algorithm with running time
$k^{O(k^3)}n^{O(1)}$. Here $n$ is the number connected areas in the plane
drawing of all the obstacles.

  In this paper we consider alignment of sparse graphs, for which we introduce
the Neighborhood Tree Matching Algorithm (NTMA). For correlated
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, we prove that the algorithm returns -- in
polynomial time -- a positive fraction of correctly matched vertices, and a
vanishing fraction of mismatches. This result holds with average degree of the
graphs in $O(1)$ and correlation parameter $s$ bounded away from 1, conditions
under which random graph alignment is particularly challenging. As a byproduct
of the analysis we introduce a matching metric between trees and characterize
it for several models of correlated random trees. These results may be of
independent interest, yielding for instance efficient tests for determining
whether two random trees are correlated or independent.

\\
  The use of network based approaches to model and analyse large datasets is
currently a growing research field. For instance in biology and medicine,
networks are used to model interactions among biological molecules as well as
relations among patients. Similarly, data coming from social networks can be
trivially modelled by using graphs. More recently, the use of dual networks
gained the attention of researchers. A dual network model uses a pair of graphs
to model a scenario in which one of the two graphs is usually unweighted (a
network representing physical associations among nodes) while the other one is
edge-weighted (a network representing conceptual associations among nodes). In
this paper we focus on the problem of finding the Densest Connected sub-graph
(DCS) having the largest density in the conceptual network which is also
connected in the physical network. The problem is relevant but also
computationally hard, therefore the need for introducing of novel algorithms
arises. We formalise the problem and then we map DCS into a graph alignment
problem. Then we propose a possible solution. A set of experiments is also
presented to support our approach.

Title: Accelerating Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm using Machine
  Learning
Authors: Mahabubul Alam, Abdullah Ash-Saki, Swaroop Ghosh
Categories: cs.ET cs.LG
\\
  We propose a machine learning based approach to accelerate quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) implementation which is a promising
quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to prove the so-called quantum supremacy. In
QAOA, a parametric quantum circuit and a classical optimizer iterates in a
closed loop to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems. The performance
of QAOA improves with increasing number of stages (depth) in the quantum
circuit. However, two new parameters are introduced with each added stage for
the classical optimizer increasing the number of optimization loop iterations.
We note a correlation among parameters of the lower-depth and the higher-depth
QAOA implementations and, exploit it by developing a machine learning model to
predict the gate parameters close to the optimal values. As a result, the
optimization loop converges in a fewer number of iterations. We choose graph
MaxCut problem as a prototype to solve using QAOA. We perform a feature
extraction routine using 100 different QAOA instances and develop a training
data-set with 13,860 optimal parameters. We present our analysis for 4 flavors
of regression models and 4 flavors of classical optimizers. Finally, we show
that the proposed approach can curtail the number of optimization iterations by
on average 44.9% (up to 65.7%) from an analysis performed with 264 flavors of
graphs.

Title: Quid Pro Quo allocations in Production-Inventory games
Authors: Luis Guardiola, Ana Meca and Justo Puerto
Categories: cs.GT econ.TH
\\
  The concept of Owen point, introduced in Guardiola et al. (2009), is an
appealing solution concept that for Production-Inventory games (PI-games)
always belongs to their core. The Owen point allows all the players in the game
to operate at minimum cost but it does not take into account the cost reduction
induced by essential players over their followers (fans). Thus, it may be seen
as an altruistic allocation for essential players what can be criticized. The
aim this paper is two-fold: to study the structure and complexity of the core
of PI-games and to introduce new core allocations for PI-games improving the
weaknesses of the Owen point. Regarding the first goal, we advance further on
the analysis of PI-games and we analyze its core structure and algorithmic
complexity. Specifically, we prove that the number of extreme points of the
core of PI-games is exponential on the number of players. On the other hand, we
propose and characterize a new core-allocation, the Omega point, which
compensates the essential players for their role on reducing the costs of their
fans. Moreover, we define another solution concept, the Quid Pro Quo set
(QPQ-set) of allocations, which is based on the Owen and Omega points. Among
all the allocations in this set, we emphasize what we call the Solomonic QPQ
allocation and we provide some necessary conditions for the coincidence of that
allocation with the Shapley value and the Nucleolus.

Title: Local Nash Equilibria are Isolated, Strict Local Nash Equilibria in
  `Almost All' Zero-Sum Continuous Games
Authors: Eric Mazumdar, Lillian Ratliff
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: A shorter version of this paper was presented at the 2019 IEEE
  Conference on Decision and Control
\\
  We prove that differential Nash equilibria are generic amongst local Nash
equilibria in continuous zero-sum games. That is, there exists an open-dense
subset of zero-sum games for which local Nash equilibria are non-degenerate
differential Nash equilibria. The result extends previous results to the
zero-sum setting, where we obtain even stronger results; in particular, we show
that local Nash equilibria are generically hyperbolic critical points. We
further show that differential Nash equilibria of zero-sum games are
structurally stable. The purpose for presenting these extensions is the recent
renewed interest in zero-sum games within machine learning and optimization.
Adversarial learning and generative adversarial network approaches are touted
to be more robust than the alternative. Zero-sum games are at the heart of such
approaches. Many works proceed under the assumption of hyperbolicity of
critical points. Our results justify this assumption by showing `almost all'
zero-sum games admit local Nash equilibria that are hyperbolic.

Title: Limitations of Incentive Compatibility on Discrete Type Spaces
Authors: Taylor Lundy and Hu Fu
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: 11 pages, 2 figures, to be published in Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference
  on Artificial Intelligence
\\
  In the design of incentive compatible mechanisms, a common approach is to
enforce incentive compatibility as constraints in programs that optimize over
feasible mechanisms. Such constraints are often imposed on sparsified
representations of the type spaces, such as their discretizations or samples,
in order for the program to be manageable. In this work, we explore limitations
of this approach, by studying whether all dominant strategy incentive
compatible mechanisms on a set $T$ of discrete types can be extended to the
convex hull of $T$.
  Dobzinski, Fu and Kleinberg (2015) answered the question affirmatively for
all settings where types are single dimensional. It is not difficult to show
that the same holds when the set of feasible outcomes is downward closed. In
this work we show that the question has a negative answer for certain
non-downward-closed settings with multi-dimensional types. This result should
call for caution in the use of the said approach to enforcing incentive
compatibility beyond single-dimensional preferences and downward closed
feasible outcomes.

their innate preferences but also by the decision taken by their social
neighbors. We assume that the strategies of the agents are embedded in an
{approximate} metric space. Furthermore, departing from the previous
literature, we assume that, due to the lack of information, each agent locally
represents the trend of the network through an aggregate value, which can be
interpreted as the output of an aggregation function. We answer some
fundamental questions related to the existence and efficiency of pure Nash
equilibria.

  Industry 4.0 or Industrial IoT both describe new paradigms for seamless
interaction between humans and machines. Both concepts rely on intelligent,
inter-connected cyber-physical production systems that are able to control the
process flow of industrial production. As those machines take many decisions
autonomously and further interact with production and manufacturing planning
systems, the integration of human users requires new paradigms. In this paper,
we provide an analysis of the current state-of-the-art in human-machine
interaction in the Industry 4.0 domain.We focus on new paradigms that integrate
the application of augmented and virtual reality technology. Based on our
analysis, we further provide a discussion of research challenges.

Title: Decoding Visual Responses based on Deep Neural Networks with Ear-EEG
  Signals
Authors: Young-Eun Lee, Minji Lee
Categories: cs.HC eess.SP
Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, conference
\\
  Recently, practical brain-computer interface is actively carried out,
especially, in an ambulatory environment. However, the electroencephalography
signals are distorted by movement artifacts and electromyography signals in
ambulatory condition, which make hard to recognize human intention. In
addition, as hardware issues are also challenging, ear-EEG has been developed
for practical brain-computer interface and is widely used. However, ear-EEG
still contains contaminated signals. In this paper, we proposed robust
two-stream deep neural networks in walking conditions and analyzed the visual
response EEG signals in the scalp and ear in terms of statistical analysis and
brain-computer interface performance. We validated the signals with the visual
response paradigm, steady-state visual evoked potential. The brain-computer
interface performance deteriorated as 3~14% when walking fast at 1.6 m/s. When
applying the proposed method, the accuracies increase 15% in cap-EEG and 7% in
ear-EEG. The proposed method shows robust to the ambulatory condition in
session dependent and session-to-session experiments.

Title: Human-centered Explainable AI: Towards a Reflective Sociotechnical
  Approach
Authors: Upol Ehsan and Mark O. Riedl
Categories: cs.HC cs.AI
Comments: In Proceedings of HCI International 2020: 22nd International
  Conference On Human-Computer Interaction
\\
  Explanations--a form of post-hoc interpretability--play an instrumental role
in making systems accessible as AI continues to proliferate complex and
sensitive sociotechnical systems. In this paper, we introduce Human-centered
Explainable AI (HCXAI) as an approach that puts the human at the center of
technology design. It develops a holistic understanding of "who" the human is
by considering the interplay of values, interpersonal dynamics, and the
socially situated nature of AI systems. In particular, we advocate for a
reflective sociotechnical approach. We illustrate HCXAI through a case study of
an explanation system for non-technical end-users that shows how technical
advancements and the understanding of human factors co-evolve. Building on the
case study, we lay out open research questions pertaining to further refining
our understanding of "who" the human is and extending beyond 1-to-1
human-computer interactions. Finally, we propose that a reflective HCXAI
paradigm--mediated through the perspective of Critical Technical Practice and
supplemented with strategies from HCI, such as value-sensitive design and
participatory design--not only helps us understand our intellectual blind
spots, but it can also open up new design and research spaces.

Title: Do I Look Like a Criminal? Examining how Race Presentation Impacts Human

\\
  Understanding how racial information impacts human decision making in online
systems is critical in today's world. Prior work revealed that race information
of criminal defendants, when presented as a text field, had no significant
impact on users' judgements of recidivism. We replicated and extended this work
to explore how and when race information influences users' judgements, with
respect to the saliency of presentation. Our results showed that adding photos
to the race labels had a significant impact on recidivism predictions for users
who identified as female, but not for those who identified as male. The race of
the defendant also impacted these results, with black defendants being less
likely to be predicted to recidivate compared to white defendants. These
results have strong implications for how system-designers choose to display
race information, and cautions researchers to be aware of gender and race
effects when using Amazon Mechanical Turk workers.

Title: A BCI based Smart Home System Combined with Event-related Potentials and
  Speech Imagery Task
Authors: Hyeong-Jin Kim, Min-Ho Lee, Minji Lee
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Recently, smart home systems based on brain-computer interface (BCI) has
attracted a wide range of interests in both industry and academia. However, the
current BCI system has several shortcomings as it produces a comparatively
lower accuracy for real-time implementations as well as the intuitive paradigm
for the users cannot be well established here. Therefore, in this study, we
proposed a highly intuitive BCI paradigm that combines event-related potential
(ERP) with the speech-imagery task for the individual target objects. The
decoding accuracy of the proposed paradigm was 88.1% (plus or minus 5.90) which
is a much significant higher performance than a conventional ERP system.
Furthermore, the amplitude of N700 components was significantly enhanced over
frontal regions which are priory evoked by the speech-imagery task. Our results
could be utilized to develop a smart home system so that it could be more
user-friendly and convenient by means of delivering user's intentions both,
intuitively and accurately.

Title: Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Visual Imagery for Intuitive Brain-Computer
  Interface
Authors: Seo-Hyun Lee, Minji Lee
Categories: cs.HC q-bio.NC
\\
  Visual imagery is an intuitive brain-computer interface paradigm, referring
to the emergence of the visual scene. Despite its convenience, analysis of its
intrinsic characteristics is limited. In this study, we demonstrate the effect
of time interval and channel selection that affects the decoding performance of
the multi-class visual imagery. We divided the epoch into time intervals of 0-1
s and 1-2 s and performed six-class classification in three different brain
regions: whole brain, visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex. In the time
interval, 0-1 s group showed 24.2 % of average classification accuracy, which
was significantly higher than the 1-2 s group in the prefrontal cortex. In the
three different regions, the classification accuracy of the prefrontal cortex
showed significantly higher performance than the visual cortex in 0-1 s
interval group, implying the cognitive arousal during the visual imagery. This
finding would provide crucial information in improving the decoding
performance.

Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables
\\
  In this study, 3D brain-computer interface (BCI) training platforms were used
to stimulate the subjects for visual motion imagery and visual perception. We
measured the activation brain region and alpha-band power activity when the
subjects perceived and imagined the stimuli. Based on this, 4-class were
classified in visual stimuli session and visual motion imagery session
respectively. The results showed that the occipital region is involved in
visual perception and visual motion imagery, and alpha-band power is increased
in visual motion imagery session and decreased in visual motion stimuli
session. Compared with the performance of visual motion imagery and motor
imagery, visual motion imagery has higher performance than motor imagery. The
binary class was classified using one versus rest approach as well as analysis
of brain activation to prove that visual-related brain wave signals are
meaningful, and the results were significant.

\\
  A brain-machine interface (BMI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can
overcome the movement deficits for patients and real-world applications for
healthy people. Ideally, the BMI system detects user movement intentions
transforms them into a control signal for a robotic arm movement. In this
study, we made progress toward user intention decoding and successfully
classified six different reaching movements of the right arm in the movement
execution (ME). Notably, we designed an experimental environment using robotic
arm movement and proposed a convolutional neural network architecture (CNN)
with inception block for robust classify executed movements of the same limb.
As a result, we confirmed the classification accuracies of six different
directions show 0.45 for the executed session. The results proved that the
proposed architecture has approximately 6~13% performance increase compared to
its conventional classification models. Hence, we demonstrate the 3D inception
CNN architecture to contribute to the continuous decoding of ME.

Authors: Byeong-Hoo Lee, Ji-Hoon Jeong, Kyung-Hwan Shim, Dong-Joo Kim
Categories: cs.HC cs.LG eess.SP
\\
  Brain-computer interface (BCI) decodes brain signals to understand user
intention and status. Because of its simple and safe data acquisition process,
electroencephalogram (EEG) is commonly used in non-invasive BCI. One of EEG
paradigms, motor imagery (MI) is commonly used for recovery or rehabilitation
of motor functions due to its signal origin. However, the EEG signals are an
oscillatory and non-stationary signal that makes it difficult to collect and
classify MI accurately. In this study, we proposed a band-power feature
refining convolutional neural network (BFR-CNN) which is composed of two
convolution blocks to achieve high classification accuracy. We collected EEG
signals to create MI dataset contained the movement imagination of a
single-arm. The proposed model outperforms conventional approaches in 4-class
MI tasks classification. Hence, we demonstrate that the decoding of user
intention is possible by using only EEG signals with robust performance using
BFR-CNN.

  The complex nature of intelligent systems motivates work on supporting users
during interaction, for example through explanations. However, as of yet, there
is little empirical evidence in regard to specific problems users face when
applying such systems in everyday situations. This paper contributes a novel
method and analysis to investigate such problems as reported by users: We
analysed 45,448 reviews of four apps on the Google Play Store (Facebook,
Netflix, Google Maps and Google Assistant) with sentiment analysis and topic
modelling to reveal problems during interaction that can be attributed to the
apps' algorithmic decision-making. We enriched this data with users' coping and
support strategies through a follow-up online survey (N=286). In particular, we
found problems and strategies related to content, algorithm, user choice, and
feedback. We discuss corresponding implications for designing user support,
highlighting the importance of user control and explanations of output, rather
than processes.

  Recommendation systems today exert a strong influence on consumer behavior
and individual perceptions of the world. By using collaborative filtering (CF)
methods to create recommendations, it generates a continuous feedback loop in
which user behavior becomes magnified in the algorithmic system. Popular items
get recommended more frequently, creating the bias that affects and alters user
preferences. In order to visualize and compare the different biases, we will
analyze the effects of recommendation systems and quantify the inequalities

Title: Secure MIMO Transmission via Intelligent Reflecting Surface
Authors: Limeng Dong, Hui-Ming Wang
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Accepted by WCL
\\
  In this letter, we consider an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted
Guassian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel in which a
multi-antenna transmitter communicates with a multi-antenna receiver in the
presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper. To maximize the secrecy rate of this
channel, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to jointly
optimize the transmit covariance R at transmitter and phase shift coefficient Q
at IRS by fixing the other as a constant. When Q is fixed, existing numerical
algorithm is used to search for global optimal R. When R is fixed, three
sucessive approximation to the objective function to surrogate lower bound is
applied and minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm is proposed to optimize
the local optimal Q. Simulation results have be provided to validate the
convergence and performance of the proposed AO algorithm.

\\
  This paper considers the large-scale fading precoding design for mitigating
the pilot contamination in the downlink of multi-cell massive MIMO
(multiple-input multiple-output) systems. Rician fading with spatially
correlated channels are considered where the line-of-sight (LOS) components of
the channels are randomly phase-shifted in each coherence block. The
large-scale fading precoding weights are designed based on maximizing the
product of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of the users,
which provides a good balance between max-min fairness and sum rate
maximization. The spectral efficiency (SE) is derived based on the scaled least
squares (LS) estimates of the channels, which only utilize the despreaded pilot
signals without any matrix inversion. Simulation results show that the
two-layer large-scale fading precoding improves the SE of almost all users
compared to the conventional single-layer precoding.

\\
  Wireless communications for status update are becoming increasingly
important, especially for machine-type control applications. Existing work has
been mainly focused on Age of Information (AoI) optimizations. In this paper, a
status-aware predictive wireless interface design, networking and
implementation are presented which aim to minimize the status recovery error of
a wireless networked system by leveraging online status model predictions. Two
critical issues of predictive status update are addressed: practicality and
usefulness. Link-level experiments on a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) testbed
are conducted and test results show that the proposed design can significantly
reduce the number of wireless transmissions while maintaining a low status
recovery error. A Status-aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning neTworking
solution (SMART) is proposed to dynamically and autonomously control the
transmit decisions of devices in an ad hoc network based on their individual
statuses. System-level simulations of a multi dense platooning scenario are
carried out on a road traffic simulator. Results show that the proposed schemes
can greatly improve the platooning control performance in terms of the minimum
safe distance between successive vehicles, in comparison with the AoI-optimized
status-unaware and communication latency-optimized schemes---this demonstrates
the usefulness of our proposed status update schemes in a real-world
application.

the Gray-Wyner network that connects a single source with two receivers via a
common channel and two private channels. General lower bounds are derived for
jointly Gaussian sources subject to the mean-squared error criterion,
leveraging convex duality and an argument involving the factorization of convex
envelopes. The pareto-optimal trade-offs between the sum-rate of the private
channels and the rate of the common channel is completely characterized.
Specifically, it is attained by selecting the auxiliary random variable to be
jointly Gaussian with the sources.

Title: Learning from Noisy Similar and Dissimilar Data
Authors: Soham Dan, Han Bao, Masashi Sugiyama
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  With the widespread use of machine learning for classification, it becomes
increasingly important to be able to use weaker kinds of supervision for tasks
in which it is hard to obtain standard labeled data. One such kind of
supervision is provided pairwise---in the form of Similar (S) pairs (if two
examples belong to the same class) and Dissimilar (D) pairs (if two examples
belong to different classes). This kind of supervision is realistic in
privacy-sensitive domains. Although this problem has been looked at recently,
it is unclear how to learn from such supervision under label noise, which is
very common when the supervision is crowd-sourced. In this paper, we close this
gap and demonstrate how to learn a classifier from noisy S and D labeled data.
We perform a detailed investigation of this problem under two realistic noise
models and propose two algorithms to learn from noisy S-D data. We also show
important connections between learning from such pairwise supervision data and
learning from ordinary class-labeled data. Finally, we perform experiments on
synthetic and real world datasets and show our noise-informed algorithms
outperform noise-blind baselines in learning from noisy pairwise data.

Title: Preventing Imitation Learning with Adversarial Policy Ensembles
Authors: Albert Zhan, Stas Tiomkin, Pieter Abbeel
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Imitation learning can reproduce policies by observing experts, which poses a
problem regarding policy privacy. Policies, such as human, or policies on
deployed robots, can all be cloned without consent from the owners. How can we
protect against external observers cloning our proprietary policies? To answer
this question we introduce a new reinforcement learning framework, where we
train an ensemble of near-optimal policies, whose demonstrations are guaranteed
to be useless for an external observer. We formulate this idea by a constrained
optimization problem, where the objective is to improve proprietary policies,
and at the same time deteriorate the virtual policy of an eventual external
observer. We design a tractable algorithm to solve this new optimization
problem by modifying the standard policy gradient algorithm. Our formulation
can be interpreted in lenses of confidentiality and adversarial behaviour,
which enables a broader perspective of this work. We demonstrate the existence
of "non-clonable" ensembles, providing a solution to the above optimization
problem, which is calculated by our modified policy gradient algorithm. To our
knowledge, this is the first work regarding the protection of policies in
Reinforcement Learning.

Title: Transfer Learning for HVAC System Fault Detection
Authors: Chase P. Dowling and Baosen Zhang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures, accepted to American Control Conference 2020
\\
  Faults in HVAC systems degrade thermal comfort and energy efficiency in
buildings and have received significant attention from the research community,
with data driven methods gaining in popularity. Yet the lack of labeled data,
such as normal versus faulty operational status, has slowed the application of
machine learning to HVAC systems. In addition, for any particular building,
there may be an insufficient number of observed faults over a reasonable amount
of time for training. To overcome these challenges, we present a transfer
methodology for a novel Bayesian classifier designed to distinguish between
normal operations and faulty operations. The key is to train this classifier on
a building with a large amount of sensor and fault data (for example, via
simulation or standard test data) then transfer the classifier to a new
building using a small amount of normal operations data from the new building.

architecturally similar buildings in different climates and show few samples

Title: Efficient, Noise-Tolerant, and Private Learning via Boosting
Authors: Mark Bun, Marco Leandro Carmosino, Jessica Sorrell
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 33 pages
\\
  We introduce a simple framework for designing private boosting algorithms. We
give natural conditions under which these algorithms are differentially
private, efficient, and noise-tolerant PAC learners. To demonstrate our
framework, we use it to construct noise-tolerant and private PAC learners for
large-margin halfspaces whose sample complexity does not depend on the
dimension.
  We give two sample complexity bounds for our large-margin halfspace learner.
One bound is based only on differential privacy, and uses this guarantee as an
asset for ensuring generalization. This first bound illustrates a general
methodology for obtaining PAC learners from privacy, which may be of
independent interest. The second bound uses standard techniques from the theory
of large-margin classification (the fat-shattering dimension) to match the best
known sample complexity for differentially private learning of large-margin
halfspaces, while additionally tolerating random label noise.

Title: Efficient Riemannian Optimization on the Stiefel Manifold via the Cayley
  Transform
Authors: Jun Li, Li Fuxin, Sinisa Todorovic
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: ICLR 2020 conference paper
\\
  Strictly enforcing orthonormality constraints on parameter matrices has been
shown advantageous in deep learning. This amounts to Riemannian optimization on
the Stiefel manifold, which, however, is computationally expensive. To address
this challenge, we present two main contributions: (1) A new efficient
retraction map based on an iterative Cayley transform for optimization updates,
and (2) An implicit vector transport mechanism based on the combination of a
projection of the momentum and the Cayley transform on the Stiefel manifold. We
specify two new optimization algorithms: Cayley SGD with momentum, and Cayley
ADAM on the Stiefel manifold. Convergence of Cayley SGD is theoretically
analyzed. Our experiments for CNN training demonstrate that both algorithms:
(a) Use less running time per iteration relative to existing approaches that
enforce orthonormality of CNN parameters; and (b) Achieve faster convergence
rates than the baseline SGD and ADAM algorithms without compromising the
performance of the CNN. Cayley SGD and Cayley ADAM are also shown to reduce the
training time for optimizing the unitary transition matrices in RNNs.

  Decentralized Parallel SGD (D-PSGD) and its asynchronous variant Asynchronous
Parallel SGD (AD-PSGD) is a family of distributed learning algorithms that have
been demonstrated to perform well for large-scale deep learning tasks. One
drawback of (A)D-PSGD is that the spectral gap of the mixing matrix decreases
when the number of learners in the system increases, which hampers convergence.
In this paper, we investigate techniques to accelerate (A)D-PSGD based training
by improving the spectral gap while minimizing the communication cost. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques by running experiments
on the 2000-hour Switchboard speech recognition task and the ImageNet computer
vision task. On an IBM P9 supercomputer, our system is able to train an LSTM
acoustic model in 2.28 hours with 7.5% WER on the Hub5-2000 Switchboard (SWB)
test set and 13.3% WER on the CallHome (CH) test set using 64 V100 GPUs and in
1.98 hours with 7.7% WER on SWB and 13.3% WER on CH using 128 V100 GPUs, the
fastest training time reported to date.

Title: Decoupling Learning Rates Using Empirical Bayes Priors
Authors: Sareh Nabi, Houssam Nassif, Joseph Hong, Hamed Mamani, Guido Imbens
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In this work, we propose an Empirical Bayes approach to decouple the learning
rates of first order and second order features (or any other feature grouping)
in a Generalized Linear Model. Such needs arise in small-batch or low-traffic
use-cases. As the first order features are likely to have a more pronounced
effect on the outcome, focusing on learning first order weights first is likely
to improve performance and convergence time. Our Empirical Bayes method clamps
features in each group together and uses the observed data for the deployed
model to empirically compute a hierarchical prior in hindsight. We apply our
method to a standard classification setting, as well as a contextual bandit
setting in an Amazon production system. Both during simulations and live
experiments, our method shows marked improvements, especially in cases of small
traffic. Our findings are promising, as optimizing over sparse data is often a
challenge. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to any problem instance
modeled as a Bayesian framework.

Title: On Positive-Unlabeled Classification in GAN
Authors: Tianyu Guo, Chang Xu, Jiajun Huang, Yunhe Wang, Boxin Shi, Chao Xu,
  Dacheng Tao
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  This paper defines a positive and unlabeled classification problem for
standard GANs, which then leads to a novel technique to stabilize the training
of the discriminator in GANs. Traditionally, real data are taken as positive
while generated data are negative. This positive-negative classification
criterion was kept fixed all through the learning process of the discriminator
without considering the gradually improved quality of generated data, even if
they could be more realistic than real data at times. In contrast, it is more
reasonable to treat the generated data as unlabeled, which could be positive or
negative according to their quality. The discriminator is thus a classifier for
this positive and unlabeled classification problem, and we derive a new
Positive-Unlabeled GAN (PUGAN). We theoretically discuss the global optimality
the proposed model will achieve and the equivalent optimization goal.
Empirically, we find that PUGAN can achieve comparable or even better
performance than those sophisticated discriminator stabilization methods.

Title: Graph Representation Learning via Graphical Mutual Information
  Maximization
Authors: Zhen Peng, Wenbing Huang, Minnan Luo, Qinghua Zheng, Yu Rong, Tingyang
  Xu, Junzhou Huang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  The richness in the content of various information networks such as social
networks and communication networks provides the unprecedented potential for
learning high-quality expressive representations without external supervision.
This paper investigates how to preserve and extract the abundant information
from graph-structured data into embedding space in an unsupervised manner. To
this end, we propose a novel concept, Graphical Mutual Information (GMI), to
measure the correlation between input graphs and high-level hidden
representations. GMI generalizes the idea of conventional mutual information
computations from vector space to the graph domain where measuring mutual
information from two aspects of node features and topological structure is
indispensable. GMI exhibits several benefits: First, it is invariant to the
isomorphic transformation of input graphs---an inevitable constraint in many
existing graph representation learning algorithms; Besides, it can be
efficiently estimated and maximized by current mutual information estimation
methods such as MINE; Finally, our theoretical analysis confirms its
correctness and rationality. With the aid of GMI, we develop an unsupervised
learning model trained by maximizing GMI between the input and output of a
graph neural encoder. Considerable experiments on transductive as well as
inductive node classification and link prediction demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, and even sometimes
exceeds the performance of supervised ones.

Title: Towards a Fast Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP)
  Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
Authors: Aung Aung Phyo Wai, Yangsong Zhang, Heng Guo, Ying Chi, Lei Zhang,

Categories: cs.LG cs.HC eess.SP stat.ML
Comments: Extended research work of the manuscript titled 'Improving the
  Performance of SSVEP BCI with Short Response Time by Temporal Alignments
  Enhanced CCA' published in proceeding of the 2019 9th International IEEE/EMBS
  Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)
\\
  Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) brain-computer interface (BCI)
provides reliable responses leading to high accuracy and information
throughput. But achieving high accuracy typically requires a relatively long
time window of one second or more. Various methods were proposed to improve
sub-second response accuracy through subject-specific training and calibration.
Substantial performance improvements were achieved with tedious calibration and
subject-specific training; resulting in the user's discomfort. So, we propose a
training-free method by combining spatial-filtering and temporal alignment
(CSTA) to recognize SSVEP responses in sub-second response time. CSTA exploits
linear correlation and non-linear similarity between steady-state responses and
stimulus templates with complementary fusion to achieve desirable performance
improvements. We evaluated the performance of CSTA in terms of accuracy and
Information Transfer Rate (ITR) in comparison with both training-based and
training-free methods using two SSVEP data-sets. We observed that CSTA achieves
the maximum mean accuracy of 97.43$\pm$2.26 % and 85.71$\pm$13.41 % with
four-class and forty-class SSVEP data-sets respectively in sub-second response
time in offline analysis. CSTA yields significantly higher mean performance
(p<0.001) than the training-free method on both data-sets. Compared with
training-based methods, CSTA shows 29.33$\pm$19.65 % higher mean accuracy with
statistically significant differences in time window less than 0.5 s. In longer
time windows, CSTA exhibits either better or comparable performance though not
statistically significantly better than training-based methods. We show that
the proposed method brings advantages of subject-independent SSVEP
classification without requiring training while enabling high target
recognition performance in sub-second response time.

Title: Selfish Robustness and Equilibria in Multi-Player Bandits
Authors: Etienne Boursier and Vianney Perchet
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Motivated by cognitive radios, stochastic multi-player multi-armed bandits
gained a lot of interest recently. In this class of problems, several players
simultaneously pull arms and encounter a collision -- with 0 reward -- if some
of them pull the same arm at the same time. While the cooperative case where
players maximize the collective reward (obediently following some fixed
protocol) has been mostly considered, robustness to malicious players is a
crucial and challenging concern. Existing approaches consider only the case of
adversarial jammers whose objective is to blindly minimize the collective
reward.
  We shall consider instead the more natural class of selfish players whose
incentives are to maximize their individual rewards, potentially at the expense
of the social welfare. We provide the first algorithm robust to selfish players
(a.k.a. Nash equilibrium) with a logarithmic regret, when the arm reward is
observed. When collisions are also observed, Grim Trigger type of strategies
enable some implicit communication-based algorithms and we construct robust
algorithms in two different settings: in the homogeneous case (with a regret
comparable to the centralized optimal one) and in the heterogeneous case (for
an adapted and relevant notion of regret). We also provide impossibility
results when only the reward is observed or when arm means vary arbitrarily
among players.

Title: ALPINE: Active Link Prediction using Network Embedding
Authors: Xi Chen, Bo Kang, Jefrey Lijffijt and Tijl De Bie
Categories: cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
\\
  Many real-world problems can be formalized as predicting links in a partially
observed network. Examples include Facebook friendship suggestions,
consumer-product recommendations, and the identification of hidden interactions
between actors in a crime network. Several link prediction algorithms, notably
those recently introduced using network embedding, are capable of doing this by
just relying on the observed part of the network. Often, the link status of a
node pair can be queried, which can be used as additional information by the
link prediction algorithm. Unfortunately, such queries can be expensive or
time-consuming, mandating the careful consideration of which node pairs to
query. In this paper we estimate the improvement in link prediction accuracy
after querying any particular node pair, to use in an active learning setup.
Specifically, we propose ALPINE (Active Link Prediction usIng Network
Embedding), the first method to achieve this for link prediction based on
network embedding. To this end, we generalized the notion of V-optimality from
experimental design to this setting, as well as more basic active learning
heuristics originally developed in standard classification settings. Empirical
results on real data show that ALPINE is scalable, and boosts link prediction
accuracy with far fewer queries.

Title: A Regression Tsetlin Machine with Integer Weighted Clauses for Compact
  Pattern Representation
Authors: K. Darshana Abeyrathna, Ole-Christoffer Granmo, Morten Goodwin
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables
\\
  The Regression Tsetlin Machine (RTM) addresses the lack of interpretability
impeding state-of-the-art nonlinear regression models. It does this by using
conjunctive clauses in propositional logic to capture the underlying non-linear
frequent patterns in the data. These, in turn, are combined into a continuous
output through summation, akin to a linear regression function, however, with
non-linear components and unity weights. Although the RTM has solved non-linear
regression problems with competitive accuracy, the resolution of the output is
proportional to the number of clauses employed. This means that computation
cost increases with resolution. To reduce this problem, we here introduce
integer weighted RTM clauses. Our integer weighted clause is a compact
representation of multiple clauses that capture the same sub-pattern-N
repeating clauses are turned into one, with an integer weight N. This reduces
computation cost N times, and increases interpretability through a sparser
representation. We further introduce a novel learning scheme that allows us to
simultaneously learn both the clauses and their weights, taking advantage of
so-called stochastic searching on the line. We evaluate the potential of the
integer weighted RTM empirically using six artificial datasets. The results
show that the integer weighted RTM is able to acquire on par or better accuracy
using significantly less computational resources compared to regular RTMs. We
further show that integer weights yield improved accuracy over real-valued
ones.

Title: Minimax Defense against Gradient-based Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Blerta Lindqvist, Rauf Izmailov
Categories: cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML
\\
  State-of-the-art adversarial attacks are aimed at neural network classifiers.
By default, neural networks use gradient descent to minimize their loss
function. The gradient of a classifier's loss function is used by
gradient-based adversarial attacks to generate adversarially perturbed images.
We pose the question whether another type of optimization could give neural
network classifiers an edge. Here, we introduce a novel approach that uses
minimax optimization to foil gradient-based adversarial attacks. Our minimax
classifier is the discriminator of a generative adversarial network (GAN) that
plays a minimax game with the GAN generator. In addition, our GAN generator
projects all points onto a manifold that is different from the original
manifold since the original manifold might be the cause of adversarial attacks.
To measure the performance of our minimax defense, we use adversarial attacks -
Carlini Wagner (CW), DeepFool, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) - on three
datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10 and German Traffic Sign (TRAFFIC). Against CW
attacks, our minimax defense achieves 98.07% (MNIST-default 98.93%), 73.90%
(CIFAR-10-default 83.14%) and 94.54% (TRAFFIC-default 96.97%). Against DeepFool
attacks, our minimax defense achieves 98.87% (MNIST), 76.61% (CIFAR-10) and
94.57% (TRAFFIC). Against FGSM attacks, we achieve 97.01% (MNIST), 76.79%
(CIFAR-10) and 81.41% (TRAFFIC). Our Minimax adversarial approach presents a
significant shift in defense strategy for neural network classifiers.

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  An important component of many Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms is the
Experience Replay which serves as a storage mechanism or memory of made
experiences. These experiences are used for training and help the agent to
stably find the perfect trajectory through the problem space. The classic
Experience Replay however makes only use of the experiences it actually made,
but the stored samples bear great potential in form of knowledge about the
problem that can be extracted. We present an algorithm that creates synthetic
experiences in a nondeterministic discrete environment to assist the learner.
The Interpolated Experience Replay is evaluated on the FrozenLake environment
and we show that it can support the agent to learn faster and even better than
the classic version.

  We consider the problem of cost sensitive multiclass classification, where we
would like to increase the sensitivity of an important class at the expense of
a less important one. We adopt an {\em apportioned margin} framework to address
this problem, which enables an efficient margin shift between classes that
share the same boundary. The decision boundary between all pairs of classes
divides the margin between them in accordance to a given prioritization vector,
which yields a tighter error bound for the important classes while also
reducing the overall out-of-sample error. In addition to demonstrating an
efficient implementation of our framework, we derive generalization bounds,
demonstrate Fisher consistency, adapt the framework to Mercer's kernel and to
neural networks, and report promising empirical results on all accounts.

  Real-world text classification tasks often require many labeled training
examples that are expensive to obtain. Recent advancements in machine teaching,
specifically the data programming paradigm, facilitate the creation of training
data sets quickly via a general framework for building weak models, also known
as labeling functions, and denoising them through ensemble learning techniques.
We present a fast, simple data programming method for augmenting text data sets
by generating neighborhood-based weak models with minimal supervision.
Furthermore, our method employs an iterative procedure to identify sparsely
distributed examples from large volumes of unlabeled data. The iterative data
programming techniques improve newer weak models as more labeled data is
confirmed with human-in-loop. We show empirical results on sentence
classification tasks, including those from a task of improving intent

Title: Learning Task-Driven Control Policies via Information Bottlenecks
Authors: Vincent Pacelli and Anirudha Majumdar
Categories: cs.LG cs.RO math.OC stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages, 5 figures
\\
  This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach to synthesizing
task-driven control policies for robotic systems equipped with rich sensory
modalities (e.g., vision or depth). Standard reinforcement learning algorithms
typically produce policies that tightly couple control actions to the entirety
of the system's state and rich sensor observations. As a consequence, the
resulting policies can often be sensitive to changes in task-irrelevant
portions of the state or observations (e.g., changing background colors). In
contrast, the approach we present here learns to create a task-driven
representation that is used to compute control actions. Formally, this is
achieved by deriving a policy gradient-style algorithm that creates an
information bottleneck between the states and the task-driven representation;
this constrains actions to only depend on task-relevant information. We
demonstrate our approach in a thorough set of simulation results on multiple
examples including a grasping task that utilizes depth images and a
ball-catching task that utilizes RGB images. Comparisons with a standard policy
gradient approach demonstrate that the task-driven policies produced by our
algorithm are often significantly more robust to sensor noise and
task-irrelevant changes in the environment.

  Predicting sales opportunities outcome is a core to successful business

mostly on subjective human evaluations in the process of business to business
(B2B) sales decision making. Here, we proposed a practical Machine Learning

ML). This workflow consists of two pipelines: 1) an ML pipeline that trains
probabilistic predictive models in parallel on the closed sales opportunities
data enhanced with an extensive feature engineering procedure for automated
selection and parameterization of an optimal ML model and 2) a Prediction
pipeline that uses the optimal ML model to estimate the likelihood of winning
new sales opportunities as well as predicting their outcome using optimized
decision boundaries. The performance of the proposed workflow was evaluated on
a real sales dataset of a B2B consulting firm.

Title: Cartesian Difference Categories: Extended Report
Authors: Mario Alvarez-Picallo, Jean-Simon Pacaud Lemay
Categories: cs.LO math.CT
Comments: 26 pages
\\
  Cartesian differential categories are categories equipped with a differential
combinator which axiomatizes the directional derivative. Important models of
Cartesian differential categories include classical differential calculus of
smooth functions and categorical models of the differential lambda-calculus.
However, Cartesian differential categories cannot account for other interesting
notions of differentiation such as the calculus of finite differences or the
Boolean differential calculus. On the other hand, change action models have
been shown to capture these examples as well as more "exotic" examples of
differentiation. However, change action models are very general and do not
share the nice properties of a Cartesian differential category. In this paper,
we introduce Cartesian difference categories as a bridge between Cartesian
differential categories and change action models. We show that every Cartesian
differential category is a Cartesian difference category, and how certain
well-behaved change action models are Cartesian difference categories. In
particular, Cartesian difference categories model both the differential
calculus of smooth functions and the calculus of finite differences.
Furthermore, every Cartesian difference category comes equipped with a tangent
bundle monad whose Kleisli category is again a Cartesian difference category.

Title: Intersection Type Distributors
Authors: Federico Olimpieri
Categories: cs.LO
Comments: Submitted
\\
  Building on previous works, we present a general method to define proof
relevant intersection types semantics for pure lambda calculus. We argue that
the bicategory of distributors is an appropriate categorical framework for this
kind of semantics. We first introduce a class of 2-monads whose algebras are
monoidal categories modelling resource management, following Marsden-Zwardt's
approach. We show how these monadic constructions determine Kleisli
bicategories over the bicategory of distributors and we give a sufficient
condition for cartesian closedness. We define a family of non-extentional
models for pure lambda calculus. We then prove that the interpretation of
lambda terms induced by these models can be concretely described via
intersection type systems. The intersection constructor corresponds to the

Title: Spatially Variant Laplacian Pyramids for Multi-Frame Exposure Fusion
Authors: Anmol Biswas, Green Rosh K S, and Sachin Deepak Lomte
Categories: cs.MM
\\
  Laplacian Pyramid Blending is a commonly used method for several seamless
image blending tasks. While the method works well for images with comparable
intensity levels, it is often unable to produce artifact free images for
applications which handle images with large intensity variation such as
exposure fusion. This paper proposes a spatially varying Laplacian Pyramid
Blending to blend images with large intensity differences. The proposed method
dynamically alters the blending levels during the final stage of Pyramid
Reconstruction based on the amount of local intensity variation. The proposed
algorithm out performs state-of-the-art methods for image blending both
qualitatively as well as quantitatively on publicly available High Dynamic
Range (HDR) imaging dataset. Qualitative improvements are demonstrated in terms
of details, halos and dark halos. For quantitative comparison, the no-reference
perceptual metric MEF-SSIM was used.

Title: Convexification for a 1D Hyperbolic Coefficient Inverse Problem with

\\
  A version of the convexification numerical method for a Coefficient Inverse
Problem for a 1D hyperbolic PDE is presented. The data for this problem are
generated by a single measurement event. This method converges globally. The
most important element of the construction is the presence of the Carleman
Weight Function in a weighted Tikhonov-like functional. This functional is
strictly convex on a certain bounded set in a Hilbert space, and the diameter
of this set is an arbitrary positive number. The global convergence of the
gradient projection method is established. Computational results demonstrate a
good performance of the numerical method for noisy data.

Title: A note on the accuracy of the generalized-$\alpha$ scheme for the
  incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
Authors: Ju Liu and Ingrid S. Lan and Oguz Z. Tikenogullari and Alison L.
  Marsden
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We investigate the temporal accuracy of two generalized-$\alpha$ schemes for
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The conventional approach treats
the pressure with the backward Euler method while discretizing the remainder of
the Navier-Stokes equations with the generalized-$\alpha$ method. We developed
a suite of numerical codes using inf-sup stable higher-order non-uniform
rational B-spline (NURBS) elements for spatial discretization. In doing so, we
are able to achieve very high spatial accuracy and, furthermore, to perform
temporal refinement without consideration of the stabilization terms, which can
degenerate for small time steps. Numerical experiments suggest that only
first-order accuracy is achieved, at least for the pressure, in this aforesaid
approach. Evaluating the pressure at the intermediate time step recovers
second-order accuracy, and the numerical implementation, in fact, becomes
simpler. Therefore, although the pressure can be viewed as a Lagrange
multiplier enforcing the incompressibility constraint, its temporal
discretization is not independent and should be subject to the
generalized-$\alpha$ method in order to maintain second-order accuracy of the
overall algorithm.

Title: An all-at-once preconditioner for evolutionary partial differential

\\
  In [McDonald, Pestana and Wathen, \textit{SIAM J. Sci. Comput.}, 40 (2018),
pp. A1012--A1033], a block circulant preconditioner is proposed for all-at-once
linear systems arising from evolutionary partial differential equations, in
which the preconditioned matrix is proven to be diagonalizable and to have
identity-plus-low-rank decomposition under the setting of heat equation. In
this paper, we generalize the block circulant preconditioner by introducing a
small parameter $\epsilon>0$ into the top-right block of the block circulant
preconditioner. The implementation of the generalized preconditioner requires
the same computational complexity as that of the block circulant one.
Theoretically, we prove that (i) the generalization preserves the
diagonalizability and the identity-plus-low-rank decomposition; (ii) all
eigenvalues of the new preconditioned matrix are clustered at 1 with the
clustering radius positively related to $\epsilon$; (iii) GMRES method for the
preconditioned system has a linear convergence rate independent of size of the
linear system when $\epsilon$ is taken to be smaller or comparable with square
root of time-step size. Numerical results are reported to confirm the
efficiency of the proposed preconditioner and to show that the generalization
improves the performance of block circulant preconditioner.

  The ultra-relativistic Euler equations for an ideal gas are described in
terms of the pressure $p$, the spatial part $\underline{u} \in \R^3$ of the
dimensionless four-velocity and the particle density $n$. Radially symmetric
solutions of these equations are studied. Analytical solutions are presented
for the linearized system. For the original nonlinear equations we design and
analyze a numerical scheme for simulating radially symmetric solutions in three
space dimensions. The good performance of the scheme is demonstrated by
numerical examples. In particular, it was observed that the method has the
capability to capture accurately the pressure singularity formation caused by
shock wave reflections at the origin.

Title: A local radial basis function method for the Laplace-Beltrami operator
Authors: Diego Alvarez, Pedro Gonzalez-Rodriguez and Manuel Kindelan
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We introduce a new local meshfree method for the approximation of the
Laplace-Beltrami operator on a smooth surface of co-dimension one embedded in
$\R^3$. A key element of this method is that it does not need an explicit
expression of the surface, which can be simply defined by a set of scattered
nodes. It does not require expressions for the surface normal vectors and for
the curvature of the surface neither, which are approximated using formulas
derived in the paper. An additional advantage is that it is a local method and,
hence, the matrix that approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator is sparse,
which translates into good scalability properties. The convergence, accuracy
and other computational characteristics of the method are studied numerically.
The performance is shown by solving two reaction-diffusion partial differential
equations on surfaces; the Turing model for pattern formation, and the
Schaeffer's model for electrical cardiac tissue behavior.

Title: Coalescing Eigenvalues and Crossing Eigencurves of 1-Parameter Matrix
  Flows

Comments: 15 pages, 11 graphs
MSC-class: 15A60, 65F15, 65F30, 15A18
\\
  We investigate the eigenvalue curves of 1-parameter hermitean and general
complex or real matrix flows $A(t)$ in light of their geometry and the uniform
decomposability of $A(t)$ for all parameters $t$. The often misquoted and
misapplied results by Hund and von Neumann and by Wigner for eigencurve
crossings from the late 1920s are clarified for hermitean matrix flows $A(t) =
(A(t))^*$. A conjecture on extending these results to general non-normal or
non-hermitean 1-parameter matrix flows is formulated and investigated. An
algorithm to compute the block dimensions of uniformly decomposable hermitean
matrix flows is described and tested. The algorithm uses the ZNN method to
compute the time-varying matrix eigenvalue curves of $A(t)$ for $t_o \leq t\leq
t_f$. Similar efforts for general complex matrix flows are described. This
extension leads to many new and open problems. Specifically, we point to the
difficult relationship between the geometry of eigencurves for general complex
matrix flows $A(t)$ and a general flow's decomposability into blockdiagonal
form via one fixed unitary or general matrix similarity for all parameters $t$.

\\
  Sparse polynomial chaos expansions are a popular surrogate modelling method
that takes advantage of the properties of polynomial chaos expansions (PCE),
the sparsity-of-effects principle, and powerful sparse regression solvers to
approximate computer models with many input parameters, relying on only few
model evaluations.Within the last decade, a large number of algorithms for the
computation of sparse PCE have been published in the applied math and
engineering literature. We present an extensive review of the existing methods
and develop a framework to classify the algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct a
benchmark on a selection of methods to identify which methods work best in
practical applications. Comparing their accuracy on several benchmark models of
varying dimension and complexity, we find that the choice of sparse regression
solver and sampling scheme for the computation of a sparse PCE surrogate can
make a significant difference, of up to several orders of magnitude in the
resulting mean-square error. Different methods seem to be superior in different
regimes of model dimensionality and experimental design size.

Title: Fast Multipole Method for 3-D Linearized Poisson-Boltzmann Equation in

Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1908.10863,
  arXiv:1902.05132
\\
  In this paper, we propose a fast multipole method (FMM) for 3-D linearized
Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation in layered media. The main framework of the
algorithm is analogous to the FMM for Helmholtz and Laplace equation in layered
media [1,2], using an extension of the Funk-Hecke formula for pure imaginary
wave number. Moreover, a recurrence formula is provided for the run-time
computation of the Sommerfeld-type integrals used in the FMM algorithm. Due to
the similarity between Helmholtz and linearized PB equation, the recurrence
formula can also be used for the FMM of Helmholtz equation in layered media
with minor changes as mentioned in [1] . Numerical results validate that the
FMM for interactions of charges under screen's potentials in layered media has
the same accuracy and CPU complexity as the classic FMM for charge interactions
in free space.

\\
  Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used, with huge success, to model
phenomena arising across all scientific and engineering disciplines. However,
across an equally wide swath, there exist situations in which PDE models fail
to adequately model observed phenomena or are not the best available model for
that purpose. On the other hand, in many situations, nonlocal models that
account for interaction occurring at a distance have been shown to more
faithfully and effectively model observed phenomena that involve possible
singularities and other anomalies. In this article, we consider a generic
nonlocal model, beginning with a short review of its definition, the properties
of its solution, its mathematical analysis, and specific concrete examples. We
then provide extensive discussions about numerical methods, including finite
element, finite difference, and spectral methods, for determining approximate
solutions of the nonlocal models considered. In that discussion, we pay
particular attention to a special class of nonlocal models that are the most
widely studied in the literature, namely those involving fractional
derivatives. The article ends with brief considerations of several modeling and
algorithmic extensions which serve to show the wide applicability of nonlocal
modeling.

Title: Longer time accuracy for incompressible Navier-Stokes simulations with
  the EMAC formulation
Authors: Maxim A. Olshanskii and Leo G. Rebholz
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 22 pages, 9 figures
MSC-class: 65M60 (Primary) 35Q30, 76D05 (Secondary)
\\
  In this paper, we consider the recently introduced EMAC formulation for the
incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, which is the only known NS
formulation that conserves energy, momentum and angular momentum when the
divergence constraint is only weakly enforced. Since its introduction, the EMAC
formulation has been successfully used for a wide variety of fluid dynamics
problems. We prove that discretizations using the EMAC formulation are
potentially better than those built on the commonly used skew-symmetric
formulation, by deriving a better longer time error estimate for EMAC: while
the classical results for schemes using the skew-symmetric formulation have
Gronwall constants dependent on $\exp(C\cdot Re\cdot T)$ with $Re$ the Reynolds
number, it turns out that the EMAC error estimate is free from this explicit
exponential dependence on the Reynolds number. Additionally, it is demonstrated
how EMAC admits smaller lower bounds on its velocity error, since {incorrect
treatment of linear momentum, angular momentum and energy induces} lower bounds
for $L^2$ velocity error, and EMAC treats these quantities more accurately.
Results of numerical tests for channel flow past a cylinder and 2D
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are also given, both of which show that the
advantages of EMAC over the skew-symmetric formulation increase as the Reynolds
number gets larger and for longer simulation times.

Title: Generalized Structure Preserving Preconditioners for Frame-Based Image
  Deblurring
Authors: Davide Bianchi, Alessandro Buccini
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We are interested in fast and stable iterative regularization methods for
image deblurring problems with space invariant blur. The associated coefficient
matrix has a Block Toeplitz Toeplitz Blocks (BTTB) like structure plus a small
rank correction depending on the boundary conditions imposed on the imaging
model. In the literature, several strategies have been proposed in the attempt
to define proper preconditioner for iterative regularization methods that
involve such linear systems. Usually, the preconditioner is chosen to be a
Block Circulant with Circulant Blocks (BCCB) matrix because it can be
efficiently exploit Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for any computation, including
the (pseudo-)inversion. Nevertheless, for ill-conditioned problems, it is well
known that BCCB preconditioners cannot provide a strong clustering of the
eigenvalues. Moreover, in order to get an effective preconditioner, it is
crucial to preserve the structure of the coefficient matrix.
  On the other hand, thresholding iterative methods have been recently
successfully applied to image deblurring problems, exploiting the sparsity of
the image in a proper wavelet domain. Motivated by the results of recent
papers, we combine a nonstationary preconditioned iteration with the modified
linearized Bregman algorithm (MLBA) and proper regularization operators.
  Several numerical experiments shows the performances of our methods in terms
of quality of the restorations.

Title: The Node Weight Dependent Traveling Salesperson Problem: Approximation
  Algorithms and Randomized Search Heuristics
Authors: Jakob Bossek, Katrin Casel, Pascal Kerschke and Frank Neumann
Categories: cs.NE
\\
  Several important optimization problems in the area of vehicle routing can be
seen as a variant of the classical Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). In the
area of evolutionary computation, the traveling thief problem (TTP) has gained
increasing interest over the last 5 years. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of weights on such problems, in the sense that the cost of traveling
increases with respect to the weights of nodes already visited during a tour.
This provides abstractions of important TSP variants such as the Traveling
Thief Problem and time dependent TSP variants, and allows to study precisely
the increase in difficulty caused by weight dependence. We provide a
3.59-approximation for this weight dependent version of TSP with metric
distances and bounded positive weights. Furthermore, we conduct experimental
investigations for simple randomized local search with classical mutation
operators and two variants of the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm EAX
adapted to the weighted TSP. Our results show the impact of the node weights on
the position of the nodes in the resulting tour.

  Declarative memory has been studied for its relationship with remembering
daily life experiences. Previous studies reported changes in power spectra
during encoding phase related to behavioral performance, however decoding phase
still needs to be explored. This study investigates neural oscillations changes
related to memory process. Participants were asked to perform a memory task for
encoding and decoding phase while EEG signals were recorded. Results showed
that for encoding phase, there was a significant decrease of power in low beta,
high beta bands over fronto-central area and a decrease in low beta, high beta
and gamma bands over left temporal area related to successful subsequent memory
effects. For decoding phase, only significant decreases of alpha power were
observed over fronto-central area. This finding showed relevance of beta and
alpha band for encoding and decoding phase of a memory task respectively.

  Inspired by the connectivity mechanisms in the brain, neuromorphic computing
architectures model Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in silicon. As such,
neuromorphic architectures are designed and developed with the goal of having
small, low power chips that can perform control and machine learning tasks.
However, the power consumption of the developed hardware can greatly depend on
the size of the network that is being evaluated on the chip. Furthermore, the
accuracy of a trained SNN that is evaluated on chip can change due to voltage
and current variations in the hardware that perturb the learned weights of the
network. While efforts are made on the hardware side to minimize those
perturbations, a software based strategy to make the deployed networks more
resilient can help further alleviate that issue. In this work, we study Spiking
Neural Networks in two neuromorphic architecture implementations with the goal
of decreasing their size, while at the same time increasing their resiliency to
hardware faults. We leverage an evolutionary algorithm to train the SNNs and
propose a multiobjective fitness function to optimize the size and resiliency
of the SNN. We demonstrate that this strategy leads to well-performing,
small-sized networks that are more resilient to hardware faults.

Title: Distributed Resource Allocation for Network Slicing of Bandwidth and

Authors: Anqi Huang, Yingyu Li, Yong Xiao, Xiaohu Ge, Sumei Sun, Han-Chieh Chao
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Network slicing has been considered as one of the key enablers for 5G to
support diversified services and application scenarios. This paper studies the
distributed network slicing utilizing both the spectrum resource offered by
communication network and computational resources of a coexisting fog computing
network. We propose a novel distributed framework based on a new control plane
entity, regional orchestrator (RO), which can be deployed between base stations
(BSs) and fog nodes to coordinate and control their bandwidth and computational
resources. We propose a distributed resource allocation algorithm based on
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers with Partial Variable Splitting
(DistADMM-PVS). We prove that the proposed algorithm can minimize the average
latency of the entire network and at the same time guarantee satisfactory
latency performance for every supported type of service. Simulation results
show that the proposed algorithm converges much faster than some other existing
algorithms. The joint network slicing with both bandwidth and computational
resources can offer around 15% overall latency reduction compared to network
slicing with only a single resource.

Title: Cooperative Service Caching and Workload Scheduling in Mobile Edge
  Computing
Authors: Xiao Ma, Ao Zhou, Shan Zhang, Shangguang Wang
Categories: cs.NI
Comments: INFOCOM 2020
\\
  Mobile edge computing is beneficial to reduce service response time and core
network traffic by pushing cloud functionalities to network edge. Equipped with
storage and computation capacities, edge nodes can cache services of
resource-intensive and delay-sensitive mobile applications and process the
corresponding computation tasks without outsourcing to central clouds. However,
the heterogeneity of edge resource capacities and inconsistence of edge storage
and computation capacities make it difficult to jointly fully utilize the
storage and computation capacities when there is no cooperation among edge
nodes. To address this issue, we consider cooperation among edge nodes and
investigate cooperative service caching and workload scheduling in mobile edge
computing. This problem can be formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear
programming problem, which has non-polynomial computation complexity. To
overcome the challenges of subproblem coupling, computation-communication
tradeoff, and edge node heterogeneity, we develop an iterative algorithm called
ICE. This algorithm is designed based on Gibbs sampling, which has provably
near-optimal results, and the idea of water filling, which has polynomial
computation complexity. Simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate
that our algorithm can jointly reduce the service response time and the
outsourcing traffic compared with the benchmark algorithms.

Title: A Scalable IoT-Fog Framework for Urban Sound Sensing
Authors: Marc Baucas, Petros Spachos
Categories: cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated devices that can be used
to allow large-scale collection and analysis of data. However, as it grew, IoT
networks were not capable of managing the data from these services. As a
result, cloud computing was introduced to address the need for datacentres for
IoT networks. As the technology evolved, the demand for a proper means of
supporting and managing crowdsensing and real-time data increased, and cloud
servers could no longer keep up with the large volumes of incoming data. This
demand brought rise to fog computing. It became an extension to the cloud and
allowed resources to be allocated around the network effectively. Its
integration to IoT reduced the strain towards the cloud servers. However,
issues in high power consumption at the end device and data management
constraints surfaced. This paper proposes two approaches to alleviate these
issues to keep fog computing remain as a reliable option for IoT-related
applications. We created an IoT-based sensing framework that used an urban
sound classification model. Through active low and high power states and
resource reallocation, we created a network configuration. We tested this
configuration against IoT frameworks that use the default fog and cloud setups.
The results improved the framework's end device power consumption and server
latency. Overall, with the proposed framework, fog computing was proven to be
capable of supporting a scalable IoT framework for urban sound sensing.

Title: Multi-User Provisioning in Millimeter-Wave Urban Cellular Networks
Authors: Aleksandar Ichkov, Daniel Sialkowski, Petri M\"ah\"onen and Ljiljana
  Simi\'c

Comments: 14 pages, 17 figures
\\
  In this paper we present the first comprehensive study of the multi-user
capacity of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) urban cellular networks, using
site-specific ray-tracing propagation data and realistic antenna array
patterns. We compare the performance of TDMA and SDMA (time and spatial
division multiple access, respectively) for diverse network scenarios and
antenna configurations. We propose a greedy heuristic algorithm to solve the
network-wide directional link allocation problem, thereby estimating the
achievable capacity and coverage of multi-user mm-wave networks. Our results
show that inter-cell interference is negligible, so that TDMA performance is
strictly limited by air-time sharing. By contrast, the major limiting factor
for SDMA is intra-cell interference, emphasizing the impact of real antenna
array sidelobes. Nonetheless, SDMA significantly outperforms TDMA in terms of
average UE throughput, by up to 2 Gbps using 8x8 arrays. As an important design
insight, our results show that larger base station antenna arrays limit
intra-cell interference while compensating for small UE arrays, reducing costs
and beamforming requirements in practical SDMA networks. Our analysis also
shows that the limited number of antenna sub-arrays in a practical hybrid
beamforming architecture may force SDMA to drop UEs with good coverage,
highlighting a tradeoff between base station densification and antenna
resources.

Title: The Limits of LoRaWAN in Event-Triggered Wireless Networked Control

\\
  Wireless sensors and actuators offer benefits to large industrial control
systems. The absence of wires for communication reduces the deployment cost,
maintenance effort, and provides greater flexibility for sensor and actuator
location and system architecture. These benefits come at a cost of a high
probability of communication delay or message loss due to the unreliability of
radio-based communication. This unreliability poses a challenge to contemporary
control systems that are designed with the assumption of instantaneous and
reliable communication. Wireless sensors and actuators create a paradigm shift
in engineering energy-efficient control schemes coupled with robust
communication schemes that can maintain system stability in the face of
unreliable communication. This paper investigates the feasibility of using the
low-power wide-area communication protocol LoRaWAN with an event-triggered
control scheme through modelling in Matlab. We show that LoRaWAN is capable of
meeting the maximum delay and message loss requirements of an event-triggered
controller for certain classes of applications. We also expose the limitation
in the use of LoRaWAN when message size or communication range requirements
increase or the underlying physical system is exposed to significant external
disturbances.

  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are evolving with advances in new
technology. The addition of wireless sensors and actuators and new control
techniques means that engineering practices from communication systems are
being integrated into those used for control systems. The two are engineered in
very different ways. Neither engineering approach is capable of accounting for
the subtle interactions and interdependence that occur when the two are
combined. This paper describes our first steps to bridge this gap, and push the
boundaries of both computer communication system and control system design. We
present The Separator testbed, a Cyber-Physical testbed enabling our search for
a suitable way to engineer systems that combine both computer networks and

Title: Learning robotic ultrasound scanning using probabilistic temporal
  ranking
Authors: Michael Burke, Katie Lu, Daniel Angelov, Art\=uras Strai\v{z}ys, Craig
  Innes, Kartic Subr, Subramanian Ramamoorthy
Categories: cs.RO cs.LG
\\
  This paper addresses a common class of problems where a robot learns to
perform a discovery task based on example solutions, or human demonstrations.
For example consider the problem of ultrasound scanning, where the
demonstration requires that an expert adaptively searches for a satisfactory
view of internal organs, vessels or tissue and potential anomalies while
maintaining optimal contact between the probe and surface tissue. Such problems
are currently solved by inferring notional rewards that, when optimised for,
result in a plan that mimics demonstrations. A pivotal assumption, that plans
with higher reward should be exponentially more likely, leads to the de facto
approach for reward inference in robotics. While this approach of maximum
entropy inverse reinforcement learning leads to a general and elegant
formulation, it struggles to cope with frequently encountered sub-optimal
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to cope with
the class of problems where sub-optimal demonstrations occur frequently. We
hypothesise that, in tasks which require discovery, successive states of any
demonstration are progressively more likely to be associated with a higher
reward. We formalise this temporal ranking approach and show that it improves
upon maximum-entropy approaches to perform reward inference for autonomous
ultrasound scanning, a novel application of learning from demonstration in
medical imaging.

Title: Tackling Existence Probabilities of Objects with Motion Planning for
  Automated Urban Driving
Authors: Omer Sahin Tas and Christoph Stiller
Categories: cs.RO
Comments: 5 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Motion planners take uncertain information about the environment as an input.
The environment information is most of the time noisy and has a tendency to
contain false positive object detections, rather than false negatives. The
state-of-the art motion planning approaches take uncertain state and prediction
of objects into account, but fail to distinguish between their existence
probabilities.
  In this paper we present a planning approach that considers the existence
probabilities of objects. The proposed approach reacts to falsely detected
phantom objects smoothly, and in this way tolerates the faults arising from
perception and prediction without performing harsh reactions, unless such
reactions are unavoidable for maintaining safety.

Title: Koopman-based Control of a Soft Continuum Manipulator Under Variable
  Loading Conditions
Authors: Daniel Bruder, Xun Fu, R. Brent Gillespie, C. David Remy, and Ram
  Vasudevan
Categories: cs.RO
\\
  Controlling soft continuum manipulator arms is difficult due to their
infinite degrees of freedom, nonlinear material properties, and large
deflections under loading. This paper presents a data-driven approach to
identifying soft manipulator models that enables consistent control under
variable loading conditions. This is achieved by incorporating loads into a
linear Koopman operator model as states and estimating their values online via
an observer within the control loop. Using this approach, real-time, fully
autonomous control of a pneumatically actuated soft continuum manipulator is
achieved. In several trajectory following experiments, this controller is shown
to be more accurate and precise than controllers based on models that are
unable to explicitly account for loading. The manipulator also successfully
performs pick and place of objects with unknown mass, demonstrating the
efficacy of this approach in executing real-world manipulation tasks.

\\
  Building software that can support the huge growth in data and computation
required by modern research needs individuals with increasingly specialist
skill sets that take time to develop and maintain. The Research Software
Engineering movement, which started in the UK and has been built up over recent
years, aims to recognise and support these individuals. Why does research
software matter to professional software development practitioners outside the
research community? Research software can have great impact on the wider world
and recent progress means the area can now be considered as a more realistic
option for a professional software development career. In this article we
present a structure, along with supporting evidence of real-world activities,
that defines four elements that we believe are key to providing comprehensive
and sustainable support for Research Software Engineering. We also highlight
ways that the wider developer community can learn from, and engage with, these
activities.

Comments: 13 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Developers often need to use appropriate APIs to program efficiently, but it
is usually a difficult task to identify the exact one they need from a vast of
candidates. To ease the burden, a multitude of API recommendation approaches
have been proposed. However, most of the currently available API recommenders
do not support the effective integration of users' feedback into the
recommendation loop. In this paper, we propose a framework, BRAID (Boosting
RecommendAtion with Implicit FeeDback), which leverages learning-to-rank and
active learning techniques to boost recommendation performance. By exploiting
users' feedback information, we train a learning-to-rank model to re-rank the
recommendation results. In addition, we speed up the feedback learning process
with active learning. Existing query-based API recommendation approaches can be
plugged into BRAID. We select three state-of-the-art API recommendation
approaches as baselines to demonstrate the performance enhancement of BRAID
measured by Hit@k (Top-k), MAP, and MRR. Empirical experiments show that, with
acceptable overheads, the recommendation performance improves steadily and
substantially with the increasing percentage of feedback data, comparing with
the baselines.

clones on SO and point to open questions that need to be addressed to be able
to make data-informed decisions about how to properly handle clones on this
important platform. We present results from a first preliminary investigation,
indicating that clones on SO are common and diverse. We further point to
specific challenges, including incentives for users to clone successful answers
and difficulties with bulk edits on the platform, and conclude with possible
directions for future work.

Title: Adversarial Attacks to Scale-Free Networks: Testing the Robustness of
  Physical Criteria
Authors: Qi Xuan and Yalu Shan and Jinhuan Wang and Zhongyuan Ruan and Guanrong

Comments: 10pages, 6figures,
\\
  Adversarial attacks have been alerting the artificial intelligence community
recently, since many machine learning algorithms were found vulnerable to
malicious attacks. This paper studies adversarial attacks to scale-free
networks to test their robustness in terms of statistical measures. In addition
to the well-known random link rewiring (RLR) attack, two heuristic attacks are
formulated and simulated: degree-addition-based link rewiring (DALR) and
degree-interval-based link rewiring (DILR). These three strategies are applied
to attack a number of strong scale-free networks of various sizes generated
from the Barab\'asi-Albert model. It is found that both DALR and DILR are more
effective than RLR, in the sense that rewiring a smaller number of links can
succeed in the same attack. However, DILR is as concealed as RLR in the sense
that they both are constructed by introducing a relatively small number of
changes on several typical structural properties such as average shortest
path-length, average clustering coefficient, and average diagonal distance. The
results of this paper suggest that to classify a network to be scale-free has
to be very careful from the viewpoint of adversarial attack effects.

\\
  Control theory provides engineers with a multitude of tools to design
controllers that manipulate the closed-loop behavior and stability of dynamical
systems. These methods rely heavily on insights about the mathematical model
governing the physical system. However, if a system is highly complex, it might
be infeasible to produce a reliable mathematical model of the system. Without a
model most of the theoretical tools to develop control laws break down. In
these settings, machine learning controllers become attractive: Controllers
that can learn and adapt to complex systems, developing control laws where the
engineer cannot. This article focuses on utilizing machine learning controllers
in practical applications, specifically using deep reinforcement learning in
motion control systems for an autonomous underwater vehicle with six
degrees-of-freedom. Two methods are considered: end-to-end learning, where the
vehicle is left entirely alone to explore the solution space in its search for
an optimal policy, and PID assisted learning, where the DRL controller is
essentially split into three separate parts, each controlling its own actuator.

\\
  In this paper we propose a dynamical transmission power allocation for
elastic optical networks (EONs) based on the evolutionary hurricane search
optimization (HSO) algorithm with a chaotic logistic map diversification
strategy with the purpose of improving the capability to escape from local
optima, namely CHSO. The aiming is the dynamical control of the transmitted
optical powers according to the each link state variations due to traffic
fluctuations, channel impairments, as well as other channel-power coupling
effects. Such realistic EON scenarios are affected mainly by the channel
estimation inaccuracy, channel ageing and power fluctuations. The link state is
based on the channel estimation and quality of transmission (QoT) parameters
obtained from the optical performance monitors (OPMs). Numerical results have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the CHSO to dynamically mitigate the power
penalty under real measurements conditions with uncertainties and noise, as
well as when perturbations in the optical transmit powers are considered.

\\
  Growing penetration of renewable generation in power systems brings more
challenges in transient stability assessment using direct methods. One of the
reasons is the inability to assess the risk of instability brought by tripping
of a large amount of RGs due to violation of their ride through curves. In this
paper, a scalable approach is proposed based on the Lyapunov functions family
to estimate the stability region under ride through constraints. An inner
polytopic approximation to the feasibility region is proposed to convexify the
overall problem. The acquired constrained stability region estimate helps
capture trajectories that trigger undesirable tripping of renewable generation.
A 2-machine system is used to visualize its effectiveness.

Comments: 16 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Because of increasing amounts of intermittent and distributed generators in
power systems, many demand response programs have been developed to schedule
flexible energy consumption. However, proper benchmarks for comparing these
methods are lacking, especially when decisions are made based on information
which is repeatedly updated. This paper presents a new benchmarking tool
designed to bridge this gap. Surveys that classify flexibility planning
algorithms were an input to define the benchmarking standards. The framework
can be used for different objectives and under diverse conditions faced by
electricity energy stakeholders interested in flexibility scheduling
algorithms. It includes a simulation environment that captures the evolution of
look--ahead information, which enables comparing online planning and scheduling
algorithms. The benchmarking tool is used to test seven planning algorithms
measuring their performance under uncertain market conditions. The results show
the importance of online decision making, the influence of data quality on the
algorithm performance, the benefit of using robust and stochastic programming
approaches, and the necessity of trustworthy benchmarking.

\\
  In this paper the stability of a closed-loop cascade control system in the
trajectory tracking task is addressed. The considered plant consists of
underlying second-order fully actuated perturbed dynamics and the first order
system which describes dynamics of the input. The main theoretical result
presented in the paper concerns stability conditions formulated based on the
Lyapunov analysis for the cascade control structure taking advantage of the
active rejection disturbance approach. In particular, limitations imposed on a
feasible set of an observer bandwidth are discussed. In order to illustrate
characteristics of the closed-loop control system simulation results are
presented. Furthermore, the controller is verified experimentally using a
two-axis telescope mount. The obtained results confirm that the considered
control strategy can be efficiently applied for mechanical systems when a high
tracking precision is required.

  The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is an algorithmic
framework for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization
problems, derived from an approximation to the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm
(QAA). In solving combinatorial optimization problems with constraints in the
context of QAOA or QAA, one needs to find a way to encode problem constraints
into the scheme. In this paper, we formalize different constraint types to
linear equalities, linear inequalities, and arbitrary form. Based on this, we
propose constraint-encoding schemes well-fitting into the QAOA framework for
solving NP combinatorial optimization problems. The implemented algorithms
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme by the
testing results of varied instances of some well-known NP optimization
problems. We argue that our work leads to a generalized framework for finding,
in the context of QAOA, high-quality approximate solutions to combinatorial
problems with various types of constraints.

Title: Differential Privacy for Stackelberg Games
Authors: Ferdinando Fioretto, Lesia Mitridati, Pascal Van Hentenryck
Categories: math.OC cs.CR
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1911.10178
\\
  This paper introduces a differentially private (DP) mechanism to protect the
information exchanged during the coordination of sequential and interdependent
markets. This coordination represents a classic Stackelberg game and relies on
the exchange of sensitive information between the system agents. The paper is
motivated by the observation that the perturbation introduced by traditional DP
mechanisms fundamentally changes the underlying optimization problem and even
leads to unsatisfiable instances. To remedy such limitation, the paper
introduces the Privacy-Preserving Stackelberg Mechanism (PPSM), a framework
that enforces the notions of feasibility and fidelity of the privacy-preserving
information to the original problem objective. PPSM complies with the notion of
differential privacy and ensures that the outcomes of the privacy-preserving
coordination mechanism are close-to-optimality for each agent. Experimental
results on several gas and electricity market benchmarks based on a real case
study demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Title: Improved inter-scanner MS lesion segmentation by adversarial training on
  longitudinal data
Authors: Mattias Billast, Maria Ines Meyer, Diana M. Sima and David Robben
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: MICCAI BrainLes 2019 Workshop
\\
  The evaluation of white matter lesion progression is an important biomarker
in the follow-up of MS patients and plays a crucial role when deciding the
course of treatment. Current automated lesion segmentation algorithms are
susceptible to variability in image characteristics related to MRI scanner or
protocol differences. We propose a model that improves the consistency of MS
lesion segmentations in inter-scanner studies. First, we train a CNN base model
to approximate the performance of icobrain, an FDA-approved clinically
available lesion segmentation software. A discriminator model is then trained
to predict if two lesion segmentations are based on scans acquired using the
same scanner type or not, achieving a 78% accuracy in this task. Finally, the
base model and the discriminator are trained adversarially on multi-scanner
longitudinal data to improve the inter-scanner consistency of the base model.
The performance of the models is evaluated on an unseen dataset containing
manual delineations. The inter-scanner variability is evaluated on test-retest
data, where the adversarial network produces improved results over the base
model and the FDA-approved solution.

Title: Stan: Small tumor-aware network for breast ultrasound image segmentation

\\
  Breast tumor segmentation provides accurate tumor boundary, and serves as a
key step toward further cancer quantification. Although deep learning-based
approaches have been proposed and achieved promising results, existing
approaches have difficulty in detecting small breast tumors. The capacity to
detecting small tumors is particularly important in finding early stage cancers
using computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In this paper, we propose a novel
deep learning architecture called Small Tumor-Aware Network (STAN), to improve
the performance of segmenting tumors with different size. The new architecture
integrates both rich context information and high-resolution image features. We
validate the proposed approach using seven quantitative metrics on two public
breast ultrasound datasets. The proposed approach outperformed the
state-of-the-art approaches in segmenting small breast tumors. Index

Title: Acoustic anomaly detection via latent regularized gaussian mixture
  generative adversarial networks

Categories: eess.AS cs.CV cs.LG cs.SD
\\
  Acoustic anomaly detection aims at distinguishing abnormal acoustic signals
from the normal ones. It suffers from the class imbalance issue and the lacking
in the abnormal instances. In addition, collecting all kinds of abnormal or
unknown samples for training purpose is impractical and timeconsuming. In this
paper, a novel Gaussian Mixture Generative Adversarial Network (GMGAN) is
proposed under semi-supervised learning framework, in which the underlying
structure of training data is not only captured in spectrogram reconstruction
space, but also can be further restricted in the space of latent representation
in a discriminant manner. Experiments show that our model has clear superiority
over previous methods, and achieves the state-of-the-art results on DCASE
dataset.

Title: Texture Classification using Block Intensity and Gradient Difference
  (BIGD) Descriptor
Authors: Yuting Hu, Zhen Wang, and Ghassan AlRegib
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
DOI: 10.1016/j.image.2019.115770
\\
  In this paper, we present an efficient and distinctive local descriptor,
namely block intensity and gradient difference (BIGD). In an image patch, we
randomly sample multi-scale block pairs and utilize the intensity and gradient
differences of pairwise blocks to construct the local BIGD descriptor. The
random sampling strategy and the multi-scale framework help BIGD descriptors
capture the distinctive patterns of patches at different orientations and
spatial granularity levels. We use vectors of locally aggregated descriptors
(VLAD) or improved Fisher vector (IFV) to encode local BIGD descriptors into a
full image descriptor, which is then fed into a linear support vector machine
(SVM) classifier for texture classification. We compare the proposed descriptor
with typical and state-of-the-art ones by evaluating their classification
performance on five public texture data sets including Brodatz, CUReT,
KTH-TIPS, and KTH-TIPS-2a and -2b. Experimental results show that the proposed
BIGD descriptor with stronger discriminative power yields 0.12% ~ 6.43% higher
classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art texture descriptor, dense
microblock difference (DMD).

Title: Robust Generative Restricted Kernel Machines using Weighted Conjugate
  Feature Duality
Authors: Arun Pandey, Joachim Schreurs, Johan A. K. Suykens
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  In the past decade, interest in generative models has grown tremendously.
However, their training performance can be highly affected by contamination,
where outliers are encoded in the representation of the model. This results in
the generation of noisy data. In this paper, we introduce a weighted conjugate
feature duality in the framework of Restricted Kernel Machines (RKMs). This
formulation is used to fine-tune the latent space of generative RKMs using a
weighting function based on the Minimum Covariance Determinant, which is a
highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter. Experiments show
that the weighted RKM is capable of generating clean images when contamination
is present in the training data. We further show that the robust method also
preserves uncorrelated feature learning through qualitative and quantitative
experiments on standard datasets.

Title: Fast reconstruction of atomic-scale STEM-EELS images from sparse
  sampling
Authors: Etienne Monier, Thomas Oberlin, Nathalie Brun, Xiaoyan Li, Marcel
  Tenc\'e, Nicolas Dobigeon
Categories: eess.IV cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.CV
\\
  This paper discusses the reconstruction of partially sampled spectrum-images
to accelerate the acquisition in scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM). The problem of image reconstruction has been widely considered in the
literature for many imaging modalities, but only a few attempts handled 3D data
such as spectral images acquired by STEM electron energy loss spectroscopy
(EELS). Besides, among the methods proposed in the microscopy literature, some
are fast but inaccurate while others provide accurate reconstruction but at the
price of a high computation burden. Thus none of the proposed reconstruction
methods fulfills our expectations in terms of accuracy and computation
complexity. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate reconstruction method
suited for atomic-scale EELS. This method is compared to popular solutions such
as beta process factor analysis (BPFA) which is used for the first time on
STEM-EELS images. Experiments based on real as synthetic data will be
conducted.

Title: Determination of the relative inclination and the viewing angle of an
  interacting pair of galaxies using convolutional neural networks
Authors: Prem Prakash, Arunima Banerjee, Pavan Kumar Perepu
Categories: astro-ph.GA cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Constructing dynamical models for interacting pair of galaxies as constrained
by their observed structure and kinematics crucially depends on the correct
choice of the values of the relative inclination ($i$) between their galactic
planes as well as the viewing angle ($\theta$), the angle between the line of
sight and the normal to the plane of their orbital motion. We construct Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models to determine the relative
inclination ($i$) and the viewing angle ($\theta$) of interacting galaxy pairs,
using N-body $+$ Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation data from the
GALMER database for training the same. In order to classify galaxy pairs based
on their $i$ values only, we first construct DCNN models for a (a) 2-class (
$i$ = 0 $^{\circ}$, 45$^{\circ}$ ) and (b) 3-class ($i = 0^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}
\text{ and } 90^{\circ}$) classification, obtaining $F_1$ scores of 99% and 98%
respectively. Further, for a classification based on both $i$ and $\theta$
values, we develop a DCNN model for a 9-class classification ($(i,\theta) \sim
(0^{\circ},15^{\circ}) ,(0^{\circ},45^{\circ}), (0^{\circ},90^{\circ}),
(45^{\circ},15^{\circ}), (45^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}), (45^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}),
(90^{\circ}, 15^{\circ}), (90^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}), (90^{\circ},90^{\circ})$),
and the $F_1$ score was 97$\%$. Finally, we tested our 2-class model on real
data of interacting galaxy pairs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR15,
and achieve an $F_1$ score of 78%. Our DCNN models could be further extended to
determine additional parameters needed to model dynamics of interacting galaxy
pairs, which is currently accomplished by trial and error method.

Title: Pixel-wise Conditioned Generative Adversarial Networks for Image
  Synthesis and Completion
Authors: Cyprien Ruffino and Romain H\'erault and Eric Laloy and Gilles Gasso
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven successful for
unsupervised image generation. Several works have extended GANs to image
inpainting by conditioning the generation with parts of the image to be
reconstructed. Despite their success, these methods have limitations in
settings where only a small subset of the image pixels is known beforehand. In
this paper we investigate the effectiveness of conditioning GANs when very few
pixel values are provided. We propose a modelling framework which results in
adding an explicit cost term to the GAN objective function to enforce
pixel-wise conditioning. We investigate the influence of this regularization
term on the quality of the generated images and the fulfillment of the given
pixel constraints. Using the recent PacGAN technique, we ensure that we keep
diversity in the generated samples. Conducted experiments on FashionMNIST show
that the regularization term effectively controls the trade-off between quality
of the generated images and the conditioning. Experimental evaluation on the
CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets evidences that our method achieves accurate
results both visually and quantitatively in term of Fr\'echet Inception
Distance, while still enforcing the pixel conditioning. We also evaluate our
method on a texture image generation task using fully-convolutional networks.
As a final contribution, we apply the method to a classical geological
simulation application.

Title: Introduction to quasi-open set semi-supervised learning for big data
  analytics
Authors: Emile R. Engelbrecht, Johan A. du Preez
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 16 Pages
\\
  State-of-the-art performance and low system complexity has made deep-learning
an increasingly attractive solution for big data analytics. However, limiting
assumptions of end-to-end learning regimes hinder the use of neural networks on
large application-grade datasets. This work addresses the assumption that
output class-labels are defined for all classes in the domain. The amount of
data collected by modern-day sensors span over an incomprehensible range of
potential classes. Therefore, we propose a new learning regime where only some,
but not all, classes of the training data are of interest to the classification
system. The semi-supervised learning scenario in big data requires the
assumption of a partial class mismatch between labelled and unlabelled training
data. With classification systems required to classify source classes indicated
by labelled samples while separating novel classes indicated by unlabelled
samples, we find ourselves in an open-set case (vs closed set with only source
classes). However, introducing samples from novel classes into the training set
indicates a more relaxed open-set case. As such, our proposed regime of
\textit{quasi-open set semi-supervised learning} is introduced. We propose a
suitable method to train under quasi-open set semi-supervised learning that
makes use of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs). A trained
classification certainty estimation within the discriminator (or critic)
network is used to enable a reject option for the classifier. By placing a
threshold on this certainty estimation, the reject option accepts
classifications of source classes and rejects novel classes. Big data
end-to-end training is promoted by developing models that recognize input
samples do not necessarily belong to output labels. We believe this essential
for big data analytics, and urge more work under quasi-open set semi-supervised
learning.

  CHIPP (Computing HTC in INAF Pilot Project) is an Italian project funded by
the Italian Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) and promoted by the ICT office of
INAF. The main purpose of the CHIPP project is to coordinate the use of, and
access to, already existing high throughput computing and high-performance
computing and data processing resources (for small/medium size programs) for
the INAF community. Today, Tier2/Tier3 systems (1,200 CPU/core) are provided at
the INAF institutes at Trieste and Catania, but in the future, the project will
evolve including also other computing infrastructures. During the last two
years, more than 30 programs have been approved for a total request of 30
Million CPU-h. Most of the programs are HPC, data reduction and analysis,
machine learning. In this paper, we describe in details the CHIPP
infrastructures and the results of the first two years of activity.

\\
  Cooperative training methods for distributed machine learning are typically
based on the exchange of local gradients or local model parameters. The latter
approach is known as Federated Learning (FL). An alternative solution with
reduced communication overhead, referred to as Federated Distillation (FD), was
recently proposed that exchanges only averaged model outputs. While prior work
studied implementations of FL over wireless fading channels, here we propose
wireless protocols for FD and for an enhanced version thereof that leverages an
offline communication phase to communicate ``mixed-up'' covariate vectors. The
proposed implementations consist of different combinations of digital schemes
based on separate source-channel coding and of over-the-air computing
strategies based on analog joint source-channel coding. It is shown that the
enhanced version FD has the potential to significantly outperform FL in the
presence of limited spectral resources.

\\
  The technologically-relevant task of feature extraction from data performed
in deep-learning systems is routinely accomplished as repeated fast Fourier
transforms (FFT) electronically in prevalent domain-specific architectures such
as in graphics processing units (GPUs). However, electronics systems are
limited with respect to power dissipation and delay, both, due to wire-charging
challenges related to interconnect capacitance. Here we present a silicon
photonics-based architecture for convolutional neural networks that harnesses
the phase property of light to perform FFTs efficiently by executing the
convolution as a multiplication in the Fourier-domain. The algorithmic
executing time is determined by the time-of-flight of the signal through this
photonic reconfigurable passive FFT filter circuit and is on the order of 10s
of picosecond. A sensitivity analysis shows that this optical processor must be
thermally phase stabilized corresponding to a few degrees. Furthermore, we find
that for a small sample number, the obtainable number of convolutions per
{time-power-chip area) outperforms GPUs by about 2 orders of magnitude. Lastly,
we show that, conceptually, the optical FFT and convolution-processing
performance is indeed directly linked to optoelectronic device-level, and
improvements in plasmonics, metamaterials or nanophotonics are fueling next
generation densely interconnected intelligent photonic circuits with relevance
for edge-computing 5G networks.

Title: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Multi-Antenna Joint Communication and
  Radar Transmissions
Authors: Chengcheng Xu, Bruno Clerckx, Shiwa Chen, Yijie Mao, Jianyun Zhang
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), relying on multi-antenna
Rate-Splitting (RS) techniques, has emerged as a powerful strategy for
multi-user multi-antenna systems. In this paper, RSMA is used as unified
multiple access for multi-antenna radar-communication (RadCom) system, where
the base station has a dual communication and radar capability to
simultaneously communicate with downlink users and probe detection signals to
azimuth angles of interests. Using RS, messages are split into common and
private parts, then encoded into common and private streams before being
precoded and transmitted. We design the message split and the precoders for
this RadCom system such that the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) is maximized and the
transmit beampattern is approximated to the desired radar beampattern under an
average transmit power constraint at each antenna. We then propose a framework
based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the
complicated non-convex optimization problem. Results highlight the benefits of
RSMA to unify RadCom transmissions and to manage the interference among radar
and communications, over the conventional Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA)
technique.

Title: Optimal Confidence Regions for the Multinomial Parameter
Authors: Matthew L. Malloy, Ardhendu Tripathy, Robert D. Nowak
Categories: stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.ST stat.TH
\\
  Construction of tight confidence regions and intervals is central to
statistical inference and decision-making. Consider an empirical distribution
$\widehat{\boldsymbol{p}}$ generated from $n$ iid realizations of a random
variable that takes one of $k$ possible values according to an unknown
distribution $\boldsymbol{p}$. This is analogous with a single draw from a
multinomial distribution. A confidence region is a subset of the probability
simplex that depends on $\widehat{\boldsymbol{p}}$ and contains the unknown
$\boldsymbol{p}$ with a specified confidence. This paper shows how one can
construct minimum average volume confidence regions, answering a long standing
question. We also show the optimality of the regions directly translates to
optimal confidence intervals of functionals, such as the mean, variance and
median.

Title: On the Sample Complexity and Optimization Landscape for Quadratic
  Feasibility Problems
Authors: Parth Thaker, Gautam Dasarathy, and Angelia Nedi\'c

\\
  We consider the problem of recovering a complex vector $\mathbf{x}\in
\mathbb{C}^n$ from $m$ quadratic measurements $\{\langle A_i\mathbf{x},
\mathbf{x}\rangle\}_{i=1}^m$. This problem, known as quadratic feasibility,
encompasses the well known phase retrieval problem and has applications in a
wide range of important areas including power system state estimation and x-ray
crystallography. In general, not only is the the quadratic feasibility problem
NP-hard to solve, but it may in fact be unidentifiable. In this paper, we
establish conditions under which this problem becomes {identifiable}, and
further prove isometry properties in the case when the matrices
$\{A_i\}_{i=1}^m$ are Hermitian matrices sampled from a complex Gaussian
distribution. Moreover, we explore a nonconvex {optimization} formulation of
this problem, and establish salient features of the associated optimization
landscape that enables gradient algorithms with an arbitrary initialization to
converge to a \emph{globally optimal} point with a high probability. Our
results also reveal sample complexity requirements for successfully identifying
a feasible solution in these contexts.

\\
  We consider the weak detection problem in a rank-one spiked Wigner data
matrix where the signal-to-noise ratio is small so that reliable detection is
impossible. We propose a hypothesis test on the presence of the signal by
utilizing the linear spectral statistics of the data matrix. The test is
data-driven and does not require prior knowledge about the distribution of the
signal or the noise. When the noise is Gaussian, the proposed test is optimal
in the sense that its error matches that of the likelihood ratio test, which
minimizes the sum of the Type-I and Type-II errors. If the density of the noise
is known and non-Gaussian, the error of the test can be lowered by applying an
entrywise transformation to the data matrix. We establish a central limit
theorem for the linear spectral statistics of general rank-one spiked Wigner
matrices as an intermediate step.

Title: Profit-oriented sales forecasting: a comparison of forecasting
  techniques from a business perspective
Authors: Tine Van Calster, Filip Van den Bossche, Bart Baesens, Wilfried
  Lemahieu
Categories: econ.EM cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Choosing the technique that is the best at forecasting your data, is a
problem that arises in any forecasting application. Decades of research have
resulted into an enormous amount of forecasting methods that stem from
statistics, econometrics and machine learning (ML), which leads to a very
difficult and elaborate choice to make in any forecasting exercise. This paper
aims to facilitate this process for high-level tactical sales forecasts by
comparing a large array of techniques for 35 times series that consist of both
industry data from the Coca-Cola Company and publicly available datasets.
However, instead of solely focusing on the accuracy of the resulting forecasts,
this paper introduces a novel and completely automated profit-driven approach
that takes into account the expected profit that a technique can create during
both the model building and evaluation process. The expected profit function
that is used for this purpose, is easy to understand and adaptable to any
situation by combining forecasting accuracy with business expertise.
Furthermore, we examine the added value of ML techniques, the inclusion of
external factors and the use of seasonal models in order to ascertain which
type of model works best in tactical sales forecasting. Our findings show that
simple seasonal time series models consistently outperform other methodologies
and that the profit-driven approach can lead to selecting a different
forecasting model.

  During the last decade, considerable effort has been made to perform
automatic classification of variable stars using machine learning techniques.
Traditionally, light curves are represented as a vector of descriptors or
features used as input for many algorithms. Some features are computationally
expensive, cannot be updated quickly and hence for large datasets such as the
LSST cannot be applied. Previous work has been done to develop alternative
unsupervised feature extraction algorithms for light curves, but the cost of
doing so still remains high. In this work, we propose an end-to-end algorithm
that automatically learns the representation of light curves that allows an
accurate automatic classification. We study a series of deep learning
architectures based on Recurrent Neural Networks and test them in automated
classification scenarios. Our method uses minimal data preprocessing, can be
updated with a low computational cost for new observations and light curves,
and can scale up to massive datasets. We transform each light curve into an
input matrix representation whose elements are the differences in time and
magnitude, and the outputs are classification probabilities. We test our method
in three surveys: OGLE-III, Gaia and WISE. We obtain accuracies of about $95\%$
in the main classes and $75\%$ in the majority of subclasses. We compare our
results with the Random Forest classifier and obtain competitive accuracies
while being faster and scalable. The analysis shows that the computational
complexity of our approach grows up linearly with the light curve size, while
the traditional approach cost grows as $N\log{(N)}$.

Title: Bending Loss Regularized Network for Nuclei Segmentation in
  Histopathology Images
Authors: Haotian Wang, Min Xian, Aleksandar Vakanski

\\
  Separating overlapped nuclei is a major challenge in histopathology image
analysis. Recently published approaches have achieved promising overall
performance on public datasets; however, their performance in segmenting
overlapped nuclei are limited. To address the issue, we propose the bending
loss regularized network for nuclei segmentation. The proposed bending loss
defines high penalties to contour points with large curvatures, and applies
small penalties to contour points with small curvature. Minimizing the bending
loss can avoid generating contours that encompass multiple nuclei. The proposed
approach is validated on the MoNuSeg dataset using five quantitative metrics.
It outperforms six state-of-the-art approaches on the following metrics:
Aggregate Jaccard Index, Dice, Recognition Quality, and Pan-optic Quality.

Title: PDE-NetGen 1.0: from symbolic PDE representations of physical processes
  to trainable neural network representations
Authors: Olivier Pannekoucke and Ronan Fablet
Categories: physics.comp-ph cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Bridging physics and deep learning is a topical challenge. While deep
learning frameworks open avenues in physical science, the design of
physically-consistent deep neural network architectures is an open issue. In
the spirit of physics-informed NNs, PDE-NetGen package provides new means to
automatically translate physical equations, given as PDEs, into neural network
architectures. PDE-NetGen combines symbolic calculus and a neural network
generator. The later exploits NN-based implementations of PDE solvers using
Keras. With some knowledge of a problem, PDE-NetGen is a plug-and-play tool to
generate physics-informed NN architectures. They provide
computationally-efficient yet compact representations to address a variety of
issues, including among others adjoint derivation, model calibration,
forecasting, data assimilation as well as uncertainty quantification. As an
illustration, the workflow is first presented for the 2D diffusion equation,
then applied to the data-driven and physics-informed identification of
uncertainty dynamics for the Burgers equation.

  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used to examine the human brain
white matter structures, including their microarchitecture integrity and
spatial fiber tract trajectories, with clinical applications in several
neurological disorders and neurosurgical guidance. However, a major factor that
prevents DTI from being incorporated in clinical routines is its long scan time
due to the acquisition of a large number (typically 30 or more) of
diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) required for reliable tensor estimation. Here,
a deep learning-based technique is developed to obtain diffusion tensor images
with only six DWIs, resulting in a significant reduction in imaging time. The
method uses deep convolutional neural networks to learn the highly nonlinear
relationship between DWIs and several tensor-derived maps, bypassing the
conventional tensor fitting procedure, which is well known to be highly
susceptible to noises in DWIs. The performance of the method was evaluated
using DWI datasets from the Human Connectome Project and patients with ischemic
stroke. Our results demonstrate that the proposed technique is able to generate
quantitative maps of good quality fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean
diffusivity (MD), as well as the fiber tractography from as few as six DWIs.
The proposed method achieves a quantification error of less than 5% in all
regions of interest of the brain, which is the rate of in vivo reproducibility
of diffusion tensor imaging. Tractography reconstruction is also comparable to
the ground truth obtained from 90 DWIs. In addition, we also demonstrate that
the neural network trained on healthy volunteers can be directly applied/tested
on stroke patients' DWIs data without compromising the lesion detectability.
Such a significant reduction in scan time will allow inclusion of DTI into
clinical routine for many potential applications.

Title: Gated Graph Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Luana Ruiz, Fernando Gama, Alejandro Ribeiro
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
Comments: Submitted to IEEE TSP
\\
  Graph processes exhibit a temporal structure determined by the sequence index
and and a spatial structure determined by the graph support. To learn from
graph processes, an information processing architecture must then be able to
exploit both underlying structures. We introduce Graph Recurrent Neural
Networks (GRNNs), which achieve this goal by leveraging the hidden Markov model
(HMM) together with graph signal processing (GSP). In the GRNN, the number of
learnable parameters is independent of the length of the sequence and of the
size of the graph, guaranteeing scalability. We also prove that GRNNs are
permutation equivariant and that they are stable to perturbations of the
underlying graph support. Following the observation that stability decreases
with longer sequences, we propose a time-gated extension of GRNNs. We also put
forward node- and edge-gated variants of the GRNN to address the problem of
vanishing gradients arising from long range graph dependencies. The advantages
of GRNNs over GNNs and RNNs are demonstrated in a synthetic regression
experiment and in a classification problem where seismic wave readings from a
network of seismographs are used to predict the region of an earthquake.
Finally, the benefits of time, node and edge gating are experimentally
validated in multiple time and spatial correlation scenarios.

Title: Policy Gradient based Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
Authors: Jiahao Yao, Marin Bukov, Lin Lin
Categories: quant-ph cond-mat.other cs.LG physics.comp-ph
\\
  The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), as a hybrid
quantum/classical algorithm, has received much interest recently. QAOA can also
be viewed as a variational ansatz for quantum control. However, its direct
application to emergent quantum technology encounters additional physical
constraints: (i) the states of the quantum system are not observable; (ii)
obtaining the derivatives of the objective function can be computationally
expensive or even inaccessible in experiments, and (iii) the values of the
objective function may be sensitive to various sources of uncertainty, as is
the case for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Taking such
constraints into account, we show that policy-gradient-based reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms are well suited for optimizing the variational
parameters of QAOA in a noise-robust fashion, opening up the way for developing
RL techniques for continuous quantum control. This is advantageous to help
mitigate and monitor the potentially unknown sources of errors in modern
quantum simulators. We analyze the performance of the algorithm for quantum
state transfer problems in single- and multi-qubit systems, subject to various
sources of noise such as error terms in the Hamiltonian, or quantum uncertainty
in the measurement process. We show that, in noisy setups, it is capable of
outperforming state-of-the-art existing optimization algorithms.

Title: REAK: Reliability analysis through Error rate-based Adaptive Kriging
Authors: Zeyu Wang and Abdollah Shafieezadeh
Categories: stat.AP cs.LG
DOI: 10.1016/j.ress.2018.10.004
\\
  As models in various fields are becoming more complex, associated
computational demands have been increasing significantly. Reliability analysis
for these systems when failure probabilities are small is significantly
challenging, requiring a large number of costly simulations. To address this
challenge, this paper introduces Reliability analysis through Error rate-based
Adaptive Kriging (REAK). An extension of the Central Limit Theorem based on
Lindeberg condition is adopted here to derive the distribution of the number of
design samples with wrong sign estimate and subsequently determine the maximum
error rate for failure probability estimates. This error rate enables optimal
establishment of effective sampling regions at each stage of an adaptive scheme
for strategic generation of design samples. Moreover, it facilitates setting a
target accuracy for failure probability estimation, which is used as stopping
criterion for reliability analysis. These capabilities together can
significantly reduce the number of calls to sophisticated, computationally
demanding models. The application of REAK for four examples with varying extent
of nonlinearity and dimension is presented. Results indicate that REAK is able
to reduce the computational demand by as high as 50% compared to
state-of-the-art methods of Adaptive Kriging with Monte Carlo Simulation
(AK-MCS) and Improved Sequential Kriging Reliability Analysis (ISKRA).

  We study learning problems in which the underlying class is a bounded subset
of $L_p$ and the target $Y$ belongs to $L_p$. Previously, minimax sample
complexity estimates were known under such boundedness assumptions only when
$p=\infty$. We present a sharp sample complexity estimate that holds for any $p
> 4$. It is based on a learning procedure that is suited for heavy-tailed
problems.

Title: On the use of recurrent neural networks for predictions of turbulent
  flows
Authors: Luca Guastoni, Prem A. Srinivasan, Hossein Azizpour, Philipp Schlatter
  and Ricardo Vinuesa
Categories: physics.flu-dyn cs.LG physics.comp-ph
\\
  In this paper, the prediction capabilities of recurrent neural networks are
assessed in the low-order model of near-wall turbulence by Moehlis {\it et al.}
(New J. Phys. {\bf 6}, 56, 2004). Our results show that it is possible to
obtain excellent predictions of the turbulence statistics and the dynamic
behavior of the flow with properly trained long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks, leading to relative errors in the mean and the fluctuations below
$1\%$. We also observe that using a loss function based only on the
instantaneous predictions of the flow may not lead to the best predictions in
terms of turbulence statistics, and it is necessary to define a stopping
criterion based on the computed statistics. Furthermore, more sophisticated
loss functions, including not only the instantaneous predictions but also the
averaged behavior of the flow, may lead to much faster neural network training.

Title: Machine Learning Techniques to Detect and Characterise Whistler Radio
  Waves
Authors: Othniel J.E.Y. Konan, Amit Kumar Mishra, Stefan Lotz
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML

  Machine Learning in Heliophysics hosted in September 2019 in Amsterdam

\\
  Lightning strokes create powerful electromagnetic pulses that routinely cause
very low frequency (VLF) waves to propagate across hemispheres along
geomagnetic field lines. VLF antenna receivers can be used to detect these
whistler waves generated by these lightning strokes. The particular
time/frequency dependence of the received whistler wave enables the estimation
of electron density in the plasmasphere region of the magnetosphere. Therefore
the identification and characterisation of whistlers are important tasks to
monitor the plasmasphere in real-time and to build large databases of events to
be used for statistical studies. The current state of the art in detecting
whistler is the Automatic Whistler Detection (AWD) method developed by
Lichtenberger (2009). This method is based on image correlation in 2 dimensions
and requires significant computing hardware situated at the VLF receiver
antennas (e.g. in Antarctica). The aim of this work is to develop a machine
learning-based model capable of automatically detecting whistlers in the data
provided by the VLF receivers. The approach is to use a combination of image
classification and localisation on the spectrogram data generated by the VLF
receivers to identify and localise each whistler. The data at hand has around
2300 events identified by AWD at SANAE and Marion and will be used as training,
validation, and testing data. Three detector designs have been proposed. The
first one using a similar method to AWD, the second using image classification
on regions of interest extracted from a spectrogram, and the last one using
YOLO, the current state of the art in object detection. It has been shown that
these detectors can achieve a misdetection and false alarm of less than 15% on
Marion's dataset.

Title: Finite Time Analysis of Linear Two-timescale Stochastic Approximation
  with Markovian Noise
Authors: Maxim Kaledin, Eric Moulines, Alexey Naumov, Vladislav Tadic, Hoi-To

Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  Linear two-timescale stochastic approximation (SA) scheme is an important
class of algorithms which has become popular in reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly for the policy evaluation problem. Recently, a number of works
have been devoted to establishing the finite time analysis of the scheme,
especially under the Markovian (non-i.i.d.) noise settings that are ubiquitous
in practice. In this paper, we provide a finite-time analysis for linear two
timescale SA. Our bounds show that there is no discrepancy in the convergence
rate between Markovian and martingale noise, only the constants are affected by
the mixing time of the Markov chain. With an appropriate step size schedule,
the transient term in the expected error bound is $o(1/k^c)$ and the
steady-state term is ${\cal O}(1/k)$, where $c>1$ and $k$ is the iteration
number. Furthermore, we present an asymptotic expansion of the expected error
with a matching lower bound of $\Omega(1/k)$. A simple numerical experiment is
presented to support our theory.

Title: Linear and Fisher Separability of Random Points in the d-dimensional
  Spherical Layer
Authors: Sergey Sidorov and Nikolai Zolotykh

Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures Submitted to IJCNN 2020
\\
  Stochastic separation theorems play important role in high-dimensional data
analysis and machine learning. It turns out that in high dimension any point of
a random set of points can be separated from other points by a hyperplane with
high probability even the number of points is exponential in terms of
dimension. This and similar facts can be used for constructing correctors for
artificial intelligent systems, for determining an intrinsic dimension of data
and for explaining various natural intelligence phenomena. In this paper, we
refine the bounds for the number of points and for the probability in
stochastic separation theorems, thereby strengthening some results obtained by
Gorban, Tyukin, Burton, Sidorov, Zolotykh et al. We give and discuss the bounds
for linear and Fisher separability, when the points are drawn randomly,
independently and uniformly from a d-dimensional spherical layer. These results
allow us to better outline the applicability limits of the stochastic
separation theorems in the mentioned applications.

Title: Training Keyword Spotters with Limited and Synthesized Speech Data
Authors: James Lin, Kevin Kilgour, Dominik Roblek, Matthew Sharifi
Categories: eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML
\\
  With the rise of low power speech-enabled devices, there is a growing demand
to quickly produce models for recognizing arbitrary sets of keywords. As with
many machine learning tasks, one of the most challenging parts in the model
creation process is obtaining a sufficient amount of training data. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of synthesized speech data in training
small, spoken term detection models of around 400k parameters. Instead of
training such models directly on the audio or low level features such as MFCCs,
we use a pre-trained speech embedding model trained to extract useful features
for keyword spotting models. Using this speech embedding, we show that a model
which detects 10 keywords when trained on only synthetic speech is equivalent
to a model trained on over 500 real examples. We also show that a model without
our speech embeddings would need to be trained on over 4000 real examples to
reach the same accuracy.

  Emotion plays an essential role in human-to-human communication, enabling us
to convey feelings such as happiness, frustration, and sincerity. While modern
speech technologies rely heavily on speech recognition and natural language
understanding for speech content understanding, the investigation of vocal
expression is increasingly gaining attention. Key considerations for building
robust emotion models include characterizing and improving the extent to which
a model, given its training data distribution, is able to generalize to unseen
data conditions. This work investigated a long-shot-term memory (LSTM) network
and a time convolution - LSTM (TC-LSTM) to detect primitive emotion attributes
such as valence, arousal, and dominance, from speech. It was observed that
training with multiple datasets and using robust features improved the
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for valence, by 30\% with respect to
the baseline system. Additionally, this work investigated how emotion
primitives can be used to detect categorical emotions such as happiness,
disgust, contempt, anger, and surprise from neutral speech, and results
indicated that arousal, followed by dominance was a better detector of such
emotions.

Title: Centimeter-Level Indoor Localization using Channel State Information
  with Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Jianyuan Yu, R. Michael Buehrer
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
\\
  Modern techniques in the Internet of Things or autonomous driving require
more accuracy positioning ever. Classic location techniques mainly adapt to
outdoor scenarios, while they do not meet the requirement of indoor cases with
multiple paths. Meanwhile as a feature robust to noise and time variations,
Channel State Information (CSI) has shown its advantages over Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) at more accurate positioning. To this end, this paper
proposes the neural network method to estimate the centimeter-level indoor
positioning with real CSI data collected from linear antennas. It utilizes an
amplitude of channel response or a correlation matrix as the input, which can
highly reduce the data size and suppress the noise. Also, it makes use of the
consistency in the user motion trajectory via Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
and signal-noise ratio (SNR) information, which can further improve the
estimation accuracy, especially in small datasize learning. These contributions
all benefit the efficiency of the neural network, based on the results with
other classic supervised learning methods.

  physics
Authors: Giles Chatham Strong
Categories: physics.data-an cs.LG hep-ex stat.ML
Comments: Preprint
\\
  Beginning from a basic neural-network architecture, we test the potential
benefits offered by a range of advanced techniques for machine learning and
deep learning in the context of a typical classification problem encountered in
the domain of high-energy physics, using a well-studied dataset: the 2014 Higgs
ML Kaggle dataset. The advantages are evaluated in terms of both performance
metrics and the time required to train and apply the resulting models.
Techniques examined include domain-specific data-augmentation, learning rate
and momentum scheduling, (advanced) ensembling in both model-space and
weight-space, and alternative architectures and connection methods. Following
the investigation, we arrive at a model which achieves equal performance to the
winning solution of the original Kaggle challenge, whilst requiring about 1% of
the training time and less than 5% of the inference time using much less
specialised hardware. Additionally, a new wrapper library for PyTorch called
LUMIN is presented, which incorporates all of the techniques studied.

corresponding free boundary problem with nonlocal diffusion.
  We start the paper by reviewing the main properties of the classical problem
that are of interest for us. Then we introduce the fractional Stefan problem
and develop the basic theory. After that we center our attention on selfsimilar
solutions, their properties and consequences. We first discuss the results of
the one-phase fractional Stefan problem which have recently been studied by the
authors. Finally, we address the theory of the two-phase fractional Stefan
problem which contains the main original contributions of this paper. Rigorous
numerical studies support our results and claims.

\\
  The recent observation of interstellar objects, 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov
cross the solar system opened new opportunities for planetary science and
planetary defense. As the first confirmed objects originating outside of the
solar system, there are myriads of origin questions to explore and discuss,
including where they came from, how did they get here and what are they
composed of. Besides, there is a need to be cognizant especially if such
interstellar objects pass by the Earth of potential dangers of impact.
Specifically, in the case of Oumuamua, which was detected after its perihelion,
passed by the Earth at around 0.2 AU, with an estimated excess speed of 60 km/s
relative to the Earth. Without enough forewarning time, a collision with such
high-speed objects can pose a catastrophic danger to all life Earth. Such
challenges underscore the importance of detection and exploration systems to
study these interstellar visitors. The detection system can include a
spacecraft constellation with zenith-pointing telescope spacecraft. After an
event is detected, a spacecraft swarm can be deployed from Earth to flyby past
the visitor. The flyby can then be designed to perform a proximity operation of
interest. This work aims to develop algorithms to design these swarm missions
through the IDEAS (Integrated Design Engineering & Automation of Swarms)
architecture. Specifically, we develop automated algorithms to design an
Earth-based detection constellation and a spacecraft swarm that generates
detailed surface maps of the visitor during the rendezvous, along with their
heliocentric cruise trajectories.

Title: tfp.mcmc: Modern Markov Chain Monte Carlo Tools Built for Modern

\\
  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is widely regarded as one of the most
important algorithms of the 20th century. Its guarantees of asymptotic
convergence, stability, and estimator-variance bounds using only unnormalized
probability functions make it indispensable to probabilistic programming. In
this paper, we introduce the TensorFlow Probability MCMC toolkit, and discuss
some of the considerations that motivated its design.

Title: Decentralized Observer Design for Virtual Decomposition Control
Authors: Jukka-Pekka Humaloja, Janne Koivum\"aki, Lassi Paunonen and Jouni
  Mattila
Categories: math.OC cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 16 pages, 4 figures
MSC-class: 93C10, 93C15, (34D20, 70Q05)
\\
  In this paper, we incorporate velocity observer design into the virtual
decomposition control (VDC) strategy of an $n$-DoF open chain robotic
manipulator. Descending from the VDC strategy, the proposed design is based on
decomposing the $n$-DoF manipulator into subsystems, i.e., rigid links and
joints, for which the controller-observer implementation can be done locally.
Similar to VDC, the combined controller-observer design is passivity-based, and
we show that it achieves semiglobal asymptotic convergence of the tracking
error. The convergence analysis is carried out using non-negative accompanying
functions based on the observer and controller error dynamics. The proposed
design is demonstrated in a simulation study of a 2-DoF open chain robotic
manipulator in the vertical plane.

Title: Audio-Visual Calibration with Polynomial Regression for 2-D Projection
  Using SVD-PHAT
Authors: Francois Grondin, Hao Tang, James Glass
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD eess.SP
\\
  This paper proposes a straightforward 2-D method to spatially calibrate the
visual field of a camera with the auditory field of an array microphone by
generating and overlaying an acoustic image over an optical image. Using a
low-cost microphone array and an off-the-shelf camera, we show that polynomial
regression can deal efficiently with non-linear camera distortion, and that a
recently proposed sound source localization method for real-time processing,
SVD-PHAT, can be adapted for this task.

Title: Probabilistic State Estimation in Water Networks
Authors: Shen Wang and Ahmad F. Taha and Nikolaos Gatsis and Lina Sela and
  Marcio Giacomoni
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  State estimation in water distribution networks (WDN), the problem of
estimating all unknown network heads and flows given select measurements, is
challenging due to the nonconvexity of hydraulic models and significant
uncertainty from demands, network parameters, and measurements. To this end,
probabilistic modeling for state estimation (PSE) in WDNs is proposed.
Regardless of uncertainty's statistical distributions, the PSE shows that the
covariance matrix of unknown system states (unmeasured heads and flows) can be
linearly expressed by the covariance matrix of uncertainty from measurement
noise, network parameters, and demand at arbitrary operating points---after
linearizing the nonlinear hydraulic models. Rather than computing point-based
estimates for unknown states, the proposed PSE approach (i) yields variances of
individual unknown states, (ii) amounts to solving a highly scalable linear
systems of equations, (iii) is also useful for uncertainty quantification,
extended period simulations, or confidence limit analysis, and (iv) includes
the modeling of various types of valves and measurement scenarios in water
networks. Thorough case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability
of the proposed approach.
