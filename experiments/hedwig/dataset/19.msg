Title: Intelligent Roundabout Insertion using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Alessandro Paolo Capasso, Giulio Bacchiani, Daniele Molinari
Categories: cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA cs.RO
\\
  An important topic in the autonomous driving research is the development of
maneuver planning systems. Vehicles have to interact and negotiate with each
other so that optimal choices, in terms of time and safety, are taken. For this
purpose, we present a maneuver planning module able to negotiate the entering
in busy roundabouts. The proposed module is based on a neural network trained
to predict when and how entering the roundabout throughout the whole duration
of the maneuver. Our model is trained with a novel implementation of A3C, which
we will call Delayed A3C (D-A3C), in a synthetic environment where vehicles
move in a realistic manner with interaction capabilities. In addition, the
system is trained such that agents feature a unique tunable behavior, emulating
real world scenarios where drivers have their own driving styles. Similarly,
the maneuver can be performed using different aggressiveness levels, which is
particularly useful to manage busy scenarios where conservative rule-based
policies would result in undefined waits.

Title: Towards Intelligent Robotic Process Automation for BPMers
Authors: Simone Agostinelli, Andrea Marrella and Massimo Mecella
Categories: cs.AI cs.SE
\\
  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a fast-emerging automation technology
that sits between the fields of Business Process Management (BPM) and
Artificial Intelligence (AI), and allows organizations to automate high volume
routines. RPA tools are able to capture the execution of such routines
previously performed by a human users on the interface of a computer system,
and then emulate their enactment in place of the user by means of a software
robot. Nowadays, in the BPM domain, only simple, predictable business processes
involving routine work can be automated by RPA tools in situations where there
is no room for interpretation, while more sophisticated work is still left to
human experts. In this paper, starting from an in-depth experimentation of the
RPA tools available on the market, we provide a classification framework to
categorize them on the basis of some key dimensions. Then, based on this
analysis, we derive four research challenges and discuss prospective approaches
necessary to inject intelligence into current RPA technology, in order to
achieve more widespread adoption of RPA in the BPM domain.

Title: TrappeD: DRAM Trojan Designs for Information Leakage and Fault Injection
  Attacks
Authors: Karthikeyan Nagarajan, Asmit De, Mohammad Nasim Imtiaz Khan, Swaroop
  Ghosh
Categories: cs.AR cs.CR
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the advanced circuit features such as wordline-
(WL) underdrive (prevents retention failure) and overdrive (assists write)
employed in the peripherals of Dynamic RAM (DRAM) memories from a security
perspective. In an ideal environment, these features ensure fast and reliable
read and write operations. However, an adversary can re-purpose them by
inserting Trojans to deliver malicious payloads such as fault injections,
Denial-of-Service (DoS), and information leakage attacks when activated by the
adversary. Simulation results indicate that wordline voltage can be increased
to cause retention failure and thereby launch a DoS attack in DRAM memory.
Furthermore, two wordlines or bitlines can be shorted to leak information or
inject faults by exploiting the DRAM's refresh operation. We demonstrate an
information leakage system exploit by implementing TrappeD on RocketChip SoC.

Title: Hard 3-CNF-SAT problems are in $P$ -- A first step in proving $NP=P$
Authors: Marcel R\'emon and Johan Barth\'elemy
Categories: cs.CC
Comments: First draft, comments and suggestion are welcome
\\
  The relationship between the complexity classes $P$ and $NP$ is an unsolved
question in the field of theoretical computer science. In the first part of
this paper, a lattice framework is proposed to handle the 3-CNF-SAT problems,
known to be in $NP$. In the second section, we define a multi-linear descriptor
function ${\cal H}_\varphi$ for any 3-CNF-SAT problem $\varphi$ of size $n$, in
the sense that ${\cal H}_\varphi : \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ is such
that $Im \; {\cal H}_\varphi$ is the set of all the solutions of $\varphi$. A
new merge operation ${\cal H}_\varphi \bigwedge {\cal H}_{\psi}$ is defined,
where $\psi$ is a single 3-CNF clause. Given ${\cal H}_\varphi$ [but this can
be of exponential complexity], the complexity needed for the computation of $Im
\; {\cal H}_\varphi$, the set of all solutions, is shown to be polynomial for
hard 3-CNF-SAT problems, i.e. the one with few ($\leq 2^k$) or no solutions.
The third part uses the relation between ${\cal H}_\varphi$ and the indicator
function $\mathbb{1}_{{\cal S}_\varphi}$ for the set of solutions, to develop a
greedy polynomial algorithm to solve hard 3-CNF-SAT problems.

Title: Numerical investigation into fracture resistance of bone following
  adaptation
Authors: Karol Lewandowski, {\L}ukasz Kaczmarczyk, Ignatios Athanasiadis, John
  F. Marshall, Chris J. Pearce
Categories: cs.CE
\\
  Bone adapts in response to its mechanical environment. This evolution of bone
density is one of the most important mechanisms for developing fracture
resistance. A finite element framework for simulating bone adaptation, commonly
called bone remodelling, is presented. This is followed by a novel method to
both quantify fracture resistance and to simulate fracture propagation. The
authors' previous work on the application of configurational mechanics for
modelling fracture is extended to include the influence of heterogeneous bone
density distribution. The main advantage of this approach is that
configurational forces, and fracture energy release rate, are expressed
exclusively in terms of nodal quantities. This approach avoids the need for
post-processing and enables a fully implicit formulation for modelling the
evolving crack front. In this paper density fields are generated from both (a)
bone adaptation analysis and (b) subject-specific geometry and material
properties obtained from CT scans. It is shown that, in order to correctly
evaluate the configurational forces at the crack front, it is necessary to have
a spatially smooth density field with higher regularity than if the field is
directly approximated on the finite element mesh. Therefore, discrete density
data is approximated as a smooth density field using a Moving Weighted Least
Squares method. Performance of the framework is demonstrated using numerical
simulations for bone adaptation and subsequent crack propagation, including
consideration of an equine 3rd metacarpal bone. The degree of bone adaption is
shown to influence both fracture resistance and the resulting crack path.

Title: Upper bounds for stabbing simplices by a line
Authors: Inbar Daum-Sadon and Gabriel Nivasch
Categories: cs.CG math.CO
Comments: 17 pages, 3 figures
MSC-class: 52A35
\\
  It is known that for every dimension $d\ge 2$ and every $k<d$ there exists a
constant $c_{d,k}>0$ such that for every $n$-point set $X\subset \mathbb R^d$
there exists a $k$-flat that intersects at least $c_{d,k} n^{d+1-k} -
o(n^{d+1-k})$ of the $(d-k)$-dimensional simplices spanned by $X$. However, the
optimal values of the constants $c_{d,k}$ are mostly unknown. The case $k=0$
(stabbing by a point) has received a great deal of attention.
  In this paper we focus on the case $k=1$ (stabbing by a line). Specifically,
we try to determine the upper bounds yielded by two point sets, known as the
"stretched grid" and the "stretched diagonal". Even though the calculations are
independent of $n$, they are still very complicated, so we resort to analytical
and numerical software methods. Surprisingly, for $d=4,5,6$ the stretched grid
yields better bounds than the stretched diagonal (unlike for all cases $k=0$
and for the case $(d,k)=(3,1)$, in which both point sets yield the same bound).
The stretched grid yields $c_{4,1}\leq 0.00457936$, $c_{5,1}\leq 0.000405335$,
and $c_{6,1}\leq 0.0000291323$.

  The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for
question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent
Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and
trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model
with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel,
followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC
10 test set. All the model architectures in this paper were developed from

Title: Read Beyond the Lines: Understanding the Implied Textual Meaning via a
  Skim and Intensive Reading Model
Authors: Guoxiu He, Zhe Gao, Zhuoren Jiang, Yangyang Kang, Changlong Sun,
  Xiaozhong Liu, Wei Lu
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  The nonliteral interpretation of a text is hard to be understood by machine
models due to its high context-sensitivity and heavy usage of figurative
language. In this study, inspired by human reading comprehension, we propose a
novel, simple, and effective deep neural framework, called Skim and Intensive
Reading Model (SIRM), for figuring out implied textual meaning. The proposed
SIRM consists of two main components, namely the skim reading component and
intensive reading component. N-gram features are quickly extracted from the
skim reading component, which is a combination of several convolutional neural
networks, as skim (entire) information. An intensive reading component enables
a hierarchical investigation for both local (sentence) and global (paragraph)
representation, which encapsulates the current embedding and the contextual
information with a dense connection. More specifically, the contextual
information includes the near-neighbor information and the skim information
mentioned above. Finally, besides the normal training loss function, we employ
an adversarial loss function as a penalty over the skim reading component to
eliminate noisy information arisen from special figurative words in the
training data. To verify the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the
proposed architecture, we conduct extensive comparative experiments on several
sarcasm benchmarks and an industrial spam dataset with metaphors. Experimental
results indicate that (1) the proposed model, which benefits from context
modeling and consideration of figurative language, outperforms existing
state-of-the-art solutions, with comparable parameter scale and training speed;
(2) the SIRM yields superior robustness in terms of parameter size sensitivity;
(3) compared with ablation and addition variants of the SIRM, the final
framework is efficient enough.

Title: TED: A Pretrained Unsupervised Summarization Model with Theme Modeling
  and Denoising
Authors: Ziyi Yang, Chenguang Zhu, Robert Gmyr, Michael Zeng, Xuedong Huang
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Text summarization aims to extract essential information from a piece of text
and transform it into a concise version. Existing unsupervised abstractive
summarization models use recurrent neural networks framework and ignore
abundant unlabeled corpora resources. In order to address these issues, we
propose TED, a transformer-based unsupervised summarization system with
pretraining on large-scale data. We first leverage the lead bias in news
articles to pretrain the model on large-scale corpora. Then, we finetune TED on
target domains through theme modeling and a denoising autoencoder to enhance
the quality of summaries. Notably, TED outperforms all unsupervised abstractive
baselines on NYT, CNN/DM and English Gigaword datasets with various document
styles. Further analysis shows that the summaries generated by TED are
abstractive and containing even higher proportions of novel tokens than those
from supervised models.

Title: "Love is as Complex as Math": Metaphor Generation System for Social
  Chatbot
Authors: Danning Zheng, Ruihua Song, Tianran Hu, Hao Fu, Jin Zhou
Categories: cs.CL cs.AI
\\
  As the wide adoption of intelligent chatbot in human daily life, user demands
for such systems evolve from basic task-solving conversations to more casual
and friend-like communication. To meet the user needs and build emotional bond
with users, it is essential for social chatbots to incorporate more human-like
and advanced linguistic features. In this paper, we investigate the usage of a
commonly used rhetorical device by human -- metaphor for social chatbot. Our
work first designs a metaphor generation framework, which generates topic-aware
and novel figurative sentences. By embedding the framework into a chatbot
system, we then enables the chatbot to communicate with users using figurative
language. Human annotators validate the novelty and properness of the generated
metaphors. More importantly, we evaluate the effects of employing metaphors in
human-chatbot conversations. Experiments indicate that our system effectively
arouses user interests in communicating with our chatbot, resulting in
significantly longer human-chatbot conversations.

Title: On the comparability of Pre-trained Language Models
Authors: Matthias A{\ss}enmacher, Christian Heumann
Categories: cs.CL
\\
  Recent developments in unsupervised representation learning have successfully
established the concept of transfer learning in NLP. Mainly three forces are
driving the improvements in this area of research: More elaborated
architectures are making better use of contextual information. Instead of
simply plugging in static pre-trained representations, these are learned based
on surrounding context in end-to-end trainable models with more intelligently
designed language modelling objectives. Along with this, larger corpora are
used as resources for pre-training large language models in a self-supervised
fashion which are afterwards fine-tuned on supervised tasks. Advances in
parallel computing as well as in cloud computing, made it possible to train
these models with growing capacities in the same or even in shorter time than
previously established models. These three developments agglomerate in new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results being revealed in a higher and higher
frequency. It is not always obvious where these improvements originate from, as
it is not possible to completely disentangle the contributions of the three
driving forces. We set ourselves to providing a clear and concise overview on
several large pre-trained language models, which achieved SOTA results in the
last two years, with respect to their use of new architectures and resources.
We want to clarify for the reader where the differences between the models are
and we furthermore attempt to gain some insight into the single contributions
of lexical/computational improvements as well as of architectural changes. We
explicitly do not intend to quantify these contributions, but rather see our
work as an overview in order to identify potential starting points for
benchmark comparisons. Furthermore, we tentatively want to point at potential
possibilities for improvement in the field of open-sourcing and reproducible
research.

Title: Two-Level Transformer and Auxiliary Coherence Modeling for Improved Text
  Segmentation
Authors: Goran Glava\v{s} and Swapna Somasundaran
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: AAAI 2020
\\
  Breaking down the structure of long texts into semantically coherent segments
makes the texts more readable and supports downstream applications like
summarization and retrieval. Starting from an apparent link between text
coherence and segmentation, we introduce a novel supervised model for text
segmentation with simple but explicit coherence modeling. Our model -- a neural
architecture consisting of two hierarchically connected Transformer networks --
is a multi-task learning model that couples the sentence-level segmentation
objective with the coherence objective that differentiates correct sequences of
sentences from corrupt ones. The proposed model, dubbed Coherence-Aware Text
Segmentation (CATS), yields state-of-the-art segmentation performance on a
collection of benchmark datasets. Furthermore, by coupling CATS with
cross-lingual word embeddings, we demonstrate its effectiveness in zero-shot
language transfer: it can successfully segment texts in languages unseen in
training.

Title: Differentially Private Combinatorial Cloud Auction
Authors: Tianjiao Ni, Zhili Chen, Lin Chen, Hong Zhong, Shun Zhang, Yan Xu
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Cloud service providers typically provide different types of virtual machines
(VMs) to cloud users with various requirements. Thanks to its effectiveness and
fairness, auction has been widely applied in this heterogeneous resource
allocation. Recently, several strategy-proof combinatorial cloud auction
mechanisms have been proposed. However, they fail to protect the bid privacy of
users from being inferred from the auction results. In this paper, we design a
differentially private combinatorial cloud auction mechanism (DPCA) to address
this privacy issue. Technically, we employ the exponential mechanism to compute
a clearing unit price vector with a probability proportional to the
corresponding revenue. We further improve the mechanism to reduce the running
time while maintaining high revenues, by computing a single clearing unit
price, or a subgroup of clearing unit prices at a time, resulting in the
improved mechanisms DPCA-S and its generalized version DPCA-M, respectively. We
theoretically prove that our mechanisms can guarantee differential privacy,
approximate truthfulness and high revenue. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DPCA can generate near-optimal revenues at the price of
relatively high time complexity, while the improved mechanisms achieve a
tunable trade-off between auction revenue and running time.

  The Internet has many backbone components on top of which the whole world is
connected. It is important to make these components, like Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP), Domain Name System (DNS), and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI),

have vulnerabilities, mainly because of their dependence on the centralized

  Blockchain is revolutionizing the concept of today's Internet, primarily
because of its degree of decentralization and security properties. In this

Title: Fair Auction and Trade Framework for Cloud VM Allocation based on
  Blockchain
Authors: Zhili Chen, Wei Ding, Yan Xu, Miaomiao Tian and Hong Zhong
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Cloud auctions provide cost-effective strategies for cloud VM allocation.
Most existing cloud auctions simply assume that the auctioneer is trustable,
and thus the fairness of auctions can be easily achieved. However, in fact,
such a trustable auctioneer may not exist, and the fairness is non-trivial to
guarantee. In this work, for the first time, we propose a decentralized cloud
VM auction and trade framework based on blockchain. We realize both auction
fairness and trade fairness among participants (e.g., cloud provider and cloud
users) in this system, which guarantees the interest of each party will not
suffer any loss as long as it follows the protocol. Furthermore, we implement
our system through the local blockchain and Ethereum official test blockchain,
carry out experimental simulations, and demonstrate the feasibility of our
system.

Title: Verifying Cryptographic Security Implementations in C Using Automated
  Model Extraction
Authors: Mihhail Aizatulin
Categories: cs.CR cs.PL
\\
  This thesis presents an automated method for verifying security properties of
protocol implementations written in the C language. We assume that each
successful run of a protocol follows the same path through the C code,
justified by the fact that typical security protocols have linear structure. We
then perform symbolic execution of that path to extract a model expressed in a
process calculus similar to the one used by the CryptoVerif tool. The symbolic
execution uses a novel algorithm that allows symbolic variables to represent
bitstrings of potentially unknown length to model incoming protocol messages.
  The extracted models do not use pointer-addressed memory, but they may still
contain low-level details concerning message formats. In the next step we
replace the message formatting expressions by abstract tupling and projection
operators. The properties of these operators, such as the projection operation
being the inverse of the tupling operation, are typically only satisfied with
respect to inputs of correct types. Therefore we typecheck the model to ensure
that all type-safety constraints are satisfied. The resulting model can then be
verified with CryptoVerif to obtain a computational security result directly,
or with ProVerif, to obtain a computational security result by invoking a
computational soundness theorem.
  Our method achieves high automation and does not require user input beyond
what is necessary to specify the properties of the cryptographic primitives and
the desired security goals. We evaluated the method on several protocol
implementations, totalling over 3000 lines of code. The biggest case study was
a 1000-line implementation that was independently written without verification
in mind. We found several flaws that were acknowledged and fixed by the
authors, and were able to verify the fixed code without any further
modifications to it.

  Smart grid is an alternative solution of the conventional power grid which

today's environment requirements. Due to the inherent vulnerabilities in the
information technology, the smart grid is exposed to a wide variety of threats

approach is trained and tested extensively on an empirical industrial dataset
which is composed of several attack categories including the scanning, buffer
overflow, and denial of service attacks. Then, an experimental comparison in
terms of detection accuracy is conducted to evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach with Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest.
The obtained results suggest that the proposed approaches produce optimal
results comparing to the other algorithms. Finally, we propose a network
architecture to deploy the proposed anomaly-based intrusion detection system
across the Advanced Metering Infrastructure network. In addition, we propose a
network security architecture composed of two types of Intrusion detection
system types, Host and Network-based, deployed across the Advanced Metering
Infrastructure network to inspect the traffic and detect the malicious one at
all the levels.

\\
  Smart grid is an emerging and promising technology. It uses the power of
information technologies to deliver intelligently the electrical power to
customers, and it allows the integration of the green technology to meet the
environmental requirements. Unfortunately, information technologies have its
inherent vulnerabilities and weaknesses that expose the smart grid to a wide
variety of security risks. The Intrusion detection system (IDS) plays an
important role in securing smart grid networks and detecting malicious
activity, yet it suffers from several limitations. Many research papers have
been published to address these issues using several algorithms and techniques.
Therefore, a detailed comparison between these algorithms is needed. This paper
presents an overview of four data mining algorithms used by IDS in Smart Grid.
An evaluation of performance of these algorithms is conducted based on several
metrics including the probability of detection, probability of false alarm,
probability of miss detection, efficiency, and processing time. Results show
that Random Forest outperforms the other three algorithms in detecting attacks
with higher probability of detection, lower probability of false alarm, lower
probability of miss detection, and higher accuracy.

Title: PI-GAN: Learning Pose Independent representations for multiple profile
  face synthesis
Authors: Hamed Alqahtani
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Generating a pose-invariant representation capable of synthesizing multiple
face pose views from a single pose is still a difficult problem. The solution
is demanded in various areas like multimedia security, computer vision,
robotics, etc. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have encoder-decoder
structures possessing the capability to learn pose-independent representation
incorporated with discriminator network for realistic face synthesis. We
present PIGAN, a cyclic shared encoder-decoder framework, in an attempt to
solve the problem. As compared to traditional GAN, it consists of secondary
encoder-decoder framework sharing weights from the primary structure and
reconstructs the face with the original pose. The primary framework focuses on
creating disentangle representation, and secondary framework aims to restore
the original face. We use CFP high-resolution, realistic dataset to check the
performance.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  To gain an understanding of the relation between a given human pose image and
the corresponding physical foot pressure of the human subject, we propose and
validate two end-to-end deep learning architectures, PressNet and
PressNet-Simple, to regress foot pressure heatmaps (dynamics) from 2D human
pose (kinematics) derived from a video frame. A unique video and foot pressure
data set of 813,050 synchronized pairs, composed of 5-minute long choreographed
Taiji movement sequences of 6 subjects, is collected and used for
leaving-one-subject-out cross validation. Our initial experimental results
demonstrate reliable and repeatable foot pressure prediction from a single
image, setting the first baseline for such a complex cross modality mapping
problem in computer vision. Furthermore, we compute and quantitatively validate
the Center of Pressure (CoP) and Base of Support (BoS) from predicted foot
pressure distribution, obtaining key components in pose stability analysis from
images with potential applications in kinesiology, medicine, sports and
robotics.

\\
  Multi-focus image fusion technologies compress different focus depth images
into an image in which most objects are in focus. However, although existing
image fusion techniques, including traditional algorithms and deep
learning-based algorithms, can generate high-quality fused images, they need
multiple images with different focus depths in the same field of view. This
criterion may not be met in some cases where time efficiency is required or the
hardware is insufficient. The problem is especially prominent in large-size
whole slide images. This paper focused on the multi-focus image fusion of
cytopathological digital slide images, and proposed a novel method for
generating fused images from single-focus or few-focus images based on
conditional generative adversarial network (GAN). Through the adversarial
learning of the generator and discriminator, the method is capable of
generating fused images with clear textures and large depth of field. Combined
with the characteristics of cytopathological images, this paper designs a new
generator architecture combining U-Net and DenseBlock, which can effectively
improve the network's receptive field and comprehensively encode image
features. Meanwhile, this paper develops a semantic segmentation network that
identifies the blurred regions in cytopathological images. By integrating the
network into the generative model, the quality of the generated fused images is
effectively improved. Our method can generate fused images from only
single-focus or few-focus images, thereby avoiding the problem of collecting
multiple images of different focus depths with increased time and hardware
costs. Furthermore, our model is designed to learn the direct mapping of input
source images to fused images without the need to manually design complex
activity level measurements and fusion rules as in traditional methods.

Title: HandAugment: A Simple Data Augmentation for HANDS19 Challenge Task 1 --
  Depth-Based 3D Hand Pose Estimation
Authors: Zhaohui Zhang and Shipeng Xie and Mingxiu Chen and Haichao Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Hand pose estimation from 3D depth images, has been explored widely using
various kinds of techniques in the field of computer vision. However, this
problem still remain unsolved. In this paper we present HandAugment, a simple
data augmentation for depth-based 3D hand pose estimation. HandAugment consists
of two stages of neural networks. The first stage of neural network is used to
extract hand patches and estimate the initial hand poses from the depth images
in an iteration fashion. This step can help filter out more outlier patches
away (e.g., arms and backgrounds). Then the extracted patches and initial hand
poses are further feed into the neural network of the second stage to get the
final hand poses. This strategy of two stages greatly improves the accuracy of
hands pose estimation. Finally, our method achieves the first place in the task
of depth-based 3D hand pose estimation in HANDS19 challenge.

Title: A Multi-oriented Chinese Keyword Spotter Guided by Text Line Detection
Authors: Pei Xu, Shan Huang, Hongzhen Wang, Hao Song, Shen Huang, Qi Ju
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by ICDAR2019
\\
  Chinese keyword spotting is a challenging task as there is no visual blank
for Chinese words. Different from English words which are split naturally by
visual blanks, Chinese words are generally split only by semantic
information.In this paper, we propose a new Chinese keyword spotter for natural
images, which is inspired by Mask R-CNN. We propose to predict the keyword
masks guided by text line detection. Firstly, proposals of text lines are
generated by Faster R-CNN;Then, text line masks and keyword masks are predicted
by segmentation in the proposals. In this way, the text lines and keywords are
predicted in parallel. We create two Chinese keyword datasets based on RCTW-17
and ICPR MTWI2018 to verify the effectiveness of our method.

Title: Trajectory Forecasts in Unknown Environments Conditioned on Grid-Based
  Plans
Authors: Nachiket Deo and Mohan M. Trivedi
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
\\
  In this paper, we address the problem of forecasting agent trajectories in
unknown environments, conditioned on their past motion and scene structure.
Trajectory forecasting is a challenging problem due to the large variation in
scene structure, and the multi-modal nature of the distribution of future
trajectories. Unlike prior approaches that directly learn one-to-many mappings
from observed context, to multiple future trajectories, we propose to condition
trajectory forecasts on \textit{plans} sampled from a grid based policy learned
using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning policy (MaxEnt IRL). We
reformulate MaxEnt IRL to allow the policy to jointly infer plausible agent
goals and paths to those goals on a coarse 2-D grid defined over an unknown
scene. We propose an attention based trajectory generator that generates
continuous valued future trajectories conditioned on state sequences sampled
from the MaxEnt policy. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation on the publicly
available Stanford drone dataset (SDD) shows that our model generates
trajectories that are (1) diverse, representing the multi-modal predictive
distribution, and (2) precise, conforming to the underlying scene structure
over long prediction horizons, achieving state of the art results on the
TrajNet benchmark split of SDD.

\\
  Domain gaps of sensor modalities pose a challenge for the design of
autonomous robots. Taking a step towards closing this gap, we propose two
unsupervised training frameworks for finding a common representation of LiDAR
and camera data. The first method utilizes a double Siamese training structure
to ensure consistency in the results. The second method uses a Canny edge image
guiding the networks towards a desired representation. All networks are trained
in an unsupervised manner, leaving room for scalability. The results are
evaluated using common computer vision applications, and the limitations of the
proposed approaches are outlined.

  Statistical divergence is widely applied in multimedia processing, basically
due to regularity and explainable features displayed in data. However, in a
broader range of data realm, these advantages may not out-stand, and therefore
a more general approach is required. In data detection, statistical divergence
can be used as an similarity measurement based on collective features. In this
paper, we present a collective detection technique based on statistical
divergence. The technique extracts distribution similarities among data
collections, and then uses the statistical divergence to detect collective
anomalies. Our technique continuously evaluates metrics as evolving features
and calculates adaptive threshold to meet the best mathematical expectation. To
illustrate details of the technique and explore its efficiency, we case-studied
a real world problem of click farming detection against malicious online
sellers. The evaluation shows that these techniques provided efficient
classifiers. They were also sufficiently sensitive to a much smaller magnitude
of data alteration, compared with real world malicious behaviours. Thus, it is
applicable in the real world.

  Dataframes are a popular and convenient abstraction to represent, structure,
clean, and analyze data during exploratory data analysis. Despite the success
of dataframe libraries in R and Python (pandas), dataframes face performance
issues even on moderately large datasets. In this vision paper, we take the
first steps towards formally defining dataframes, characterizing their
properties, and outlining a research agenda towards making dataframes more
interactive at scale. We draw on tools and techniques from the database
community, and describe ways they may be adapted to serve dataframe systems, as
well as the new challenges therein. We also describe our current progress
toward a scalable dataframe system, Modin, which is already up to 30$times$
faster than pandas in preliminary case studies, while enabling unmodified
pandas code to run as-is. In its first 18 months, Modin is already used by over
60 downstream projects, has over 250 forks, and 3,900 stars on GitHub,
indicating the pressing need for pursuing this agenda.

wide spectrum of applications ranging from machine learning, healthcare
analytics, social network analysis, data mining to quantum chemistry and signal
processing. Efforts to improve the performance of tensor computations include
exploring data layout, execution scheduling, and parallelism in common tensor

kernels using state-of-the-art tensor formats: coordinate (COO) and
hierarchical coordinate (HiCOO) on CPUs and GPUs. It presents a set of
reference tensor kernel implementations that are compatible with real-world
tensors and power law tensors extended from synthetic graph generation
techniques. We also propose Roofline performance models for these kernels to
provide insights of computer platforms from sparse tensor view.

and by energy users who producemore energy than they need and can sell their
excess powerfor profit. Energy trading system takes advantage of varioussources
and effectively coordinates the energy to ensure efficientand optimal
utilization of the available resources and providesbetter services for energy

  Grid computing is a collection of computer resources that are gathered
together from various areas to give computational resources such as storage,
data or application services. This is to permit clients to access this huge
measure of processing resources without the need to know where these might be
found and what technology such as, hardware equipment and operating system was
used. Dependability and performance are among the key difficulties faced in a
grid computing environment. Various systems have been proposed in the
literature to handle recouping from resource failure in Grid computing
environment. One case of such system is checkpointing. Checkpointing is a
system that endures faults when resources failed. Checkpointing method has the
upside of lessening the work lost because of resource faults. However,
checkpointing presents a huge runtime overhead. In this paper, we propose an
improved checkpointing system to bring down runtime overhead. A replica is
added to ensure the availability of resources. This replicates all
checkpointing files to other machines as opposed to having dedicated
checkpointing machine. The results of simulation employing GridSim noted that
retaining the number of resources fixed and changing the number of gridlets,
gains of up to 11%, 9%, and 11% on makespan, throughput, and turnaround time
respectively were realized while changing the number of resources and
preserving the number of gridlets fixed, increases of up to 11%, 8%, and 9% on
makespan, throughput, and turnaround time respectively, were realized

Title: Representing graphs as the intersection of cographs and threshold graphs

\\
  A graph $G$ is said to be the intersection of graphs $G_1,G_2,\ldots,G_k$ if
$V(G)=V(G_1)=V(G_2)=\cdots=V(G_k)$ and $E(G)=E(G_1)\cap E(G_2)\cap\cdots\cap
E(G_k)$. For a graph $G$, $\mathrm{dim}_{COG}(G)$ (resp.
$\mathrm{dim}_{TH}(G)$) denotes the minimum number of cographs (resp. threshold
graphs) whose intersection gives $G$. We present several new bounds on these
parameters for general graphs as well as some special classes of graphs. It is
shown that for any graph $G$: (a) $\mathrm{dim}_{COG}(G)\leq\mathrm{tw}(G)+2$,
(b) $\mathrm{dim}_{TH}(G)\leq\mathrm{pw}(G)+1$, and (c)
$\mathrm{dim}_{TH}(G)\leq\chi(G)\cdot\mathrm{box}(G)$, where $\mathrm{tw}(G)$,
$\mathrm{pw}(G)$, $\chi(G)$ and $\mathrm{box}(G)$ denote respectively the
treewidth, pathwidth, chromatic number and boxicity of the graph $G$. We also
derive the exact values for these parameters for cycles and show that every
forest is the intersection of two cographs. These results allow us to derive
improved bounds on $\mathrm{dim}_{COG}(G)$ and $\mathrm{dim}_{TH}(G)$ when $G$
belongs to some special graph classes.

\\
  The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) is an NP-hard routing problem in which a
fleet of identical vehicles aims at collecting rewards (prizes) available at
given locations, while satisfying restrictions on the travel times. In TOP,
each location can be visited by at most one vehicle, and the goal is to
maximize the total sum of rewards collected by the vehicles within a given time
limit. In this paper, we propose a generalization of TOP, namely the Steiner
Team Orienteering Problem (STOP). In STOP, we provide, additionally, a subset
of mandatory locations. In this sense, STOP also aims at maximizing the total
sum of rewards collected within the time limit, but, now, every mandatory
location must be visited. In this work, we propose a new commodity-based
formulation for STOP and use it within a cutting-plane scheme. The algorithm
benefits from the compactness and strength of the proposed formulation and
works by separating three families of valid inequalities, which consist of some
general connectivity constraints, classical lifted cover inequalities based on
dual bounds and a class of conflict cuts. To our knowledge, the last class of
inequalities is also introduced in this work. A state-of-the-art branch-and-cut
algorithm from the literature of TOP is adapted to STOP and used as baseline to
evaluate the performance of the cutting-plane. Extensive computational
experiments show the competitiveness of the new algorithm while solving several
STOP and TOP instances. In particular, it is able to solve, in total, 14 more
TOP instances than any other previous exact algorithm and finds eight new
optimality certificates. With respect to the new STOP instances introduced in
this work, our algorithm solves 30 more instances than the baseline.

Title: Submodular Matroid Secretary Problem with Shortlists
Authors: Mohammad Shadravan
Categories: cs.DS
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1809.05082
\\
  In the matroid secretary problem, the elements of a matroid $\mathcal{M}$
arrive in random order. Once we observe an item we need to irrevocably decide
whether or not to accept it. The set of selected elements should form an
independent set of the matroid. The goal is to maximize the total sum of the
values assigned to these elements.
  We introduce a version of this problem motivated by the shortlist model in
[Agrawal et al.]. In this setting, the algorithm is allowed to choose a subset
of items as part of a shortlist, possibly more than $k=rk(\mathcal{M})$ items.
Then, after seeing the entire input, the algorithm can choose an independent
subset from the shortlist. Furthermore we generalize the objective function to
any monotone submodular function. Is there an online algorithm achieve a
constant competitive ratio using a shortlist of size $O(k)$? We design an
algorithm that achieves a $\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e^2-\epsilon-O(1/k))$ competitive
ratio for any constant $\epsilon>0$, using a shortlist of size $O(k)$. This is
especially surprising considering that the best known competitive ratio for the
matroid secretary problem is $O(\log \log k)$.
  An important application of our algorithm is for the random order streaming
of submodular functions. We show that our algorithm can be implemented in the
streaming setting using $O(k)$ memory. It achieves a
$\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e^2-\epsilon-O(1/k))$ approximation. The previously best known
approximation ratio for streaming submodular maximization under matroid
constraint is 0.25 (adversarial order) due to [Feldman et al.], [Chekuri et
al.], and [Chakrabarti et al.]. Moreover, we generalize our results to the case
of p-matchoid constraints and give a
$\frac{1}{p+1}(1-1/e^{p+1}-\epsilon-O(1/k))$ approximation using $O(k)$ memory,
which asymptotically approaches the best known offline guarantee
$\frac{1}{p+1}$ [Nemhauser et al.]

  Unordered, variable-sized inputs arise in many settings across multiple

this type of input has been the focus of much work in recent years. We propose
to represent multisets using complex-weighted multiset automata and show how
the multiset representations of certain existing neural architectures can be
viewed as special cases of ours. Namely, (1) we provide a new theoretical and
intuitive justification for the Transformer model's representation of positions
using sinusoidal functions, and (2) we extend the DeepSets model to use complex
numbers, enabling it to outperform the existing model on an extension of one of
their tasks.

miss a part of the news or misinterpret the complete thing. The situation is
even worse for the people who are visually impaired or have lost their ability
to see. The inability of these people to read text has a huge impact on their
lives. There are a number of methods for blind people to read the text. Braille
script, in particular, is one of the examples, but it is a highly inefficient
method as it is really time taking and requires a lot of practice. So, we
present a method for visually impaired people based on the sense of sound which
is obviously better and more accurate than the sense of touch. This paper deals
with an efficient method to summarize news into important keywords so as to
save the efforts to go through the complete text every single time. This paper
deals with many API's and modules like the tesseract, GTTS, and many algorithms
that have been discussed and implemented in detail such as Luhn's Algorithm,
Latent Semantic Analysis Algorithm, Text Ranking Algorithm. And the other
functionality that this paper deals with is converting the summarized text to
speech so that the system can aid even the blind people.

Title: Exploration of Interaction Techniques for Graph-based Modelling in
  Virtual Reality
Authors: Adrien Coppens and Berat Bicer and Naz Yilmaz and Serhat Aras
Categories: cs.HC
\\
  Editing and manipulating graph-based models within immersive environments is
largely unexplored and certain design activities could benefit from using those
technologies. For example, in the case study of architectural modelling, the 3D
context of Virtual Reality naturally matches the intended output product, i.e.
a 3D architectural geometry. Since both the state of the art and the state of
the practice are lacking, we explore the field of VR-based interactive
modelling, and provide insights as to how to implement proper interactions in
that context, with broadly available devices. We consequently produce several
open-source software prototypes for manipulating graph-based models in VR.

Title: Characterizing Reading Time on Enterprise Emails
Authors: Xinyi Li, Chia-Jung Lee, Milad Shokouhi, Susan Dumais
Categories: cs.IR
\\
  Email is an integral part of people's work and life, enabling them to perform
activities such as communicating, searching, managing tasks and storing
information. Modern email clients take a step forward and help improve users'
productivity by automatically creating reminders, tasks or responses. The act
of reading is arguably the only activity that is in common in most -- if not
all -- of the interactions that users have with their emails.
  In this paper, we characterize how users read their enterprise emails, and
reveal the various contextual factors that impact reading time. Our approach
starts with a reading time analysis based on the reading events from a major
email platform, followed by a user study to provide explanations for some
discoveries. We identify multiple temporal and user contextual factors that are
correlated with reading time. For instance, email reading time is correlated
with user devices: on desktop reading time increases through the morning and
peaks at noon but on mobile it increases through the evening till midnight. The
reading time is also negatively correlated with the screen size.
  We have established the connection between user status and reading time:
users spend more time reading emails when they have fewer meetings and busy
hours during the day. In addition, we find that users also reread emails across
devices. Among the cross-device reading events, 76% of reread emails are first
visited on mobile and then on desktop. Overall, our study is the first to
characterize enterprise email reading time on a very large scale. The findings
provide insights to develop better metrics and user models for understanding
and improving email interactions.

\\
  Recommender systems need to mirror the complexity of the environment they are
applied in. The more we know about what might benefit the user, the more
objectives the recommender system has. In addition there may be multiple
stakeholders - sellers, buyers, shareholders - in addition to legal and ethical
constraints. Simultaneously optimizing for a multitude of objectives,
correlated and not correlated, having the same scale or not, has proven
difficult so far.
  We introduce a stochastic multi-gradient descent approach to recommender
systems (MGDRec) to solve this problem. We show that this exceeds
state-of-the-art methods in traditional objective mixtures, like revenue and
recall. Not only that, but through gradient normalization we can combine
fundamentally different objectives, having diverse scales, into a single
coherent framework. We show that uncorrelated objectives, like the proportion
of quality products, can be improved alongside accuracy. Through the use of
stochasticity, we avoid the pitfalls of calculating full gradients and provide
a clear setting for its applicability.

Title: Modeling Information Need of Users in Search Sessions
Authors: Kishaloy Halder, Heng-Tze Cheng, Ellie Ka In Chio, Georgios Roumpos,

Categories: cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  Users issue queries to Search Engines, and try to find the desired
information in the results produced. They repeat this process if their
information need is not met at the first place. It is crucial to identify the
important words in a query that depict the actual information need of the user
and will determine the course of a search session. To this end, we propose a
sequence-to-sequence based neural architecture that leverages the set of past
queries issued by users, and results that were explored by them. Firstly, we
employ our model for predicting the words in the current query that are
important and would be retained in the next query. Additionally, as a
downstream application of our model, we evaluate it on the widely popular task
of next query suggestion. We show that our intuitive strategy of capturing
information need can yield superior performance at these tasks on two large
real-world search log datasets.

Title: Integer-Forcing Architectures for Uplink Cloud Radio Access Networks
Authors: Islam El Bakoury and Bobak Nazer
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Wireless
  Communications
\\
  Consider an uplink cloud radio access network where users are observed
simultaneously by several base stations, each with a rate-limited link to a
central processor, which wishes to decode all transmitted messages. Recent
efforts have demonstrated the advantages of compression-based strategies that
send quantized channel observations to the central processor, rather than
attempt local decoding. We study the setting where channel state information is
not available at the transmitters, but known fully or partially at the base
stations. We propose an end-to-end integer-forcing framework for
compression-based uplink cloud radio access, and show that it operates within a
constant gap from the optimal outage probability if channel state information
is fully available at the base stations. We demonstrate via simulations that
our framework is competitive with state-of-the-art Wyner-Ziv-based strategies.

  Graph based codes such as low density parity check (LDPC) codes have been
shown promising for the information reconciliation phase in quantum key
distribution (QKD). However, existing graph coding schemes have not fully
utilized the properties of the QKD channel. In this work, we first investigate
the channel statistics for discrete variable (DV) QKD based on energy-time
entangled photons. We then establish a so-called balanced modulation scheme
that is promising for this channel. Based on the modulation, we propose a joint
local-global graph coding scheme that is expected to achieve good
error-correction performance.

Title: Communication over Random-Parameter Quantum Channels with Parameter
  Estimation
Authors: Uzi Pereg
Categories: cs.IT math.IT quant-ph
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1909.09992
\\
  Communication over a random-parameter quantum channel when the decoder is
required to reconstruct the parameter sequence is considered. We study
scenarios that include either strictly-causal, causal, or non-causal channel
side information (CSI) available at the encoder, and also when CSI is not
available. This model is the quantum counterpart of the classical
rate-and-state channel with state estimation at the decoder. Regularized
formulas for the capacity-distortion regions are derived. In the special case
of measurement channels, a single-letter characterization is derived for the
strictly-causal and causal settings. Furthermore, in the more general case of
entanglement-breaking channels, a single-letter characterization is derived
when CSI is not available. As a consequence, we obtain regularized formulas for
the capacity of random-parameter quantum channels with CSI, generalizing
previous results by Boche et al. on classical-quantum channels.

Title: Biometric and Physical Identifiers with Correlated Noise for
  Controllable Private Authentication
Authors: Onur G\"unl\"u, Rafael F. Schaefer, and H. Vincent Poor
Categories: cs.IT cs.CR math.IT math.PR
\\
  The problem of secret-key based authentication under privacy and storage
constraints on the source sequence is considered. The identifier measurement
channels during authentication are assumed to be controllable via a
cost-constrained action sequence. Single-letter inner and outer bounds for the
key-leakage-storage-cost regions are derived for a generalization of a classic
two-terminal key agreement model with an eavesdropper that observes a sequence
that is correlated with the sequences observed by the legitimate terminals. The
additions to the model are that the encoder observes a noisy version of a
remote source, and the noisy output and the remote source output together with
an action sequence are given as inputs to the measurement channel at the
decoder. Thus, correlation is introduced between the noise components on the
encoder and decoder measurements. The model with a secret-key generated by an
encoder is extended to the randomized models, where a secret-key is embedded to
the encoder. The results are relevant for several user and device
authentication scenarios including physical and biometric identifiers with
multiple measurements that provide diversity and multiplexing gains. To
illustrate the behavior of the rate region, achievable (secret-key rate,
storage-rate, cost) tuples are given for binary identifiers and measurement
channels that can be represented as a set of binary symmetric subchannels. The
gains from using an action sequence such as a large secret-key rate at a
significantly small hardware cost, are illustrated to motivate the use of
low-complexity transform-coding algorithms with cost-constrained actions.

Title: Novel Wake-up Scheme for Energy-Efficient Low-Latency Mobile Devices in
  5G Networks
Authors: Soheil Rostami, Kari Heiska, Oleksandr Puchko, Kari Leppanen, and
  Mikko Valkama
Categories: cs.IT eess.SP math.IT
\\
  Improved mobile device battery lifetime and latency mini-mization are
critical requirements for enhancing the mobile broadband services and user
experience. Long-term evolution (LTE) networks have adopted discontinuous
reception (DRX) as the baseline solution for prolonged battery lifetime.
However, in every DRX cycle, the mobile device baseband processing unit
monitors and decodes the control signaling, and thus all instances without any
actual data allocation leads to unnecessary energy consumption. This fact
together with the long start-up and power-down times can prevent adopting
frequent wake-up instants, which in turn leads to considerable latency. In this
work,a novel wake-up scheme is described and studied, to tackle the trade-off
between latency and battery lifetime in future 5G networks, seeking thus to
facilitate an always-available experience, rather than always-on. Analytical
and simulation-based results show that the proposed scheme is a promising
approach to control the user plane latency and energy consumption, when the
device is operating in the power saving mode. The aim of this article is to
describe the overall wake-up system operating principle and the associated
signaling methods,receiver processing solutions and essential implementation
aspects. Additionally, the advantages compared to DRX-based systems are shown
and demonstrated, through the analysis of the system energy-efficiency and
latency characteristics, with special emphasis on future 5G-grade mobile
devices

Title: The Real-World-Weight Cross-Entropy Loss Function: Modeling the Costs of
  Mislabeling
Authors: Yaoshiang Ho, Samuel Wookey
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Submitted to IEEE Access
\\
  In this paper, we propose a new metric to measure goodness-of-fit for
classifiers, the Real World Cost function. This metric factors in information
about a real world problem, such as financial impact, that other measures like
accuracy or F1 do not. This metric is also more directly interpretable for
users. To optimize for this metric, we introduce the Real-World- Weight
Crossentropy loss function, in both binary and single-label classification
variants. Both variants allow direct input of real world costs as weights. For
single-label, multicategory classification, our loss function also allows
direct penalization of probabilistic false positives, weighted by label, during
the training of a machine learning model. We compare the design of our loss
function to the binary crossentropy and categorical crossentropy functions, as
well as their weighted variants, to discuss the potential for improvement in
handling a variety of known shortcomings of machine learning, ranging from
imbalanced classes to medical diagnostic error to reinforcement of social bias.
We create scenarios that emulate those issues using the MNIST data set and
demonstrate empirical results of our new loss function. Finally, we sketch a
proof of this function based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation and discuss
future directions.

Title: A Hybrid Framework for Topic Structure using Laughter Occurrences
Authors: Sucheta Ghosh
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS
\\
  Conversational discourse coherence depends on both linguistic and
paralinguistic phenomena. In this work we combine both paralinguistic and
linguistic knowledge into a hybrid framework through a multi-level hierarchy.
Thus it outputs the discourse-level topic structures. The laughter occurrences
are used as paralinguistic information from the multiparty meeting transcripts
of ICSI database. A clustering-based algorithm is proposed that chose the best
topic-segment cluster from two independent, optimized clusters, namely,
hierarchical agglomerative clustering and $K$-medoids. Then it is iteratively
hybridized with an existing lexical cohesion based Bayesian topic segmentation
framework. The hybrid approach improves the performance of both of the
stand-alone approaches. This leads to the brief study of interactions between
topic structures with discourse relational structure. This training-free topic
structuring approach can be applicable to online understanding of spoken
dialogs.

Title: DAWSON: A Domain Adaptive Few Shot Generation Framework
Authors: Weixin Liang, Zixuan Liu and Can Liu
Categories: cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS stat.ML
\\
  Training a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for a new domain from
scratch requires an enormous amount of training data and days of training time.
To this end, we propose DAWSON, a Domain Adaptive FewShot Generation
FrameworkFor GANs based on meta-learning. A major challenge of applying
meta-learning GANs is to obtain gradients for the generator from evaluating it
on development sets due to the likelihood-free nature of GANs. To address this
challenge, we propose an alternative GAN training procedure that naturally
combines the two-step training procedure of GANs and the two-step training
procedure of meta-learning algorithms. DAWSON is a plug-and-play framework that
supports a broad family of meta-learning algorithms and various GANs with
architectural-variants. Based on DAWSON, We also propose MUSIC MATINEE, which
is the first few-shot music generation model. Our experiments show that MUSIC
MATINEE could quickly adapt to new domains with only tens of songs from the
target domains. We also show that DAWSON can learn to generate new digits with
only four samples in the MNIST dataset. We release source codes implementation
of DAWSON in both PyTorch and Tensorflow, generated music samples on two genres
and the lightning video.

Comments: 16 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Spin-glasses are universal models that can capture complex behavior of
many-body systems at the interface of statistical physics and computer science
including discrete optimization, inference in graphical models, and automated
reasoning. Computing the underlying structure and dynamics of such complex
systems is extremely difficult due to the combinatorial explosion of their
state space. Here, we develop deep generative continuous spin-glass
distributions with normalizing flows to model correlations in generic discrete
problems. We use a self-supervised learning paradigm by automatically
generating the data from the spin-glass itself. We demonstrate that key
physical and computational properties of the spin-glass phase can be
successfully learned, including multi-modal steady-state distributions and
topological structures among metastable states. Remarkably, we observe that the
learning itself corresponds to a spin-glass phase transition within the layers
of the trained normalizing flows. The inverse normalizing flows learns to
perform reversible multi-scale coarse-graining operations which are very
different from the typical irreversible renormalization group techniques.

  Tumblr, as a leading content provider and social media, attracts 371 million
monthly visits, 280 million blogs and 53.3 million daily posts. The popularity
of Tumblr provides great opportunities for advertisers to promote their
products through sponsored posts. However, it is a challenging task to target
specific demographic groups for ads, since Tumblr does not require user
information like gender and ages during their registration. Hence, to promote
ad targeting, it is essential to predict user's demography using rich content
such as posts, images and social connections. In this paper, we propose graph
based and deep learning models for age and gender predictions, which take into
account user activities and content features. For graph based models, we come
up with two approaches, network embedding and label propagation, to generate
connection features as well as directly infer user's demography. For deep
learning models, we leverage convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer
perceptron (MLP) to prediction users' age and gender. Experimental results on
real Tumblr daily dataset, with hundreds of millions of active users and
billions of following relations, demonstrate that our approaches significantly
outperform the baseline model, by improving the accuracy relatively by 81% for
age, and the AUC and accuracy by 5\% for gender.

  We use matrix iteration theory to characterize acceleration in smooth games.
We define the spectral shape of a family of games as the set containing all
eigenvalues of the Jacobians of standard gradient dynamics in the family.
Shapes restricted to the real line represent well-understood classes of
problems, like minimization. Shapes spanning the complex plane capture the
added numerical challenges in solving smooth games. In this framework, we
describe gradient-based methods, such as extragradient, as transformations on
the spectral shape. Using this perspective, we propose an optimal algorithm for
bilinear games. For smooth and strongly monotone operators, we identify a
continuum between convex minimization, where acceleration is possible using
Polyak's momentum, and the worst case where gradient descent is optimal.
Finally, going beyond first-order methods, we propose an accelerated version of
consensus optimization.

\\
  Simulation-to-simulation and simulation-to-real world transfer of neural
network models have been a difficult problem. To close the reality gap, prior
methods to simulation-to-real world transfer focused on domain adaptation,
decoupling perception and dynamics and solving each problem separately, and
randomization of agent parameters and environment conditions to expose the
learning agent to a variety of conditions. While these methods provide
acceptable performance, the computational complexity required to capture a
large variation of parameters for comprehensive scenarios on a given task such
as autonomous driving or robotic manipulation is high. Our key contribution is
to theoretically prove and empirically demonstrate that a deep attention
convolutional neural network (DACNN) with specific visual sensor configuration
performs as well as training on a dataset with high domain and parameter
variation at lower computational complexity. Specifically, the attention
network weights are learned through policy optimization to focus on local
dependencies that lead to optimal actions, and does not require tuning in
real-world for generalization. Our new architecture adapts perception with
respect to the control objective, resulting in zero-shot learning without
pre-training a perception network. To measure the impact of our new deep
network architecture on domain adaptation, we consider autonomous driving as a
use case. We perform an extensive set of experiments in
simulation-to-simulation and simulation-to-real scenarios to compare our
approach to several baselines including the current state-of-art models.

\\
  This paper formulates the problem of building a context-aware predictive
model based on user diverse behavioral activities with smartphones. In the area
of machine learning and data science, a tree-like model as that of decision
tree is considered as one of the most popular classification techniques, which
can be used to build a data-driven predictive model. The traditional decision
tree model typically creates a number of leaf nodes as decision nodes that
represent context-specific rigid decisions, and consequently may cause
overfitting problem in behavior modeling. However, in many practical scenarios
within the context-aware environment, the generalized outcomes could play an
important role to effectively capture user behavior. In this paper, we propose
a behavioral decision tree, "BehavDT" context-aware model that takes into
account user behavior-oriented generalization according to individual
preference level. The BehavDT model outputs not only the generalized decisions
but also the context-specific decisions in relevant exceptional cases. The
effectiveness of our BehavDT model is studied by conducting experiments on
individual user real smartphone datasets. Our experimental results show that
the proposed BehavDT context-aware model is more effective when compared with
the traditional machine learning approaches, in predicting user diverse
behaviors considering multi-dimensional contexts.

Title: Unsupervised Online Feature Selection for Cost-Sensitive Medical
  Diagnosis

Comments: Accepted to NetHealth Workshop at COMSNETS 2020
\\
  In medical diagnosis, physicians predict the state of a patient by checking
measurements (features) obtained from a sequence of tests, e.g., blood test,
urine test, followed by invasive tests. As tests are often costly, one would
like to obtain only those features (tests) that can establish the presence or
absence of the state conclusively. Another aspect of medical diagnosis is that
we are often faced with unsupervised prediction tasks as the true state of the
patients may not be known. Motivated by such medical diagnosis problems, we
consider a {\it Cost-Sensitive Medical Diagnosis} (CSMD) problem, where the
true state of patients is unknown. We formulate the CSMD problem as a feature
selection problem where each test gives a feature that can be used in a
prediction model. Our objective is to learn strategies for selecting the
features that give the best trade-off between accuracy and costs. We exploit
the `Weak Dominance' property of problem to develop online algorithms that
identify a set of features which provides an `optimal' trade-off between cost
and accuracy of prediction without requiring to know the true state of the
medical condition. Our empirical results validate the performance of our
algorithms on problem instances generated from real-world datasets.

Title: A Loss-Function for Causal Machine-Learning
Authors: I-Sheng Yang
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 13 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Causal machine-learning is about predicting the net-effect (true-lift) of
treatments. Given the data of a treatment group and a control group, it is
similar to a standard supervised-learning problem. Unfortunately, there is no
similarly well-defined loss function due to the lack of point-wise true values
in the data. Many advances in modern machine-learning are not directly
applicable due to the absence of such loss function.
  We propose a novel method to define a loss function in this context, which is
equal to mean-square-error (MSE) in a standard regression problem. Our loss
function is universally applicable, thus providing a general standard to
evaluate the quality of any model/strategy that predicts the true-lift. We
demonstrate that despite its novel definition, one can still perform gradient
descent directly on this loss function to find the best fit. This leads to a
new way to train any parameter-based model, such as deep neural networks, to
solve causal machine-learning problems without going through the meta-learner
strategy.

\\
  There is currently an unprecedented demand for large-scale temporal data
analysis due to the explosive growth of data. Dynamic topic modeling has been
widely used in social and data sciences with the goal of learning latent topics
that emerge, evolve, and fade over time. Previous work on dynamic topic
modeling primarily employ the method of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF),
where slices of the data tensor are each factorized into the product of
lower-dimensional nonnegative matrices. With this approach, however,
information contained in the temporal dimension of the data is often neglected
or underutilized. To overcome this issue, we propose instead adopting the
method of nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAPAC (CP) tensor decomposition (NNCPD),
where the data tensor is directly decomposed into a minimal sum of outer
products of nonnegative vectors, thereby preserving the temporal information.
The viability of NNCPD is demonstrated through application to both synthetic
and real data, where significantly improved results are obtained compared to
those of typical NMF-based methods. The advantages of NNCPD over such
approaches are studied and discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time that NNCPD has been utilized for the purpose of dynamic topic
modeling, and our findings will be transformative for both applications and
further developments.

Title: Academic Performance Estimation with Attention-based Graph Convolutional
  Networks
Authors: Qian Hu, Huzefa Rangwala
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
\\
  Student's academic performance prediction empowers educational technologies
including academic trajectory and degree planning, course recommender systems,
early warning and advising systems. Given a student's past data (such as grades
in prior courses), the task of student's performance prediction is to predict a
student's grades in future courses. Academic programs are structured in a way
that prior courses lay the foundation for future courses. The knowledge
required by courses is obtained by taking multiple prior courses, which
exhibits complex relationships modeled by graph structures. Traditional methods
for student's performance prediction usually neglect the underlying
relationships between multiple courses; and how students acquire knowledge
across them. In addition, traditional methods do not provide interpretation for
predictions needed for decision making. In this work, we propose a novel
attention-based graph convolutional networks model for student's performance
prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset obtained
from a large public university. The experimental results show that our proposed
model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of grade prediction. The
proposed model also shows strong accuracy in identifying students who are
at-risk of failing or dropping out so that timely intervention and feedback can
be provided to the student.

Title: Convolutional Neural Network-based Topology Optimization (CNN-TO) By
  Estimating Sensitivity of Compliance from Material Distribution
Authors: Yusuke Takahashi, Yoshiro Suzuki, Akira Todoroki
Categories: cs.LG cs.CE
\\
  This paper proposes a new topology optimization method that applies a
convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one deep learning technique for
topology optimization problems. Using this method, we acquire a structure with
a little higher performance that could not be obtained by the previous topology
optimization method. In particular, in this paper, we solve a topology
optimization problem aimed at maximizing stiffness with a mass constraint,
which is a common type of topology optimization. In this paper, we first
formulate the conventional topology optimization by the solid isotropic
material with penalization method. Next, we formulate the topology optimization
using CNN. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed topology
optimization method by solving a verification example, namely a topology
optimization problem aimed at maximizing stiffness. In this research, as a
result of solving the verification example for a small design area of 16x32
element, we obtain the solution different from the previous topology
optimization method. This result suggests that stiffness information of
structure can be extracted and analyzed for structural design by analyzing the
density distribution using CNN like an image. This suggests that CNN technology
can be utilized in the structural design and topology optimization.

\\
  We describe a method for Bayesian optimization by which one may incorporate
data from multiple systems whose quantitative interrelationships are unknown a
priori. All general (nonreal-valued) features of the systems are associated
with continuous latent variables that enter as inputs into a single metamodel
that simultaneously learns the response surfaces of all of the systems.
Bayesian inference is used to determine appropriate beliefs regarding the
latent variables. We explain how the resulting probabilistic metamodel may be
used for Bayesian optimization tasks and demonstrate its implementation on a
variety of synthetic and real-world examples, comparing its performance under
zero-, one-, and few-shot settings against traditional Bayesian optimization,
which usually requires substantially more data from the system of interest.

Title: Auditing and Debugging Deep Learning Models via Decision Boundaries:
  Individual-level and Group-level Analysis
Authors: Roozbeh Yousefzadeh and Dianne P. O'Leary
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
\\
  Deep learning models have been criticized for their lack of easy
interpretation, which undermines confidence in their use for important
applications. Nevertheless, they are consistently utilized in many
applications, consequential to humans' lives, mostly because of their better
performance. Therefore, there is a great need for computational methods that
can explain, audit, and debug such models. Here, we use flip points to
accomplish these goals for deep learning models with continuous output scores
(e.g., computed by softmax), used in social applications. A flip point is any
point that lies on the boundary between two output classes: e.g. for a model
with a binary yes/no output, a flip point is any input that generates equal
scores for "yes" and "no". The flip point closest to a given input is of
particular importance because it reveals the least changes in the input that
would change a model's classification, and we show that it is the solution to a
well-posed optimization problem. Flip points also enable us to systematically
study the decision boundaries of a deep learning classifier. The resulting
insight into the decision boundaries of a deep model can clearly explain the
model's output on the individual-level, via an explanation report that is
understandable by non-experts. We also develop a procedure to understand and
audit model behavior towards groups of people. Flip points can also be used to
alter the decision boundaries in order to improve undesirable behaviors. We
demonstrate our methods by investigating several models trained on standard
datasets used in social applications of machine learning. We also identify the
features that are most responsible for particular classifications and
misclassifications.

Title: A Neural Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for Task-Free Continual
  Learning
Authors: Soochan Lee, Junsoo Ha, Dongsu Zhang, Gunhee Kim
Categories: cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML
Comments: Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2020
\\
  Despite the growing interest in continual learning, most of its contemporary
works have been studied in a rather restricted setting where tasks are clearly
distinguishable, and task boundaries are known during training. However, if our
goal is to develop an algorithm that learns as humans do, this setting is far
from realistic, and it is essential to develop a methodology that works in a
task-free manner. Meanwhile, among several branches of continual learning,
expansion-based methods have the advantage of eliminating catastrophic
forgetting by allocating new resources to learn new data. In this work, we
propose an expansion-based approach for task-free continual learning. Our
model, named Continual Neural Dirichlet Process Mixture (CN-DPM), consists of a
set of neural network experts that are in charge of a subset of the data.
CN-DPM expands the number of experts in a principled way under the Bayesian
nonparametric framework. With extensive experiments, we show that our model
successfully performs task-free continual learning for both discriminative and
generative tasks such as image classification and image generation.

Title: Fractional Skipping: Towards Finer-Grained Dynamic CNN Inference
Authors: Jianghao Shen, Yonggan Fu, Yue Wang, Pengfei Xu, Zhangyang Wang,
  Yingyan Lin
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  While increasingly deep networks are still in general desired for achieving
state-of-the-art performance, for many specific inputs a simpler network might
already suffice. Existing works exploited this observation by learning to skip
convolutional layers in an input-dependent manner. However, we argue their
binary decision scheme, i.e., either fully executing or completely bypassing
one layer for a specific input, can be enhanced by introducing finer-grained,
"softer" decisions. We therefore propose a Dynamic Fractional Skipping (DFS)
framework. The core idea of DFS is to hypothesize layer-wise quantization (to
different bitwidths) as intermediate "soft" choices to be made between fully
utilizing and skipping a layer. For each input, DFS dynamically assigns a
bitwidth to both weights and activations of each layer, where fully executing
and skipping could be viewed as two "extremes" (i.e., full bitwidth and zero
bitwidth). In this way, DFS can "fractionally" exploit a layer's expressive
power during input-adaptive inference, enabling finer-grained
accuracy-computational cost trade-offs. It presents a unified view to link
input-adaptive layer skipping and input-adaptive hybrid quantization. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the superior tradeoff between computational
cost and model expressive power (accuracy) achieved by DFS. More visualizations
also indicate a smooth and consistent transition in the DFS behaviors,
especially the learned choices between layer skipping and different
quantizations when the total computational budgets vary, validating our
hypothesis that layer quantization could be viewed as intermediate variants of
layer skipping. Our source code and supplementary material are available at
\link{https://github.com/Torment123/DFS}.

Title: Automated Relational Meta-learning

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: Accepted by ICLR 2020
\\
  In order to efficiently learn with small amount of data on new tasks,
meta-learning transfers knowledge learned from previous tasks to the new ones.
However, a critical challenge in meta-learning is the task heterogeneity which
cannot be well handled by traditional globally shared meta-learning methods. In
addition, current task-specific meta-learning methods may either suffer from
hand-crafted structure design or lack the capability to capture complex
relations between tasks. In this paper, motivated by the way of knowledge
organization in knowledge bases, we propose an automated relational
meta-learning (ARML) framework that automatically extracts the cross-task
relations and constructs the meta-knowledge graph. When a new task arrives, it
can quickly find the most relevant structure and tailor the learned structure
knowledge to the meta-learner. As a result, the proposed framework not only
addresses the challenge of task heterogeneity by a learned meta-knowledge
graph, but also increases the model interpretability. We conduct extensive
experiments on 2D toy regression and few-shot image classification and the
results demonstrate the superiority of ARML over state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: Memory-Loss is Fundamental for Stability and Distinguishes the Echo
  State Property Threshold in Reservoir Computing & Beyond
Authors: G Manjunath
Categories: cs.LG math.DS stat.ML
\\
  Reservoir computing, a highly successful neuromorphic computing scheme used
to filter, predict, classify temporal inputs, has entered an era of microchips
for several other engineering and biological applications. A basis for
reservoir computing is memory-loss or the echo state property. It is an open
problem on how design parameters of the reservoir can be optimized to maximize
reservoir freedom to map an input robustly and yet have its close-by-variants
represented in the reservoir differently. We present a framework to analyze
stability due to input and parameter perturbations and make a surprising
fundamental conclusion, that the echo state property is \emph{equivalent} to
robustness to input in any nonlinear recurrent neural network that may or may
not be in the gambit of reservoir computing. Further, backed by theoretical
conclusions, we define and find the difficult-to-describe \emph{input specific}
edge-of-criticality or the echo state property threshold, which defines the
boundary between parameter related stability and instability.

Title: Optimizing Wireless Systems Using Unsupervised and
  Reinforced-Unsupervised Deep Learning
Authors: Dong Liu, Chengjian Sun, Chenyang Yang, Lajos Hanzo
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: To appear in IEEE Network Magazine
\\
  Resource allocation and transceivers in wireless networks are usually
designed by solving optimization problems subject to specific constraints,
which can be formulated as variable or functional optimization. If the
objective and constraint functions of a variable optimization problem can be
derived, standard numerical algorithms can be applied for finding the optimal
solution, which however incur high computational cost when the dimension of the
variable is high. To reduce the on-line computational complexity, learning the
optimal solution as a function of the environment's status by deep neural
networks (DNNs) is an effective approach. DNNs can be trained under the
supervision of optimal solutions, which however, is not applicable to the
scenarios without models or for functional optimization where the optimal
solutions are hard to obtain. If the objective and constraint functions are
unavailable, reinforcement learning can be applied to find the solution of a
functional optimization problem, which is however not tailored to optimization
problems in wireless networks. In this article, we introduce unsupervised and
reinforced-unsupervised learning frameworks for solving both variable and
functional optimization problems without the supervision of the optimal
solutions. When the mathematical model of the environment is completely known
and the distribution of environment's status is known or unknown, we can invoke
unsupervised learning algorithm. When the mathematical model of the environment
is incomplete, we introduce reinforced-unsupervised learning algorithms that
learn the model by interacting with the environment. Our simulation results
confirm the applicability of these learning frameworks by taking a user
association problem as an example.

Title: Making Sense of Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic Inference
Authors: Brendan O'Donoghue, Ian Osband, Catalin Ionescu
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  Reinforcement learning (RL) combines a control problem with statistical
estimation: the system dynamics are not known to the agent, but can be learned
through experience. A recent line of research casts `RL as inference' and
suggests a particular framework to generalize the RL problem as probabilistic
inference. Our paper surfaces a key shortcoming in that approach, and clarifies
the sense in which RL can be coherently cast as an inference problem. In
particular, an RL agent must consider the effects of its actions upon future
rewards and observations: the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In all but the
most simple settings, the resulting inference is computationally intractable so
that practical RL algorithms must resort to approximation. We demonstrate that
the popular `RL as inference' approximation can perform poorly in even very
basic problems. However, we show that with a small modification the framework
does yield algorithms that can provably perform well, and we show that the
resulting algorithm is equivalent to the recently proposed K-learning, which we
further connect with Thompson sampling.

  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are considered an integral part
of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Their impact, and far-reaching
consequences, while acknowledged, are yet to be comprehended. These
technologies are very specialized, and few organizations and select highly
trained professionals have the wherewithal, in terms of money, manpower, and
might, to chart the future. However, concentration of power can lead to
marginalization, causing severe inequalities. Regulatory agencies and
governments across the globe are creating national policies, and laws around
these technologies to protect the rights of the digital citizens, as well as to
empower them. Even private, not-for-profit organizations are also contributing
to democratizing the technologies by making them \emph{accessible} and
\emph{affordable}. However, accessibility and affordability are all but a few
of the facets of democratizing the field. Others include, but not limited to,
\emph{portability}, \emph{explainability}, \emph{credibility}, \emph{fairness},
among others. As one can imagine, democratizing AI is a multi-faceted problem,
and it requires advancements in science, technology and policy. At
\texttt{mlsquare}, we are developing scientific tools in this space.
Specifically, we introduce an opinionated, extensible, \texttt{Python}

in each of the categories mentioned above. We present the design details, APIs
of the framework, reference implementations, road map for development, and

Title: Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty with Random Forests

Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures
\\
  Due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical
applications, many of which are coming with safety requirements, the notion of
uncertainty has received increasing attention in machine learning research in
the last couple of years. In particular, the idea of distinguishing between two
important types of uncertainty, often refereed to as aleatoric and epistemic,
has recently been studied in the setting of supervised learning. In this paper,
we propose to quantify these uncertainties with random forests. More
specifically, we show how two general approaches for measuring the learner's
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a prediction can be instantiated with
decision trees and random forests as learning algorithms in a classification
setting. In this regard, we also compare random forests with deep neural
networks, which have been used for a similar purpose.

Title: Learning Accurate Integer Transformer Machine-Translation Models
Authors: Ephrem Wu
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL stat.ML
\\
  We describe a method for training accurate Transformer machine-translation
models to run inference using 8-bit integer (INT8) hardware matrix multipliers,
as opposed to the more costly single-precision floating-point (FP32) hardware.
Unlike previous work, which converted only 85 Transformer matrix
multiplications to INT8, leaving 48 out of 133 of them in FP32 because of
unacceptable accuracy loss, we convert them all to INT8 without compromising
accuracy. Tested on the newstest2014 English-to-German translation task, our
INT8 Transformer Base and Transformer Big models yield BLEU scores that are
99.3% to 100% relative to those of the corresponding FP32 models. Our approach
converts all matrix-multiplication tensors from an existing FP32 model into
INT8 tensors by automatically making range-precision trade-offs during
training. To demonstrate the robustness of this approach, we also include
results from INT6 Transformer models.

Title: On Supergraphs Satisfying CMSO Properties
Authors: Mateus de Oliveira Oliveira
Categories: cs.LO
Comments: A preliminary version of this work appeared at the 26th EACSL Annual
  Conference on Computer Science Logic, CSL 2017
\\
  Let CMSO denote the counting monadic second order logic of graphs. We give a
constructive proof that for some computable function $f$, there is an algorithm
$\mathfrak{A}$ that takes as input a CMSO sentence $\varphi$, a positive
integer $t$, and a connected graph $G$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, and
determines, in time $f(|\varphi|,t)\cdot 2^{O(\Delta \cdot t)}\cdot
|G|^{O(t)}$, whether $G$ has a supergraph $G'$ of treewidth at most $t$ such
that $G'\models \varphi$. The algorithmic metatheorem described above sheds new
light on certain unresolved questions within the framework of graph completion
algorithms. In particular, using this metatheorem, we provide an explicit
algorithm that determines, in time $f(d)\cdot 2^{O(\Delta \cdot d)}\cdot
|G|^{O(d)}$, whether a connected graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ has a planar
supergraph of diameter at most $d$. Additionally, we show that for each fixed
$k$, the problem of determining whether $G$ has an $k$-outerplanar supergraph
of diameter at most $d$ is strongly uniformly fixed parameter tractable with
respect to the parameter $d$. This result can be generalized in two directions.
First, the diameter parameter can be replaced by any contraction-closed
effectively CMSO-definable parameter $\mathbf{p}$. Examples of such parameters
are vertex-cover number, dominating number, and many other
contraction-bidimensional parameters. In the second direction, the planarity
requirement can be relaxed to bounded genus, and more generally, to bounded
local treewidth.

formulas) or additionally to derive all implied literals if the formula is
satisfiable (propagation complete or PC formulas). If a formula represents a
function using existentially quantified auxiliary variables, it is called an
encoding of the function. We prove several results on the sizes of PC and URC
formulas and encodings. One of them are separations between the sizes of
formulas of different types. Namely, we prove an exponential separation between
the size of URC formulas and PC formulas and between the size of PC encodings
using auxiliary variables and URC formulas. Besides of this, we prove that the
sizes of any two irredundant PC formulas for the same function differ at most
by a polynomial factor in the number of the variables and present an example of
a function demonstrating that a similar statement is not true for URC formulas.
One of the separations above implies that a q-Horn formula may require an
exponential number of additional clauses to become a URC formula. On the other
hand, for every q-Horn formula, we present a polynomial size URC encoding of
the same function using auxiliary variables. This encoding is not q-Horn in
general.

Title: Convergence bounds for empirical nonlinear least-squares
Authors: Martin Eigel, Reinhold Schneider, Philipp Trunschke
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.PR
\\
  We consider best approximation problems in a (nonlinear) subspace
$\mathcal{M}$ of a Banach space $(\mathcal{V},\|\bullet\|)$ where only an
empirical estimate $\|\bullet\|_n$ of the norm can be computed. The norm is
assumed to be of the form $\|v\| := \mathbb{E}_Y[|v|_Y^2]^{1/2}$ for some
(parametric) seminorm $|\bullet|_Y$ depending on a random variable $Y$. The
objective is to approximate an unknown function $u \in \mathcal{V}$ by
$v\in\mathcal{M}$ by minimizing the empirical norm $\|u-v\|_n^2 :=
\tfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n |u-v|_{y_i}^2$ w.r.t.\ $n$ random samples
$\{y_i\}_{i=1,\ldots,n}$. It is well-known that such least squares
approximations can become inaccurate and unstable when the number of samples
$n$ is too close to the number of parameters $m \propto
\operatorname{dim}(\mathcal{M})$. We review this statement in the light of
adapted distributions for the samples $y_i$ and establish error bounds of the
empirical best approximation error based on a restricted isometry property
(RIP) $(1-\delta)\|v\|^2 \le \|v\|_n^2 \le (1+\delta)\|v\|^2 \ \forall
v\in\mathcal{M}$ which holds in probability. These results are closely related
to those in "Optimal weighted least-squares methods" (A. Cohen and G.
Migliorati, 2016) and show that $n \ge sm$ is sufficient for the RIP to be
satisfied with high probability. The factor $s$ represents the variation of the
empirical norm $\|\bullet\|_n$ on $\mathcal{M}$. % and can be influenced by the
choice of the distribution of the samples. Several model classes are examined
and numerical experiments illustrate some of the obtained stability bounds.

Title: Asymptotically compatible reproducing kernel collocation and meshfree
  integration for the peridynamic Navier equation
Authors: Yu Leng, Xiaochuan Tian, Nathaniel A. Trask, John T. Foster
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  In this work, we study the reproducing kernel (RK) collocation method for the
peridynamic Navier equation. We first apply a linear RK approximation on both
displacements and dilatation, then back-substitute dilatation, and solve the
peridynamic Navier equation in a pure displacement form. The RK collocation
scheme converges to the nonlocal limit and also to the local limit as nonlocal
interactions vanish. The stability is shown by comparing the collocation scheme
with the standard Galerkin scheme using Fourier analysis. We then apply the RK
collocation to the quasi-discrete peridynamic Navier equation and show its
convergence to the correct local limit when the ratio between the nonlocal
length scale and the discretization parameter is fixed. The analysis is carried
out on a special family of rectilinear Cartesian grids for the RK collocation
method with a designated kernel with finite support. We assume the Lam\'{e}
parameters satisfy $\lambda \geq \mu$ to avoid adding extra constraints on the
nonlocal kernel. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the
theoretical results.

Title: A note on $2\times 2$ block-diagonal preconditioning
Authors: Ben S. Southworth and Samuel A. Olivier
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 13 pages
MSC-class: 65F08
\\
  For 2x2 block matrices, it is well-known that block-triangular or block-LDU
preconditioners with an exact Schur complement (inverse) converge in at most
two iterations for fixed-point or minimal-residual methods. Similarly, for
saddle-point matrices with a zero (2,2)-block, block-diagonal preconditioners
converge in at most three iterations for minimal-residual methods, although
they may diverge for fixed-point iterations. But, what happens for
non-saddle-point matrices and block-diagonal preconditioners with an exact
Schur complement? This note proves that minimal-residual methods applied to
general 2x2 block matrices, preconditioned with a block-diagonal
preconditioner, including an exact Schur complement, do not (necessarily)
converge in a fixed number of iterations. Furthermore, examples are constructed
where (i) block-diagonal preconditioning with an exact Schur complement
converges no faster than block-diagonal preconditioning using diagonal blocks
of the matrix, and (ii) block-diagonal preconditioning with an approximate
Schur complement converges as fast as the corresponding block-triangular
preconditioning. The paper concludes by discussing some practical applications
in neutral-particle transport, introducing one algorithm where block-triangular
or block-LDU preconditioning are superior to block-diagonal, and a second
algorithm where block-diagonal preconditioning is superior both in speed and
simplicity.

Title: Explicit high-order energy-preserving methods for general Hamiltonian
  partial differential equations
Authors: Chaolong Jiang and Yushun Wang and Yuezheng Gong
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 18pages, 21 figures
\\
  A novel class of explicit high-order energy-preserving methods are proposed
for general Hamiltonian partial differential equations with non-canonical
structure matrix. When the energy is not quadratic, it is firstly done that the
original system is reformulated into an equivalent form with a modified
quadratic energy conservation law by the energy quadratization approach. Then
the resulting system that satisfies the quadratic energy conservation law is
discretized in time by combining explicit high-order Runge-Kutta methods with
orthogonal projection techniques. The proposed schemes are shown to share the
order of explicit Runge-Kutta method and thus can reach the desired high-order
accuracy. Moreover, the methods are energy-preserving and explicit because the
projection step can be solved explicitly. Numerical results are addressed to
demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed schemes in comparison
with other structure-preserving methods.

Title: Step-by-step solving schemes based on scalar auxiliary variable and
  invariant energy quadratization approaches for gradient flows
Authors: Zhengguang Liu and Xiaoli Li
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.AP
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1912.09263
\\
  In this paper, we propose several novel numerical techniques to deal with
nonlinear terms in gradient flows. These step-by-step solving schemes, termed
3S-SAV and 3S-IEQ schemes, are based on recently popular scalar auxiliary
variable (SAV) and invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) approaches. In these
constructed numerical methods, the phase function $\phi$ and auxiliary variable
can be calculated step-by-step. Compared with the traditional SAV/IEQ
approaches, there are many advantages for the novel 3S-SAV/3S-IEQ schemes.
Firstly, we do not need the restriction of the bounded from below of the
nonlinear free energy potential/density function. Secondly, the auxiliary
variable combined with nonlinear function can be treated totally explicitly in
the 3S-SAV/3S-IEQ approaches. Specially, for solving the discrete scheme based
on IEQ approach, the linear system usually involves variable coefficients which
change at each time step. However, the discrete scheme based on 3S-IEQ approach
leads to linear equation with constant coefficients. Two comparative studies of
traditional SAV/IEQ and 3S-SAV/3S-IEQ approaches are considered to show the
accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we present various 2D numerical simulations
to demonstrate the stability and accuracy.

Title: Stabilized reduced basis methods for parametrized steady Stokes and
  Navier-Stokes equations
Authors: Shafqat Ali and Francesco Ballarin and Gianluigi Rozza
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 27 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables
\\
  It is well known in the Reduced Basis approximation of saddle point problems
that the Galerkin projection on the reduced space does not guarantee the
inf-sup approximation stability even if a stable high fidelity method was used
to generate snapshots. For problems in computational fluid dynamics, the lack
of inf-sup stability is reflected by the inability to accurately approximate
the pressure field. In this context, inf-sup stability is usually recovered
through the enrichment of the velocity space with suitable supremizer
functions. The main goal of this work is to propose an alternative approach,
which relies on the residual based stabilization techniques customarily
employed in the Finite Element literature, such as Brezzi-Pitkaranta,
Franca-Hughes, streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin, Galerkin Least Square. In the
spirit of \textit{offline-online} reduced basis computational splitting, two
such options are proposed, namely \textit{offline-only stabilization} and
\textit{offline-online stabilization}. These approaches are then compared to
(and combined with) the state of the art supremizer enrichment approach.
Numerical results are discussed, highlighting that the proposed methodology
allows to obtain smaller reduced basis spaces (i.e., neglecting supremizer
enrichment) for which a modified inf-sup stability is still preserved at the
reduced order level.

Title: Monte-Carlo cubature construction
Authors: Satoshi Hayakawa
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.PR
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  In numerical integration, cubature methods are effective, in particular when
the integrands can well be approximated by known test functions, such as
polynomials. However, the construction of cubature formulas has not generally
been known, and existing examples are only for particular domains of integrands
such as hypercube and sphere. In this study, we show that we can generally
construct cubature formulas for probability measures provided that we have an
i.i.d. sampler from the measure and mean values of given test functions. We
also see that our method work as a means of data compression, even if we do not
have sufficient prior information of the measure.

Title: A Two stage Adaptive Knowledge Transfer Evolutionary Multi-tasking Based
  on Population Distribution for Multi/Many-Objective Optimization
Authors: Zhengping Liang, Weiqi Liang, Xiuju Xu, and Zexuan Zhu
Categories: cs.NE
Comments: 13 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, 56 references
\\
  Multi-tasking optimization can usually achieve better performance than
traditional single-tasking optimization through knowledge transfer between
tasks. However, current multi-tasking optimization algorithms have some
deficiencies. For high similarity problems, the knowledge that can accelerate
the convergence rate of tasks has not been utilized fully. For low similarity
problems, the probability of generating negative transfer is high, which may
result in optimization performance degradation. In addition, some knowledge
transfer methods proposed previously do not fully consider how to deal with the
situation in which the population falls into local optimum. To solve these
issues, a two stage adaptive knowledge transfer evolutionary multi-tasking
optimization algorithm based on population distribution, labeled as EMT-PD, is
proposed. EMT-PD can accelerate and improve the convergence performance of
tasks based on the knowledge extracted from the probability model that reflects
the search trend of the whole population. At the first transfer stage, an
adaptive weight is used to adjust the step size of individual's search, which
can reduce the impact of negative transfer. At the second stage of knowledge
transfer, the individual's search range is further adjusted dynamically, which
can increase the diversity of population and beneficial for jumping out of
local optimum. Experimental results on multi-tasking multi-objective
optimization test suites show that EMT-PD is superior to six state-of-the-art
optimization algorithms. In order to further investigate the effectiveness of
EMT-PD on many-objective optimization problems, a multi-tasking many-objective
test suite is designed. The experimental results on it also demonstrate that
EMT-PD has obvious competitiveness.

Title: Good Feature Matching: Towards Accurate, Robust VO/VSLAM with Low

Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
Comments: Accepted as a Regular Paper to the IEEE Transactions on Robotics
  Journal
DOI: 10.1109/TRO.2020.2964138
\\
  Analysis of state-of-the-art VO/VSLAM system exposes a gap in balancing
performance (accuracy & robustness) and efficiency (latency). Feature-based
systems exhibit good performance, yet have higher latency due to explicit data
association; direct & semidirect systems have lower latency, but are
inapplicable in some target scenarios or exhibit lower accuracy than
feature-based ones. This paper aims to fill the performance-efficiency gap with
an enhancement applied to feature-based VSLAM. We present good feature
matching, an active map-to-frame feature matching method. Feature matching
effort is tied to submatrix selection, which has combinatorial time complexity
and requires choosing a scoring metric. Via simulation, the Max-logDet matrix
revealing metric is shown to perform best. For real-time applicability, the
combination of deterministic selection and randomized acceleration is studied.
The proposed algorithm is integrated into monocular & stereo feature-based
VSLAM systems. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks and compute
hardware quantify the latency reduction and the accuracy & robustness
preservation.

Title: Gait Graph Optimization: Generate Variable Gaits from One Base Gait for
  Lower-limb Rehabilitation Exoskeleton Robots
Authors: Lei Zhang, Weihai Chen, Yuan Chai, Jianhua Wang, Jianbin Zhang
Categories: cs.RO cs.HC
Comments: 8 pages, 15 figures
\\
  The most concentrated application of lower-limb rehabilitation exoskeleton
(LLE) robot is that it can help paraplegics "re-walk". However, "walking" in
daily life is more than just walking on flat ground with fixed gait. This paper
focuses on variable gaits generation for LLE robot to adapt complex walking
environment. Different from traditional gaits generator for biped robot, the
generated gaits for LLEs should be comfortable to patients. Inspired by the
pose graph optimization algorithm in SLAM, we propose a graph-based gait
generation algorithm called gait graph optimization (GGO) to generate variable,
functional and comfortable gaits from one base gait collected from healthy
individuals to adapt the walking environment. Variants of walking problem,
e.g., stride adjustment, obstacle avoidance, and stair ascent and descent, help
verify the proposed approach in simulation and experimentation. We open source
our implementation.

Title: Eigenresiduals for improved Parametric Speech Synthesis
Authors: Thomas Drugman, Geoffrey Wilfart, Thierry Dutoit
Categories: cs.SD cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  Statistical parametric speech synthesizers have recently shown their ability
to produce natural-sounding and flexible voices. Unfortunately the delivered
quality suffers from a typical buzziness due to the fact that speech is
vocoded. This paper proposes a new excitation model in order to reduce this
undesirable effect. This model is based on the decomposition of
pitch-synchronous residual frames on an orthonormal basis obtained by Principal
Component Analysis. This basis contains a limited number of eigenresiduals and
is computed on a relatively small speech database. A stream of PCA-based
coefficients is added to our HMM-based synthesizer and allows to generate the
voiced excitation during the synthesis. An improvement compared to the
traditional excitation is reported while the synthesis engine footprint remains
under about 1Mb.

  This paper addresses the problem of automatic detection of voice pathologies
directly from the speech signal. For this, we investigate the use of the
glottal source estimation as a means to detect voice disorders. Three sets of
features are proposed, depending on whether they are related to the speech or
the glottal signal, or to prosody. The relevancy of these features is assessed
through mutual information-based measures. This allows an intuitive
interpretation in terms of discrimation power and redundancy between the
features, independently of any subsequent classifier. It is discussed which
characteristics are interestingly informative or complementary for detecting
voice pathologies.

Title: A Comparative Study of Glottal Source Estimation Techniques
Authors: Thomas Drugman, Baris Bozkurt, Thierry Dutoit
Categories: cs.SD cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  Source-tract decomposition (or glottal flow estimation) is one of the basic
problems of speech processing. For this, several techniques have been proposed
in the literature. However studies comparing different approaches are almost
nonexistent. Besides, experiments have been systematically performed either on
synthetic speech or on sustained vowels. In this study we compare three of the
main representative state-of-the-art methods of glottal flow estimation:
closed-phase inverse filtering, iterative and adaptive inverse filtering, and
mixed-phase decomposition. These techniques are first submitted to an objective
assessment test on synthetic speech signals. Their sensitivity to various
factors affecting the estimation quality, as well as their robustness to noise
are studied. In a second experiment, their ability to label voice quality
(tensed, modal, soft) is studied on a large corpus of real connected speech. It
is shown that changes of voice quality are reflected by significant
modifications in glottal feature distributions. Techniques based on the
mixed-phase decomposition and on a closed-phase inverse filtering process turn
out to give the best results on both clean synthetic and real speech signals.
On the other hand, iterative and adaptive inverse filtering is recommended in
noisy environments for its high robustness.

Title: Glottal Closure and Opening Instant Detection from Speech Signals
Authors: Thomas Drugman, Thierry Dutoit
Categories: cs.SD cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  This paper proposes a new procedure to detect Glottal Closure and Opening
Instants (GCIs and GOIs) directly from speech waveforms. The procedure is
divided into two successive steps. First a mean-based signal is computed, and
intervals where speech events are expected to occur are extracted from it.
Secondly, at each interval a precise position of the speech event is assigned
by locating a discontinuity in the Linear Prediction residual. The proposed
method is compared to the DYPSA algorithm on the CMU ARCTIC database. A
significant improvement as well as a better noise robustness are reported.
Besides, results of GOI identification accuracy are promising for the glottal
source characterization.

Title: A Deterministic plus Stochastic Model of the Residual Signal for
  Improved Parametric Speech Synthesis
Authors: Thomas Drugman, Geoffrey Wilfart, Thierry Dutoit
Categories: cs.SD cs.CL eess.AS
\\
  Speech generated by parametric synthesizers generally suffers from a typical
buzziness, similar to what was encountered in old LPC-like vocoders. In order
to alleviate this problem, a more suited modeling of the excitation should be
adopted. For this, we hereby propose an adaptation of the Deterministic plus
Stochastic Model (DSM) for the residual. In this model, the excitation is
divided into two distinct spectral bands delimited by the maximum voiced
frequency. The deterministic part concerns the low-frequency contents and
consists of a decomposition of pitch-synchronous residual frames on an
orthonormal basis obtained by Principal Component Analysis. The stochastic
component is a high-pass filtered noise whose time structure is modulated by an
energy-envelope, similarly to what is done in the Harmonic plus Noise Model
(HNM). The proposed residual model is integrated within a HMM-based speech
synthesizer and is compared to the traditional excitation through a subjective
test. Results show a significative improvement for both male and female voices.
In addition the proposed model requires few computational load and memory,
which is essential for its integration in commercial applications.

\\
  Research has shown that cryptographic APIs are hard to use. Consequently,
developers resort to using code examples available in online information
sources that are often not secure. We have developed a web platform, named
CryptoExplorer, stocked with numerous real-world secure and insecure examples
that developers can explore to learn how to use cryptographic APIs properly.
This platform currently provides 3,263 secure uses, and 5,897 insecure uses of
Java Cryptography Architecture mined from 2,324 Java projects on GitHub. A
preliminary study shows that CryptoExplorer provides developers with secure
crypto API use examples instantly, developers can save time compared to
searching on the internet for such examples, and they learn to avoid using
certain algorithms in APIs by studying misused API examples. We have a pipeline
to regularly mine more projects, and, on request, we offer our dataset to
researchers.

\\
  We present a tool to calculate distances and travel times between a set of
origins and a set of destinations, using different modes of transport in
Argentina. The input data for the tool is a set of destinations (a
geo-referenced list of points of city amenities or "opportunities", such as
firms, schools, hospitals, parks, banks or retail, etc.) and a set of origins
characterized by their geographic coordinates that could be interpreted as
households or other. The tool determines, from each origin, which is the
closest destination, depending on the distance or travel time and the mode of
transport (on foot, by bicycle, by car, and by public transport).
  The sets of origins and destinations are large sets, which can contain up to
several thousand points. We applied and developed algorithms to improve the
scalability of the different parts of the procedure. For the public
transportation network, we pre-processed the reachable lines from each point
and used quad-trees to determine the distance between said points and the bus
line's path.
  A second objective of this project was to rely only on open data, such as
Open Street Map (OSM) data, together with making this tool open source.
Therefore, the successful development and implementation of this tool is
potentially beneficial to both public sector agencies as well as NGOs and other
civil society organizations that focus their work on the design and
implementation of public policies, aimed at improving accessibility in cities
as a way to reduce spatial inequalities and social exclusion.

\\
  A map of potential prevalence of Chagas disease (ChD) with high spatial
disaggregation is presented. It aims to detect areas outside the Gran Chaco
ecoregion (hyperendemic for the ChD), characterized by high affinity with ChD
and high health vulnerability.
  To quantify potential prevalence, we developed several indicators: an
Affinity Index which quantifies the degree of linkage between endemic areas of
ChD and the rest of the country. We also studied favorable habitability
conditions for Triatoma infestans, looking for areas where the predominant
materials of floors, roofs and internal ceilings favor the presence of the
disease vector.
  We studied determinants of a more general nature that can be encompassed
under the concept of Health Vulnerability Index. These determinants are
associated with access to health providers and the socio-economic level of
different segments of the population.
  Finally we constructed a Chagas Potential Prevalence Index (ChPPI) which
combines the affinity index, the health vulnerability index, and the population
density. We show and discuss the maps obtained. These maps are intended to
assist public health specialists, decision makers of public health policies and
public officials in the development of cost-effective strategies to improve
access to diagnosis and treatment of ChD.

Title: Mining Disinformation and Fake News: Concepts, Methods, and Recent
  Advancements
Authors: Kai Shu, Suhang Wang, Dongwon Lee, and Huan Liu
Categories: cs.SI cs.CL
Comments: Submitted as an introductory chapter for the edited book on "Fake
  News, Disinformation, and Misinformation in Social Media- Emerging Research
  Challenges and Opportunities", Springer Press
MSC-class: H.2.8
ACM-class: H.2.8
\\
  In recent years, disinformation including fake news, has became a global
phenomenon due to its explosive growth, particularly on social media. The wide
spread of disinformation and fake news can cause detrimental societal effects.
Despite the recent progress in detecting disinformation and fake news, it is
still non-trivial due to its complexity, diversity, multi-modality, and costs
of fact-checking or annotation. The goal of this chapter is to pave the way for
appreciating the challenges and advancements via: (1) introducing the types of
information disorder on social media and examine their differences and
connections; (2) describing important and emerging tasks to combat
disinformation for characterization, detection and attribution; and (3)
discussing a weak supervision approach to detect disinformation with limited
labeled data. We then provide an overview of the chapters in this book that
represent the recent advancements in three related parts: (1) user engagements
in the dissemination of information disorder; (2) techniques on detecting and
mitigating disinformation; and (3) trending issues such as ethics, blockchain,
clickbaits, etc. We hope this book to be a convenient entry point for
researchers, practitioners, and students to understand the problems and
challenges, learn state-of-the-art solutions for their specific needs, and
quickly identify new research problems in their domains.

\\
  In this paper, we treat extended balancing for continuous-time linear
time-invariant systems, and we address the problem of structure-preserving
model reduction of the subclass of port-Hamiltonian systems. We establish
sufficient conditions to ensure that the reduced-order model preserves a
port-Hamiltonian structure. Moreover, we show that the use of extended Gramians
can be exploited to get a small error bound and, possibly, to preserve a
physical interpretation for the reduced-order model.

Title: Sharing reserves through HVDC: potential cost savings in the Nordic
  countries
Authors: Matas Dijokas and Andrea Tosatto and Tilman Weckesser and Spyros

Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Submitted to "IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery" on January 2, 2020
\\
  During summer 2018, the Nordic system's kinetic energy dropped below a
critical level. As a consequence, Svenska kraftn\"at, the Swedish transmission
system operator (TSO), requested the largest production unit to reduce its
power output to guarantee system's security. This action resulted in a
deviation from the generation dispatch determined by the market and in high
costs for the Nordic TSOs. In this regard, this paper assesses the economic
cost of redispatching the largest generating unit and evaluates potential
economic benefits of utilizing the Emergency Power Control (EPC) functionality
of HVDC lines for the provision of Fast Frequency Reserve (FFR). Moreover, the
analysis is extended to the years 2020 and 2025, using Rate of Change of
Frequency (RoCoF) and inertia forecasts from the Nordic TSOs. The findings of
the paper suggest that the frequency of redispatching actions will increase in
the future and that the cost of security for Nordic TSOs could be reduced by
70% if HVDC links are used for frequency support.

Title: Stability Analysis of Continuous-Time Linear Time-Invariant Systems
Authors: Kamyar Modjtahedzadeh
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  This paper focuses on the mathematical approaches to the analysis of
stability that is a crucial step in the design of dynamical systems. Three
methods are presented, namely, absolutely integrable impulse response, Fourier
integral, and Laplace transform. The superiority of Laplace transform over the
other methods becomes clear for several reasons that include the following: 1)
It allows for the analysis of the stable, as well as, the unstable systems. 2)
It not only determines absolute stability (a yes/no answer), but also shines
light on the relative stability (how stable/unstable the system is), allowing
for a design with a good degree of stability. 3) Its algebraic and convolution
properties significantly simplify the mathematical manipulations involved in
the analysis, especially when tackling a complex system composed of several
simpler ones. A brief relevant introduction to the subject of systems is
presented for the unfamiliar reader. Additionally, appropriate physical
concepts and examples are presented for better clarity.

Title: Control Challenges for Resilient Control Systems
Authors: Quanyan Zhu
Categories: eess.SY cs.GT cs.SY
\\
  In this chapter, we introduce methods to address resiliency issues for
control systems. The main challenge for control systems is its cyber-physical
system nature which strongly couples the cyber systems with physical layer
dynamics. Hence the resiliency issues for control systems need to be addressed
by integrating the cyber resiliency with the physical layer resiliency. We
introduce frameworks that can provide a holistic view of the control system
resiliency and a quantitative design paradigm that can enable an optimal
cross-layer and cross-stage design at the planning, operation, and recovery
stage of control systems. The control systems are often large-scale systems in
industrial application and critical infrastructures. Decentralized control of
such systems is indispensable. We extend the resiliency framework to address
distributed and collaborative resiliency among decentralized control agents.

Title: Increasing the Flexibility of Combined Heat and Power Systems through
  Optimal Dispatch with Variable Mass Flow Rate
Authors: Xin Qin, Ye Guo, Xinwei Shen, Hongbin Sun
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  To increase the flexibility of combined heat and power systems, we consider
its optimal dispatch problem with variable mass flow rate, which is assumed to
be fixed in most of the literature. This paper adopts a novel heat system model
to remove binary variables from the original optimal dispatch. The resulting
non-convex problem is further decomposed into a convex sub-problem with fixed
mass flow rate and a master problem which updates the mass flow rate. Then a
solution method is developed for the decomposed model, which calculates
sensitivity of the sub-problem objective function with respect to the given
mass flow rate, then applies gradient projection to update mass flow rate in
the master problem. Compared with existing methods with fixed mass flow rate,
the proposed mechanism can exploit more flexibility to reduce system overall
cost without any additional devices.

Title: A Solution Strategy to the Unit Commitment Problem Incorporating
  Manifold Uncertainties
Authors: Fang Zhai, Libao Shi
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  The widespread uncertainties have made the interaction between wind power and
power grid more complicated and difficult to model and handle. This paper
proposes an approach for the solution of unit commitment (UC) problem
incorporating multiple uncertainties that exist in both wind power and power
grid inherently, consisting of probability, possibility, and interval measures.
To handle the manifold uncertainties in a comprehensive and efficient manner,
the evidence theory (ET) is applied to fuse these uncertain variables into
Dempster-Shafer structure. Moreover, the power loss is introduced into power
balance constraints, and the extended affine arithmetic (EAA) is employed to
evaluate the uncertainty of power loss caused by the propagation of the
aforementioned uncertainties. Regarding the mix-discrete nonlinear
characteristics of the established optimization model, an enhanced grey wolf
optimizer (GWO) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model.
Specifically, the corresponding commitment schedule is determined by a kind of
binary grey wolf optimizer (BGWO), and the economic dispatch (ED) is settled by
GWO. Finally, the IEEE 30-bus test system and a real-sized 183-bus China power
system are studied to demonstrate the validity and scalability of the proposed
model and method.

Title: $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm transmission switching to improve synchronism of
  low-inertia power grids
Authors: Tong Han, David J.Hill
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: Submitted to 21st IFAC World Congress
\\
  This paper investigates the utilization of transmission switching to improve
synchronization performance of low-inertia grids. The synchronization
performance of power girds is first measured by the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of
linearized power systems. Laplacian-based bounds and a close-form formulation
of the $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm synchronization performance metric are derived to
reveal the influence of network structure on synchronization performance.
Furthermore, a transmission switching approach is developed by analyzing the
sensitivity of the $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm metric to perturbation of network
susceptance. Effectiveness of the proposed approach to improve synchronization
performance is demonstrated using the SciGRID network for Germany.

Title: Policy Synthesis for Switched Linear Systems with Markov Decision
  Process Switching
Authors: Bo Wu and Murat Cubuktepe and Franck Djeumou and Zhe Xu and Ufuk Topcu
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1904.11456
\\
  We study the synthesis of mode switching protocols for a class of
discrete-time switched linear systems in which the mode jumps are governed by
Markov decision processes (MDPs). We call such systems MDP-JLS for brevity.
Each state of the MDP corresponds to a mode in the switched system. The
probabilistic state transitions in the MDP represent the mode transitions. We
focus on finding a policy that selects the switching actions at each mode such
that the switched system that follows these actions is guaranteed to be stable.
Given a policy in the MDP, the considered MDP-JLS reduces to a Markov jump
linear system (MJLS). {We consider both mean-square stability and stability
with probability one. For mean-square stability, we leverage existing stability
conditions for MJLSs and propose efficient semidefinite programming
formulations to find a stabilizing policy in the MDP. For stability with
probability one, we derive new sufficient conditions and compute a stabilizing
policy using linear programming. We also extend the policy synthesis results to
MDP-JLS with uncertain mode transition probabilities.

\\
  To make progress in science, we often build abstract representations of
physical systems that meaningfully encode information about the systems. The
representations learnt by most current machine learning techniques reflect
statistical structure present in the training data; however, these methods do
not allow us to specify explicit and operationally meaningful requirements on
the representation. Here, we present a neural network architecture based on the
notion that agents dealing with different aspects of a physical system should
be able to communicate relevant information as efficiently as possible to one
another. This produces representations that separate different parameters which
are useful for making statements about the physical system in different
experimental settings. We present examples involving both classical and quantum
physics. For instance, our architecture finds a compact representation of an
arbitrary two-qubit system that separates local parameters from parameters
describing quantum correlations. We further show that this method can be
combined with reinforcement learning to enable representation learning within
interactive scenarios where agents need to explore experimental settings to
identify relevant variables.

Comments: Accepted to 12th International Conference on Agents and Artificial

\\
  Previous studies have used a specific success metric within an algorithmic
search framework to prove machine learning impossibility results. However, this
specific success metric prevents us from applying these results on other forms
of machine learning, e.g. transfer learning. We define decomposable metrics as
a category of success metrics for search problems which can be expressed as a
linear operation on a probability distribution to solve this issue. Using an
arbitrary decomposable metric to measure the success of a search, we
demonstrate theorems which bound success in various ways, generalizing several
existing results in the literature.

Title: Meaning updating of density matrices
Authors: Bob Coecke and Konstantinos Meichanetzidis
Categories: quant-ph cs.CL
Comments: 24 pages, many figures
\\
  The DisCoCat model of natural language meaning assigns meaning to a sentence
given: (i) the meanings of its words, and, (ii) its grammatical structure. The
recently introduced DisCoCirc model extends this to text consisting of multiple
sentences. While in DisCoCat all meanings are fixed, in DisCoCirc each sentence
updates meanings of words. In this paper we explore different update mechanisms
for DisCoCirc, in the case where meaning is encoded in density matrices---which
come with several advantages as compared to vectors.
  Our starting point are two non-commutative update mechanisms, borrowing one
from quantum foundations research, from Leifer and Spekkens. Unfortunately,
neither of these satisfies any desirable algebraic properties, nor are internal
to the meaning category. By passing to double density matrices we do get an
elegant internal diagrammatic update mechanism.
  We also show that (commutative) spiders can be cast as an instance of the
Leifer-Spekkens update mechanism. This result is of interest to quantum
foundations, as it bridges the work in Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM) with
that on conditional quantum states. Our work also underpins implementation of
text-level natural language processing on quantum hardware (a.k.a. QNLP), for
which exponential space-gain and quadratic speed-up have previously been
identified.

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
\\
  We propose fixed-function neural network hardware that is designed to perform
pixel-to-pixel image transformations in a highly efficient way. We use a fully
trainable, fixed-topology neural network to build a model that can perform a
wide variety of image processing tasks. Our model uses compressed skip lines
and hybrid FIR-IIR blocks to reduce the latency and hardware footprint. Our
proposed Machine Learning Imaging Core, dubbed MagIC, uses a silicon area of
~3mm^2 (in TSMC 16nm), which is orders of magnitude smaller than a comparable
pixel-wise dense prediction model. MagIC requires no DDR bandwidth, no SRAM,
and practically no external memory. Each MagIC core consumes 56mW (215 mW max
power) at 500MHz and achieves an energy-efficient throughput of 23TOPS/W/mm^2.
MagIC can be used as a multi-purpose image processing block in an imaging
pipeline, approximating compute-heavy image processing applications, such as
image deblurring, denoising, and colorization, within the power and silicon
area limits of mobile devices.

Title: Synthetic vascular structure generation for unsupervised pre-training in
  CTA segmentation tasks
Authors: Nil Stolt Ans\'o
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Large enough computed tomography (CT) data sets to train supervised deep
models are often hard to come by. One contributing issue is the amount of
manual labor that goes into creating ground truth labels, specially for
volumetric data. In this research, we train a U-net architecture at a vessel
segmentation task that can be used to provide insights when treating stroke
patients. We create a computational model that generates synthetic vascular
structures which can be blended into unlabeled CT scans of the head. This
unsupervised approached to labelling is used to pre-train deep segmentation
models, which are later fine-tuned on real examples to achieve an increase in
accuracy compared to models trained exclusively on a hand-labeled data set.

Title: DeepFocus: a Few-Shot Microscope Slide Auto-Focus using a Sample
  Invariant CNN-based Sharpness Function
Authors: Adrian Shajkofci, Michael Liebling
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV
Comments: Submitted to IEEE ISBI 2020
\\
  Autofocus (AF) methods are extensively used in biomicroscopy, for example to
acquire timelapses, where the imaged objects tend to drift out of focus. AD
algorithms determine an optimal distance by which to move the sample back into
the focal plane. Current hardware-based methods require modifying the
microscope and image-based algorithms either rely on many images to converge to
the sharpest position or need training data and models specific to each
instrument and imaging configuration. Here we propose DeepFocus, an AF method
we implemented as a Micro-Manager plugin, and characterize its Convolutional
neural network-based sharpness function, which we observed to be depth
co-variant and sample-invariant. Sample invariance allows our AF algorithm to
converge to an optimal axial position within as few as three iterations using a
model trained once for use with a wide range of optical microscopes and a
single instrument-dependent calibration stack acquisition of a flat (but
arbitrary) textured object. From experiments carried out both on synthetic and
experimental data, we observed an average precision, given 3 measured images,
of 0.30 +- 0.16 micrometers with a 10x, NA 0.3 objective. We foresee that this
performance and low image number will help limit photodamage during
acquisitions with light-sensitive samples.

Title: Improve Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Mixup Training
Authors: Shen Yan, Huan Song, Nanxiang Li, Lincan Zou, Liu Ren
Categories: stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Unsupervised domain adaptation studies the problem of utilizing a relevant
source domain with abundant labels to build predictive modeling for an
unannotated target domain. Recent work observe that the popular adversarial
approach of learning domain-invariant features is insufficient to achieve
desirable target domain performance and thus introduce additional training
constraints, e.g. cluster assumption. However, these approaches impose the
constraints on source and target domains individually, ignoring the important
interplay between them. In this work, we propose to enforce training
constraints across domains using mixup formulation to directly address the
generalization performance for target data. In order to tackle potentially huge
domain discrepancy, we further propose a feature-level consistency regularizer
to facilitate the inter-domain constraint. When adding intra-domain mixup and
domain adversarial learning, our general framework significantly improves
state-of-the-art performance on several important tasks from both image
classification and human activity recognition.

Title: Robust Self-Supervised Learning of Deterministic Errors in Single-Plane
  (Monoplanar) and Dual-Plane (Biplanar) X-ray Fluoroscopy
Authors: Jacky C.K. Chow, Steven K. Boyd, Derek D. Lichti and Janet L. Ronsky

DOI: 10.1109/TMI.2019.2963446
\\
  Fluoroscopic imaging that captures X-ray images at video framerates is
advantageous for guiding catheter insertions by vascular surgeons and
interventional radiologists. Visualizing the dynamical movements non-invasively
allows complex surgical procedures to be performed with less trauma to the
patient. To improve surgical precision, endovascular procedures can benefit
from more accurate fluoroscopy data via calibration. This paper presents a
robust self-calibration algorithm suitable for single-plane and dual-plane
fluoroscopy. A three-dimensional (3D) target field was imaged by the
fluoroscope in a strong geometric network configuration. The unknown 3D
positions of targets and the fluoroscope pose were estimated simultaneously by
maximizing the likelihood of the Student-t probability distribution function. A
smoothed k-nearest neighbour (kNN) regression is then used to model the
deterministic component of the image reprojection error of the robust bundle
adjustment. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation step and the kNN regression step
are then repeated iteratively until convergence. Four different error modeling
schemes were compared while varying the quantity of training images. It was
found that using a smoothed kNN regression can automatically model the
systematic errors in fluoroscopy with similar accuracy as a human expert using
a small training dataset. When all training images were used, the 3D mapping
error was reduced from 0.61-0.83 mm to 0.04 mm post-calibration (94.2-95.7%
improvement), and the 2D reprojection error was reduced from 1.17-1.31 to
0.20-0.21 pixels (83.2-83.8% improvement). When using biplanar fluoroscopy, the
3D measurement accuracy of the system improved from 0.60 mm to 0.32 mm (47.2%
improvement).

Title: A Review on InSAR Phase Denoising

\\
  Nowadays, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been a
powerful tool in remote sensing by enhancing the information acquisition.
During the InSAR processing, phase denoising of interferogram is a mandatory
step for topography mapping and deformation monitoring. Over the last three
decades, a large number of effective algorithms have been developed to do
efforts on this topic. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of InSAR
phase denoising methods, classifying the established and emerging algorithms
into four main categories. The first two parts refer to the categories of
traditional local filters and transformed-domain filters, respectively. The
third part focuses on the category of nonlocal (NL) filters, considering their
outstanding performances. Latter, some advanced methods based on new concept of
signal processing are also introduced to show their potentials in this field.
Moreover, several popular phase denoising methods are illustrated and compared
by performing the numerical experiments using both simulated and measured data.
The purpose of this paper is intended to provide necessary guideline and
inspiration to related researchers by promoting the architecture development of
InSAR signal processing.

Title: Improved Spectral Imaging Microscopy for Cultural Heritage through
  Oblique Illumination
Authors: Lindsay Oakley, Stephanie Zaleski, Billie Males, Ollie Cossairt, Marc
  Walton
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV physics.optics
\\
  This work presents the development of a flexible microscopic chemical imaging
platform for cultural heritage that utilizes wavelength-tunable oblique
illumination from a point source to obtain per-pixel reflectance spectra in the
VIS-NIR range. The microscope light source can be adjusted on two axes allowing
for a hemisphere of possible illumination directions. The synthesis of multiple
illumination angles allows for the calculation of surface normal vectors,
similar to phase gradients, and axial optical sectioning. The extraction of
spectral reflectance images with high spatial resolutions from these data is
demonstrated through the analysis of a replica cross-section, created from
known painting reference materials, as well as a sample extracted from a
painting by Pablo Picasso entitled La Mis\'ereuse accroupie (1902). These case
studies show the rich microscale molecular information that may be obtained
using this microscope and how the instrument overcomes challenges for spectral
analysis commonly encountered on works of art with complex matrices composed of
both inorganic minerals and organic lakes.

Title: A Proximal Linearization-based Decentralized Method for Nonconvex
  Problems with Nonlinear Constraints
Authors: Yu Yang, Guoqiang Hu, Costas J. Spanos
Categories: math.OC cs.DC
Comments: 17 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Decentralized optimization for non-convex problems are now demanding by many
emerging applications (e.g., smart grids, smart building, etc.). Though
dramatic progress has been achieved in convex problems, the results for
non-convex cases, especially with non-linear constraints, are still largely
unexplored. This is mainly due to the challenges imposed by the non-linearity
and non-convexity, which makes establishing the convergence conditions
bewildered. This paper investigates decentralized optimization for a class of
structured non-convex problems characterized by: (i) nonconvex global objective
function (possibly nonsmooth) and (ii) coupled nonlinear constraints and local
bounded convex constraints w.r.t. the agents. For such problems, a
decentralized approach called Proximal Linearizationbased Decentralized Method
(PLDM) is proposed. Different from the traditional (augmented) Lagrangian-based
methods which usually require the exact (local) optima at each iteration, the
proposed method leverages a proximal linearization-based technique to update
the decision variables iteratively, which makes it computationally efficient
and viable for the non-linear cases. Under some standard conditions, the PLDM
global convergence and local convergence rate to the epsilon-critical points
are studied based on the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property which holds for most
analytical functions. Finally, the performance and efficacy of the method are
illustrated through a numerical example and an application to multi-zone
heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) control.

Title: Competitive equilibria between staking and on-chain lending
Authors: Tarun Chitra
Categories: q-fin.GN cs.DC
Comments: 25 pages, Submitted to Stanford Blockchain Conference, MIT
  Cryptoeconomic Systems
\\
  Proof of Stake (PoS) is a burgeoning Sybil resistance mechanism that aims to
have a digital asset ("token") serve as security collateral in crypto networks.
However, PoS has so far eluded a comprehensive threat model that encompasses
both Byzantine attacks from distributed systems and financial attacks that
arise from the dual usage of the token as a means of payment and a Sybil
resistance mechanism. In particular, the existence of derivatives markets makes
malicious coordination among validators easier to execute than in Proof of Work
systems. We demonstrate that it is also possible for on-chain lending smart
contracts to cannibalize network security in PoS systems. When the yield
provided by these contracts is more attractive than the inflation rate provided
from staking, stakers will tend to remove their staked tokens and lend them
out, thus reducing network security. In this paper, we provide a simple
stochastic model that describes how rational validators with varying risk
preferences react to changes in staking and lending returns. For a particular
configuration of this model, we provide a formal proof of a phase transition
between equilibria in which tokens are predominantly staked and those in which
they are predominantly lent. We further validate this emergent adversarial
behavior (e.g. reduced staked token supply) with agent-based simulations that
sample transitions under more realistic conditions. Our results illustrate that
rational, non-adversarial actors can dramatically reduce PoS network security
if block rewards are not calibrated appropriately above the expected yields of
on-chain lending.

Title: Compressed Quadratization of Higher Order Binary Optimization Problems
Authors: Avradip Mandal, Arnab Roy, Sarvagya Upadhyay and Hayato
  Ushijima-Mwesigwa
Categories: quant-ph cs.DM
\\
  Recent hardware advances in quantum and quantum-inspired annealers promise
substantial speedup for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems
compared to general-purpose computers. These special-purpose hardware are built
for solving hard instances of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) problems. In terms of number of variables and precision of these
hardware are usually resource-constrained and they work either in Ising space
{-1,1} or in Boolean space {0,1}. Many naturally occurring problem instances
are higher-order in nature. The known method to reduce the degree of a
higher-order optimization problem uses Rosenberg's polynomial. The method works
in Boolean space by reducing the degree of one term by introducing one extra
variable. In this work, we prove that in Ising space the degree reduction of
one term requires the introduction of two variables. Our proposed method of
degree reduction works directly in Ising space, as opposed to converting an
Ising polynomial to Boolean space and applying previously known Rosenberg's
polynomial. For sparse higher-order Ising problems, this results in a more
compact representation of the resultant QUBO problem, which is crucial for
utilizing resource-constrained QUBO solvers.

Title: A single layer artificial neural network with engineered bacteria
Authors: Kathakali Sarkar, Deepro Bonnerjee, and Sangram Bagh
Categories: physics.bio-ph cs.ET q-bio.MN
Comments: 23 pages, 6 figures, 1 table
\\
  The abstract mathematical rules of artificial neural network (ANN) are
implemented through computation using electronic computers, photonics and
in-vitro DNA computation. Here we demonstrate the physical realization of ANN
in living bacterial cells. We created a single layer ANN using engineered
bacteria, where a single bacterium works as an artificial neuron and
demonstrated a 2-to-4 decoder and a 1-to-2 de-multiplexer for processing
chemical signals. The inputs were extracellular chemical signals, which
linearly combined and got processed through a non-linear log-sigmoid activation
function to produce fluorescent protein outputs. The activation function was
generated by synthetic genetic circuits, and for each artificial neuron, the
weight and bias values were adjusted manually by engineering the molecular
interactions within the bacterial neuron to represent a specific logical
function. The artificial bacterial neurons were connected as ANN architectures
to implement a 2-to-4 chemical decoder and a 1-to-2 chemical de-multiplexer. To
our knowledge, this is the first ANN created by artificial bacterial neurons.
Thus, it may open up a new direction in ANN research, where engineered
biological cells can be used as ANN enabled hardware.

Title: Identifiability Conditions for Compressive Multichannel Blind
  Deconvolution
Authors: Satish Mulleti, Kiryung Lee, and Yonina C. Eldar
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: 13 pages, 5 figures
\\
  In applications such as multi-receiver radars and ultrasound array systems,
the observed signals can often be modeled as a linear convolution of an unknown
signal which represents the transmit pulse and sparse filters which describe
the sparse target scenario. The problem of identifying the unknown signal and
the sparse filters is a sparse multichannel blind deconvolution (MBD) problem
and is in general ill-posed. In this paper, we consider the identifiability
problem of sparse-MBD and show that, similar to compressive sensing, it is
possible to identify the sparse filters from compressive measurements of the
output sequences. Specifically, we consider compressible measurements in the
Fourier domain and derive identifiability conditions in a deterministic setup.
Our main results demonstrate that $L$-sparse filters can be identified from
$2L^2$ Fourier measurements from only two coprime channels. We also show that
$2L$ measurements per channel are necessary. The sufficient condition sharpens
as the number of channels increases asymptotically in the number of channels,
it suffices to acquire on the order of $L$ Fourier samples per channel. We also
propose a kernel-based sampling scheme that acquires Fourier measurements from
a commensurate number of time samples. We discuss the gap between the
sufficient and necessary conditions through numerical experiments including
comparing practical reconstruction algorithms. The proposed compressive MBD
results require fewer measurements and fewer channels for identifiability
compared to previous results, which aids in building cost-effective receivers.

Title: Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics on a Distributed Network

Categories: math.OC cs.IT math.IT
\\
  Langevin MCMC gradient optimization is a class of increasingly popular
methods for estimating a posterior distribution. This paper addresses the
algorithm as applied in a decentralized setting, wherein data is distributed
across a network of agents which act to cooperatively solve the problem using
peer-to-peer gossip communication. We show, theoretically, results in 1) the
time-complexity to $\epsilon$-consensus for the continuous time stochastic
differential equation, 2) convergence rate in $L^2$ norm to consensus for the
discrete implementation as defined by the Euler-Maruyama discretization and 3)
convergence rate in the Wasserstein metric to the optimal stationary
distribution for the discretized dynamics.

\\
  In this paper, we present a new on-device automatic speech recognition (ASR)
system based on monotonic chunk-wise attention (MoChA) models trained with
large (> 10K hours) corpus. We attained around 90% of a word recognition rate
for general domain mainly by using joint training of connectionist temporal
classifier (CTC) and cross entropy (CE) losses, minimum word error rate (MWER)
training, layer-wise pre-training and data augmentation methods. In addition,
we compressed our models by more than 3.4 times smaller using an iterative
hyper low-rank approximation (LRA) method while minimizing the degradation in
recognition accuracy. The memory footprint was further reduced with 8-bit
quantization to bring down the final model size to lower than 39 MB. For
on-demand adaptation, we fused the MoChA models with statistical n-gram models,
and we could achieve a relatively 36% improvement on average in word error rate
(WER) for target domains including the general domain.

Title: Explainable outlier detection through decision tree conditioning
Authors: David Cortes
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  This work describes an outlier detection procedure (named "OutlierTree")
loosely based on the GritBot software developed by RuleQuest research, which
works by evaluating and following supervised decision tree splits on variables,
in whose branches 1-d confidence intervals are constructed for the target
variable and potential outliers flagged according to these confidence
intervals. Under this logic, it's possible to produce human-readable
explanations for why a given value of a variable in an observation can be
considered as outlier, by considering the decision tree branch conditions along
with general distribution statistics among the non-outlier observations that
fell into the same branch, which can then be contrasted against the value which
lies outside the CI. The supervised splits help to ensure that the generated
conditions are not spurious, but rather related to the target variable and
having logical breakpoints.

Title: Hydrological time series forecasting using simple combinations: Big data
  testing and investigations on one-year ahead river flow predictability
Authors: Georgia Papacharalampous, Hristos Tyralis
Categories: stat.AP cs.LG stat.ME stat.ML
\\
  Delivering useful hydrological forecasts is critical for urban and
agricultural water management, hydropower generation, flood protection and
management, drought mitigation and alleviation, and river basin planning and
management, among others. In this work, we present and appraise a new
methodology for hydrological time series forecasting. This methodology is based
on simple combinations. The appraisal is made by using a big dataset consisted
of 90-year-long mean annual river flow time series from approximately 600
stations. Covering large parts of North America and Europe, these stations
represent various climate and catchment characteristics, and thus can
collectively support benchmarking. Five individual forecasting methods and 26
variants of the introduced methodology are applied to each time series. The
application is made in one-step ahead forecasting mode. The individual methods
are the last-observation benchmark, simple exponential smoothing, complex
exponential smoothing, automatic autoregressive fractionally integrated moving
average (ARFIMA) and Facebook's Prophet, while the 26 variants are defined by
all the possible combinations (per two, three, four or five) of the five
afore-mentioned methods. The findings have both practical and theoretical
implications. The simple methodology of the study is identified as
well-performing in the long run. Our large-scale results are additionally
exploited for finding an interpretable relationship between predictive
performance and temporal dependence in the river flow time series, and for
examining one-year ahead river flow predictability.

\\
  Unfair stock trading strategies have been shown to be one of the most
negative perceptions that customers can have concerning trading and may result
in long-term losses for a company. Investment banks usually place trading
orders for multiple clients with the same target assets but different order
sizes and diverse requirements such as time frame and risk aversion level,
thereby total earning and individual earning cannot be optimized at the same
time. Orders executed earlier would affect the market price level, so late
execution usually means additional implementation cost. In this paper, we
propose a novel scheme that utilizes multi-agent reinforcement learning systems
to derive stock trading strategies for all clients which keep a balance between
revenue and fairness. First, we demonstrate that Reinforcement learning (RL) is
able to learn from experience and adapt the trading strategies to the complex
market environment. Secondly, we show that the Multi-agent RL system allows
developing trading strategies for all clients individually, thus optimizing
individual revenue. Thirdly, we use the Generalized Gini Index (GGI)
aggregation function to control the fairness level of the revenue across all
clients. Lastly, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of the novel scheme
in improving fairness meanwhile maintaining optimization of revenue.

Title: Wide Neural Networks with Bottlenecks are Deep Gaussian Processes
Authors: Devanshu Agrawal, Theodore Papamarkou, Jacob Hinkle
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
\\
  There is recently much work on the "wide limit" of neural networks, where
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are shown to converge to a Gaussian process
(GP) as all hidden layers are sent to infinite width. However, these results do
not apply to architectures that require one or more of the hidden layers to
remain narrow. In this paper, we consider the wide limit of BNNs where some
hidden layers, called "bottlenecks", are held at finite width. The result is a
composition of GPs that we term a "bottleneck neural network Gaussian process"
(bottleneck NNGP). Although intuitive, the subtlety of the proof is in showing
that the wide limit of a composition of networks is in fact the composition of
the limiting GPs. We also analyze theoretically a single-bottleneck NNGP,
finding that the bottleneck induces dependence between the outputs of a
multi-output network that persists through infinite post-bottleneck depth, and
prevents the kernel of the network from losing discriminative power at infinite
post-bottleneck depth.

Title: A Probability Density Theory for Spin-Glass Systems
Authors: Gavin S. Hartnett, Masoud Mohseni
Categories: cond-mat.dis-nn cs.LG quant-ph
Comments: 20 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Spin-glass systems are universal models for representing many-body phenomena
in statistical physics and computer science. High quality solutions of NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems can be encoded into low energy states of
spin-glass systems. In general, evaluating the relevant physical and
computational properties of such models is difficult due to critical slowing
down near a phase transition. Ideally, one could use recent advances in deep
learning for characterizing the low-energy properties of these complex systems.
Unfortunately, many of the most promising machine learning approaches are only
valid for distributions over continuous variables and thus cannot be directly
applied to discrete spin-glass models. To this end, we develop a continuous
probability density theory for spin-glass systems with arbitrary dimensions,
interactions, and local fields. We show how our formulation geometrically
encodes key physical and computational properties of the spin-glass in an
instance-wise fashion without the need for quenched disorder averaging. We show
that our approach is beyond the mean-field theory and identify a transition
from a convex to non-convex energy landscape as the temperature is lowered past
a critical temperature. We apply our formalism to a number of spin-glass models
including the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, spins on random
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, and random restricted Boltzmann machines.

  We propose a model for demonstrating spontaneous emergence of collective

Each of these mechanisms provides a distinctly different way an agent can
increase the individual benefit accrued through playing the prisoner's dilemma
game ($PDG$) with other agents. The $SA$ provides a generalization of the
self-organized temporal criticality ($SOTC$) model and shows that
self-interested individuals can simultaneously produce maximum social benefit
from their decisions. The mechanisms in the $SA$ are self-tuned by the internal
dynamics and without having a pre-established network structure. Our results
demonstrate emergence of mutual cooperation, emergence of dynamic networks, and
adaptation and resilience of social systems after perturbations. The
implications and applications of the $SA$ are discussed.

Title: Continuation of global solution curves using global parameters
Authors: Philip Korman and Dieter S. Schmidt
Categories: math.AP cs.NA math.NA
Comments: 32 pages, 15 figures
\\
  This paper provides both the theoretical results and numerical calculations
of global solution curves, by continuation in global parameters. Each point on
the solution curves is computed directly as the global parameter is varied, so
that all of the turns that the solution curves make, as well as its different
branches, appear automatically on the computer screen. For radial $p$-Laplace
equations we present a simplified derivation of the regularizing transformation
from P. Korman [15], and use this transformation for more accurate numerical
computations. While for $p>2$ the solutions are not of class $C^2$, we show
that they are of the form $w(r^{\frac{p}{2(p-1)}})$, where $w(z)$ is of class
$C^2$. Bifurcation diagrams are also calculated for non-autonomous problems,
and for the fourth order equations modeling elastic beams. We show that the
first harmonic of the solution can also serve as a global parameter.

Title: Regularization of Inverse Problems
Authors: Christian Clason
Categories: math.FA cs.NA math.NA
Comments: lecture notes
\\
  These lecture notes for a graduate class present the regularization theory
for linear and nonlinear ill-posed operator equations in Hilbert spaces.
Covered are the general framework of regularization methods and their analysis
via spectral filters as well as the concrete examples of Tikhonov
regularization, Landweber iteration, regularization by discretization for
linear inverse problems. In the nonlinear setting, Tikhonov regularization and
iterative regularization (Landweber, Levenberg-Marquardt, and iteratively
regularized Gau{\ss}-Newton methods) are discussed. The necessary background
from functional analysis is also briefly summarized.

Title: Tuning Multigrid Methods with Robust Optimization
Authors: Jed Brown and Yunhui He and Scott MacLachlan and Matt Menickelly and
  Stefan M. Wild
Categories: math.OC cs.NA math.AP math.NA
\\
  Local Fourier analysis is a useful tool for predicting and analyzing the
performance of many efficient algorithms for the solution of discretized PDEs,
such as multigrid and domain decomposition methods. The crucial aspect of local
Fourier analysis is that it can be used to minimize an estimate of the spectral
radius of a stationary iteration, or the condition number of a preconditioned
system, in terms of a symbol representation of the algorithm. In practice, this
is a "minimax" problem, minimizing with respect to solver parameters the
appropriate measure of work, which involves maximizing over the Fourier
frequency. Often, several algorithmic parameters may be determined by local
Fourier analysis in order to obtain efficient algorithms. Analytical solutions
to minimax problems are rarely possible beyond simple problems; the status quo
in local Fourier analysis involves grid sampling, which is prohibitively
expensive in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose and explore
optimization algorithms to solve these problems efficiently. Several examples,
with known and unknown analytical solutions, are presented to show the
effectiveness of these approaches.

Title: A Pilot Study on Mandarin Chinese Cued Speech
Authors: Liu Li, Feng Gang
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
Comments: Accepted by Journal of American Annals of the Deaf
\\
  Cued Speech (CS) is a communication system developed for deaf people, which
exploits hand cues to complement speechreading at the phonetic level.
Currently, it is estimated that CS has been adapted to over 60 languages;
however, no official CS system is available for Mandarin Chinese. This article
proposes a novel and efficient Mandarin Chinese CS system, satisfying the main
criterion that the hand coding constitutes a complement to the lips movements.
We propose to code vowels [i, u, y] as semiconsonants when they are followed by
other Mandarin finals, which reduces the number of Mandarin finals to be coded
from 36 to 16. We establish a coherent similarity between Mandarin Chinese and
French vowels for the remaining 16 vowels, which allows us to take advantage of
the French CS system. Furthermore, by investigating the lips viseme
distribution based on a new corpus, an optimal allocation of the 16 Mandarin
vowels to different hand positions is obtained. A Gaussian classifier was used
to evaluate the average separability of different allocated vowel groups, which
gives 92.08\%, 92.33\%, and 92.73\% for the three speakers, respectively. The
consonants are mainly designed according to their similarities with the French
CS system, as well as some considerations on the special Mandarin consonants.
In our system, the tones of Mandarin are coded with head movements.

Title: A New Re-synchronization Method based Multi-modal Fusion for Automatic
  Continuous Cued Speech Recognition
Authors: Li Liu, Gang Feng, Denis Beautemps and Xiao-Ping Zhang
Categories: eess.AS cs.SD
\\
  Cued Speech (CS) is an augmented lip reading complemented by hand coding, and
it is very helpful to the deaf people. Automatic CS recognition can help
communications between the deaf people and others. Due to the asynchronous
nature of lips and hand movements, fusion of them in automatic CS recognition
is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a novel re-synchronization
procedure for multi-modal fusion, which aligns the hand features with lips
feature. It is realized by delaying hand position and hand shape with their
optimal hand preceding time which is derived by investigating the temporal
organizations of hand position and hand shape movements in CS. This
re-synchronization procedure is incorporated into a practical continuous CS
recognition system that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) with
multi-stream hidden markov model (MSHMM). A significant improvement of about
4.6\% has been achieved retaining 76.6\% CS phoneme recognition correctness
compared with the state-of-the-art architecture (72.04\%), which did not take
into account the asynchrony of multi-modal fusion in CS. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to tackle the asynchronous multi-modal fusion in the
automatic continuous CS recognition.

Title: Resilient Primal-Dual Optimization Algorithms for Distributed Resource
  Allocation
Authors: Berkay Turan, Cesar A. Uribe, Hoi-To Wai, Mahnoosh Alizadeh
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 14 pages, 8 figures, submitted to TCNS
\\
  Distributed algorithms for multi-agent resource allocation can provide
privacy and scalability over centralized algorithms in many cyber-physical
systems. However, the distributed nature of these algorithms can render these
systems vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that can lead to
non-convergence and infeasibility of resource allocation schemes. In this
paper, we propose attack-resilient distributed algorithms based on primal-dual
optimization when Byzantine attackers are present in the system. In particular,
we design attack-resilient primal-dual algorithms for static and dynamic
impersonation attacks by means of robust statistics. For static impersonation
attacks, we formulate a robustified optimization model and show that our
algorithm guarantees convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution of
the robustified problem. On the other hand, a robust optimization model is not
required for the dynamic impersonation attack scenario and we are able to
design an algorithm that is shown to converge to a near-optimal solution of the
original problem. We analyze the performances of our algorithms through both
theoretical and computational studies.

Title: A Two-Stage Batch Algorithm for Nonlinear Static Parameter Estimation
Authors: Kerry Sun and Demoz Gebre-Egziabher
Categories: eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY stat.ME
Comments: Accepted by AIAA Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics, Dec 2019
\\
  A two-stage batch estimation algorithm for solving a class of nonlinear,
static parameter estimation problems that appear in aerospace engineering
applications is proposed. It is shown how these problems can be recast into a
form suitable for the proposed two-stage estimation process. In the first
stage, linear least squares is used to obtain a subset of the unknown
parameters (set 1), while a residual sampling procedure is used for selecting
initial values for the rest of the parameters (set 2). In the second stage,
depending on the uniqueness of the local minimum, either only the parameters in
the second set need to be re-estimated, or all the parameters will have to be
re-estimated simultaneously, by a nonlinear constrained optimization. The
estimates from the first stage are used as initial conditions for the second
stage optimizer. It is shown that this approach alleviates the sensitivity to
initial conditions and minimizes the likelihood of converging to an incorrect
local minimum of the nonlinear cost function. An error bound analysis is
presented to show that the first stage can be solved in such a way that the
total cost function will be driven to the optimal cost, and the difference has
an upper bound. Two tutorial examples are used to show how to implement this
estimator and compare its performance to other similar nonlinear estimators.
Finally, the estimator is used on a 5-hole Pitot tube calibration problem using
flight test data collected from a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which
cannot be easily solved with single-stage methods.

Title: On Symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM Algorithm for $\mathcal{H}_\infty$
  Guaranteed Cost Control with Convex Parameterization
Authors: Jun Ma, Zilong Cheng, Xiaoxue Zhang, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Tong Heng Lee
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures
\\
  This paper involves the innovative development of a symmetric Gauss-Seidel
ADMM algorithm to solve the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ guaranteed cost control
problem. Through a variant of the Youla-Kucera parameterization, the
stabilizing controllers are parameterized in a convex set; yielding the outcome
that the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ guaranteed cost control problem is converted to a
convex optimization problem. Based on an appropriate re-formulation using the
Schur complement, it then renders possible the use of the ADMM algorithm with
symmetric Gauss-Seidel backward and forward sweeps. This approach alleviates
the often-times prohibitively heavy computational burden typical in many
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ optimization problems while exhibiting good convergence
guarantees, which is particularly essential for the related large-scale
optimization procedures involved. With this approach, the desired robust
stability is ensured, and the disturbance attenuation is maintained at the
minimum level in the presence of parametric uncertainties. Rather importantly
too, with these attained effectiveness, the methodology thus evidently
possesses extensive applicability in various important controller synthesis
problems, such as decentralized control, sparse control, output feedback
control problems, etc.

Title: Second-Order Cone Relaxations of the Optimal Power Flow for Active
  Distribution Grids
Authors: Lucien Bobo and Andreas Venzke and Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
\\
  Convex relaxations of the AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem are essential
not only for identifying the globally optimal solution but also for enabling
the use of OPF formulations in Bilevel Programming and Mathematical Programs
with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), which are required for solving problems
such as the coordination between transmission and distribution system operator
(TSO/DSO) or optimal network investment. Focusing on active distribution grids
and radial networks, this paper introduces a framework that collects and
compares, for the first time to our knowledge, the performance of the most
promising convex OPF formulations for practical applications. Our goal is to
establish a solid basis that will inform the selection of the most appropriate
algorithm for different applications. This paper (i) introduces a unified
mathematical and simulation framework, (ii) extends existing methods to retain
exactness in a wider number of cases and (iii) consider reactive power
injections. We conduct simulations on the IEEE 34 and 123 radial test feeders
with distributed energy resources (DERs), using yearly solar irradiation and
load data.
