Title: Cross Lingual Cross Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition

\\
  The majority of existing speech emotion recognition models are trained and
evaluated on a single corpus and a single language setting. These systems do
not perform as well when applied in a cross-corpus and cross-language scenario.
This paper presents results for speech emotion recognition for 4 languages in
both single corpus and cross corpus setting. Additionally, since multi-task
learning (MTL) with gender, naturalness and arousal as auxiliary tasks has
shown to enhance the generalisation capabilities of the emotion models, this
paper introduces language ID as another auxiliary task in MTL framework to
explore the role of spoken language on emotion recognition which has not been
studied yet.

Title: Realistic Re-evaluation of Knowledge Graph Completion Methods: An

\\
  In the active research area of employing embedding models for knowledge graph
completion, particularly for the task of link prediction, most prior studies
used two benchmark datasets FB15k and WN18 in evaluating such models. Most
triples in these and other datasets in such studies belong to reverse and
duplicate relations which exhibit high data redundancy due to semantic
duplication, correlation or data incompleteness. This is a case of excessive
data leakage---a model is trained using features that otherwise would not be
available when the model needs to be applied for real prediction. There are
also Cartesian product relations for which every triple formed by the Cartesian
product of applicable subjects and objects is a true fact. Link prediction on
the aforementioned relations is easy and can be achieved with even better
accuracy using straightforward rules instead of sophisticated embedding models.
A more fundamental defect of these models is that the link prediction scenario,
given such data, is non-existent in the real-world. This paper is the first
systematic study with the main objective of assessing the true effectiveness of
embedding models when the unrealistic triples are removed. Our experiment
results show these models are much less accurate than what we used to perceive.
Their poor accuracy renders link prediction a task without truly effective
automated solution. Hence, we call for re-investigation of possible effective
approaches.

Title: Selective Attention Encoders by Syntactic Graph Convolutional Networks
  for Document Summarization
Authors: Haiyang Xu, Yun Wang, Kun Han, Baochang Ma, Junwen Chen, Xiangang Li
Categories: cs.AI
Comments: ICASSP 2020
\\
  Abstractive text summarization is a challenging task, and one need to design
a mechanism to effectively extract salient information from the source text and
then generate a summary. A parsing process of the source text contains critical
syntactic or semantic structures, which is useful to generate more accurate
summary. However, modeling a parsing tree for text summarization is not trivial
due to its non-linear structure and it is harder to deal with a document that
includes multiple sentences and their parsing trees. In this paper, we propose
to use a graph to connect the parsing trees from the sentences in a document
and utilize the stacked graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn the
syntactic representation for a document. The selective attention mechanism is
used to extract salient information in semantic and structural aspect and
generate an abstractive summary. We evaluate our approach on the CNN/Daily Mail
text summarization dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed
GCNs based selective attention approach outperforms the baselines and achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on the dataset.

  Data-driven Machine Learning has emerged as a promising approach for building
accurate and robust statistical models from medical data, which is collected in
huge volumes by modern healthcare systems. Existing medical data is not fully
exploited by ML primarily because it sits in data silos and privacy concerns
restrict access to this data. However, without access to sufficient data, ML
will be prevented from reaching its full potential and, ultimately, from making
the transition from research to clinical practice. This paper considers key
factors contributing to this issue, explores how Federated Learning (FL) may
provide a solution for the future of digital health and highlights the
challenges and considerations that need to be addressed.

Title: Modeling and solving a vehicle-sharing problem
Authors: Miriam Enzi, Sophie N. Parragh, David Pisinger
Categories: cs.AI
\\
  Motivated by the change in mobility patterns, we present a new modeling
approach for the vehicle-sharing problem. We aim at assigning vehicles to
user-trips so as to maximize savings compared to other modes of transport. We
base our formulations on the minimum-cost and the multi-commodity flow problem.
These formulations make the problem applicable in daily operations. In the
analysis we discuss an optimal composition of a shared fleet, restricted sets
of modes of transport, and variations of the objective function.

Title: Hardness of Bounded Distance Decoding on Lattices in $\ell_p$ Norms
Authors: Huck Bennett, Chris Peikert

\\

  $Bounded Distance Decoding $\BDD_{p,\alpha}$ is the problem of decoding a
lattice when the target point is promised to be within an $\alpha$ factor of
the minimum distance of the lattice, in the $\ell_{p}$ norm. We prove that
$\BDD_{p, \alpha}$ is $\NP$-hard under randomized reductions where $\alpha \to
1/2$ as $p \to \infty$ (and for $\alpha=1/2$ when $p=\infty$), thereby showing
the hardness of decoding for distances approaching the unique-decoding radius
for large $p$. We also show fine-grained hardness for $\BDD_{p,\alpha}$. For
example, we prove that for all $p \in [1,\infty) \setminus 2\Z$ and constants
$C > 1, \eps > 0$, there is no $2^{(1-\eps)n/C}$-time algorithm for
$\BDD_{p,\alpha}$ for some constant $\alpha$ (which approaches $1/2$ as $p \to
\infty$), assuming the randomized Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH).
Moreover, essentially all of our results also hold (under analogous non-uniform
assumptions) for $\BDD$ with preprocessing, in which unbounded precomputation
can be applied to the lattice before the target is available.
  Compared to prior work on the hardness of $\BDD_{p,\alpha}$ by Liu,
Lyubashevsky, and Micciancio (APPROX-RANDOM 2008), our results improve the
values of $\alpha$ for which the problem is known to be $\NP$-hard for all $p >
p_1 \approx 4.2773$, and give the very first fine-grained hardness for $\BDD$
(in any norm). Our reductions rely on a special family of "locally dense"
lattices in $\ell_{p}$ norms, which we construct by modifying the
integer-lattice sparsification technique of Aggarwal and Stephens-Davidowitz
(STOC 2018).

Title: Tatamibari is NP-complete

\\
  In the Nikoli pencil-and-paper game Tatamibari, a puzzle consists of an $m
\times n$ grid of cells, where each cell possibly contains a clue among +, -,
|. The goal is to partition the grid into disjoint rectangles, where every
rectangle contains exactly one clue, rectangles containing + are square,
rectangles containing - are strictly longer horizontally than vertically,
rectangles containing | are strictly longer vertically than horizontally, and
no four rectangles share a corner. We prove this puzzle NP-complete,
establishing a Nikoli gap of 16 years. Along the way, we introduce a gadget
framework for proving hardness of similar puzzles involving area coverage, and
show that it applies to an existing NP-hardness proof for Spiral Galaxies. We
also present a mathematical puzzle font for Tatamibari.

Title: GPU-Accelerated Computation of Vietoris-Rips Persistence Barcodes
Authors: Simon Zhang, Mengbai Xiao and Hao Wang
Categories: cs.CG
Comments: 36 pages, 15 figures. To be published in Symposium on Computational
  Geometry 2020
\\
  The computation of Vietoris-Rips persistence barcodes is both
execution-intensive and memory-intensive. In this paper, we study the
computational structure of Vietoris-Rips persistence barcodes, and identify
several unique mathematical properties and algorithmic opportunities with
connections to the GPU. Mathematically and empirically, we look into the
properties of apparent pairs, which are independently identifiable persistence
pairs comprising up to 99\% of persistence pairs. We give theoretical upper and
lower bounds of the apparent pair rate and model the average case. We also
design massively parallel algorithms to take advantage of the very large number
of simplices that can be processed independently of each other. Having
identified these opportunities, we develop a GPU-accelerated software for
computing Vietoris-Rips persistence barcodes, called Ripser++. The software
achieves up to 30x speedup over the total execution time of the original Ripser
and also reduces CPU-memory usage by up to 2.0x. We believe our
GPU-acceleration based efforts open a new chapter for the advancement of
topological data analysis in the post-Moore's Law era.

Title: Worst-Case Optimal Covering of Rectangles by Disks

  Scheffer, Sahil Shah
Categories: cs.CG
Comments: 45 pages, 26 figures. Full version of an extended abstract with the
  same title accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 36th Symposium
  on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2020)
\\
  We provide the solution for a fundamental problem of geometric optimization
by giving a complete characterization of worst-case optimal disk coverings of
rectangles: For any $\lambda\geq 1$, the critical covering area $A^*(\lambda)$
is the minimum value for which any set of disks with total area at least
$A^*(\lambda)$ can cover a rectangle of dimensions $\lambda\times 1$.
  We show that there is a threshold value $\lambda_2 = \sqrt{\sqrt{7}/2 - 1/4}
\approx 1.035797\ldots$, such that for $\lambda<\lambda_2$ the critical
covering area $A^*(\lambda)$ is $A^*(\lambda)=3\pi\left(\frac{\lambda^2}{16}
+\frac{5}{32} + \frac{9}{256\lambda^2}\right)$, and for $\lambda\geq
\lambda_2$, the critical area is $A^*(\lambda)=\pi(\lambda^2+2)/4$; these
values are tight.
  For the special case $\lambda=1$, i.e., for covering a unit square, the
critical covering area is $\frac{195\pi}{256}\approx 2.39301\ldots$. The proof
uses a careful combination of manual and automatic analysis, demonstrating the
power of the employed interval arithmetic technique.

Title: Dynamic Distribution-Sensitive Point Location
Authors: Siu-Wing Cheng and Man-Kit Lau
Categories: cs.CG
Comments: To appear in Proceedings of the International Symposium of
  Computational Geometry, 2020
ACM-class: F.2.2
\\
  We propose a dynamic data structure for the distribution-sensitive point
location problem. Suppose that there is a fixed query distribution in
$\mathbb{R}^2$, and we are given an oracle that can return in $O(1)$ time the
probability of a query point falling into a polygonal region of constant
complexity. We can maintain a convex subdivision $\cal S$ with $n$ vertices
such that each query is answered in $O(\mathrm{OPT})$ expected time, where OPT
is the minimum expected time of the best linear decision tree for point
location in $\cal S$. The space and construction time are $O(n\log^2 n)$. An
update of $\cal S$ as a mixed sequence of $k$ edge insertions and deletions
takes $O(k\log^5 n)$ amortized time. As a corollary, the randomized incremental
construction of the Voronoi diagram of $n$ sites can be performed in $O(n\log^5
n)$ expected time so that, during the incremental construction, a nearest
neighbor query at any time can be answered optimally with respect to the
intermediate Voronoi diagram at that time.

Title: A Generalization of Self-Improving Algorithms
Authors: Siu-Wing Cheng and Man-Kwun Chiu and Kai Jin and Man Ting Wong
Categories: cs.CG cs.CC
ACM-class: F.2.0
\\
  Ailon et al.~[SICOMP'11] proposed self-improving algorithms for sorting and
Delaunay triangulation (DT) when the input instances $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ follow
some unknown \emph{product distribution}. That is, $x_i$ comes from a fixed
unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}_i$, and the $x_i$'s are drawn independently.
After spending $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ time in a learning phase, the subsequent
expected running time is $O((n+ H)/\varepsilon)$, where $H \in
\{H_\mathrm{S},H_\mathrm{DT}\}$, and $H_\mathrm{S}$ and $H_\mathrm{DT}$ are the
entropies of the distributions of the sorting and DT output, respectively. In
this paper, we allow dependence among the $x_i$'s under the \emph{group product
distribution}. There is a hidden partition of $[1,n]$ into groups; the $x_i$'s
in the $k$-th group are fixed unknown functions of the same hidden variable
$u_k$; and the $u_k$'s are drawn from an unknown product distribution. We
describe self-improving algorithms for sorting and DT under this model when the
functions that map $u_k$ to $x_i$'s are well-behaved. After an
$O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$-time training phase, we achieve $O(n + H_\mathrm{S})$ and
$O(n\alpha(n) + H_\mathrm{DT})$ expected running times for sorting and DT,
respectively, where $\alpha(\cdot)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.

Title: Calibration of Pre-trained Transformers
Authors: Shrey Desai and Greg Durrett
Categories: cs.CL cs.LG
\\
  Pre-trained Transformers are now ubiquitous in natural language processing,
but despite their high end-task performance, little is known empirically about
whether they are calibrated. Specifically, do these models' posterior
probabilities provide an accurate empirical measure of how likely the model is
to be correct on a given example? We focus on BERT and RoBERTa in this work,
and analyze their calibration across three tasks: natural language inference,
paraphrase detection, and commonsense reasoning. For each task, we consider
in-domain as well as challenging out-of-domain settings, where models face more
examples they should be uncertain about. We show that: (1) when used
out-of-the-box, pre-trained models are calibrated in-domain, and compared to
baselines, their calibration error out-of-domain can be as much as 3.5x lower;
(2) temperature scaling is effective at further reducing calibration error
in-domain, and using label smoothing to deliberately increase empirical
uncertainty helps calibrate posteriors out-of-domain.

Title: Gender Representation in Open Source Speech Resources

Categories: cs.CL
Comments: accepted to LREC2020
\\
  With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing use of
deep-learning architectures, the question of ethics, transparency and fairness
of AI systems has become a central concern within the research community. We
address transparency and fairness in spoken language systems by proposing a
study about gender representation in speech resources available through the
Open Speech and Language Resource platform. We show that finding gender
information in open source corpora is not straightforward and that gender
balance depends on other corpus characteristics (elicited/non elicited speech,
low/high resource language, speech task targeted). The paper ends with
recommendations about metadata and gender information for researchers in order
to assure better transparency of the speech systems built using such corpora.

comprehensive review of PTMs for NLP. We first briefly introduce language
representation learning and its research progress. Then we systematically
categorize existing PTMs based on a taxonomy with four perspectives. Next, we
describe how to adapt the knowledge of PTMs to the downstream tasks. Finally,
we outline some potential directions of PTMs for future research. This survey

Title: Unsupervised Pidgin Text Generation By Pivoting English Data and
  Self-Training
Authors: Ernie Chang, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Xiaoyu Shen, Vera Demberg
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Accepted to Workshop at ICLR 2020
\\
  West African Pidgin English is a language that is significantly spoken in
West Africa, consisting of at least 75 million speakers. Nevertheless, proper
machine translation systems and relevant NLP datasets for pidgin English are
virtually absent. In this work, we develop techniques targeted at bridging the
gap between Pidgin English and English in the context of natural language
generation. %As a proof of concept, we explore the proposed techniques in the
area of data-to-text generation. By building upon the previously released
monolingual Pidgin English text and parallel English data-to-text corpus, we
hope to build a system that can automatically generate Pidgin English
descriptions from structured data. We first train a data-to-English text
generation system, before employing techniques in unsupervised neural machine
translation and self-training to establish the Pidgin-to-English cross-lingual
alignment. The human evaluation performed on the generated Pidgin texts shows
that, though still far from being practically usable, the pivoting +
self-training technique improves both Pidgin text fluency and relevance.

  Entity Recognition: A Study on Hausa and Yor\`ub\'a

Comments: Accepted to ICLR 2020 Workshop
\\
  The lack of labeled training data has limited the development of natural
language processing tools, such as named entity recognition, for many languages
spoken in developing countries. Techniques such as distant and weak supervision
can be used to create labeled data in a (semi-) automatic way. Additionally, to
alleviate some of the negative effects of the errors in automatic annotation,
noise-handling methods can be integrated. Pretrained word embeddings are
another key component of most neural named entity classifiers. With the advent
of more complex contextual word embeddings, an interesting trade-off between
model size and performance arises. While these techniques have been shown to
work well in high-resource settings, we want to study how they perform in
low-resource scenarios. In this work, we perform named entity recognition for
Hausa and Yor\`ub\'a, two languages that are widely spoken in several
developing countries. We evaluate different embedding approaches and show that
distant supervision can be successfully leveraged in a realistic low-resource
scenario where it can more than double a classifier's performance.

  We applied the T5 sequence-to-sequence model to tackle the AI2 WinoGrande
Challenge by decomposing each example into two input text strings, each
containing a hypothesis, and using the probabilities assigned to the
"entailment" token as a score of the hypothesis. Our first (and only)
submission to the official leaderboard yielded 0.7673 AUC on March 13, 2020,
which is the best known result at this time and beats the previous state of the

Title: X-Stance: A Multilingual Multi-Target Dataset for Stance Detection
Authors: Jannis Vamvas and Rico Sennrich
Categories: cs.CL
Comments: Data and code are available at https://github.com/ZurichNLP/xstance
\\
  We extract a large-scale stance detection dataset from comments written by
candidates of elections in Switzerland. The dataset consists of German, French
and Italian text, allowing for a cross-lingual evaluation of stance detection.
It contains 67 000 comments on more than 150 political issues (targets). Unlike
stance detection models that have specific target issues, we use the dataset to
train a single model on all the issues. To make learning across targets
possible, we prepend to each instance a natural question that represents the
target (e.g. "Do you support X?"). Baseline results from multilingual BERT show
that zero-shot cross-lingual and cross-target transfer of stance detection is
moderately successful with this approach.

Title: Watch your back: Backdoor Attacks in Deep Reinforcement Learning-based
  Autonomous Vehicle Control Systems
Authors: Yue Wang, Esha Sarkar, Michail Maniatakos, Saif Eddin Jabari
Categories: cs.CR cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY physics.soc-ph stat.ML
\\
  Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based
controllers are used for reducing traffic jams. AVs trained with such deep
neural networks render them vulnerable to machine learning-based attacks. In
this work, we explore the backdooring of a DRL-based AV controller in a
standard traffic scenario. The AV exhibits intended operation of reducing
congestion during genuine observations, but when a particular set of
observations appears, the AV can be triggered to either decelerate to cause
congestion (congestion attack) or to accelerate and crash into the vehicle in
front (insurance attack). These backdoors in AVs may be engineered to pose
serious threats to human lives.

Title: On the Use of Quantum Entanglement in Secure Communications: A Survey
Authors: Keith Shannon, Elias Towe, and Ozan K. Tonguz
Categories: cs.CR
\\
  Quantum computing and quantum communications are exciting new frontiers in
computing and communications. Indeed, the massive investments made by the
governments of the US, China, and EU in these new technologies are not a secret
and are based on the expected potential of these technologies to revolutionize
communications, computing, and security.
  In addition to several field trials and hero experiments, a number of
companies such as Google and IBM are actively working in these areas and some
have already reported impressive demonstrations in the past few years. While
there is some skepticism about whether quantum cryptography will eventually
replace classical cryptography, the advent of quantum computing could
necessitate the use of quantum cryptography as the ultimate frontier of secure
communications. This is because, with the amazing speeds demonstrated with
quantum computers, breaking cryptographic keys might no longer be a daunting
task in the next decade or so. Hence, quantum cryptography as the ultimate
frontier in secure communications might not be such a far-fetched idea.
  It is well known that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is essentially a
"negative result" in Physics and Quantum Mechanics. It turns out that
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, one of the most interesting results in
Quantum Mechanics, could be the theoretical basis and the main scientific
principle behind the ultimate frontier in quantum cryptography or secure
communications in conjunction with Quantum Entanglement.

Title: Blockchain-Based Distributed Patient-Centric Image Management System
Authors: Mohamed Yaseen Jabarulla and Heung-No Lee
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 12 Pages, 9 Figures, 2 Tables, Submitted to IEEE Journal of
  Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine
\\
  In recent years, many researchers have focused on developing a feasible
solution for storing and exchanging medical images in the field of health care.
Current practices are deployed on cloud-based centralized data centers, which
increase maintenance costs, require massive storage space, and raise privacy
concerns about sharing information over a network. Therefore, it is important
to design a framework to enable sharing and storing of big medical data
efficiently within a trustless environment. In the present paper, we propose a
novel proof-of-concept design for a distributed patient-centric image
management (PCIM) system that is aimed to ensure safety and control of patient
private data without using any centralized infrastructure. In this system, we
employed an emerging Ethereum blockchain and a distributed file system
technology called InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Then, we implemented an
Ethereum smart contract called the patient-centric access control protocol to
enable a distributed and trustworthy access control policy. IPFS provides the
means for decentralized storage of medical images with global accessibility.
The PCIM system ensures a high level of data security and reduces fragmentation
of patient health records by applying the steganography and asymmetric
cryptographic technique. We describe how the PCIM system architecture
facilitates the distributed and secured patient-centric data access across
multiple entities such as hospitals, patients, and image requestors. Finally,
we conduct and experiment to test the framework within the Windows environment
and deploy a smart contract prototype on an Ethereum testnet blockchain. The
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is feasible.

Title: Survey of Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Filtering
Authors: Islam Elnabarawy, Wei Jiang, Donald C. Wunsch II
Categories: cs.CR cs.IR cs.LG
\\
  Collaborative filtering recommendation systems provide recommendations to
users based on their own past preferences, as well as those of other users who
share similar interests. The use of recommendation systems has grown widely in
recent years, helping people choose which movies to watch, books to read, and
items to buy. However, users are often concerned about their privacy when using
such systems, and many users are reluctant to provide accurate information to
most online services. Privacy-preserving collaborative filtering recommendation
systems aim to provide users with accurate recommendations while maintaining
certain guarantees about the privacy of their data. This survey examines the
recent literature in privacy-preserving collaborative filtering, providing a
broad perspective of the field and classifying the key contributions in the
literature using two different criteria: the type of vulnerability they address
and the type of approach they use to solve it.

Title: Deep connections between learning from limited labels & physical
  parameter estimation -- inspiration for regularization
Authors: Bas Peters
Categories: cs.CV physics.geo-ph
MSC-class: 68T45
ACM-class: I.2.10; I.4.6
\\
  Recently established equivalences between differential equations and the
structure of neural networks enabled some interpretation of training of a
neural network as partial-differential-equation (PDE) constrained optimization.
We add to the previously established connections, explicit regularization that
is particularly beneficial in the case of single large-scale examples with
partial annotation. We show that explicit regularization of model parameters in
PDE constrained optimization translates to regularization of the network
output. Examination of the structure of the corresponding Lagrangian and
backpropagation algorithm do not reveal additional computational challenges. A
hyperspectral imaging example shows that minimum prior information together
with cross-validation for optimal regularization parameters boosts the
segmentation accuracy.

Title: Breast Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Breast cancer is prevalent in Ethiopia that accounts 34% among women cancer
patients. The diagnosis technique in Ethiopia is manual which was proven to be
tedious, subjective, and challenging. Deep learning techniques are
revolutionizing the field of medical image analysis and hence in this study, we
proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for breast mass detection so as
to minimize the overheads of manual analysis. CNN architecture is designed for
the feature extraction stage and adapted both the Region Proposal Network (RPN)
and Region of Interest (ROI) portion of the faster R-CNN for the automated
breast mass abnormality detection. Our model detects mass region and classifies
them into benign or malignant abnormality in mammogram(MG) images at once. For
the proposed model, MG images were collected from different hospitals,
locally.The images were passed through different preprocessing stages such as
gaussian filter, median filter, bilateral filters and extracted the region of
the breast from the background of the MG image. The performance of the model on
test dataset is found to be: detection accuracy 91.86%, sensitivity of 94.67%
and AUC-ROC of 92.2%.

Title: 3D medical image segmentation with labeled and unlabeled data using
  autoencoders at the example of liver segmentation in CT images
Authors: Cheryl Sital, Tom Brosch, Dominique Tio, Alexander Raaijmakers,
  J\"urgen Weese
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Automatic segmentation of anatomical structures with convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) constitutes a large portion of research in medical image
analysis. The majority of CNN-based methods rely on an abundance of labeled
data for proper training. Labeled medical data is often scarce, but unlabeled
data is more widely available. This necessitates approaches that go beyond
traditional supervised learning and leverage unlabeled data for segmentation
tasks. This work investigates the potential of autoencoder-extracted features
to improve segmentation with a CNN. Two strategies were considered. First,
transfer learning where pretrained autoencoder features were used as
initialization for the convolutional layers in the segmentation network.
Second, multi-task learning where the tasks of segmentation and feature
extraction, by means of input reconstruction, were learned and optimized
simultaneously. A convolutional autoencoder was used to extract features from
unlabeled data and a multi-scale, fully convolutional CNN was used to perform
the target task of 3D liver segmentation in CT images. For both strategies,
experiments were conducted with varying amounts of labeled and unlabeled
training data. The proposed learning strategies improved results in $75\%$ of
the experiments compared to training from scratch and increased the dice score
by up to $0.040$ and $0.024$ for a ratio of unlabeled to labeled training data
of about $32 : 1$ and $12.5 : 1$, respectively. The results indicate that both
training strategies are more effective with a large ratio of unlabeled to
labeled training data.

Title: Getting to 99% Accuracy in Interactive Segmentation
Authors: Marco Forte, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, Ning Xu, Fran\c{c}ois Piti\'e
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Submitted for review to Signal Processing: Image Communication
\\
  Interactive object cutout tools are the cornerstone of the image editing
workflow. Recent deep-learning based interactive segmentation algorithms have
made significant progress in handling complex images and rough binary
selections can typically be obtained with just a few clicks. Yet, deep learning
techniques tend to plateau once this rough selection has been reached. In this
work, we interpret this plateau as the inability of current algorithms to
sufficiently leverage each user interaction and also as the limitations of
current training/testing datasets.
  We propose a novel interactive architecture and a novel training scheme that
are both tailored to better exploit the user workflow. We also show that
significant improvements can be further gained by introducing a synthetic
training dataset that is specifically designed for complex object boundaries.
Comprehensive experiments support our approach, and our network achieves state
of the art performance.

Title: Generalizing Face Representation with Unlabeled Data
Authors: Yichun Shi, Anil K. Jain
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In recent years, significant progress has been made in face recognition due
to the availability of large-scale labeled face datasets. However, since the
faces in these datasets usually contain limited degree and types of variation,
the models trained on them generalize poorly to more realistic unconstrained
face datasets. While collecting labeled faces with larger variations could be
helpful, it is practically infeasible due to privacy and labor cost. In
comparison, it is easier to acquire a large number of unlabeled faces from
different domains which would better represent the testing scenarios in
real-world problems. We present an approach to use such unlabeled faces to
learn generalizable face representations, which can be viewed as an
unsupervised domain generalization framework. Experimental results on
unconstrained datasets show that a small amount of unlabeled data with
sufficient diversity can (i) lead to an appreciable gain in recognition
performance and (ii) outperform the supervised baseline when combined with less
than half of the labeled data. Compared with the state-of-the-art face
recognition methods, our method further improves their performance on
challenging benchmarks, such as IJB-B, IJB-C and IJB-S.

Title: BrazilDAM: A Benchmark dataset for Tailings Dam Detection

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this work we present BrazilDAM, a novel public dataset based on Sentinel-2
and Landsat-8 satellite images covering all tailings dams cataloged by the
Brazilian National Mining Agency (ANM). The dataset was built using
georeferenced images from 769 dams, recorded between 2016 and 2019. The time
series were processed in order to produce cloud free images. The dams contain
mining waste from different ore categories and have highly varying shapes,
areas and volumes, making BrazilDAM particularly interesting and challenging to
be used in machine learning benchmarks. The original catalog contains, besides
the dam coordinates, information about: the main ore, constructive method, risk
category, and associated potential damage. To evaluate BrazilDAM's predictive
potential we performed classification essays using state-of-the-art deep
Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs). In the experiments, we achieved an average
classification accuracy of 94.11\% in tailing dam binary classification task.
In addition, others four setups of experiments were made using the
complementary information from the original catalog, exhaustively exploiting
the capacity of the proposed dataset.

Title: An End-to-end Framework For Low-Resolution Remote Sensing Semantic
  Segmentation
Authors: Matheus Barros Pereira and Jefersson Alex dos Santos
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  High-resolution images for remote sensing applications are often not
affordable or accessible, especially when in need of a wide temporal span of
recordings. Given the easy access to low-resolution (LR) images from
satellites, many remote sensing works rely on this type of data. The problem is
that LR images are not appropriate for semantic segmentation, due to the need
for high-quality data for accurate pixel prediction for this task. In this
paper, we propose an end-to-end framework that unites a super-resolution and a
semantic segmentation module in order to produce accurate thematic maps from LR
inputs. It allows the semantic segmentation network to conduct the
reconstruction process, modifying the input image with helpful textures. We
evaluate the framework with three remote sensing datasets. The results show
that the framework is capable of achieving a semantic segmentation performance
close to native high-resolution data, while also surpassing the performance of
a network trained with LR inputs.

Title: Watching the World Go By: Representation Learning from Unlabeled Videos
Authors: Daniel Gordon, Kiana Ehsani, Dieter Fox, Ali Farhadi
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Recent single image unsupervised representation learning techniques show
remarkable success on a variety of tasks. The basic principle in these works is
instance discrimination: learning to differentiate between two augmented
versions of the same image and a large batch of unrelated images. Networks
learn to ignore the augmentation noise and extract semantically meaningful
representations. Prior work uses artificial data augmentation techniques such
as cropping, and color jitter which can only affect the image in superficial
ways and are not aligned with how objects actually change e.g. occlusion,
deformation, viewpoint change. In this paper, we argue that videos offer this
natural augmentation for free. Videos can provide entirely new views of
objects, show deformation, and even connect semantically similar but visually
distinct concepts. We propose Video Noise Contrastive Estimation, a method for
using unlabeled video to learn strong, transferable single image
representations. We demonstrate improvements over recent unsupervised single
image techniques, as well as over fully supervised ImageNet pretraining, across
a variety of temporal and non-temporal tasks.

Title: Graph Attention Network based Pruning for Reconstructing 3D Liver Vessel
  Morphology from Contrasted CT Images
Authors: Donghao Zhang, Siqi Liu, Shikha Chaganti, Eli Gibson, Zhoubing Xu,

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  With the injection of contrast material into blood vessels, multi-phase
contrasted CT images can enhance the visibility of vessel networks in the human
body. Reconstructing the 3D geometric morphology of liver vessels from the
contrasted CT images can enable multiple liver preoperative surgical planning
applications. Automatic reconstruction of liver vessel morphology remains a
challenging problem due to the morphological complexity of liver vessels and
the inconsistent vessel intensities among different multi-phase contrasted CT
images. On the other side, high integrity is required for the 3D reconstruction
to avoid decision making biases. In this paper, we propose a framework for
liver vessel morphology reconstruction using both a fully convolutional neural
network and a graph attention network. A fully convolutional neural network is
first trained to produce the liver vessel centerline heatmap. An
over-reconstructed liver vessel graph model is then traced based on the heatmap
using an image processing based algorithm. We use a graph attention network to
prune the false-positive branches by predicting the presence probability of
each segmented branch in the initial reconstruction using the aggregated CNN
features. We evaluated the proposed framework on an in-house dataset consisting
of 418 multi-phase abdomen CT images with contrast. The proposed graph network
pruning improves the overall reconstruction F1 score by 6.4% over the baseline.
It also outperformed the other state-of-the-art curvilinear structure
reconstruction algorithms.

Title: AMIL: Adversarial Multi Instance Learning for Human Pose Estimation
Authors: Pourya Shamsolmoali, Masoumeh Zareapoor, Huiyu Zhou, Jie Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Human pose estimation has an important impact on a wide range of applications
from human-computer interface to surveillance and content-based video
retrieval. For human pose estimation, joint obstructions and overlapping upon
human bodies result in departed pose estimation. To address these problems, by
integrating priors of the structure of human bodies, we present a novel
structure-aware network to discreetly consider such priors during the training
of the network. Typically, learning such constraints is a challenging task.
Instead, we propose generative adversarial networks as our learning model in
which we design two residual multiple instance learning (MIL) models with the
identical architecture, one is used as the generator and the other one is used
as the discriminator. The discriminator task is to distinguish the actual poses
from the fake ones. If the pose generator generates the results that the
discriminator is not able to distinguish from the real ones, the model has
successfully learnt the priors. In the proposed model, the discriminator
differentiates the ground-truth heatmaps from the generated ones, and later the
adversarial loss back-propagates to the generator. Such procedure assists the
generator to learn reasonable body configurations and is proved to be
advantageous to improve the pose estimation accuracy. Meanwhile, we propose a
novel function for MIL. It is an adjustable structure for both instance
selection and modeling to appropriately pass the information between instances
in a single bag. In the proposed residual MIL neural network, the pooling
action adequately updates the instance contribution to its bag. The proposed
adversarial residual multi-instance neural network that is based on pooling has
been validated on two datasets for the human pose estimation task and
successfully outperforms the other state-of-arts models.

Title: ScanSSD: Scanning Single Shot Detector for Mathematical Formulas in PDF
  Document Images
Authors: Parag Mali, Puneeth Kukkadapu, Mahshad Mahdavi, Richard Zanibbi
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures
\\
  We introduce the Scanning Single Shot Detector (ScanSSD) for locating math
formulas offset from text and embedded in textlines. ScanSSD uses only visual
features for detection: no formatting or typesetting information such as
layout, font, or character labels are employed. Given a 600 dpi document page
image, a Single Shot Detector (SSD) locates formulas at multiple scales using
sliding windows, after which candidate detections are pooled to obtain
page-level results. For our experiments we use the TFD-ICDAR2019v2 dataset, a
modification of the GTDB scanned math article collection. ScanSSD detects
characters in formulas with high accuracy, obtaining a 0.926 f-score, and
detects formulas with high recall overall. Detection errors are largely minor,
such as splitting formulas at large whitespace gaps (e.g., for variable
constraints) and merging formulas on adjacent textlines. Formula detection
f-scores of 0.796 (IOU $\geq0.5$) and 0.733 (IOU $\ge 0.75$) are obtained. Our
data, evaluation tools, and code are publicly available.

\\
  Classifying whole images is a classic problem in machine learning, and graph
neural networks are a powerful methodology to learn highly irregular
geometries. It is often the case that certain parts of a point cloud are more
important than others when determining overall classification. On graph
structures this started by pooling information at the end of convolutional
filters, and has evolved to a variety of staged pooling techniques on static
graphs. In this paper, a dynamic graph formulation of pooling is introduced
that removes the need for predetermined graph structure. It achieves this by
dynamically learning the most important relationships between data via an
intermediate clustering. The network architecture yields interesting results
considering representation size and efficiency. It also adapts easily to a
large number of tasks from image classification to energy regression in high
energy particle physics.

Title: Applying r-spatiogram in object tracking for occlusion handling
Authors: Niloufar Salehi Dastjerdi and M. Omair Ahmad
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Object tracking is one of the most important problems in computer vision. The
aim of video tracking is to extract the trajectories of a target or object of
interest, i.e. accurately locate a moving target in a video sequence and
discriminate target from non-targets in the feature space of the sequence. So,
feature descriptors can have significant effects on such discrimination. In
this paper, we use the basic idea of many trackers which consists of three main
components of the reference model, i.e., object modeling, object detection and
localization, and model updating. However, there are major improvements in our
system. Our forth component, occlusion handling, utilizes the r-spatiogram to
detect the best target candidate. While spatiogram contains some moments upon
the coordinates of the pixels, r-spatiogram computes region-based compactness
on the distribution of the given feature in the image that captures richer
features to represent the objects. The proposed research develops an efficient
and robust way to keep tracking the object throughout video sequences in the
presence of significant appearance variations and severe occlusions. The
proposed method is evaluated on the Princeton RGBD tracking dataset considering
sequences with different challenges and the obtained results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

  Face anti-spoofing is the key to preventing security breaches in biometric
recognition applications. Existing software-based and hardware-based face
liveness detection methods are effective in constrained environments or
designated datasets only. Deep learning method using RGB and infrared images
demands a large amount of training data for new attacks. In this paper, we
present a face anti-spoofing method in a real-world scenario by automatic
learning the physical characteristics in polarization images of a real face
compared to a deceptive attack. A computational framework is developed to
extract and classify the unique face features using convolutional neural
networks and SVM together. Our real-time polarized face anti-spoofing (PAAS)
detection method uses a on-chip integrated polarization imaging sensor with
optimized processing algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
advantages of the PAAS technique to counter diverse face spoofing attacks
(print, replay, mask) in uncontrolled indoor and outdoor conditions by learning
polarized face images of 33 people. A four-directional polarized face image
dataset is released to inspire future applications within biometric
anti-spoofing field.

Title: MUTATT: Visual-Textual Mutual Guidance for Referring Expression
  Comprehension
Authors: Shuai Wang, Fan Lyu, Wei Feng, and Song Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to localize a text-related
region in a given image by a referring expression in natural language. Existing
methods focus on how to build convincing visual and language representations
independently, which may significantly isolate visual and language information.
In this paper, we argue that for REC the referring expression and the target
region are semantically correlated and subject, location and relationship
consistency exist between vision and language.On top of this, we propose a
novel approach called MutAtt to construct mutual guidance between vision and
language, which treat vision and language equally thus yield compact
information matching. Specifically, for each module of subject, location and
relationship, MutAtt builds two kinds of attention-based mutual guidance
strategies. One strategy is to generate vision-guided language embedding for
the sake of matching relevant visual feature. The other reversely generates
language-guided visual feature to match relevant language embedding. This
mutual guidance strategy can effectively guarantees the vision-language
consistency in three modules. Experiments on three popular REC datasets
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art
methods.

Title: Object-Based Image Coding: A Learning-Driven Revisit
Authors: Qi Xia, Haojie Liu and Zhan Ma
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: ICME2020
\\
  The Object-Based Image Coding (OBIC) that was extensively studied about two
decades ago, promised a vast application perspective for both ultra-low bitrate
communication and high-level semantical content understanding, but it had
rarely been used due to the inefficient compact representation of object with
arbitrary shape. A fundamental issue behind is how to efficiently process the
arbitrary-shaped objects at a fine granularity (e.g., feature element or pixel
wise). To attack this, we have proposed to apply the element-wise masking and
compression by devising an object segmentation network for image layer
decomposition, and parallel convolution-based neural image compression networks
to process masked foreground objects and background scene separately. All
components are optimized in an end-to-end learning framework to intelligently
weigh their (e.g., object and background) contributions for visually pleasant
reconstruction. We have conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
performance on PASCAL VOC dataset at a very low bitrate scenario (e.g.,
$\lesssim$0.1 bits per pixel - bpp) which have demonstrated noticeable
subjective quality improvement compared with JPEG2K, HEVC-based BPG and another
learned image compression method. All relevant materials are made publicly
accessible at https://njuvision.github.io/Neural-Object-Coding/.

Title: Differential Treatment for Stuff and Things: A Simple Unsupervised
  Domain Adaptation Method for Semantic Segmentation

\\
  We consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic
segmentation by easing the domain shift between the source domain (synthetic
data) and the target domain (real data) in this work. State-of-the-art
approaches prove that performing semantic-level alignment is helpful in
tackling the domain shift issue. Based on the observation that stuff categories
usually share similar appearances across images of different domains while
things (i.e. object instances) have much larger differences, we propose to
improve the semantic-level alignment with different strategies for stuff
regions and for things: 1) for the stuff categories, we generate feature
representation for each class and conduct the alignment operation from the
target domain to the source domain; 2) for the thing categories, we generate
feature representation for each individual instance and encourage the instance
in the target domain to align with the most similar one in the source domain.
In this way, the individual differences within thing categories will also be
considered to alleviate over-alignment. In addition to our proposed method, we
further reveal the reason why the current adversarial loss is often unstable in
minimizing the distribution discrepancy and show that our method can help ease
this issue by minimizing the most similar stuff and instance features between
the source and the target domains. We conduct extensive experiments in two
unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, i.e. GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to
Cityscapes, and achieve the new state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.

Title: STH: Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Convolution for Efficient Action Recognition
Authors: Xu Li, Jingwen Wang, Lin Ma, Kaihao Zhang, Fengzong Lian, Zhanhui Kang
  and Jinjun Wang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Effective and Efficient spatio-temporal modeling is essential for action
recognition. Existing methods suffer from the trade-off between model
performance and model complexity. In this paper, we present a novel
Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Convolution Network (denoted as "STH") which
simultaneously encodes spatial and temporal video information with a small
parameter cost. Different from existing works that sequentially or parallelly
extract spatial and temporal information with different convolutional layers,
we divide the input channels into multiple groups and interleave the spatial
and temporal operations in one convolutional layer, which deeply incorporates
spatial and temporal clues. Such a design enables efficient spatio-temporal
modeling and maintains a small model scale. STH-Conv is a general building
block, which can be plugged into existing 2D CNN architectures such as ResNet
and MobileNet by replacing the conventional 2D-Conv blocks (2D convolutions).
STH network achieves competitive or even better performance than its
competitors on benchmark datasets such as Something-Something (V1 & V2),
Jester, and HMDB-51. Moreover, STH enjoys performance superiority over 3D CNNs
while maintaining an even smaller parameter cost than 2D CNNs.

Title: Capsule GAN Using Capsule Network for Generator Architecture
Authors: Kanako Marusaki and Hiroshi Watanabe
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
Comments: 7 pages and 8 figures
MSC-class: 68T05
\\
  This paper presents Capsule GAN, a Generative adversarial network using
Capsule Network not only in the discriminator but also in the generator.
Recently, Generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been intensively studied.
However, generating images by GANs is difficult. Therefore, GANs sometimes
generate poor quality images. These GANs use convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). However, CNNs have the defect that the relational information between
features of the image may be lost. Capsule Network, proposed by Hinton in 2017,
overcomes the defect of CNNs. Capsule GAN reported previously uses Capsule
Network in the discriminator. However, instead of using Capsule Network,
Capsule GAN reported in previous studies uses CNNs in generator architecture
like DCGAN. This paper introduces two approaches to use Capsule Network in the
generator. One is to use DigitCaps layer from the discriminator as the input to
the generator. DigitCaps layer is the output layer of Capsule Network. It has
the features of the input images of the discriminator. The other is to use the
reverse operation of recognition process in Capsule Network in the generator.
We compare Capsule GAN proposed in this paper with conventional GAN using CNN
and Capsule GAN which uses Capsule Network in the discriminator only. The
datasets are MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and color images. We show that Capsule GAN
outperforms the GAN using CNN and the GAN using Capsule Network in the
discriminator only. The architecture of Capsule GAN proposed in this paper is a
basic architecture using Capsule Network. Therefore, we can apply the existing
improvement techniques for GANs to Capsule GAN.

Title: Estimation of Orofacial Kinematics in Parkinson's Disease: Comparison of
  2D and 3D Markerless Systems for Motion Tracking
Authors: Diego L. Guarin, Aidan Dempster, Andrea Bandini, Yana Yunusova and
  Babak Taati

Comments: 4 pages, 1 table
\\
  Orofacial deficits are common in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and
their evolution might represent an important biomarker of disease progression.
We are developing an automated system for assessment of orofacial function in
PD that can be used in-home or in-clinic and can provide useful and objective
clinical information that informs disease management. Our current approach
relies on color and depth cameras for the estimation of 3D facial movements.
However, depth cameras are not commonly available, might be expensive, and
require specialized software for control and data processing. The objective of
this paper was to evaluate if depth cameras are needed to differentiate between
healthy controls and PD patients based on features extracted from orofacial
kinematics. Results indicate that 2D features, extracted from color cameras
only, are as informative as 3D features, extracted from color and depth
cameras, differentiating healthy controls from PD patients. These results pave
the way for the development of a universal system for automatic and objective
assessment of orofacial function in PD.

Title: OmniSLAM: Omnidirectional Localization and Dense Mapping for
  Wide-baseline Multi-camera Systems
Authors: Changhee Won, Hochang Seok, Zhaopeng Cui, Marc Pollefeys, Jongwoo Lim
Categories: cs.CV cs.RO
Comments: accepted by ICRA 2020
\\
  In this paper, we present an omnidirectional localization and dense mapping
system for a wide-baseline multiview stereo setup with ultra-wide field-of-view
(FOV) fisheye cameras, which has a 360 degrees coverage of stereo observations
of the environment. For more practical and accurate reconstruction, we first
introduce improved and light-weighted deep neural networks for the
omnidirectional depth estimation, which are faster and more accurate than the
existing networks. Second, we integrate our omnidirectional depth estimates
into the visual odometry (VO) and add a loop closing module for global
consistency. Using the estimated depth map, we reproject keypoints onto each
other view, which leads to a better and more efficient feature matching
process. Finally, we fuse the omnidirectional depth maps and the estimated rig
poses into the truncated signed distance function (TSDF) volume to acquire a 3D
map. We evaluate our method on synthetic datasets with ground-truth and
real-world sequences of challenging environments, and the extensive experiments
show that the proposed system generates excellent reconstruction results in
both synthetic and real-world environments.

Title: Deep Spatial Gradient and Temporal Depth Learning for Face Anti-spoofing
Authors: Zezheng Wang, Zitong Yu, Chenxu Zhao, Xiangyu Zhu, Yunxiao Qin,

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by CVPR2020 (oral)
\\
  Face anti-spoofing is critical to the security of face recognition systems.
Depth supervised learning has been proven as one of the most effective methods
for face anti-spoofing. Despite the great success, most previous works still
formulate the problem as a single-frame multi-task one by simply augmenting the
loss with depth, while neglecting the detailed fine-grained information and the
interplay between facial depths and moving patterns. In contrast, we design a
new approach to detect presentation attacks from multiple frames based on two
insights: 1) detailed discriminative clues (e.g., spatial gradient magnitude)
between living and spoofing face may be discarded through stacked vanilla
convolutions, and 2) the dynamics of 3D moving faces provide important clues in
detecting the spoofing faces. The proposed method is able to capture
discriminative details via Residual Spatial Gradient Block (RSGB) and encode
spatio-temporal information from Spatio-Temporal Propagation Module (STPM)
efficiently. Moreover, a novel Contrastive Depth Loss is presented for more
accurate depth supervision. To assess the efficacy of our method, we also
collect a Double-modal Anti-spoofing Dataset (DMAD) which provides actual depth
for each sample. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves state-of-the-art results on five benchmark datasets including
OULU-NPU, SiW, CASIA-MFSD, Replay-Attack, and the new DMAD. Codes will be
available at https://github.com/clks-wzz/FAS-SGTD.

Title: Multi-task Learning with Coarse Priors for Robust Part-aware Person
  Re-identification
Authors: Changxing Ding, Kan Wang, Pengfei Wang, and Dacheng Tao
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: submitted in September, 2019
\\
  Part-level representations are important for robust person re-identification
(ReID), but in practice feature quality suffers due to the body part
misalignment problem. In this paper, we present a robust, compact, and
easy-to-use method called the Multi-task Part-aware Network (MPN), which is
designed to extract semantically aligned part-level features from pedestrian
images. MPN solves the body part misalignment problem via multi-task learning
(MTL) in the training stage. More specifically, it builds one main task (MT)
and one auxiliary task (AT) for each body part on the top of the same backbone
model. The ATs are equipped with a coarse prior of the body part locations for
training images. ATs then transfer the concept of the body parts to the MTs via
optimizing the MT parameters to identify part-relevant channels from the
backbone model. Concept transfer is accomplished by means of two novel
alignment strategies: namely, parameter space alignment via hard parameter
sharing and feature space alignment in a class-wise manner. With the aid of the
learned high-quality parameters, MTs can independently extract semantically
aligned part-level features from relevant channels in the testing stage. MPN
has three key advantages: 1) it does not need to conduct body part detection in
the inference stage; 2) its model is very compact and efficient for both
training and testing; 3) in the training stage, it requires only coarse priors
of body part locations, which are easy to obtain. Systematic experiments on
four large-scale ReID databases demonstrate that MPN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins.

Title: Unsupervised Multi-Modal Image Registration via Geometry Preserving
  Image-to-Image Translation
Authors: Moab Arar, Yiftach Ginger, Dov Danon, Ilya Leizerson, Amit Bermano,
  Daniel Cohen-Or
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Many applications, such as autonomous driving, heavily rely on multi-modal
data where spatial alignment between the modalities is required. Most
multi-modal registration methods struggle computing the spatial correspondence
between the images using prevalent cross-modality similarity measures. In this
work, we bypass the difficulties of developing cross-modality similarity
measures, by training an image-to-image translation network on the two input
modalities. This learned translation allows training the registration network
using simple and reliable mono-modality metrics. We perform multi-modal
registration using two networks - a spatial transformation network and a
translation network. We show that by encouraging our translation network to be
geometry preserving, we manage to train an accurate spatial transformation
network. Compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal methods our presented method
is unsupervised, requiring no pairs of aligned modalities for training, and can
be adapted to any pair of modalities. We evaluate our method quantitatively and
qualitatively on commercial datasets, showing that it performs well on several
modalities and achieves accurate alignment.

Title: OpenGAN: Open Set Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Luke Ditria, Benjamin J. Meyer, Tom Drummond
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Many existing conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) are limited
to conditioning on pre-defined and fixed class-level semantic labels or
attributes. We propose an open set GAN architecture (OpenGAN) that is
conditioned per-input sample with a feature embedding drawn from a metric
space. Using a state-of-the-art metric learning model that encodes both
class-level and fine-grained semantic information, we are able to generate
samples that are semantically similar to a given source image. The semantic
information extracted by the metric learning model transfers to
out-of-distribution novel classes, allowing the generative model to produce
samples that are outside of the training distribution. We show that our
proposed method is able to generate 256$\times$256 resolution images from novel
classes that are of similar visual quality to those from the training classes.
In lieu of a source image, we demonstrate that random sampling of the metric
space also results in high-quality samples. We show that interpolation in the
feature space and latent space results in semantically and visually plausible
transformations in the image space. Finally, the usefulness of the generated
samples to the downstream task of data augmentation is demonstrated. We show
that classifier performance can be significantly improved by augmenting the
training data with OpenGAN samples on classes that are outside of the GAN
training distribution.

Title: Scene Text Recognition via Transformer
Authors: Xinjie Feng, Hongxun Yao, Yuankai Yi, Jun Zhang, and Shengping Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Scene text recognition with arbitrary shape is very challenging due to large
variations in text shapes, fonts, colors, backgrounds, etc. Most
state-of-the-art algorithms rectify the input image into the normalized image,
then treat the recognition as a sequence prediction task. The bottleneck of
such methods is the rectification, which will cause errors due to distortion
perspective. In this paper, we find that the rectification is completely
unnecessary. What all we need is the spatial attention. We therefore propose a
simple but extremely effective scene text recognition method based on
transformer [50]. Different from previous transformer based models [56,34],
which just use the decoder of the transformer to decode the convolutional
attention, the proposed method use a convolutional feature maps as word
embedding input into transformer. In such a way, our method is able to make
full use of the powerful attention mechanism of the transformer. Extensive
experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a very large margin on both regular and irregular
text datasets. On one of the most challenging CUTE dataset whose
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy is 89.6%, our method achieves 99.3%, which
is a pretty surprising result. We will release our source code and believe that
our method will be a new benchmark of scene text recognition with arbitrary
shapes.

Title: Transformer Networks for Trajectory Forecasting

Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 18 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Most recent successes on forecasting the people motion are based on LSTM
models and all most recent progress has been achieved by modelling the social
interaction among people and the people interaction with the scene. We question
the use of the LSTM models and propose the novel use of Transformer Networks
for trajectory forecasting. This is a fundamental switch from the sequential
step-by-step processing of LSTMs to the only-attention-based memory mechanisms
of Transformers. In particular, we consider both the original Transformer
Network (TF) and the larger Bidirectional Transformer (BERT), state-of-the-art
on all natural language processing tasks. Our proposed Transformers predict the
trajectories of the individual people in the scene. These are \simple" model
because each person is modelled separately without any complex human-human nor
scene interaction terms. In particular, the TF model without bells and whistles
yields the best score on the largest and most challenging trajectory
forecasting benchmark of TrajNet. Additionally, its extension which predicts
multiple plausible future trajectories performs on par with more engineered
techniques on the 5 datasets of ETH+UCY. Finally, we show that Transformers may
deal with missing observations, as it may be the case with real sensor data.

Title: Rotate-and-Render: Unsupervised Photorealistic Face Rotation from
  Single-View Images

Comments: To appear in IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern
  Recognition (CVPR), 2020. Code and models are available at:
  https://github.com/Hangz-nju-cuhk/Rotate-and-Render
\\
  Though face rotation has achieved rapid progress in recent years, the lack of
high-quality paired training data remains a great hurdle for existing methods.
The current generative models heavily rely on datasets with multi-view images
of the same person. Thus, their generated results are restricted by the scale
and domain of the data source. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
unsupervised framework that can synthesize photo-realistic rotated faces using
only single-view image collections in the wild. Our key insight is that
rotating faces in the 3D space back and forth, and re-rendering them to the 2D
plane can serve as a strong self-supervision. We leverage the recent advances
in 3D face modeling and high-resolution GAN to constitute our building blocks.
Since the 3D rotation-and-render on faces can be applied to arbitrary angles
without losing details, our approach is extremely suitable for in-the-wild
scenarios (i.e. no paired data are available), where existing methods fall
short. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach has superior
synthesis quality as well as identity preservation over the state-of-the-art
methods, across a wide range of poses and domains. Furthermore, we validate
that our rotate-and-render framework naturally can act as an effective data
augmentation engine for boosting modern face recognition systems even on strong
baseline models.

networks: face detection network, facial landmark detection and head pose
estimation network, fatigue recognition network. Experiments show that the
algorithm has the advantages of small volume, high speed and high accuracy.

\\
  Swapping text in scene images while preserving original fonts, colors, sizes

between different factors. In this work, we present SwapText, a three-stage
framework to transfer texts across scene images. First, a novel text swapping
network is proposed to replace text labels only in the foreground image.
Second, a background completion network is learned to reconstruct background
images. Finally, the generated foreground image and background image are used
to generate the word image by the fusion network. Using the proposing
framework, we can manipulate the texts of the input images even with severe
geometric distortion. Qualitative and quantitative results are presented on
several scene text datasets, including regular and irregular text datasets. We

Title: 3D Crowd Counting via Multi-View Fusion with 3D Gaussian Kernels
Authors: Qi Zhang and Antoni B. Chan
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures, AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI,
  New York, Feb 2020
\\
  Crowd counting has been studied for decades and a lot of works have achieved
good performance, especially the DNNs-based density map estimation methods.
Most existing crowd counting works focus on single-view counting, while few
works have studied multi-view counting for large and wide scenes, where
multiple cameras are used. Recently, an end-to-end multi-view crowd counting
method called multi-view multi-scale (MVMS) has been proposed, which fuses
multiple camera views using a CNN to predict a 2D scene-level density map on
the ground-plane. Unlike MVMS, we propose to solve the multi-view crowd
counting task through 3D feature fusion with 3D scene-level density maps,
instead of the 2D ground-plane ones. Compared to 2D fusion, the 3D fusion
extracts more information of the people along z-dimension (height), which helps
to solve the scale variations across multiple views. The 3D density maps still
preserve the 2D density maps property that the sum is the count, while also
providing 3D information about the crowd density. We also explore the
projection consistency among the 3D prediction and the ground-truth in the 2D
views to further enhance the counting performance. The proposed method is
tested on 3 multi-view counting datasets and achieves better or comparable
counting performance to the state-of-the-art.

Title: High-Order Information Matters: Learning Relation and Topology for
  Occluded Person Re-Identification
Authors: Guan'an Wang, Shuo Yang, Huanyu Liu, Zhicheng Wang, Yang Yang,

\\
  Occluded person re-identification (ReID) aims to match occluded person images
to holistic ones across dis-joint cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework by learning high-order relation and topology information for
discriminative features and robust alignment. At first, we use a CNN backbone
and a key-points estimation model to extract semantic local features. Even so,
occluded images still suffer from occlusion and outliers. Then, we view the
local features of an image as nodes of a graph and propose an adaptive
direction graph convolutional (ADGC)layer to pass relation information between
nodes. The proposed ADGC layer can automatically suppress the message-passing
of meaningless features by dynamically learning di-rection and degree of
linkage. When aligning two groups of local features from two images, we view it
as a graph matching problem and propose a cross-graph embedded-alignment (CGEA)
layer to jointly learn and embed topology information to local features, and
straightly predict similarity score. The proposed CGEA layer not only take full
use of alignment learned by graph matching but also re-place sensitive
one-to-one matching with a robust soft one. Finally, extensive experiments on
occluded, partial, and holistic ReID tasks show the effectiveness of our
proposed method. Specifically, our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art by6.5%mAP scores on Occluded-Duke dataset.

Title: Optimal Image Smoothing and Its Applications in Anomaly Detection in
  Remote Sensing
Authors: M. Kiani
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: Second International Conference On Biology and Earth Sciences
\\
  This paper is focused on deriving an optimal image smoother. The optimization
is done through the minimization of the norm of the Laplace operator in the
image coordinate system. Discretizing the Laplace operator and using the method
of Euler-Lagrange result in a weighted average scheme for the optimal smoother.
Satellite imagery can be smoothed by this optimal smoother. It is also very
fast and can be used for detecting the anomalies in the image. A real anomaly
detecting problem is considered for the Qom region in Iran. Satellite image in
different bands are smoothed. Comparing the smoothed and original images in
different bands, the maps of anomalies are presented. Comparison between the
derived method and the existing methods reveals that it is more efficient in
detecting anomalies in the region.

Title: Detection of Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome based on morphological facial
  features
Authors: Elena D'Amato, Constantino Carlos Reyes-Aldasoro, Maria Felicia
  Faienza, Marcella Zollino
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Submitted to MIUA 2020
\\
  This work describes an automatic methodology to discriminate between
individuals with the genetic disorder Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS), and healthy
individuals. As input data, the methodology accepts unconstrained frontal
facial photographs, from which faces are located with Histograms of Oriented
Gradients features descriptors. Pre-processing steps of the methodology consist
of colour normalisation, scaling down, rotation, and cropping in order to
produce a series of images of faces with consistent dimensions. Sixty eight
facial landmarks are automatically located on each face through a cascade of
regression functions learnt via gradient boosting to estimate the shape from an
initial approximation. The intensities of a sparse set of pixels indexed
relative to this initial estimate are used to determine the landmarks. A set of
carefully selected geometric features, for example, relative width of the
mouth, or angle of the nose, are extracted from the landmarks. The features are
used to investigate the statistical differences between the two populations of
PTHS and healthy controls. The methodology was tested on 71 individuals with
PTHS and 55 healthy controls. Two geometric features related to the nose and
mouth showed statistical difference between the two populations.

Title: Rethinking Object Detection in Retail Stores
Authors: Yuanqiang Cai, Longyin Wen, Libo Zhang, Dawei Du, Weiqiang Wang,
  Pengfei Zhu
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  The convention standard for object detection uses a bounding box to represent
each individual object instance. However, it is not practical in the
industry-relevant applications in the context of warehouses due to severe
occlusions among groups of instances of the same categories. In this paper, we
propose a new task, ie, simultaneously object localization and counting,
abbreviated as Locount, which requires algorithms to localize groups of objects
of interest with the number of instances. However, there does not exist a
dataset or benchmark designed for such a task. To this end, we collect a
large-scale object localization and counting dataset with rich annotations in
retail stores, which consists of 50,394 images with more than 1.9 million
object instances in 140 categories. Together with this dataset, we provide a
new evaluation protocol and divide the training and testing subsets to fairly
evaluate the performance of algorithms for Locount, developing a new benchmark
for the Locount task. Moreover, we present a cascaded localization and counting
network as a strong baseline, which gradually classifies and regresses the
bounding boxes of objects with the predicted numbers of instances enclosed in
the bounding boxes, trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the proposed dataset to demonstrate its significance and the
analysis discussions on failure cases are provided to indicate future
directions. Dataset is available at

Title: CAFENet: Class-Agnostic Few-Shot Edge Detection Network
Authors: Young-Hyun Park, Jun Seo, Jaekyun Moon
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures
\\
  We tackle a novel few-shot learning challenge, which we call few-shot
semantic edge detection, aiming to localize crisp boundaries of novel
categories using only a few labeled samples. We also present a Class-Agnostic
Few-shot Edge detection Network (CAFENet) based on meta-learning strategy.
CAFENet employs a semantic segmentation module in small-scale to compensate for
lack of semantic information in edge labels. The predicted segmentation mask is
used to generate an attention map to highlight the target object region, and
make the decoder module concentrate on that region. We also propose a new
regularization method based on multi-split matching. In meta-training, the
metric-learning problem with high-dimensional vectors are divided into small
subproblems with low-dimensional sub-vectors. Since there is no existing
dataset for few-shot semantic edge detection, we construct two new datasets,
FSE-1000 and SBD-$5^i$, and evaluate the performance of the proposed CAFENet on
them. Extensive simulation results confirm the performance merits of the
techniques adopted in CAFENet.

Title: Fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy: FixEfficientNet
Authors: Hugo Touvron, Andrea Vedaldi, Matthijs Douze, Herv\'e J\'egou
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  This note complements the paper "Fixing the train-test resolution
discrepancy" that introduced the FixRes method. First, we show that this
strategy is advantageously combined with recent training recipes from the
literature. Most importantly, we provide new results for the EfficientNet
architecture. The resulting network, called FixEfficientNet, significantly
outperforms the initial architecture with the same number of parameters. For
instance, our FixEfficientNet-B0 trained without additional training data
achieves 79.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. This is a +0.5%
absolute improvement over the Noisy student EfficientNet-B0 trained with 300M
unlabeled images and +1.7% compared to the EfficientNet-B0 trained with
adversarial examples. An EfficientNet-L2 pre-trained with weak supervision on
300M unlabeled images and further optimized with FixRes achieves 88.5% top-1
accuracy (top-5: 98.7%), which establishes the new state of the art for
ImageNet with a single crop.

Title: LRC-Net: Learning Discriminative Features on Point Clouds by
  EncodingLocal Region Contexts
Authors: Xinhai Liu, Zhizhong Han, Fangzhou Hong, Yu-Shen Liu, Matthias Zwicker
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To be published at GMP2020
\\
  Learning discriminative feature directly on point clouds is still challenging
in the understanding of 3D shapes. Recent methods usually partition point
clouds into local region sets, and then extract the local region features with
fixed-size CNN or MLP, and finally aggregate all individual local features into
a global feature using simple max pooling. However, due to the irregularity and
sparsity in sampled point clouds, it is hard to encode the fine-grained
geometry of local regions and their spatial relationships when only using the
fixed-size filters and individual local feature integration, which limit the
ability to learn discriminative features. To address this issue, we present a
novel Local-Region-Context Network (LRC-Net), to learn discriminative features
on point clouds by encoding the fine-grained contexts inside and among local
regions simultaneously. LRC-Net consists of two main modules. The first module,
named intra-region context encoding, is designed for capturing the geometric
correlation inside each local region by novel variable-size convolution filter.
The second module, named inter-region context encoding, is proposed for
integrating the spatial relationships among local regions based on spatial
similarity measures. Experimental results show that LRC-Net is competitive with
state-of-the-art methods in shape classification and shape segmentation
applications.

Title: Cross-domain Self-supervised Learning for Domain Adaptation with Few
  Source Labels
Authors: Donghyun Kim, Kuniaki Saito, Tae-Hyun Oh, Bryan A. Plummer, Stan
  Sclaroff, and Kate Saenko
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods aim to transfer knowledge
from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However,
obtaining labels for some source domains may be very expensive, making complete
labeling as used in prior work impractical. In this work, we investigate a new
domain adaptation scenario with sparsely labeled source data, where only a few
examples in the source domain have been labeled, while the target domain is
unlabeled. We show that when labeled source examples are limited, existing
methods often fail to learn discriminative features applicable for both source
and target domains. We propose a novel Cross-Domain Self-supervised (CDS)
learning approach for domain adaptation, which learns features that are not
only domain-invariant but also class-discriminative. Our self-supervised
learning method captures apparent visual similarity with in-domain
self-supervision in a domain adaptive manner and performs cross-domain feature
matching with across-domain self-supervision. In extensive experiments with
three standard benchmark datasets, our method significantly boosts performance
of target accuracy in the new target domain with few source labels and is even
helpful on classical domain adaptation scenarios.

Title: An Artificial Intelligence-Based System to Assess Nutrient Intake for
  Hospitalised Patients
Authors: Ya Lu, Thomai Stathopoulou, Maria F. Vasiloglou, Stergios
  Christodoulidis, Zeno Stanga, Stavroula Mougiakakou
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV
\\
  Regular monitoring of nutrient intake in hospitalised patients plays a
critical role in reducing the risk of disease-related malnutrition. Although
several methods to estimate nutrient intake have been developed, there is still
a clear demand for a more reliable and fully automated technique, as this could
improve data accuracy and reduce both the burden on participants and health
costs. In this paper, we propose a novel system based on artificial
intelligence (AI) to accurately estimate nutrient intake, by simply processing
RGB Depth (RGB-D) image pairs captured before and after meal consumption. The
system includes a novel multi-task contextual network for food segmentation, a
few-shot learning-based classifier built by limited training samples for food
recognition, and an algorithm for 3D surface construction. This allows
sequential food segmentation, recognition, and estimation of the consumed food
volume, permitting fully automatic estimation of the nutrient intake for each
meal. For the development and evaluation of the system, a dedicated new
database containing images and nutrient recipes of 322 meals is assembled,
coupled to data annotation using innovative strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that the estimated nutrient intake is highly correlated (> 0.91) to
the ground truth and shows very small mean relative errors (< 20%),
outperforming existing techniques proposed for nutrient intake assessment.

Title: PIC: Permutation Invariant Convolution for Recognizing Long-range
  Activities
Authors: Noureldien Hussein, Efstratios Gavves, Arnold W.M. Smeulders
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Neural operations as convolutions, self-attention, and vector aggregation are
the go-to choices for recognizing short-range actions. However, they have three
limitations in modeling long-range activities. This paper presents PIC,
Permutation Invariant Convolution, a novel neural layer to model the temporal
structure of long-range activities. It has three desirable properties. i.
Unlike standard convolution, PIC is invariant to the temporal permutations of
features within its receptive field, qualifying it to model the weak temporal
structures. ii. Different from vector aggregation, PIC respects local
connectivity, enabling it to learn long-range temporal abstractions using
cascaded layers. iii. In contrast to self-attention, PIC uses shared weights,
making it more capable of detecting the most discriminant visual evidence
across long and noisy videos. We study the three properties of PIC and
demonstrate its effectiveness in recognizing the long-range activities of
Charades, Breakfast, and MultiThumos.

Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Semantic segmentation of large-scale outdoor point clouds is essential for
urban scene understanding in various applications, especially autonomous
driving and urban high-definition (HD) mapping. With rapid developments of
mobile laser scanning (MLS) or mobile Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
systems, massive point clouds are available for scene understanding, but
publicly accessible large-scale labeled datasets, which are essential for
developing learning-based methods, are still limited. This paper introduces
Toronto-3D, a large-scale urban outdoor point cloud dataset acquired by a MLS
system in Toronto, Canada for semantic segmentation. This dataset covers
approximately 1 km of point clouds and consists of about 78.3 million points
with 8 labeled object classes. Baseline experiments for semantic segmentation
were conducted and the results confirmed the capability of this dataset to
train deep learning models effectively. Toronto-3D will be publicly released to
encourage new research activities, and the labels will be further improved and
updated with feedback from the research community.

  Solving Single-Shot Person Re-Identification (Re-Id) by training Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks is a daunting challenge, due to the lack of

formulates the Triplet Permutation method to generate multiple training sets,
from a certain re-id dataset. This is a novel strategy for feeding triplet
networks, which reduces the overfitting of the Single-Shot Re-Id model. The
improved performance has been demonstrated over one of the most challenging
Re-Id datasets, PRID2011, proving the effectiveness of the method.

Title: On the Distribution of Minima in Intrinsic-Metric Rotation Averaging
Authors: Kyle Wilson and David Bindel
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: To be published in CVPR2020
\\
  Rotation Averaging is a non-convex optimization problem that determines
orientations of a collection of cameras from their images of a 3D scene. The
problem has been studied using a variety of distances and robustifiers. The
intrinsic (or geodesic) distance on SO(3) is geometrically meaningful; but
while some extrinsic distance-based solvers admit (conditional) guarantees of
correctness, no comparable results have been found under the intrinsic metric.
  In this paper, we study the spatial distribution of local minima. First, we
do a novel empirical study to demonstrate sharp transitions in qualitative
behavior: as problems become noisier, they transition from a single
(easy-to-find) dominant minimum to a cost surface filled with minima. In the
second part of this paper we derive a theoretical bound for when this
transition occurs. This is an extension of the results of [24], which used
local convexity as a proxy to study the difficulty of problem. By recognizing
the underlying quotient manifold geometry of the problem we achieve an n-fold
improvement over prior work. Incidentally, our analysis also extends the prior
$l_2$ work to general $l_p$ costs. Our results suggest using algebraic
connectivity as an indicator of problem difficulty.

  Human performance capture is a highly important computer vision problem with
many applications in movie production and virtual/augmented reality. Many
previous performance capture approaches either required expensive multi-view
setups or did not recover dense space-time coherent geometry with
frame-to-frame correspondences. We propose a novel deep learning approach for
monocular dense human performance capture. Our method is trained in a weakly
supervised manner based on multi-view supervision completely removing the need
for training data with 3D ground truth annotations. The network architecture is
based on two separate networks that disentangle the task into a pose estimation
and a non-rigid surface deformation step. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms the state of the
art in terms of quality and robustness.

Title: A new geodesic-based feature for characterization of 3D shapes:
  application to soft tissue organ temporal deformations
Authors: Karim Makki, Amine Bohi, Augustin C. Ogier, Marc-Emmanuel Bellemare
Categories: cs.CV math.AP
\\
  In this paper, we propose a method for characterizing 3D shapes from point
clouds and we show a direct application on a study of organ temporal
deformations. As an example, we characterize the behavior of a bladder during a
forced respiratory motion with a reduced number of 3D surface points: first, a
set of equidistant points representing the vertices of quadrilateral mesh for
the surface in the first time frame are tracked throughout a long dynamic MRI
sequence using a Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)
framework. Second, a novel geometric feature which is invariant to scaling and
rotation is proposed for characterizing the temporal organ deformations by
employing an Eulerian Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) methodology. We
demonstrate the robustness of our feature on both synthetic 3D shapes and
realistic dynamic MRI data portraying the bladder deformation during forced
respiratory motions. Promising results are obtained, showing that the proposed
feature may be useful for several computer vision applications such as medical
imaging, aerodynamics and robotics.

Title: Collaborative Video Object Segmentation by Foreground-Background
  Integration
Authors: Zongxin Yang, Yunchao Wei, Yi Yang
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  In this paper, we investigate the principles of embedding learning between
the given reference and the predicted sequence to tackle the challenging
semi-supervised video object segmentation. Different from previous practices
that only explore the embedding learning using pixels from foreground object
(s), we consider background should be equally treated and thus propose
Collaborative video object segmentation by Foreground-Background Integration
(CFBI) approach. Our CFBI implicitly imposes the feature embedding from the
target foreground object and its corresponding background to be contrastive,
promoting the segmentation results accordingly. With the feature embedding from
both foreground and background, our CFBI performs the matching process between
the reference and the predicted sequence from both pixel and instance levels,
making the CFBI be robust to various object scales. We conduct extensive
experiments on three popular benchmarks, ie, DAVIS 2016, DAVIS 2017, and
YouTube-VOS. Our CFBI achieves the performance (J&F) of 89.4%, 81.9%, and
81.0%, respectively, outperforming all other state-of-the-art methods. Code

Title: Multi-View Optimization of Local Feature Geometry
Authors: Mihai Dusmanu, Johannes L. Sch\"onberger, Marc Pollefeys
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: 27 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables
\\
  In this work, we address the problem of refining the geometry of local image
features from multiple views without known scene or camera geometry. Current
approaches to local feature detection are inherently limited in their keypoint
localization accuracy because they only operate on a single view. This
limitation has a negative impact on downstream tasks such as
Structure-from-Motion, where inaccurate keypoints lead to large errors in
triangulation and camera localization. Our proposed method naturally
complements the traditional feature extraction and matching paradigm. We first
estimate local geometric transformations between tentative matches and then
optimize the keypoint locations over multiple views jointly according to a
non-linear least squares formulation. Throughout a variety of experiments, we
show that our method consistently improves the triangulation and camera
localization performance for both hand-crafted and learned local features.

\\
  We present a deep learning solution for estimating the incident illumination
at any 3D location within a scene from an input narrow-baseline stereo image
pair. Previous approaches for predicting global illumination from images either
predict just a single illumination for the entire scene, or separately estimate
the illumination at each 3D location without enforcing that the predictions are
consistent with the same 3D scene. Instead, we propose a deep learning model
that estimates a 3D volumetric RGBA model of a scene, including content outside
the observed field of view, and then uses standard volume rendering to estimate
the incident illumination at any 3D location within that volume. Our model is
trained without any ground truth 3D data and only requires a held-out
perspective view near the input stereo pair and a spherical panorama taken
within each scene as supervision, as opposed to prior methods for
spatially-varying lighting estimation, which require ground truth scene
geometry for training. We demonstrate that our method can predict consistent
spatially-varying lighting that is convincing enough to plausibly relight and
insert highly specular virtual objects into real images.

\\
  Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) methods have become increasingly
popular since they only require image level labels as opposed to expensive
bounding box annotations required by fully supervised algorithms. Typically, a
WSOL model is first trained to predict class generic objectness scores on an
off-the-shelf fully supervised source dataset and then it is progressively
adapted to learn the objects in the weakly supervised target dataset. In this
work, we argue that learning only an objectness function is a weak form of
knowledge transfer and propose to learn a classwise pairwise similarity
function that directly compares two input proposals as well. The combined
localization model and the estimated object annotations are jointly learned in
an alternating optimization paradigm as is typically done in standard WSOL
methods. In contrast to the existing work that learns pairwise similarities,
our proposed approach optimizes a unified objective with convergence guarantee
and it is computationally efficient for large-scale applications. Experiments
on the COCO and ILSVRC 2013 detection datasets show that the performance of the
localization model improves significantly with the inclusion of pairwise
similarity function. For instance, in the ILSVRC dataset, the Correct
Localization (CorLoc) performance improves from 72.7% to 78.2% which is a new
state-of-the-art for weakly supervised object localization task.

Title: Sequential Forecasting of 100,000 Points

\\
  Predicting the future is a crucial first step to effective control, since
systems that can predict the future can select plans that lead to desired
outcomes. In this work, we study the problem of future prediction at the level
of 3D scenes, represented by point clouds captured by a LiDAR sensor, i.e.,
directly learning to forecast the evolution of >100,000 points that comprise a
complete scene. We term this Scene Point Cloud Sequence Forecasting (SPCSF). By
directly predicting the densest-possible 3D representation of the future, the
output contains richer information than other representations such as future
object trajectories. We design a method, SPCSFNet, evaluate it on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets, and find that it demonstrates excellent performance on the
SPCSF task. To show that SPCSF can benefit downstream tasks such as object
trajectory forecasting, we present a new object trajectory forecasting pipeline
leveraging SPCSFNet. Specifically, instead of forecasting at the object level
as in conventional trajectory forecasting, we propose to forecast at the sensor
level and then apply detection and tracking on the predicted sensor data. As a
result, our new pipeline can remove the need of object trajectory labels and
enable large-scale training with unlabeled sensor data. Surprisingly, we found
our new pipeline based on SPCSFNet was able to outperform the conventional
pipeline using state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods, all of which
require future object trajectory labels. Finally, we propose a new evaluation
procedure and two new metrics to measure the end-to-end performance of the
trajectory forecasting pipeline. Our code will be made publicly available at

  Technological advancement has led to digitizing hard copies of media
effortlessly with optical character recognition (OCR) system. As OCR systems
are being used constantly, converting printed or handwritten documents and
books have become simple and time efficient. To be a fully functional
structure, Bengali OCR system needs to overcome some constraints involved in
pre-processing, segmentation and recognition phase. The aim of this research is
to analyze the challenges prevalent in developing a Bengali OCR system through
robust literature review and implementation.

Title: DLow: Diversifying Latent Flows for Diverse Human Motion Prediction
Authors: Ye Yuan, Kris Kitani
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG
Comments: Video: https://youtu.be/64OEdSadb00
\\
  Deep generative models are often used for human motion prediction as they are
able to model multi-modal data distributions and characterize diverse human
behavior. While much care has been taken into designing and learning deep
generative models, how to efficiently produce diverse samples from a deep
generative model after it has been trained is still an under-explored problem.
To obtain samples from a pretrained generative model, most existing generative
human motion prediction methods draw a set of independent Gaussian latent codes
and convert them to motion samples. Clearly, this random sampling strategy is
not guaranteed to produce diverse samples for two reasons: (1) The independent
sampling cannot force the samples to be diverse; (2) The sampling is based
solely on likelihood which may only produce samples that correspond to the
major modes of the data distribution. To address these problems, we propose a
novel sampling method, Diversifying Latent Flows (DLow), to produce a diverse
set of samples from a pretrained deep generative model. Unlike random
(independent) sampling, the proposed DLow sampling method samples a single
random variable and then maps it with a set of learnable mapping functions to a
set of correlated latent codes. The correlated latent codes are then decoded
into a set of correlated samples. During training, DLow uses a
diversity-promoting prior over samples as an objective to optimize the latent
mappings to improve sample diversity. The design of the prior is highly
flexible and can be customized to generate diverse motions with common features
(e.g., similar leg motion but diverse upper-body motion). Our experiments
demonstrate that DLow outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of
sample diversity and accuracy. Video: https://youtu.be/64OEdSadb00.

Title: Forecasting Crime Using ARIMA Model
Authors: Khawar Islam and Akhter Raza
Categories: cs.CY
Comments: Under Review
\\
  Data mining is the process in which we extract the different patterns and
useful Information from large dataset. According to London police, crimes are
immediately increases from beginning of 2017 in different borough of London. No
useful information is available for prevent crime on future basis. We forecasts
crime rates in London borough by extracting large dataset of crime in London
and predicted number of crimes in future. We used time series ARIMA model for
forecasting crimes in London. By giving 5 years of data to ARIMA model
forecasting 2 years crime data. Comparatively, with exponential smoothing ARIMA
model has higher fitting values. A real dataset of crimes reported by London
police collected from its website and other resources. Our main concept is
divided into four parts. Data extraction (DE), data processing (DP) of
unstructured data, visualizing model in IBM SPSS. DE extracts crime data from
web sources during 2012 for the 2016 year. DP integrates and reduces data and
give them predefined attributes. Crime prediction is analyzed by applying some
calculation, calculated their moving average, difference, and auto-regression.
Forecasted Model gives 80% correct values, which is formed to be an accurate
model. This work helps for London police in decision-making against crime.

Title: PolyFit: Polynomial-based Indexing Approach for Fast Approximate Range
  Aggregate Queries
Authors: Zhe Li, Tsz Nam Chan, Man Lung Yiu, Christian S. Jensen
Categories: cs.DB
Comments: 13 pages
\\
  Range aggregate queries find frequent application in data analytics. In some
use cases, approximate results are preferred over accurate results if they can
be computed rapidly and satisfy approximation guarantees. Inspired by a recent
indexing approach, we provide means of representing a discrete point data set
by continuous functions that can then serve as compact index structures. More
specifically, we develop a polynomial-based indexing approach, called PolyFit,
for processing approximate range aggregate queries. PolyFit is capable of
supporting multiple types of range aggregate queries, including COUNT, SUM, MIN
and MAX aggregates, with guaranteed absolute and relative error bounds.
Experiment results show that PolyFit is faster and more accurate and compact
than existing learned index structures.

Title: Discovering Business Area Effects to Process Mining Analysis Using
  Clustering and Influence Analysis
Authors: Teemu Lehto and Markku Hinkka
Categories: cs.DB cs.LG
Comments: 12 pages. Paper accepted in 23rd International Conference on Business
  Information Systems (BIS 2020) to be published in a proceedings edition of
  the Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing
\\
  A common challenge for improving business processes in large organizations is
that business people in charge of the operations are lacking a fact-based
understanding of the execution details, process variants, and exceptions taking
place in business operations. While existing process mining methodologies can
discover these details based on event logs, it is challenging to communicate
the process mining findings to business people. In this paper, we present a
novel methodology for discovering business areas that have a significant effect
on the process execution details. Our method uses clustering to group similar
cases based on process flow characteristics and then influence analysis for
detecting those business areas that correlate most with the discovered
clusters. Our analysis serves as a bridge between BPM people and business,
people facilitating the knowledge sharing between these groups. We also present
an example analysis based on publicly available real-life purchase order
process data.

Comments: This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE CDMA 2020 conference
\\
  This paper presents a new application for multi-dimensional Skyline query.
The idea presented in this paper can be used to find best shopping malls based
on users requirements. A web-based application was used to simulate the problem
and proposed solution. Also, a mathematical definition was developed to define
the problem and show how multi-dimensional Skyline query can be used to solve
complex problems, such as, finding shopping malls using multiple different
criteria. The idea of this paper can be used in other fields, where different

Title: Co-Optimizing Performance and Memory FootprintVia Integrated CPU/GPU
  Memory Management, anImplementation on Autonomous Driving Platform
Authors: Soroush Bateni, Zhendong Wang, Yuankun Zhu, Yang Hu, Cong Liu
Categories: cs.DC cs.OS
\\
  Cutting-edge embedded system applications, such as self-driving cars and
unmanned drone software, are reliant on integrated CPU/GPU platforms for their
DNNs-driven workload, such as perception and other highly parallel components.
In this work, we set out to explore the hidden performance implication of GPU
memory management methods of integrated CPU/GPU architecture. Through a series
of experiments on micro-benchmarks and real-world workloads, we find that the
performance under different memory management methods may vary according to
application characteristics. Based on this observation, we develop a
performance model that can predict system overhead for each memory management
method based on application characteristics. Guided by the performance model,
we further propose a runtime scheduler. By conducting per-task memory
management policy switching and kernel overlapping, the scheduler can
significantly relieve the system memory pressure and reduce the multitasking
co-run response time. We have implemented and extensively evaluated our system
prototype on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Drive PX2, and Xavier AGX platforms, using
both Rodinia benchmark suite and two real-world case studies of drone software
and autonomous driving software.

  Deploying big-data Machine Learning (ML) services in a cloud environment

configuration sizing for any given customer use case. OracleLabs has developed
an automated framework that uses nested-loop Monte Carlo simulation to
autonomously scale any size customer ML use cases across the range of cloud
CPU-GPU "Shapes" (configurations of CPUs and/or GPUs in Cloud containers
available to end customers). Moreover, the OracleLabs and NVIDIA authors have
collaborated on a ML benchmark study which analyzes the compute cost and GPU
acceleration of any ML prognostic algorithm and assesses the reduction of
compute cost in a cloud container comprising conventional CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs.

Title: On the Analysis of Parallel Real-Time Tasks with Spin Locks
Authors: Xu Jiang, Nan Guan, He Du, Weichen Liu, Wang Yi
Categories: cs.DC
\\
  Locking protocol is an essential component in resource management of
real-time systems, which coordinates mutually exclusive accesses to shared
resources from different tasks. Although the design and analysis of locking
protocols have been intensively studied for sequential real-time tasks, there
has been little work on this topic for parallel real-time tasks. In this paper,
we study the analysis of parallel real-time tasks using spin locks to protect
accesses to shared resources in three commonly used request serving orders
(unordered, FIFO-order and priority-order). A remarkable feature making our
analysis method more accurate is to systematically analyze the blocking time
which may delay a task's finishing time, where the impact to the total workload
and the longest path length is jointly considered, rather than analyzing them
separately and counting all blocking time as the workload that delays a task's
finishing time, as commonly assumed in the state-of-the-art.

\\
  Existing power modelling research focuses on the model rather than the
process for developing models. An automated power modelling process that can be
deployed on different processors for developing power models with high accuracy
is developed. For this, (i) an automated hardware performance counter selection
method that selects counters best correlated to power on both ARM and Intel
processors, (ii) a noise filter based on clustering that can reduce the mean
error in power models, and (iii) a two stage power model that surmounts
challenges in using existing power models across multiple architectures are
proposed and developed. The key results are: (i) the automated hardware
performance counter selection method achieves comparable selection to the
manual method reported in the literature, (ii) the noise filter reduces the
mean error in power models by up to 55%, and (iii) the two stage power model
can predict dynamic power with less than 8% error on both ARM and Intel
processors, which is an improvement over classic models.

Title: Vermillion: A High-Performance Scalable IoT Middleware for Smart Cities
Authors: Poorna Chandra Tejasvi, Vasanth Rajaraman, Arun Babu Puthuparambil,

Categories: cs.DC
\\
  With the massive increase in the number of IoT devices being deployed in
smart cities, it becomes paramount for middlewares to be able to handle very
high loads and support demanding use-cases. In order to do so, middlewares must
scale horizontally while providing a commensurate increase in availability and
throughput. Currently, most open-source IoT middlewares do not provide
out-of-the-box support for scaling horizontally. In this paper, we present
"Vermillion'', a scalable, secure and open-source IoT middleware for smart
cities which provides in-built support for scaling-out. We make three
contributions in this paper. Firstly, the middleware platform itself along with
a formal process for data exchange between data producers and consumers.
Secondly, we propose the use of hash-based federation to distribute and manage
load across various message broker nodes while eliminating inter-node
synchronisation overheads. Thirdly, we discuss a case study where Vermillion
was deployed in a city and briefly discuss about deployment considerations
using the obtained results.

\\
  Many existing studies on mixed-criticality (MC) scheduling assume that
low-criticality budgets for high-criticality applications are known apriori.
These budgets are primarily used as guidance to determine when the scheduler
should switch the system mode from low to high. Based on this key observation,
in this paper we propose a dynamic MC scheduling model under which
low-criticality budgets for individual high-criticality applications are
determined at runtime as opposed to being fixed offline. To ensure sufficient
budget for high-criticality applications at all times, we use offline
schedulability analysis to determine a system-wide total low-criticality budget
allocation for all the high-criticality applications combined. This total
budget is used as guidance in our model to determine the need for a
mode-switch. The runtime strategy then distributes this total budget among the
various applications depending on their execution requirement and with the
objective of postponing mode-switch as much as possible. We show that this
runtime strategy is able to postpone mode-switches for a longer time than any
strategy that uses a fixed low-criticality budget allocation for each
application. Finally, since we are able to control the total budget allocation
for high-criticality applications before mode-switch, we also propose
techniques to determine these budgets considering system-wide objectives such
as schedulability and service guarantee for low-criticality applications.

Title: Prevalence of Potentially Predatory Publishing in Scopus on the Country
  Level

Comments: 56 pages, 8 figures
\\
  We present the results of a large-scale study of potentially predatory
journals (PPJ) represented in the Scopus database, which is widely used for
research evaluation. Both journal metrics and country, disciplinary data have
been evaluated for different groups of PPJ: those listed by Jeffrey Beall and
those delisted by Scopus because of "publication concerns". Our results show
that even after years of delisting, PPJ are still highly visible in the Scopus
database with hundreds of active potentially predatory journals. PPJ papers are
continuously produced by all major countries, but with different shares. All
major subject areas are affected. The largest number of PPJ papers are in
engineering and medicine. On average, PPJ have much lower citation metrics than
other Scopus-indexed journals. We conclude with a brief survey of the case of
Kazakhstan where the share of PPJ papers at one time amounted to almost a half
of all Kazakhstan papers in Scopus, and propose a link between PPJ share and
national research evaluation policies (in particular, rules of awarding
academic degrees). The progress of potentially predatory journal research will
be increasingly important because such evaluation methods are becoming more
widespread in times of the Metric Tide.

Title: Enumeration of Unordered Forests
Authors: Florian Ingels and Romain Aza\"is
Categories: cs.DM cs.DS math.CO
\\
  Reverse search is a convenient method for enumerating structured objects,
that can be used both to address theoretical issues and to solve data mining
problems. This method has already been successfully developed to handle
unordered trees. If the literature proposes solutions to enumerate singletons
of trees, we study in this article a more general, higher combinatorial
problem, the enumeration of sets of trees - forests. By compressing each forest
into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), we develop a reverse search like method to
enumerate DAG compressing forests. Remarkably, we prove that these DAG are in
bijection with the row-Fishburn matrices, a well-studied class of combinatorial
objects. In a second step, we derive our forest enumeration to provide
algorithms for tackling two related problems : (i) the enumeration of
"subforests" of a forest, and (ii) the frequent "subforest" mining problem. All
the methods presented in this article enumerate each item uniquely, up to
isomorphism.

Title: Speeding up Linear Programming using Randomized Linear Algebra
Authors: Agniva Chowdhury, Palma London, Haim Avron, Petros Drineas
Categories: cs.DS math.OC
\\
  Linear programming (LP) is an extremely useful tool and has been successfully
applied to solve various problems in a wide range of areas, including
operations research, engineering, economics, or even more abstract mathematical
areas such as combinatorics. It is also used in many machine learning
applications, such as $\ell_1$-regularized SVMs, basis pursuit, nonnegative
matrix factorization, etc. Interior Point Methods (IPMs) are one of the most
popular methods to solve LPs both in theory and in practice. Their underlying
complexity is dominated by the cost of solving a system of linear equations at
each iteration. In this paper, we consider \emph{infeasible} IPMs for the
special case where the number of variables is much larger than the number of
constraints. Using tools from Randomized Linear Algebra, we present a
preconditioning technique that, when combined with the Conjugate Gradient
iterative solver, provably guarantees that infeasible IPM algorithms (suitably
modified to account for the error incurred by the approximate solver), converge
to a feasible, approximately optimal solution, without increasing their
iteration complexity. Our empirical evaluations verify our theoretical results
on both real-world and synthetic data.

Title: Grammar compression with probabilistic context-free grammar

Categories: cs.DS
Comments: 11 pages, 3 figures, accepted for poster presentation at DCC 2020
\\
  We propose a new approach for universal lossless text compression, based on
grammar compression. In the literature, a target string $T$ has been compressed
as a context-free grammar $G$ in Chomsky normal form satisfying $L(G) = \{T\}$.
Such a grammar is often called a \emph{straight-line program} (SLP). In this
paper, we consider a probabilistic grammar $G$ that generates $T$, but not
necessarily as a unique element of $L(G)$. In order to recover the original
text $T$ unambiguously, we keep both the grammar $G$ and the derivation tree of
$T$ from the start symbol in $G$, in compressed form. We show some simple
evidence that our proposal is indeed more efficient than SLPs for certain
texts, both from theoretical and practical points of view.

necessary. In this article, a readable implementation of Manacher's algorithm
based on index mapping is developed which does away with the string

Title: The State Complexity of Lexicographically Smallest Words and Computing
  Successors
Authors: Lukas Fleischer and Jeffrey Shallit
Categories: cs.FL
ACM-class: F.4.3
\\
  Given a regular language L over an ordered alphabet $\Sigma$, the set of
lexicographically smallest (resp., largest) words of each length is itself
regular. Moreover, there exists an unambiguous finite-state transducer that, on
a given word w, outputs the length-lexicographically smallest word larger than
w (henceforth called the L-successor of w). In both cases, naive constructions
result in an exponential blowup in the number of states. We prove that if L is
recognized by a DFA with n states, then $2^{\Theta(\sqrt{n \log n})}$ states
are sufficient for a DFA to recognize the subset S(L) of L composed of its
lexicographically smallest words. We give a matching lower bound that holds
even if S(L) is represented as an NFA. We then show that the same upper and

Title: The value of randomized strategies in distributionally robust risk
  averse network interdiction games
Authors: Utsav Sadana, Erick Delage
Categories: cs.GT math.OC
\\
  Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is widely used to account for the
preferences of a risk-averse agent in the extreme loss scenarios. To study the
effectiveness of randomization in interdiction games with an interdictor that
is both risk and ambiguity averse, we introduce a distributionally robust
network interdiction game where the interdictor randomizes over the feasible
interdiction plans in order to minimize the worst-case CVaR of the flow with
respect to both the unknown distribution of the capacity of the arcs and his
mixed strategy over interdicted arcs. The flow player, on the contrary,
maximizes the total flow in the network. By using the budgeted uncertainty set,
we control the degree of conservatism in the model and reformulate the
interdictor's non-linear problem as a bi-convex optimization problem. For
solving this problem to any given optimality level, we devise a spatial branch
and bound algorithm that uses the McCormick inequalities and reduced
reformulation linearization technique (RRLT) to obtain convex relaxation of the
problem. We also develop a column generation algorithm to identify the optimal
support of the convex relaxation which is then used in the coordinate descent
algorithm to determine the upper bounds. The efficiency and convergence of the
spatial branch and bound algorithm is established in the numerical experiments.
Further, our numerical experiments show that randomized strategies can have
significantly better in-sample and out-of-sample performance than optimal
deterministic ones.

Title: Dynamic Information Design: A Simple Problem on Optimal Sequential
  Information Disclosure
Authors: Farzaneh Farhadi and Demosthenis Teneketzis
Categories: cs.GT
Comments: 36 pages
\\
  We study a dynamic information design problem in a finite-horizon setting
consisting of two strategic and long-term optimizing agents, namely a principal
(he) and a detector (she). The principal observes the evolution of a Markov
chain that has two states, one "good" and one "bad" absorbing state, and has to
decide how to sequentially disclose information to the detector. The detector's
only information consists of the messages she receives from the principal. The
detector's objective is to detect as accurately as possible the time of the
jump from the good to the bad state. The principal's objective is to delay the
detector as much as possible from detective the jump to the bad state. For this
setting, we determine the optimal strategies of the principal and the detector.
The detector's optimal strategy is described by time-varying thresholds on her
posterior belief of the good state. We prove that it is optimal for the
principal to give no information to the detector before a time threshold, run a
mixed strategy to confuse the detector at the threshold time, and reveal the
true state afterwards. We present an algorithm that determines both the optimal
time threshold and the optimal mixed strategy that could be employed by the
principal. We show, through numerical experiments, that this optimal sequential
mechanism significantly outperforms any other information disclosure strategy
presented in literature.

Title: Maximizing Influence-based Group Shapley Centrality
Authors: Ruben Becker, Gianlorenzo D'Angelo, Hugo Gilbert
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  One key problem in network analysis is the so-called influence maximization
problem, which consists in finding a set $S$ of at most $k$ seed users, in a
social network, maximizing the spread of information from $S$. This paper
studies a related but slightly different problem: We want to find a set $S$ of
at most $k$ seed users that maximizes the spread of information, when $S$ is
added to an already pre-existing - but unknown - set of seed users $T$. We
consider such scenario to be very realistic. Assume a central entity wants to
spread a piece of news, while having a budget to influence $k$ users. This
central authority may know that some users are already aware of the information
and are going to spread it anyhow. The identity of these users being however
completely unknown. We model this optimization problem using the Group Shapley
value, a well-founded concept from cooperative game theory. While the standard
influence maximization problem is easy to approximate within a factor
$1-1/e-\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$, assuming common computational complexity
conjectures, we obtain strong hardness of approximation results for the problem
at hand in this paper. Maybe most prominently, we show that it cannot be
approximated within $1/n^{o(1)}$ under the Gap Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Hence, it is unlikely to achieve anything better than a polynomial factor
approximation. Nevertheless, we show that a greedy algorithm can achieve a
factor of $\frac{1-1/e}{k}-\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$, showing that not all
is lost in settings where $k$ is bounded.

  When allocating indivisible resources or tasks, an envy-free allocation or

Title: Towards Data Auctions with Externalities
Authors: Anish Agarwal, Munther Dahleh, Thibaut Horel, Maryann Rui
Categories: cs.GT
\\
  The design of data markets has gained in importance as firms increasingly use
predictions from machine learning models to make their operations more
effective, yet need to externally acquire the necessary training data to fit
such models. A property of such markets that has been given limited
consideration thus far is the externality faced by a firm when data is
allocated to other, competing firms. Addressing this is likely necessary for
progress towards the practical implementation of such markets. In this work, we
consider the case with $n$ competing firms and a monopolistic data seller. We
demonstrate that modeling the utility of firms solely through the increase in
prediction accuracy experienced reduces the complex, combinatorial problem of
allocating and pricing multiple data sets to an auction of a single digital
(freely replicable) good. Crucially, this is what enables us to model the
negative externalities experienced by a firm resulting from other firms'
allocations. We obtain forms of the welfare-maximizing and revenue-maximizing
auctions for such settings. We highlight how the form of the firms' private
information -- whether they know the externalities they exert on others or that
others exert on them -- affects the structure of the optimal mechanisms. We
find that in all cases, the optimal allocation rules turn out to be single
thresholds (one per firm), in which the seller allocates all information or
none of it to a firm. We note the framework and results introduced hold more
broadly for the auction of digital goods with externalities.

  When people talk about fashion, they care about the underlying meaning of
fashion concepts,e.g., style.For example, people ask questions like what
features make this dress smart.However, the product descriptions in today
fashion websites are full of domain specific and low level words. It is not
clear to people how exactly those low level descriptions can contribute to a
style or any high level fashion concept. In this paper, we proposed a data
driven solution to address this concept understanding issues by leveraging a
large number of existing product data on fashion sites. We first collected and
categorized 1546 fashion keywords into 5 different fashion categories. Then, we
collected a new fashion product dataset with 853,056 products in total.
Finally, we trained a deep learning model that can explicitly predict and
explain high level fashion concepts in a product image with its low level and
domain specific fashion features.

Categories: cs.IR
\\
  There exists a natural tension between encouraging a diverse ecosystem of
open-source search engines and supporting fair, replicable comparisons across
those systems. To balance these two goals, we examine two approaches to
providing interoperability between the inverted indexes of several systems. The
first takes advantage of internal abstractions around index structures and
building wrappers that allow one system to directly read the indexes of
another. The second involves sharing indexes across systems via a data exchange
specification that we have developed, called the Common Index File Format
(CIFF). We demonstrate the first approach with the Java systems Anserini and
Terrier, and the second approach with Anserini, JASSv2, OldDog, PISA, and
Terrier. Together, these systems provide a wide range of implementations and
features, with different research goals. Overall, we recommend CIFF as a
low-effort approach to support independent innovation while enabling the types
of fair evaluations that are critical for driving the field forward.

Comments: To be presented in the 45th IEEE International Conference on
  Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2020, 5 pages, 4 figures
\\
  In this work, we propose a new single-RF MIMO architecture which enjoys high
scalability and energy-efficiency. The transmitter in this proposal consists of
a single RF illuminator radiating towards a reflecting surface. Each element on
the reflecting surface re-transmits its received signal after applying a
phase-shift, such that a desired beamforming pattern is obtained. For this
architecture, the problem of beamforming is interpreted as linear regression
and a solution is derived via the method of least-squares. Using this
formulation, a fast iterative algorithm for tuning of the reflecting surface is
developed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is
fully compatible with current designs of reflecting surfaces.

Title: Localization Efficiency in Massive MIMO Systems

Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures
\\
  In the next generation of wireless systems, Massive MIMO offers high angular
resolution for localization. By virtue of large number of antennas, users'
angle of arrival can be estimated with high accuracy. As Massive MIMO antenna
array can be very large, the channels seen by different antennas might differ
from each other, however, this does not rule out the possibility of the Angle
of Arrival (AoA) estimation. We show that Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) in
multi-user independent, identically distributed (i.i.d) channels does exist and
regardless of channel distribution, it converges toward a closed-form
expression. Then, we redefine a localization efficiency function for a
multi-user scenario and numerically optimize it with respect to the number of
antennas. We prove when only a subset of the available antennas is used, CRLB
can be minimized with respect to which set of antennas is used. An antenna
selection strategy that minimizes CRLB is proposed. As a benchmark, we apply
the proposed antenna selection scheme to the MUltiple SIgnal Classification
(MUSIC) algorithm and study its efficiency. Numerical results validate the
accuracy of our analysis and show significant improvement in efficiency when
the proposed antenna selection strategy is employed.

Title: Age of Information for Multicast Transmission with Fixed and Random
  Deadlines in IoT Systems
Authors: Jie Li, Yong Zhou, and He Chen
Categories: cs.IT math.IT
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2002.02125
\\
  In this paper, we consider the multicast transmission of a real-time Internet
of Things (IoT) system, where an access point (AP) transmits time-stamped
status updates to multiple IoT devices. Different from the existing studies
that only considered multicast transmission without deadlines, we enforce a
deadline for the service time of each multicast status update, taking into
account both the fixed and randomly distributed deadlines. In particular, a
status update is dropped when either its deadline expires or it is successfully
received by a certain number of IoT devices. Considering deadlines is important
for many emerging IoT applications, where the outdated status updates are of no
use to IoT devices. We evaluate the timeliness of the status update delivery by
applying a recently proposed metric, named the age of information (AoI), which
is defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the most recently
received status update. After deriving the distributions of the service time
for all possible reception outcomes at IoT devices, we manage to obtain the
closed-form expressions of both the average AoI and the average peak AoI.
Simulations validate the performance analysis, which reveals that the multicast
transmission with deadlines achieves a lower average AoI than that without
deadlines and there exists an optimal value of the deadline that can minimize
the average (peak) AoI. Results also show that the fixed and random deadlines
have respective advantages in different deadline regimes.

Title: Random Access based Reliable Uplink Communication and Power Transfer
  using Dynamic Power Splitting
Authors: Steven Kisseleff, Symeon Chatzinotas, Bj\"orn Ottersten

Comments: 18 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on
  Wireless Communications
\\
  Large communication networks, e.g. Internet of Things (IoT), are known to be
vulnerable to co-channel interference. One possibility to address this issue is
the use of orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques. However, due to a
potentially very long duty cycle, OMA is not well suited for such schemes.
Instead, random medium access (RMA) appears more promising. An RMA scheme is
based on transmission of short data packets with random scheduling, which is
typically unknown to the receiver. The received signal, which consists of the
overlapping packets, can be used for energy harvesting and powering of a relay
device. Such an energy harvesting relay may utilize the energy for further
information processing and uplink transmission. In this paper, we address the
design of a simultaneous information and power transfer scheme based on
randomly scheduled packet transmissions and reliable symbol detection. We
formulate a prediction problem with the goal to maximize the harvested power
for an RMA scenario. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new
prediction method, which shows a significant performance improvement compared
to the straightforward baseline scheme. Furthermore, we investigate the
complexity of the proposed method and its vulnerability to imperfect channel
state information.

Title: Generating Electronic Health Records with Multiple Data Types and
  Constraints
Authors: Chao Yan, Ziqi Zhang, Steve Nyemba, Bradley A. Malin
Categories: cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML
\\
  Sharing electronic health records (EHRs) on a large scale may lead to privacy
intrusions. Recent research has shown that risks may be mitigated by simulating
EHRs through generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks. Yet the methods
developed to date are limited because they 1) focus on generating data of a
single type (e.g., diagnosis codes), neglecting other data types (e.g.,
demographics, procedures or vital signs) and 2) do not represent constraints
between features. In this paper, we introduce a method to simulate EHRs
composed of multiple data types by 1) refining the GAN model, 2) accounting for
feature constraints, and 3) incorporating utility measures for such generation
tasks. The findings over 770K EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center
demonstrate that our model achieved higher data utilities in retaining the
basic statistics, interdimensional correlation, structural properties and
frequent association rules from real data. Importantly, these were done without
sacrificing privacy.

Title: Self-Supervised Log Parsing

Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.SE stat.ML
\\
  Logs are extensively used during the development and maintenance of software
systems. They collect runtime events and allow tracking of code execution,
which enables a variety of critical tasks such as troubleshooting and fault
detection. However, large-scale software systems generate massive volumes of
semi-structured log records, posing a major challenge for automated analysis.
Parsing semi-structured records with free-form text log messages into
structured templates is the first and crucial step that enables further
analysis. Existing approaches rely on log-specific heuristics or manual rule
extraction. These are often specialized in parsing certain log types, and thus,
limit performance scores and generalization. We propose a novel parsing
technique called NuLog that utilizes a self-supervised learning model and
formulates the parsing task as masked language modeling (MLM). In the process
of parsing, the model extracts summarizations from the logs in the form of a
vector embedding. This allows the coupling of the MLM as pre-training with a
downstream anomaly detection task. We evaluate the parsing performance of NuLog
on 10 real-world log datasets and compare the results with 12 parsing
techniques. The results show that NuLog outperforms existing methods in parsing
accuracy with an average of 99% and achieves the lowest edit distance to the
ground truth templates. Additionally, two case studies are conducted to
demonstrate the ability of the approach for log-based anomaly detection in both
supervised and unsupervised scenario. The results show that NuLog can be
successfully used to support troubleshooting tasks. The implementation is
available at https://github.com/nulog/nulog.

Title: The Value of Nullspace Tuning Using Partial Label Information
Authors: Colin B. Hansen, Vishwesh Nath, Diego A. Mesa, Yuankai Huo, Bennett A.
  Landman, Thomas A. Lasko
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  In semi-supervised learning, information from unlabeled examples is used to
improve the model learned from labeled examples. But in some learning problems,
partial label information can be inferred from otherwise unlabeled examples and
used to further improve the model. In particular, partial label information
exists when subsets of training examples are known to have the same label, even
though the label itself is missing. By encouraging a model to give the same
label to all such examples, we can potentially improve its performance. We call
this encouragement \emph{Nullspace Tuning} because the difference vector
between any pair of examples with the same label should lie in the nullspace of
a linear model. In this paper, we investigate the benefit of using partial
label information using a careful comparison framework over well-characterized
public datasets. We show that the additional information provided by partial
labels reduces test error over good semi-supervised methods usually by a factor
of 2, up to a factor of 5.5 in the best case. We also show that adding
Nullspace Tuning to the newer and state-of-the-art MixMatch method decreases
its test error by up to a factor of 1.8.

Title: Improving predictions by nonlinear regression models from outlying input
  data
Authors: William W. Hsieh
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
Comments: 26 pages, 12 figures. Preprint of a paper accepted for publication by
  the Journal of Environmental Informatics
\\
  When applying machine learning/statistical methods to the environmental
sciences, nonlinear regression (NLR) models often perform only slightly better
and occasionally worse than linear regression (LR). The proposed reason for
this conundrum is that NLR models can give predictions much worse than LR when
given input data which lie outside the domain used in model training.
Continuous unbounded variables are widely used in environmental sciences,
whence not uncommon for new input data to lie far outside the training domain.
For six environmental datasets, inputs in the test data were classified as
"outliers" and "non-outliers" based on the Mahalanobis distance from the
training input data. The prediction scores (mean absolute error, Spearman
correlation) showed NLR to outperform LR for the non-outliers, but often
underperform LR for the outliers. An approach based on Occam's Razor (OR) was
proposed, where linear extrapolation was used instead of nonlinear
extrapolation for the outliers. The linear extrapolation to the outlier domain
was based on the NLR model within the non-outlier domain. This
NLR$_{\mathrm{OR}}$ approach reduced occurrences of very poor extrapolation by
NLR, and it tended to outperform NLR and LR for the outliers. In conclusion,
input test data should be screened for outliers. For outliers, the unreliable
NLR predictions can be replaced by NLR$_{\mathrm{OR}}$ or LR predictions, or by
issuing a "no reliable prediction" warning.

Title: Adversarial Transferability in Wearable Sensor Systems
Authors: Ramesh Kumar Sah and Hassan Ghasemzadeh
Categories: cs.LG cs.CR eess.SP stat.ML
\\
  Machine learning has increasingly become the most used approach for inference
and decision making in wearable sensor systems. However, recent studies have
found that machine learning systems are easily fooled by the addition of
adversarial perturbation to their inputs. What is more interesting is that the
adversarial examples generated for one machine learning system can also degrade
the performance of another. This property of adversarial examples is called
transferability. In this work, we take the first strides in studying
adversarial transferability in wearable sensor systems, from the following
perspectives: 1) Transferability between machine learning models, 2)
Transferability across subjects, 3) Transferability across sensor locations,
and 4) Transferability across datasets. With Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
as an example sensor system, we found strong untargeted transferability in all
cases of transferability. Specifically, gradient-based attacks were able to
achieve higher misclassification rates compared to non-gradient attacks. The
misclassification rate of untargeted adversarial examples ranged from 20% to
98%. For targeted transferability between machine learning models, the success
rate of adversarial examples was 100% for iterative attack methods. However,
the success rate for other types of targeted transferability ranged from 20% to
0%. Our findings strongly suggest that adversarial transferability has serious
consequences not only in sensor systems but also across the broad spectrum of
ubiquitous computing.

Title: Domain Adaptation Through Transferring both the Source-Knowledge and
  Target-Relatedness Simultaneously
Authors: Qing Tian, Chuang Ma, Meng Cao, Songcan Chen
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Domain adaptation (DA) is an emerging research topic in the field of machine
learning and pattern recognition, which aims to assist the learning of target
domains by transferring model knowledge from the source domains. To perform DA,
a variety of methods have been proposed, most of which concentrate on the
scenario of single source and single target domain (1S1T). However, in real
applications, usually multiple domains, especially target domains, are
involved, which cannot be handled directly by those 1S1T models. Although
related works on multi-target domains have been proposed, they are quite rare,
and more unfortunately, nearly none of them model the source domain knowledge
and leverage the target-relatedness jointly. To overcome these shortcomings, in
this paper we propose a kind of DA model through TrAnsferring both the
source-KnowlEdge and TargEt-Relatedness, DATAKETER for short. In this way, not
only the supervision knowledge from the source domain, but also the potential
relatedness among the target domains are simultaneously modeled for
exploitation in the process of 1SmT DA. In addition, we construct an
alternating optimization algorithm to solve the variables of the proposed model
with convergence guarantee. Finally, through extensive experiments on both
benchmark and real datasets, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of
the proposed method.

guarantee on asymptotic stability of the depth-flows, leading to robustness
against input perturbations and low computational burden for the numerical
solver. The learning procedure is cast as an optimal control problem, and an
approximate solution is proposed based on adjoint sensivity analysis. We
further introduce novel regularizers designed to ease the optimization process
and speed up convergence. The proposed model class is evaluated on non-linear
classification and function approximation tasks.

Title: Federated Visual Classification with Real-World Data Distribution
Authors: Tzu-Ming Harry Hsu, Hang Qi, and Matthew Brown
Categories: cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  Federated Learning enables visual models to be trained on-device, bringing
advantages for user privacy (data need never leave the device), but challenges
in terms of data diversity and quality. Whilst typical models in the datacenter
are trained using data that are independent and identically distributed (IID),
data at source are typically far from IID. Furthermore, differing quantities of
data are typically available at each device (imbalance). In this work, we
characterize the effect these real-world data distributions have on distributed
learning, using as a benchmark the standard Federated Averaging (FedAvg)
algorithm. To do so, we introduce two new large-scale datasets for species and
landmark classification, with realistic per-user data splits that simulate
real-world edge learning scenarios. We also develop two new algorithms (FedVC,
FedIR) that intelligently resample and reweight over the client pool, bringing
large improvements in accuracy and stability in training.

Title: Compressed Sensing with Invertible Generative Models and Dependent Noise
Authors: Jay Whang, Qi Lei, Alexandros G. Dimakis
Categories: cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML
\\
  We study image inverse problems with invertible generative priors,
specifically normalizing flow models. Our formulation views the solution as the
Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the measurements. Our
general formulation allows for non-linear differentiable forward operators and
noise distributions with long-range dependencies. We establish theoretical
recovery guarantees for denoising and compressed sensing under our framework.
We also empirically validate our method on various inverse problems including
compressed sensing with quantized measurements and denoising with dependent
noise patterns.

Title: Efficient improper learning for online logistic regression
Authors: R\'emi J\'ez\'equel (SIERRA), Pierre Gaillard (SIERRA), Alessandro
  Rudi (SIERRA)
Categories: cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  We consider the setting of online logistic regression and consider the regret
with respect to the 2-ball of radius B. It is known (see [Hazan et al., 2014])
that any proper algorithm which has logarithmic regret in the number of samples
(denoted n) necessarily suffers an exponential multiplicative constant in B. In
this work, we design an efficient improper algorithm that avoids this
exponential constant while preserving a logarithmic regret. Indeed, [Foster et
al., 2018] showed that the lower bound does not apply to improper algorithms
and proposed a strategy based on exponential weights with prohibitive
computational complexity. Our new algorithm based on regularized empirical risk
minimization with surrogate losses satisfies a regret scaling as O(B log(Bn))
with a per-round time-complexity of order O(d^2).

Title: Anchor & Transform: Learning Sparse Representations of Discrete Objects
Authors: Paul Pu Liang, Manzil Zaheer, Yuan Wang, Amr Ahmed
Categories: cs.LG cs.CL stat.ML
\\
  Learning continuous representations of discrete objects such as text, users,
and URLs lies at the heart of many applications including language and user
modeling. When using discrete objects as input to neural networks, we often
ignore the underlying structures (e.g. natural groupings and similarities) and
embed the objects independently into individual vectors. As a result, existing
methods do not scale to large vocabulary sizes. In this paper, we design a
Bayesian nonparametric prior for embeddings that encourages sparsity and
leverages natural groupings among objects. We derive an approximate inference
algorithm based on Small Variance Asymptotics which yields a simple and natural
algorithm for learning a small set of anchor embeddings and a sparse
transformation matrix. We call our method Anchor & Transform (ANT) as the
embeddings of discrete objects are a sparse linear combination of the anchors,
weighted according to the transformation matrix. ANT is scalable, flexible,
end-to-end trainable, and allows the user to incorporate domain knowledge about
object relationships. On text classification and language modeling benchmarks,
ANT demonstrates stronger performance with fewer parameters as compared to
existing compression baselines.

Title: Task-Adaptive Clustering for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Classification
Authors: Jun Seo, Sung Whan Yoon, Jaekyun Moon
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI
Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures
\\
  Few-shot learning aims to handle previously unseen tasks using only a small
amount of new training data. In preparing (or meta-training) a few-shot
learner, however, massive labeled data are necessary. In the real world,
unfortunately, labeled data are expensive and/or scarce. In this work, we
propose a few-shot learner that can work well under the semi-supervised setting
where a large portion of training data is unlabeled. Our method employs
explicit task-conditioning in which unlabeled sample clustering for the current
task takes place in a new projection space different from the embedding feature
space. The conditioned clustering space is linearly constructed so as to
quickly close the gap between the class centroids for the current task and the
independent per-class reference vectors meta-trained across tasks. In a more
general setting, our method introduces a concept of controlling the degree of
task-conditioning for meta-learning: the amount of task-conditioning varies
with the number of repetitive updates for the clustering space. Extensive
simulation results based on the miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets show
state-of-the-art semi-supervised few-shot classification performance of the
proposed method. Simulation results also indicate that the proposed
task-adaptive clustering shows graceful degradation with a growing number of
distractor samples, i.e., unlabeled sample images coming from outside the
candidate classes.

Title: Few-Shot Graph Classification with Model Agnostic Meta-Learning
Authors: Ning Ma, Jiajun Bu, Jieyu Yang, Zhen Zhang, Chengwei Yao, and Zhi Yu
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Graph classification aims to perform accurate information extraction and
classification over graphstructured data. In the past few years, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have achieved satisfactory performance on graph classification
tasks. However, most GNNs based methods focus on designing graph convolutional
operations and graph pooling operations, overlooking that collecting or
labeling graph-structured data is more difficult than grid-based data. We
utilize meta-learning for fewshot graph classification to alleviate the scarce
of labeled graph samples when training new tasks.More specifically, to boost
the learning of graph classification tasks, we leverage GNNs as graph embedding
backbone and meta-learning as training paradigm to capture task-specific
knowledge rapidly in graph classification tasks and transfer them to new tasks.
To enhance the robustness of meta-learner, we designed a novel step controller
driven by Reinforcement Learning. The experiments demonstrate that our
framework works well compared to baselines.

Title: Interpretable Deep Recurrent Neural Networks via Unfolding Reweighted
  $\ell_1$-$\ell_1$ Minimization: Architecture Design and Generalization
  Analysis
Authors: Huynh Van Luong, Boris Joukovsky, Nikos Deligiannis
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML
Comments: Pre-print: 14 pages
\\
  Deep unfolding methods---for example, the learned iterative shrinkage
thresholding algorithm (LISTA)---design deep neural networks as learned
variations of optimization methods. These networks have been shown to achieve
faster convergence and higher accuracy than the original optimization methods.
In this line of research, this paper develops a novel deep recurrent neural
network (coined reweighted-RNN) by the unfolding of a reweighted
$\ell_1$-$\ell_1$ minimization algorithm and applies it to the task of
sequential signal reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first deep unfolding method that explores reweighted minimization. Due to the
underlying reweighted minimization model, our RNN has a different
soft-thresholding function (alias, different activation functions) for each
hidden unit in each layer. Furthermore, it has higher network expressivity than
existing deep unfolding RNN models due to the over-parameterizing weights.
Importantly, we establish theoretical generalization error bounds for the
proposed reweighted-RNN model by means of Rademacher complexity. The bounds
reveal that the parameterization of the proposed reweighted-RNN ensures good
generalization. We apply the proposed reweighted-RNN to the problem of video
frame reconstruction from low-dimensional measurements, that is, sequential
frame reconstruction. The experimental results on the moving MNIST dataset
demonstrate that the proposed deep reweighted-RNN significantly outperforms
existing RNN models.

  Super learner algorithm can be applied to combine results of multiple base
learners to improve quality of predictions. The default method for verification
of super learner results is by nested cross validation. It has been proposed by
Tsamardinos et al., that nested cross validation can be replaced by resampling
for tuning hyper-parameters of the learning algorithms. We apply this idea to
verification of super learner and compare with other verification methods,
including nested cross validation. Tests were performed on artificial data sets
of diverse size and on seven real, biomedical data sets. The resampling method,
called Bootstrap Bias Correction, proved to be a reasonably precise and very
cost-efficient alternative for nested cross validation.

Title: A Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach to Autonomous
  Separation Assurance
Authors: Marc Brittain, Xuxi Yang, Peng Wei
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.MA stat.ML
Comments: 11 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1905.01303
\\
  A novel deep multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is proposed to
identify and resolve conflicts among a variable number of aircraft in a
high-density, stochastic, and dynamic sector in en route airspace. Currently
the sector capacity is limited by human air traffic controller's cognitive
limitation. In order to scale up to a high-density airspace, in this work we
investigate the feasibility of a new concept (autonomous separation assurance)
and a new approach (multi-agent reinforcement learning) to push the sector
capacity above human cognitive limitation. We propose the concept of using
distributed vehicle autonomy to ensure separation, instead of a centralized
sector air traffic controller. Our proposed framework utilizes an actor-critic
model, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that we customize to incorporate an
attention network. By using the attention network, we are able to encode the
information from a variable number of intruder aircraft into a fixed length
vector and allow the agents to learn which intruder aircraft's information is
critical to achieve the optimal performance. This allows the agents to have
access to variable aircraft information in the sector in a scalable, efficient
approach to achieve high traffic throughput under uncertainty. The agents are
trained using a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme where one
neural network is learned and shared by all agents in the environment. To
validate the proposed framework, we designed three challenging case studies in
the BlueSky air traffic control environment. Numerical results show the
proposed framework significantly reduces the offline training time without
sacrificing performance.

Title: Two Tier Prediction of Stroke Using Artificial Neural Networks and

Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1706.08227
\\
  Cerebrovascular accident \textit{(CVA)} or stroke is the rapid loss of brain
function due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain. Statistically,
stroke is the second leading cause of death. This has motivated us to suggest a
two-tier system for predicting stroke; the first tier makes use of Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) to predict the chances of a person suffering from stroke.
The ANN is trained the using the values of various risk factors of stroke of
several patients who had stroke. Once a person is classified as having a high
risk of stroke, s/he undergoes another the tier-2 classification test where
his/her neuro MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) is analysed to predict the
chances of stroke. The tier-2 uses Non-negative Matrix Factorization and
Haralick Textural features for feature extraction and SVM classifier for
classification. We have obtained an accuracy of 96.67\% in tier-1 and an
accuracy of 70\% in tier-2.

Title: Deep Quaternion Features for Privacy Protection

Categories: cs.LG cs.CR cs.CV stat.ML
\\
  We propose a method to revise the neural network to construct the
quaternion-valued neural network (QNN), in order to prevent intermediate-layer
features from leaking input information. The QNN uses quaternion-valued
features, where each element is a quaternion. The QNN hides input information
into a random phase of quaternion-valued features. Even if attackers have
obtained network parameters and intermediate-layer features, they cannot
extract input information without knowing the target phase. In this way, the
QNN can effectively protect the input privacy. Besides, the output accuracy of
QNNs only degrades mildly compared to traditional neural networks, and the
computational cost is much less than other privacy-preserving methods.

Title: SurvLIME: A method for explaining machine learning survival models
Authors: Maxim S. Kovalev, Lev V. Utkin, Ernest M. Kasimov
Categories: cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  A new method called SurvLIME for explaining machine learning survival models
is proposed. It can be viewed as an extension or modification of the well-known
method LIME. The main idea behind the proposed method is to apply the Cox
proportional hazards model to approximate the survival model at the local area
around a test example. The Cox model is used because it considers a linear
combination of the example covariates such that coefficients of the covariates
can be regarded as quantitative impacts on the prediction. Another idea is to
approximate cumulative hazard functions of the explained model and the Cox
model by using a set of perturbed points in a local area around the point of
interest. The method is reduced to solving an unconstrained convex optimization
problem. A lot of numerical experiments demonstrate the SurvLIME efficiency.

Title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Emergent Roles
Authors: Tonghan Wang, Heng Dong, Victor Lesser, Chongjie Zhang
Categories: cs.MA
\\
  The role concept provides a useful tool to design and understand complex
multi-agent systems, which allows agents with a similar role to share similar
behaviors. However, existing role-based methods use prior domain knowledge and
predefine role structures and behaviors. In contrast, multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) provides flexibility and adaptability, but less efficiency in
complex tasks. In this paper, we synergize these two paradigms and propose a
role-oriented MARL framework (ROMA). In this framework, roles are emergent, and
agents with similar roles tend to share their learning to be specialized on
certain sub-tasks. To this end, we construct a stochastic role embedding space
by introducing two novel regularizers and conditioning individual policies on
roles. Experiments show that our method can learn dynamic, versatile,
identifiable, and specialized roles, which help our method push forward the
state of the art on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark. Demonstrative

Categories: cs.MA
\\
  The next generation of mobile robots needs to be socially-compliant to be
accepted by humans. As simple as this task may seem, defining compliance
formally is not trivial. Yet, classical reinforcement learning (RL) relies upon
hard-coded reward signals. In this work, we go beyond this approach and provide
the agent with intrinsic motivation using empowerment. Empowerment maximizes
the influence of an agent on its near future and has been shown to be a good
model for biological behaviors. It also has been used for artificial agents to
learn complicated and generalized actions. Self-empowerment maximizes the
influence of an agent on its future. On the contrary, our robot strives for the
empowerment of people in its environment, so they are not disturbed by the
robot when pursuing their goals. We show that our robot has a positive
influence on humans, as it minimizes the travel time and distance of humans
while moving efficiently to its own goal. The method can be used in any
multi-agent system that requires a robot to solve a particular task involving
humans interactions.

\\
  Being one of the most promising applications enabled by connected and
automated vehicles (CAV) technology, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC)
is expected to be deployed in the near term on public roads.} Thus far, the
majority of the CACC studies have been focusing on the overall network
performance with limited insights on the potential impacts of CAVs on
human-driven vehicles (HVs).This paper aims to quantify such impacts by
studying the high-resolution vehicle trajectory data that are obtained from
microscopic simulation. Two platoon clustering strategies for CACC- an ad hoc
coordination strategy and a local coordination strategy-are implemented.
Results show that the local coordination outperforms the ad hoc coordination
across all tested market penetration rates (MPRs) in terms of network
throughput and productivity. According to the two-sample
Kolmogorov-\textcolor{re}{Smirnov} test, however, the distributions of the hard
braking events (as a potential safety impact) for HVs change significantly
under local coordination strategy. For both of the clustering strategy, CAVs
increase the average lane change frequency for HVs. The break-even point for
average lane change frequency between the two strategies is observed at 30%
MPR, which decreases from 5.42 to 5.38 per vehicle. The average lane change
frequency following a monotonically increasing pattern in response to MPR, and
it reaches the highest 5.48 per vehicle at 40% MPR. Lastly, the interaction
state of the car-following model for HVs is analyzed. It is revealed that the
composition of the interaction state could be influenced by CAVs as well. One
of the apparent trends is that the time spent on approaching state declines
with the increasing presence of CAVs.

\\
  In a transformation method, the numerical solution of a given boundary value
problem is obtained by solving one or more related initial value problems.
Therefore, a transformation method, like a shooting method, is an initial value
method. The main difference between a transformation and a shooting method is
that the former is conceived and derive its formulation from the scaling
invariance theory. This paper is concerned with the application of the
iterative transformation method to several problems in the boundary layer
theory. The iterative method is an extension of the T{\"o}pfer's non-iterative
algorithm developed as a simple way to solve the celebrated Blasius problem.
This iterative method provides a simple numerical test for the existence and
uniqueness of solutions. Here we show how the method can be applied to problems
with a homogeneous boundary conditions at infinity and in particular we solve
the Sakiadis problem of boundary layer theory. Moreover, we show how to couple
our method with Newton's root-finder. The obtained numerical results compare
well with those available in the literature. The main aim here is that any
method developed for the Blasius, or the Sakiadis, problem might be extended to
more challenging or interesting problems. In this context, the iterative
transformation method has been recently applied to compute the normal and
reverse flow solutions of Stewartson for the Falkner-Skan model [Comput. \&
Fluids, {\bf 73} (2013) pp. 202-209].

difference method are presented. The method shows an explicit method without
any modification to the Leap-Frogging scheme. The polarizations of the Lorentz
media are convoluted simply in the current density. The numerical results are
shown to be competitive accuracy with a conventional method. The codes used in
the numerical investigation are available on the GitHub

Title: Computation of Tight Enclosures for Laplacian Eigenvalues
Authors: Joel Dahne and Bruno Salvy
Categories: math.NA cs.NA math.CO
\\
  Recently, there has been interest in high-precision approximations of the
first eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on spherical triangles for
combinatorial purposes. We compute improved and certified enclosures to these
eigenvalues. This is achieved by applying the method of particular solutions in
high precision, the enclosure being obtained by a combination of interval
arithmetic and Taylor models. The index of the eigenvalue is certified by
exploiting the monotonicity of the eigenvalue with respect to the domain. The
classically troublesome case of singular corners is handled by combining
expansions from all corners and an expansion from an interior point. In
particular, this allows us to compute 80 digits of the fundamental eigenvalue
for the 3D Kreweras model that has been the object of previous efforts.

Title: Convergence Analysis of Asymptotic Preserving Schemes for Strongly
  Mangnetized Plasmas
Authors: Francis Filbet (UT3), Luis Miguel Rodrigues (IRMAR), Hamed Zakerzadeh
  (UT3)
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  The present paper is devoted to the convergence analysis of a class of
asymptotic preserving particle schemes [Filbet \& Rodrigues, SIAM J. Numer.
Anal., 54(2) (2016):1120-1146] for the Vlasov equation with a strong external
magnetic field. In this regime, classical Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods are
subject to quite restrictive stability constraints on the time and space steps,
due to the small Larmor radius and plasma frequency. The asymptotic preserving
discretization that we are going to study removes such a constraint while
capturing the large-scale dynamics, even when the discretization (in time and
space) is too coarse to capture fastest scales. Our error bounds are explicit
regarding the discretization, stiffness parameter, initial data and time.

Title: An immersed boundary method with subgrid resolution and improved
  numerical stability applied to slender bodies in Stokes flow
Authors: Ondrej Maxian and Charles S. Peskin
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
Comments: 23 pages, 6 figures. To be published in SIAM J. Sci. Comput
MSC-class: 65M12, 76D07, 74F10
\\
  The immersed boundary method is a numerical and mathematical formulation for
solving fluid-structure interaction problems. It relies on solving fluid
equations on an Eulerian fluid grid and interpolating the resulting velocity
back onto immersed structures. To resolve slender fibers, the grid spacing must
be on the order of the fiber radius, and thus the number of required grid
points along the filament must be of the same order as the aspect ratio.
Simulations of slender bodies using the IB method can therefore be intractable.
A technique is presented to address this problem in the context of Stokes flow.
The velocity of the structure is split into a component coming from the
underlying fluid grid, which is coarser than normally required, and a component
proportional to the force (a drag term). The drag coefficient is set so that a
single sphere is represented exactly on a grid of arbitrary meshwidth. Implicit
treatment of the drag term removes some of the stability restrictions normally
associated with the IB method. This comes at a loss of accuracy, although tests
are conducted that show 1-2 digits of relative accuracy can be obtained on
coarser grids. After its accuracy and stability are tested, the method is
applied to two real world examples: fibers in shear flow and a suspension of
fibers. These examples show that the method can reproduce existing results and
make reasonable predictions about the viscosity of an aligned fiber suspension.

designed to preserve invariants of ordinary differential equations. From a
formal series expansion of the methods, we derive conditions for arbitrarily

methods for canonical Hamiltonian systems. Higher order schemes are presented
and applied to the H\'enon-Heiles system and a Lotka-Volterra system.

  We consider the time-harmonic electromagnetic transmission problem for the

first stability result of the local multiple trace formulation (MTF) for
electromagnetics, originally introduced by Hiptmair and Jerez-Hanckes [Adv.
Comp. Math. 37 (2012), 37-91] for the acoustic case, paving the way towards an
extension to general piecewise homogeneous scatterers. Moreover, we investigate
preconditioning techniques for the local MTF scheme and study the accumulation
points of induced operators. In particular, we propose a novel second-order
inverse approximation of the operator. Numerical experiments validate our
claims and confirm the relevance of the preconditioning strategies.

Title: Convergence of Lagrange finite elements for the Maxwell Eigenvalue
  Problem in 2D
Authors: Daniele Boffi, Johnny Guzman, Michael Neilan
Categories: math.NA cs.NA
\\
  We consider finite element approximations of the Maxwell eigenvalue problem
in two dimensions. We prove, in certain settings, convergence of the discrete
eigenvalues using Lagrange finite elements. In particular, we prove convergence
in three scenarios: piecewise linear elements on Powell--Sabin triangulations,
piecewise quadratic elements on Clough--Tocher triangulations, and piecewise
quartics (and higher) elements on general shape-regular triangulations. We
provide numerical experiments that support the theoretical results. The
computations also show that, on general triangulations, the eigenvalue
approximations are very sensitive to nearly singular vertices, i.e., vertices
that fall on exactly two "almost" straight lines.

Title: Neuroevolution of Self-Interpretable Agents
Authors: Yujin Tang, Duong Nguyen, David Ha
Categories: cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Inattentional blindness is the psychological phenomenon that causes one to
miss things in plain sight. It is a consequence of the selective attention in
perception that lets us remain focused on important parts of our world without
distraction from irrelevant details. Motivated by selective attention, we study
the properties of artificial agents that perceive the world through the lens of
a self-attention bottleneck. By constraining access to only a small fraction of
the visual input, we show that their policies are directly interpretable in
pixel space. We find neuroevolution ideal for training self-attention
architectures for vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, allowing us
to incorporate modules that can include discrete, non-differentiable operations
which are useful for our agent. We argue that self-attention has similar
properties as indirect encoding, in the sense that large implicit weight
matrices are generated from a small number of key-query parameters, thus
enabling our agent to solve challenging vision based tasks with at least 1000x
fewer parameters than existing methods. Since our agent attends to only task
critical visual hints, they are able to generalize to environments where task
irrelevant elements are modified while conventional methods fail. Videos of our
results and source code available at https://attentionagent.github.io/

Title: Many-Objective Estimation of Distribution Optimization Algorithm Based
  on WGAN-GP
Authors: Zhenyu Liang, Yunfan Li, Zhongwei Wan
Categories: cs.NE
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2003.07013
\\
  Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) are stochastic optimization
algorithms. EDA establishes a probability model to describe the distribution of
solution from the perspective of population macroscopically by statistical
learning method, and then randomly samples the probability model to generate a
new population. EDA can better solve multi-objective optimal problems (MOPs).
However, the performance of EDA decreases in solving many-objective optimal
problems (MaOPs), which contains more than three objectives. Reference Vector
Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (RVEA), based on the EDA framework, can better
solve MaOPs. In our paper, we use the framework of RVEA. However, we generate
the new population by Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks-Gradient
Penalty (WGAN-GP) instead of using crossover and mutation. WGAN-GP have
advantages of fast convergence, good stability and high sample quality. WGAN-GP
learn the mapping relationship from standard normal distribution to given data
set distribution based on a given data set subject to the same distribution. It
can quickly generate populations with high diversity and good convergence. To
measure the performance, RM-MEDA, MOPSO and NSGA-II are selected to perform
comparison experiments over DTLZ and LSMOP test suites with 3-, 5-, 8-, 10- and
15-objective.

Title: Patient-centric HetNets Powered by Machine Learning and Big Data
  Analytics for 6G Networks
Authors: Mohammed S. Hadi, Ahmed Q. Lawey, Taisir E. H. El-Gorashi, and Jaafar
  M. H. Elmirghani
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Having a cognitive and self-optimizing network that proactively adapts not
only to channel conditions, but also according to its users needs can be one of
the highest forthcoming priorities of future 6G Heterogeneous Networks
(HetNets). In this paper, we introduce an interdisciplinary approach linking
the concepts of e-healthcare, priority, big data analytics (BDA) and radio
resource optimization in a multi-tier 5G network. We employ three machine
learning (ML) algorithms, namely, naive Bayesian (NB) classifier, logistic
regression (LR), and decision tree (DT), working as an ensemble system to
analyze historical medical records of stroke out-patients (OPs) and readings
from body-attached internet-of-things (IoT) sensors to predict the likelihood
of an imminent stroke. We convert the stroke likelihood into a risk factor
functioning as a priority in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
optimization model. Hence, the task is to optimally allocate physical resource
blocks (PRBs) to HetNet users while prioritizing OPs by granting them high gain
PRBs according to the severity of their medical state. Thus, empowering the OPs
to send their critical data to their healthcare provider with minimized delay.
To that end, two optimization approaches are proposed, a weighted sum rate
maximization (WSRMax) approach and a proportional fairness (PF) approach. The
proposed approaches increased the OPs average signal to interference plus noise
(SINR) by 57% and 95%, respectively. The WSRMax approach increased the system
total SINR to a level higher than that of the PF approach, nevertheless, the PF
approach yielded higher SINRs for the OPs, better fairness and a lower margin
of error.

Title: Interleaved Weighted Round-Robin: A Network Calculus Analysis
Authors: Seyed Mohammadhossein Tabatabaee, Jean-Yves Le Boudec, Marc Boyer
Categories: cs.NI
\\
  Weighted Round-Robin (WRR) is often used, due to its simplicity, for
scheduling packets or tasks. With WRR, a number of packets equal to the weight
allocated to a flow can be served consecutively, which leads to a bursty
service. Interleaved Weighted Round-Robin (IWRR) is a variant that mitigates
this effect. We are interested in finding bounds on worst-case delay obtained
with IWRR. To this end, we use a network calculus approach and find a strict
service curve for IWRR. The result is obtained using the pseudo-inverse of a
function. We show that the strict service curve is the best obtainable one, and
that delay bounds derived from it are tight (i.e. worst-case) for flows of
packets of constant size. Furthermore, the IWRR strict service curve dominates
the strict service curve for WRR that was previously published. We provide some
numerical examples to illustrate the reduction in worst-case delays caused by
IWRR compared to WRR.

Title: Signature restriction for polymorphic algebraic effects
Authors: Taro Sekiyama and Takeshi Tsukada and Atsushi Igarashi
Categories: cs.PL
\\
  It has been well known that naively combining polymorphic effects and
polymorphic type assignment breaks type safety. Existing approaches to this
problem are classified into two groups: one for restricting how effects are
triggered and the other for restricting how they are implemented. This work
explores a new approach to the safety of polymorphic effects in polymorphic
type assignment. A novelty of our work lies in finding a restriction on effect
interfaces. To formalize our idea, we employ algebraic effects and handlers,
where an effect interface is given by a set of operations coupled with type
signatures. We propose signature restriction, a new notion to restrict the type
signatures of operations, and show that signature restriction is sufficient to
ensure type safety of an effectful language equipped with unrestricted
polymorphic type assignment. We also develop a type-and-effect system to enable
the use of both operations that follow and do not follow signature restriction
in a single program.

The vehicles traversed an average route of 66 km in Michigan that included a
mix of driving scenarios such as the Detroit Airport, freeways, city-centers,
university campus and suburban neighbourhoods, etc. Each vehicle used in this
data collection is a Ford Fusion outfitted with an Applanix POS-LV GNSS system,
four HDL-32E Velodyne 3D-lidar scanners, 6 Point Grey 1.3 MP Cameras arranged
on the rooftop for 360-degree coverage and 1 Pointgrey 5 MP camera mounted
behind the windshield for the forward field of view. We present the seasonal
variation in weather, lighting, construction and traffic conditions experienced
in dynamic urban environments. This dataset can help design robust algorithms
for autonomous vehicles and multi-agent systems. Each log in the dataset is
time-stamped and contains raw data from all the sensors, calibration values,
pose trajectory, ground truth pose, and 3D maps. All data is available in
Rosbag format that can be visualized, modified and applied using the
open-source Robot Operating System (ROS). We also provide the output of
state-of-the-art reflectivity-based localization for bench-marking purposes.

  Predicting the behavior of road agents is a difficult and crucial task for
both advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving systems. Traditional
confidence measures for this important task often ignore the way predicted
trajectories affect downstream decisions and their utilities. In this paper we
devise a novel neural network regressor to estimate the utility distribution
given the predictions. Based on reasonable assumptions on the utility function,
we establish a decision criterion that takes into account the role of
prediction in decision making. We train our real-time regressor along with a
human driver intent predictor and use it in shared autonomy scenarios where
decisions depend on the prediction confidence. We test our system on a
realistic urban driving dataset, present the advantage of the resulting system
in terms of recall and fall-out performance compared to baseline methods, and
demonstrate its effectiveness in intervention and warning use cases.

Title: Accelerated ADMM based Trajectory Optimization for Legged Locomotion
  with Coupled Rigid Body Dynamics
Authors: Ziyi Zhou, Ye Zhao
Categories: cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY
Comments: American Control Conference (ACC), 2020
\\
  Trajectory optimization is becoming increasingly powerful in addressing
motion planning problems of underactuated robotic systems. Numerous prior
studies solve such a class of large non-convex optimal control problems in a
hierarchical fashion. However, numerical accuracy issues are prone to occur
when one uses a full-order model to track reference trajectories generated from
a reduced-order model. This study investigates an approach of Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and proposes a new splitting scheme for
legged locomotion problems. Rigid body dynamics constraints and other general
constraints such as box and cone constraints are decomposed to multiple
sub-problems in a principled manner. The resulting multi-block ADMM framework
enables us to leverage the efficiency of an unconstrained optimization
method--Differential Dynamical Programming--to iteratively solve the
optimizations using centroidal and whole-body models. Furthermore, we propose a
Stage-wise Accelerated ADMM with over-relaxation and varying-penalty schemes to
improve the overall convergence rate. We evaluate and validate the performance
of the proposed ADMM algorithm on a car-parking example and a bipedal
locomotion problem over rough terrains.

Title: Inferring the Material Properties of Granular Media for Robotic Tasks
Authors: Carolyn Matl, Yashraj Narang, Ruzena Bajcsy, Fabio Ramos, Dieter Fox
Categories: cs.RO cs.GR
\\
  Granular media (e.g., cereal grains, plastic resin pellets, and pills) are
ubiquitous in robotics-integrated industries, such as agriculture,
manufacturing, and pharmaceutical development. This prevalence mandates the
accurate and efficient simulation of these materials. This work presents a
software and hardware framework that automatically calibrates a fast physics
simulator to accurately simulate granular materials by inferring material
properties from real-world depth images of granular formations (i.e., piles and
rings). Specifically, coefficients of sliding friction, rolling friction, and
restitution of grains are estimated from summary statistics of grain formations
using likelihood-free Bayesian inference. The calibrated simulator accurately
predicts unseen granular formations in both simulation and experiment;
furthermore, simulator predictions are shown to generalize to more complex
tasks, including using a robot to pour grains into a bowl, as well as to create
a desired pattern of piles and rings. Visualizations of the framework and
experiments can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-5Sk2TUET4.

Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
\\
  Service robots are appearing more and more in our daily life. The development
of service robots combines multiple fields of research, from object perception
to object manipulation. The state-of-the-art continues to improve to make a
proper coupling between object perception and manipulation. This coupling is
necessary for service robots not only to perform various tasks in a reasonable
amount of time but also to adapt to new environments through time and interact
with non-expert human users safely. Nowadays, robots are able to recognize
various objects, and quickly plan a collision-free trajectory to grasp a target
object. While there are many successes, the robot should be painstakingly coded
in advance to perform a set of predefined tasks. Besides, in most of the cases,
there is a reliance on large amounts of training data. Therefore, the knowledge
of such robots is fixed after the training phase, and any changes in the
environment require complicated, time-consuming, and expensive robot
re-programming by human experts. Therefore, these approaches are still too
rigid for real-life applications in unstructured environments, where a
significant portion of the environment is unknown and cannot be directly sensed
or controlled. In this paper, we review advances in service robots from object
perception to complex object manipulation and shed a light on the current
challenges and bottlenecks.

  Existing studies for environment interaction with an aerial robot have been
focused on interaction with static surroundings. However, to fully explore the
concept of an aerial manipulation, interaction with moving structures should
also be considered. In this paper, a multirotor-based aerial manipulator
opening a daily-life moving structure, a hinged door, is presented. In order to
address the constrained motion of the structure and to avoid collisions during
operation, model predictive control (MPC) is applied to the derived coupled
system dynamics between the aerial manipulator and the door involving state
constraints. By implementing a constrained version of differential dynamic
programming (DDP), MPC can generate position setpoints to the disturbance
observer (DOB)-based robust controller in real-time, which is validated by our
experimental results.

  Inspired by a couple of simple organisms without eyes, neither ears. This
paper presents a novel hybrid bionic robot, called "particle robot", which mix
a macro-organism and a micro-organism in the same robot. On one hand, an
interesting rather boring animal, the biological Echinoids (sea urchins) is
mixed with the viruses micro-organisms, in specific the rotaviruses; together
with spherical mobile robots. Analogously, from a pure robotic perspective,
this bio-inspired robot can be seen as a spherical mobile robot wearing an
actuated exoskeleton. The robot has two main configurations: when the spines
are contracted it becomes a spherical mobile robot able to move in a fast pace
on land, embedding all spherical mobile robots properties. On the other hand,
when the spines or legs are extended in a controlled pattern, it can walk on
flat surfaces as well as move on snow and over rocks as a bionic sea urchin.
The spines of the robot are telescopic linear actuators, which combines soft
and hard 3D print materials to make the actuation unit flexible for compressing
it in minimal space and rigid for lifting the robot.

  In this report for the Nasa NIAC Phase I study, we present a mission
architecture and a robotic platform, the Shapeshifter, that allow multi-domain
and redundant mobility on Saturn's moon Titan, and potentially other bodies
with atmospheres. The Shapeshifter is a collection of simple and affordable
robotic units, called Cobots, comparable to personal palm-size quadcopters. By
attaching and detaching with each other, multiple Cobots can shape-shift into
novel structures, capable of (a) rolling on the surface, to increase the
traverse range, (b) flying in a flight array formation, and (c) swimming on or
under liquid. A ground station complements the robotic platform, hosting
science instrumentation and providing power to recharge the batteries of the
Cobots. Our Phase I study had the objective of providing an initial assessment

Title: An Algorithm for Computing a Minimal Comprehensive Gr\"obner\, Basis of
  a Parametric Polynomial System
Authors: Deepak Kapur and Yiming Yang
Categories: cs.SC
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  An algorithm to generate a minimal comprehensive Gr\"obner\, basis of a
parametric polynomial system from an arbitrary faithful comprehensive
Gr\"obner\, system is presented. A basis of a parametric polynomial ideal is a
comprehensive Gr\"obner\, basis if and only if for every specialization of
parameters in a given field, the specialization of the basis is a Gr\"obner\,
basis of the associated specialized polynomial ideal. The key idea used in
ensuring minimality is that of a polynomial being essential with respect to a
comprehensive Gr\"obner\, basis. The essentiality check is performed by
determining whether a polynomial can be covered for various specializations by
other polynomials in the associated branches in a comprehensive Gr\"obner\,
system. The algorithm has been implemented and successfully tried on many
examples from the literature.

Title: Multi-Source DOA Estimation through Pattern Recognition of the Modal
  Coherence of a Reverberant Soundfield
Authors: A. Fahim, P. N. Samarasinghe, T. D. Abhayapala
Categories: cs.SD eess.AS
Journal-ref: IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing 28
  (2019) 605 - 618
DOI: 10.1109/TASLP.2019.2960734
\\
  We propose a novel multi-source direction of arrival (DOA) estimation
technique using a convolutional neural network algorithm which learns the modal
coherence patterns of an incident soundfield through measured spherical
harmonic coefficients. We train our model for individual time-frequency bins in
the short-time Fourier transform spectrum by analyzing the unique snapshot of
modal coherence for each desired direction. The proposed method is capable of
estimating simultaneously active multiple sound sources on a $3$D space using a
single-source training scheme. This single-source training scheme reduces the
training time and resource requirements as well as allows the reuse of the same
trained model for different multi-source combinations. The method is evaluated
against various simulated and practical noisy and reverberant environments with
varying acoustic criteria and found to outperform the baseline methods in terms
of DOA estimation accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm allows
independent training of azimuth and elevation during a full DOA estimation over
$3$D space which significantly improves its training efficiency without
affecting the overall estimation accuracy.

Authors: Yuan Gong, Jian Yang, Christian Poellabauer

\\
  With the rapidly growing number of security-sensitive systems that use voice
as the primary input, it becomes increasingly important to address these
systems' potential vulnerability to replay attacks. Previous efforts to address
this concern have focused primarily on single-channel audio. In this paper, we
introduce a novel neural network-based replay attack detection model that
further leverages spatial information of multi-channel audio and is able to
significantly improve the replay attack detection performance.

Title: Big Code != Big Vocabulary: Open-Vocabulary Models for Source Code
Authors: Rafael-Michael Karampatsis, Hlib Babii, Romain Robbes, Charles Sutton,

Comments: 13 pages; to appear in Proceedings of ICSE 2020
DOI: 10.1145/3377811.3380342
\\
  Statistical language modeling techniques have successfully been applied to
large source code corpora, yielding a variety of new software development
tools, such as tools for code suggestion, improving readability, and API
migration. A major issue with these techniques is that code introduces new
vocabulary at a far higher rate than natural language, as new identifier names
proliferate. Both large vocabularies and out-of-vocabulary issues severely
affect Neural Language Models (NLMs) of source code, degrading their
performance and rendering them unable to scale.
  In this paper, we address this issue by: 1) studying how various modelling
choices impact the resulting vocabulary on a large-scale corpus of 13,362
projects; 2) presenting an open vocabulary source code NLM that can scale to
such a corpus, 100 times larger than in previous work; and 3) showing that such
models outperform the state of the art on three distinct code corpora (Java, C,
Python). To our knowledge, these are the largest NLMs for code that have been
reported.
  All datasets, code, and trained models used in this work are publicly
available.

Title: Learning Nonlinear Loop Invariants with Gated Continuous Logic Networks
Authors: Jianan Yao, Gabriel Ryan, Justin Wong, Suman Jana, Ronghui Gu
Categories: cs.SE cs.LG cs.PL
\\
  In many cases, verifying real-world programs requires inferring loop
invariants with nonlinear constraints. This is especially true in programs that
perform many numerical operations, such as control systems for avionics or
industrial plants. Recently, data-driven methods for loop invariant inference
have gained popularity, especially on linear loop invariants. However, applying
data-driven inference to nonlinear invariants is challenging due to the large
numbers of and large magnitudes of high-order terms, the potential for
overfitting on samples, and the large space of possible nonlinear inequality
bounds.
  In this paper, we introduce a new neural architecture for general SMT
learning, the Gated Continuous Logic Network (G-CLN), and apply it to nonlinear
loop invariant learning. G-CLNs extend the Continuous Logic Network
architecture with gating units and dropout, which allow the model to robustly
learn general invariants over large numbers of terms. To address overfitting
that arises from finite program sampling, we introduce fractional sampling---a
sound relaxation of loop semantics to continuous functions that facilitates
unbounded sampling on the real domain. We also design a new CLN activation
function, the Piecewise Biased Quadratic Unit (PBQU), for naturally learning
tight inequality bounds.
  We incorporate these methods into a nonlinear loop invariant inference system
that can learn general nonlinear loop invariants. We evaluate our system on a
benchmark of nonlinear loop invariants and show it solves 26 out of 27
problems, 3 more than prior work, with an average runtime of 53.3 seconds. We
further demonstrate the generic learning ability of G-CLNs by solving all 124
problems in the linear Code2Inv benchmark. We also perform a quantitative
stability evaluation and show G-CLNs have a convergence rate of $97.5\%$ on
quadratic problems, a $39.2\%$ improvement over CLN models.

Title: An Exploratory Study of Bot Commits
Authors: Tapajit Dey, Bogdan Vasilescu, Audris Mockus
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Background: Bots help automate many of the tasks performed by software
developers and are widely used to commit code in various social coding
platforms. At present, it is not clear what types of activities these bots
perform and understanding it may help design better bots, and find application
areas which might benefit from bot adoption. Aim: We aim to categorize the Bot
Commits by the type of change (files added, deleted, or modified), find the
more commonly changed file types, and identify the groups of file types that
tend to get updated together. Method: 12,326,137 commits made by 461 popular
bots (that made at least 1000 commits) were examined to identify the frequency
and the type of files added/ deleted/ modified by the commits, and association
rule mining was used to identify the types of files modified together. Result:
Majority of the bot commits modify an existing file, a few of them add new
files, while deletion of a file is very rare. Commits involving more than one
type of operation are even rarer. Files containing data, configuration, and
documentation are most frequently updated, while HTML is the most common type
in terms of the number of files added, deleted, and modified. Files of the type
"Markdown", "Ignore List", "YAML", "JSON" were the types that are updated
together with other types of files most frequently. Conclusion: We observe that
majority of bot commits involve single file modifications, and bots primarily
work with data, configuration, and documentation files. A better understanding
if this is a limitation of the bots and, if overcome, would lead to different
kinds of bots remains an open question.

  The fork-based development mechanism provides the flexibility and the unified
processes for software teams to collaborate easily in a distributed setting
without too much coordination overhead.Currently, multiple social coding
platforms support fork-based development, such as GitHub, GitLab, and
Bitbucket. Although these different platforms virtually share the same
features, they have different emphasis. As GitHub is the most popular platform
and the corresponding data is publicly available, most of the current studies
are focusing on GitHub hosted projects. However, we observed anecdote evidences
that people are confused about choosing among these platforms, and some
projects are migrating from one platform to another, and the reasons behind
these activities remain unknown.With the advances of Software Heritage Graph
Dataset (SWHGD),we have the opportunity to investigate the forking activities
across platforms. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study on 10popular
open-source projects to identify cross-platform forks and investigate the
motivation behind. Preliminary result shows that cross-platform forks do exist.
For the 10 subject systems in this study, we found 81,357 forks in total among
which 179 forks are on GitLab. Based on our qualitative analysis, we found that
most of the cross-platform forks that we identified are mirrors of the
repositories on another platform, but we still find cases that were created due
to preference of using certain functionalities (e.g. Continuous Integration
(CI)) supported by different platforms. This study lays the foundation of
future research directions, such as understanding the differences between
platforms and supporting cross-platform collaboration.

Title: Improving the Robustness to Data Inconsistency between Training and
  Testing for Code Completion by Hierarchical Language Model
Authors: Yixiao Yang
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  In the field of software engineering, applying language models to the token
sequence of source code is the state-of-art approach to build a code
recommendation system. The syntax tree of source code has hierarchical
structures. Ignoring the characteristics of tree structures decreases the model
performance. Current LSTM model handles sequential data. The performance of
LSTM model will decrease sharply if the noise unseen data is distributed
everywhere in the test suite. As code has free naming conventions, it is common
for a model trained on one project to encounter many unknown words on another
project. If we set many unseen words as UNK just like the solution in natural
language processing, the number of UNK will be much greater than the sum of the
most frequently appeared words. In an extreme case, just predicting UNK at
everywhere may achieve very high prediction accuracy. Thus, such solution
cannot reflect the true performance of a model when encountering noise unseen
data. In this paper, we only mark a small number of rare words as UNK and show
the prediction performance of models under in-project and cross-project
evaluation. We propose a novel Hierarchical Language Model (HLM) to improve the
robustness of LSTM model to gain the capacity about dealing with the
inconsistency of data distribution between training and testing. The newly
proposed HLM takes the hierarchical structure of code tree into consideration
to predict code. HLM uses BiLSTM to generate embedding for sub-trees according
to hierarchies and collects the embedding of sub-trees in context to predict
next code. The experiments on inner-project and cross-project data sets
indicate that the newly proposed Hierarchical Language Model (HLM) performs
better than the state-of-art LSTM model in dealing with the data inconsistency
between training and testing and achieves averagely 11.2\% improvement in
prediction accuracy.

Title: Automated synthesis of local time requirement for service composition

Comments: This is a pre-print of an article published in the International
  Journal on Software and Systems Modeling (SoSyM)
DOI: 10.1007/s10270-020-00787-5
\\
  Service composition aims at achieving a business goal by composing existing
service-based applications or components. The response time of a service is
crucial especially in time critical business environments, which is often
stated as a clause in service level agreements between service providers and
service users. To meet the guaranteed response time requirement of a composite
service, it is important to select a feasible set of component services such
that their response time will collectively satisfy the response time
requirement of the composite service. In this work, we use the BPEL modeling
language, that aims at specifying Web services. We extend it with timing
parameters, and equip it with a formal semantics. Then, we propose a fully
automated approach to synthesize the response time requirement of component
services modeled using BPEL, in the form of a constraint on the local response
times. The synthesized requirement will guarantee the satisfaction of the
global response time requirement, statically or dynamically. We implemented our
work into a tool, Selamat, and performed several experiments to evaluate the
validity of our approach.

Title: Model-Based User Interface Design for Generating E-Forms in the Context

Authors: Bedir Tekinerdogan, Namik Aktekin
Categories: cs.SE
Comments: 24 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables
\\
  We report on our experiences in an e-government project for supporting the
automatic generation of E-forms for services provided by local governments. The
approach requires the integration of both the model-based user interface design
(MBUID) and software product line engineering approaches. During the domain
engineering activity the commonality and variability of product services is
modeled using feature diagrams and the corresponding UI models are defined. To
support the automation of e-forms the implemented feature models are on their
turn used to generate E-forms automatically to enhance productivity, increase
quality and reduce cost of development. We have developed three different
approaches for e-form generation in increasing complexity: (1) offline model
transformation without interaction (2) model transformation with initial
interaction (3) model-transformation with run-time interaction. We discuss the
lessons learned and propose a systematic approach for defining model
transformations that is based on an interactive paradigm.

\\
  The data collected from open source projects provide means to model large
software ecosystems, but often suffer from data quality issues, specifically,
multiple author identification strings in code commits might actually be
associated with one developer. While many methods have been proposed for
addressing this problem, they are either heuristics requiring manual tweaking,
or require too much calculation time to do pairwise comparisons for 38M author
IDs in, for example, the World of Code collection. In this paper, we propose a
method that finds all author IDs belonging to a single developer in this entire
dataset, and share the list of all author IDs that were found to have aliases.
To do this, we first create blocks of potentially connected author IDs and then
use a machine learning model to predict which of these potentially related IDs
belong to the same developer. We processed around 38 million author IDs and
found around 14.8 million IDs to have an alias, which belong to 5.4 million
different developers, with the median number of aliases being 2 per developer.
This dataset can be used to create more accurate models of developer behaviour
at the entire OSS ecosystem level and can be used to provide a service to
rapidly resolve new author IDs.

Title: Constraint Solving with Deep Learning for Symbolic Execution
Authors: Junye Wen, Mujahid Khan, Meiru Che, Yan Yan, Guowei Yang
Categories: cs.SE
\\
  Symbolic execution is a powerful systematic software analysis technique, but
suffers from the high cost of constraint solving, which is the key supporting
technology that affects the effectiveness of symbolic execution. Techniques
like Green and GreenTrie reuse constraint solutions to speed up constraint
solving for symbolic execution; however, these reuse techniques require
syntactic/semantic equivalence or implication relationship between constraints.
This paper introduces DeepSover, a novel approach to constraint solving with
deep learning for symbolic execution. Our key insight is to utilize the
collective knowledge of a set of constraint solutions to train a deep neural
network, which is then used to classify path conditions for their
satisfiability during symbolic execution. Experimental evaluation shows
DeepSolver is highly accurate in classifying path conditions, is more efficient
than state-of-the-art constraint solving and constraint solution reuse
techniques, and can well support symbolic execution tasks.

Categories: cs.SI
Comments: Working paper
\\
  Online search data are routinely used to monitor the prevalence of infectious
diseases, such as influenza. Previous work has focused on developing supervised
models, where ground truth data, in the form of historical syndromic
surveillance reports, can be used to train machine learning models. However, no
sufficient data -- in terms of accuracy and time span -- exist to apply such
approaches for monitoring the emerging COVID-19 infectious disease pandemic
caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, unsupervised, or
semi-supervised solutions should be sought. Recent outcomes have shown that it
is possible to transfer an online search based model for influenza-like illness
from a source to a target country without using ground truth data for the
target location. The transferred model's accuracy depends on choosing search
queries and their corresponding weights wisely, via a transfer learning
methodology, for the target location. In this work, we draw a parallel to
previous findings and attempt to develop an unsupervised model for COVID-19 by:
(i) carefully choosing search queries that refer to related symptoms as
identified by Public Health England in the United Kingdom (UK), and (ii)
weighting them based on their reported ratio of occurrence in people infected
by COVID-19. Finally, understanding that online searches may be also driven by
concern rather than infections, we devise a preliminary approach that aims to
minimise this part of the signal by incorporating a news media signal in
association with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Results are presented for the UK,
England, United States of America, Canada, Australia, and Greece.

  A novel social networks sentiment analysis model is proposed based on Twitter
sentiment score (TSS) for real-time prediction of the future stock market price
FTSE 100, as compared with conventional econometric models of investor
sentiment based on closed-end fund discount (CEFD). The proposed TSS model
features a new baseline correlation approach, which not only exhibits a decent
prediction accuracy, but also reduces the computation burden and enables a fast
decision making without the knowledge of historical data. Polynomial
regression, classification modelling and lexicon-based sentiment analysis are
performed using R. The obtained TSS predicts the future stock market trend in
advance by 15 time samples (30 working hours) with an accuracy of 67.22% using
the proposed baseline criterion without referring to historical TSS or market
data. Specifically, TSS's prediction performance of an upward market is found
far better than that of a downward market. Under the logistic regression and
linear discriminant analysis, the accuracy of TSS in predicting the upward
trend of the future market achieves 97.87%.

  It remains unknown whether personalized recommendations increase or decrease
the diversity of content people consume. We present results from a randomized
field experiment on Spotify testing the effect of personalized recommendations
on consumption diversity. In the experiment, both control and treatment users
were given podcast recommendations, with the sole aim of increasing podcast
consumption. Treatment users' recommendations were personalized based on their
music listening history, whereas control users were recommended popular
podcasts among users in their demographic group. We find that, on average, the
treatment increased podcast streams by 28.90%. However, the treatment also
decreased the average individual-level diversity of podcast streams by 11.51%,
and increased the aggregate diversity of podcast streams by 5.96%, indicating
that personalized recommendations have the potential to create patterns of
consumption that are homogenous within and diverse across users, a pattern
reflecting Balkanization. Our results provide evidence of an
"engagement-diversity trade-off" when recommendations are optimized solely to
drive consumption: while personalized recommendations increase user engagement,
they also affect the diversity of consumed content. This shift in consumption
diversity can affect user retention and lifetime value, and impact the optimal
strategy for content producers. We also observe evidence that our treatment
affected streams from sections of Spotify's app not directly affected by the
experiment, suggesting that exposure to personalized recommendations can affect
the content that users consume organically. We believe these findings highlight
the need for academics and practitioners to continue investing in
personalization methods that explicitly take into account the diversity of
content recommended.

Title: Network disruption: maximizing disagreement and polarization in social
  networks
Authors: Mayee Chen and Miklos Z. Racz
Categories: cs.SI cs.DS cs.GT physics.soc-ph
Comments: 20 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Recent years have seen a marked increase in the spread of misinformation, a
phenomenon which has been accelerated and amplified by social media such as
Facebook and Twitter. While some actors spread misinformation to push a
specific agenda, it has also been widely documented that others aim to simply
disrupt the network by increasing disagreement and polarization across the
network and thereby destabilizing society. Popular social networks are also
vulnerable to large-scale attacks. Motivated by this reality, we introduce a
simple model of network disruption where an adversary can take over a limited
number of user profiles in a social network with the aim of maximizing
disagreement and/or polarization in the network.
  We investigate this model both theoretically and empirically. We show that
the adversary will always change the opinion of a taken-over profile to an
extreme in order to maximize disruption. We also prove that an adversary can
increase disagreement / polarization at most linearly in the number of user
profiles it takes over. Furthermore, we present a detailed empirical study of
several natural algorithms for the adversary on both synthetic networks and
real world (Reddit and Twitter) data sets. These show that even simple,
unsophisticated heuristics, such as targeting centrists, can disrupt a network
effectively, causing a large increase in disagreement / polarization. Studying
the problem of network disruption through the lens of an adversary thus
highlights the seriousness of the problem.

Title: Longitudinal Control of Vehicles in Traffic Microsimulation
Authors: Shirin Noei, Xilei Zhao, Carl D. Crane
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 26 pages, 11 figures
\\
  Current state-of-art traffic microsimulation tools cannot accurately estimate
safety, efficiency, and mobility benefits of automated driving systems and
vehicle connectivity because of not considering physical and powertrain
characteristics of vehicles and resistance forces. This paper proposes
realistic longitudinal control functions for autonomous vehicles with and
without vehicle-to-vehicle communications and a realistic vehicle-following
model for human-driven vehicles, considering driver characteristics and vehicle
dynamics. Conventional longitudinal control functions apply a constant time gap
policy and use empirical constant controller coefficients, potentially
sacrificing safety or reducing throughput. Proposed longitudinal control
functions calculate minimum safe time gaps at each simulation time step and

Title: Neural Networks for Encoding Dynamic Security-Constrained Optimal Power
  Flow to Mixed-Integer Linear Programs

\\
  This paper introduces a framework to capture previously intractable
optimization constraints and transform them to a mixed-integer linear program,
through the use of neural networks. We encode the feasible space of
optimization problems characterized by both tractable and intractable
constraints, e.g. differential equations, to a neural network. Leveraging an
exact mixed-integer reformulation of neural networks, we solve mixed-integer
linear programs that accurately approximate solutions to the originally
intractable non-linear optimization problem. We apply our methods to the AC
optimal power flow problem (AC-OPF), where directly including dynamic security
constraints renders the AC-OPF intractable. Our proposed approach has the
potential to be significantly more scalable than traditional approaches. We
demonstrate our approach for power system operation considering N-1 security
and small-signal stability, showing how it can efficiently obtain cost-optimal
solutions which at the same time satisfy both static and dynamic security
constraints.

\\
  This paper studies the attack detection problem in a data-driven and
model-free setting, for deterministic systems with linear and time-invariant
dynamics. Differently from existing studies that leverage knowledge of the
system dynamics to derive security bounds and monitoring schemes, we focus on
the case where the system dynamics, as well as the attack strategy and attack
location, are unknown. We derive fundamental security limitations as a function
of only the observed data and without estimating the system dynamics (in fact,
no assumption is made on the identifiability of the system). In particular, (i)
we derive detection limitations as a function of the informativity and length
of the observed data, (ii) provide a data-driven characterization of
undetectable attacks, and (iii) construct a data-driven detection monitor.
Surprisingly, and in accordance with recent studies on data-driven control, our
results show that model-based and data-driven security techniques share the
same fundamental limitations, provided that the collected data remains
sufficiently informative.

  This manuscript presents an algorithm for individual Lithium-ion (Li-ion)
battery cell state of charge (SOC) estimation when multiple cells are connected
in parallel, using only terminal voltage and total current measurements. For
battery packs consisting of thousands of cells, it is desirable to estimate
individual SOCs by only monitoring the total current in order to reduce sensing
cost. Mathematically, series connected cells yield dynamics given by ordinary
differential equations under classical full voltage sensing. In contrast,
parallel connected cells are evidently more challenging because the dynamics
are governed by a nonlinear descriptor system, including differential equations
and algebraic equations arising from voltage and current balance across cells.
An observer with linear output error injection is formulated, where the
individual cell SOCs and local currents are locally observable from the total
current and voltage measurements. The asymptotic convergence of differential
and algebraic states is established by considering local Lipschitz continuity
property of system nonlinearities. Simulation results on LiNiMnCoO$_2$/Graphite
(NMC) cells illustrate convergence for SOCs, local currents, and terminal
voltage.

Title: Tight Decomposition Functions for Continuous-Time Mixed-Monotone Systems
  with Disturbances
Authors: Matthew Abate, Maxence Dutreix, and Samuel Coogan
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY math.DS
Comments: 6 pages. 2 figures. Submitted to Control Systems Letters (L-CSS)
\\
  The vector field of a mixed-monotone system is decomposable via a
decomposition function into increasing (cooperative) and decreasing
(competitive) components, and this decomposition allows for, e.g., efficient
computation of reachable sets and forward invariant sets. A main challenge in
this approach, however, is identifying an appropriate decomposition function.
In this work, we show that any continuous-time dynamical system with Lipshitz
continuous vector field is mixed-monotone, and we provide an explicit
construction for the decomposition function that provides the tightest
approximation of reachable sets possible with the theory of mixed-monotonicity.
Our construction is similar to that recently proposed by Yang and Ozay for
computing decomposition functions of discrete-time systems where we make
appropriate modifications for the continuous-time setting and also extend to
the case with unknown disturbance inputs. As in Yang and Ozay's work, our
decomposition function construction requires solving an optimization problem
for each point in the state-space; however, we demonstrate through two examples
how tight decomposition functions can be calculated in closed form. As a second
contribution, we show how under-approximations of reachable sets can be
efficiently computed via the mixed-monotonicity property by considering the
backward time dynamics. We demonstrate our results with an example and a case
study.

Title: Distributed Small-Signal Stability Conditions for Inverter-Based
  Unbalanced Microgrids
Authors: Sai Pushpak Nandanoori, Soumya Kundu, Wei Du, Francis Tuffner and
  Kevin Schneider
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: This paper is accepted in IEEE Transactions on Power Systems
\\
  The proliferation of inverter-based generation and advanced sensing,
controls, and communication infrastructure have facilitated the accelerated
deployment of microgrids. A coordinated network of microgrids can maintain
reliable power delivery to critical facilities during extreme events. Low
inertia offered by the power electronics interfaced energy resources however,
can present significant challenges to ensuring stable operation of the
microgrids. In this work, distributed small-signal stability conditions for
inverter-based microgrids are developed that involve the droop controller
parameters and the network parameters such as line impedances, loads, etc. The
distributed closed-form parametric stability conditions derived in this paper
can be verified in a computationally efficient manner, facilitating the
reliable design and operations of networks of microgrids. Dynamic phasor models
have been used to capture the effects of electromagnetic transients. Numerical
results are presented, along with PSCAD simulations, to validate the analytical
stability conditions. Effects of design choices, such as the conductor types,
and inverter sizes, on the small-signal stability of inverter-based microgrids
are investigated to identify interpretable stable or unstable region estimates.

Title: A Unified Multi-scale and Multi-task Learning Framework for Driver
  Behaviors Reasoning
Authors: Yang Xing, Chen Lv, Wenshuo Wang, Dongpu Cao, Efstathios Velenis
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY eess.IV eess.SP
\\
  Mutual understanding between driver and vehicle is critically important to
the design of intelligent vehicles and customized interaction interface. In
this study, a unified driver behavior reasoning system toward multi-scale and
multi-tasks behavior recognition is proposed. Specifically, a multi-scale
driver behavior recognition system is designed to recognize both the driver's
physical and mental states based on a deep encoder-decoder framework. This
system can jointly recognize three driver behaviors with different time scales
based on the shared encoder network. Driver body postures and mental behaviors
include intention and emotion are studied and identified. The encoder network
is designed based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), and several
decoders for different driver states estimation are proposed with fully
connected (FC) and long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural
networks (RNN). The joint feature learning with the CNN encoder increases the
computational efficiency and feature diversity, while the customized decoders
enable an efficient multi-tasks inference. The proposed framework can be used
as a solution to exploit the relationship between different driver states, and
it is found that when drivers generate lane change intentions, their emotions
usually keep neutral state and more focus on the task. Two naturalistic
datasets are used to investigate the model performance, which is a local
highway dataset, namely, CranData and one public dataset from Brain4Cars. The
testing results on these two datasets show accurate performance and outperform
existing methods on driver postures, intention, and emotion recognition.

Title: A Control Barrier Perspective on Episodic Learning via
  Projection-to-State Safety
Authors: Andrew J. Taylor, Andrew Singletary, Yisong Yue, Aaron D. Ames
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 6 pages, 2 figures, submitted to L-CSS + CDC 2020
\\
  In this paper we seek to quantify the ability of learning to improve safety
guarantees endowed by Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). In particular, we
investigate how model uncertainty in the time derivative of a CBF can be
reduced via learning, and how this leads to stronger statements on the safe
behavior of a system. To this end, we build upon the idea of Input-to-State
Safety (ISSf) to define Projection-to-State Safety (PSSf), which characterizes
degradation in safety in terms of a projected disturbance. This enables the
direct quantification of both how learning can improve safety guarantees, and
how bounds on learning error translate to bounds on degradation in safety. We
demonstrate that a practical episodic learning approach can use PSSf to reduce
uncertainty and improve safety guarantees in simulation and experimentally.

Title: Generating Socially Acceptable Perturbations for Efficient Evaluation of
  Autonomous Vehicles
Authors: Songan Zhang, Huei Peng, Subramanya Nageshrao and H. Eric Tseng
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
\\
  Deep reinforcement learning methods have been widely used in recent years for
autonomous vehicle's decision-making. A key issue is that deep neural networks
can be fragile to adversarial attacks or other unseen inputs. In this paper, we
address the latter issue: we focus on generating socially acceptable
perturbations (SAP), so that the autonomous vehicle (AV agent), instead of the
challenging vehicle (attacker), is primarily responsible for the crash. In our
process, one attacker is added to the environment and trained by deep
reinforcement learning to generate the desired perturbation. The reward is
designed so that the attacker aims to fail the AV agent in a socially
acceptable way. After training the attacker, the agent policy is evaluated in
both the original naturalistic environment and the environment with one
attacker. The results show that the agent policy which is safe in the
naturalistic environment has many crashes in the perturbed environment.

Title: A hybrid learning method for system identification and optimal control
Authors: Baptiste Schubnel, Rafael E. Carrillo, Pierre-Jean Alet, Andreas
  Hutter
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 15 pages, submitted
\\
  We present a three-step method to perform system identification and optimal
control of non-linear systems. Our approach is mainly data driven and does not
require active excitation of the system to perform system identification. In
particular, it is designed for systems for which only historical data under
closed-loop control are available and where historical control commands exhibit
low variability. In a first step, simple simulation models of the system are
built and run under various conditions. In a second step, a neural network
architecture is extensively trained on the simulation outputs to learn the
system physics, and retrained with historical data from the real system with
stopping rules. These constraints avoid over-fitting that arise by fitting
closed-loop controlled systems. By doing so, we obtain one (or many) system
model(s), represented by this architecture, and whose behavior can be chosen to
match more or less the real system. Finally, state-of-the-art reinforcement
learning with a variant of domain randomization and distributed learning is
used for optimal control of the system. We first illustrate the model
identification strategy with a simple example, the pendulum with external
torque. We then apply our method to model and optimize the control of a large
building facility located in Switzerland. Simulation results demonstrate that
this approach generates stable functional controllers which outperform on
comfort and energy benchmark rule-based controllers.

Title: Distributed Control of Multi-zone HVAC Systems Considering Indoor Air
  Quality
Authors: Yu Yang, Seshadhri Srinivasan, Guoqiang Hu, Costas J. Spanos
Categories: eess.SY cs.SY
Comments: 12 pages, 12 figures
\\
  This investigation studies a scalable control method for multi-zone heating,
ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems with the objective to reduce
energy cost while satisfying thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ)
(represented by CO2) simultaneously. This problem is challenging as we need to
cope with the complex system behaviours, various couplings and the conflicting
nature of objectives and constraints. To address the computational challenges,
we propose a two-level distributed method (TLDM) by exploring the problem
structures. Specifically, the upper level control (ULC) computes the optimal
zone mass flow rates for maintaining zone thermal comfort, and the lower level
control (LLC) regulates zone mass flow rates calculated from the upper level
and the ventilation rate to achieve IAQ. As both the upper and lower level
subproblems can be solved in a distributed manner w.r.t the zones, the proposed
method is scalable and computationally efficient. The sub-optimality of the
method is demonstrated through comparison with centralized method in a
benchmark. Through comparison with the distributed-based scheduling strategy
(DTBSS) for HVAC control [1] which hasn't been able to involve IAQ, we find
that the proposed method can achieve both thermal comfort and IAQ with a slight
increase of energy cost. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the
commonly-used demand controlled ventilation strategies (DCVs) for IAQ
management [2, 3]. The numeric results imply an 8-10% energy cost saving for
the proposed method

Title: A Predictor-Corrector Type Algorithm for the Pseudospectral Abscissa
  Computation of Time-Delay Systems

Comments: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.04737

DOI: 10.1016/j.automatica.2010.01.032
\\
  The pseudospectrum of a linear time-invariant system is the set in the
complex plane consisting of all the roots of the characteristic equation when
the system matrices are subjected to all possible perturbations with a given
upper bound. The pseudospectral abscissa is defined as the maximum real part of
the characteristic roots in the pseudospectrum and, therefore, it is for
instance important from a robust stability point of view. In this paper we
present an accurate method for the computation of the pseudospectral abscissa
of retarded delay differential equations with discrete pointwise delays. Our
approach is based on the connections between the pseudospectrum and the level
sets of an appropriately defined complex function. The computation is done in
two steps. In the prediction step, an approximation of the pseudospectral
abscissa is obtained based on a rational approximation of the characteristic
matrix and the application of a bisection algorithm. Each step in this
bisection algorithm relies on checking the presence of the imaginary axis
eigenvalues of a complex matrix, similar to the delay free case. In the
corrector step, the approximate pseudospectral abscissa is corrected to any
given accuracy, by solving a set of nonlinear equations that characterize
extreme points in the pseudospectrum contours.

Comments: 6
\\
  We present an integrated approach for perception and control for an
autonomous vehicle and demonstrate this approach in a high-fidelity urban
driving simulator. Our approach first builds a model for the environment, then
trains a policy exploiting the learned model to identify the action to take at
each time-step. To build a model for the environment, we leverage several deep
learning algorithms. To that end, first we train a variational autoencoder to
encode the input image into an abstract latent representation. We then utilize
a recurrent neural network to predict the latent representation of the next
frame and handle temporal information. Finally, we utilize an
evolutionary-based reinforcement learning algorithm to train a controller based
on these latent representations to identify the action to take. We evaluate our
approach in CARLA, a high-fidelity urban driving simulator, and conduct an
extensive generalization study. Our results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms several previously reported approaches in terms of the percentage
of successfully completed episodes for a lane keeping task.

Title: Simulated annealing based heuristic for multiple agile satellites
  scheduling under cloud coverage uncertainty
Authors: Chao Han, Yi Gu, Guohua Wu, Xinwei Wang
Categories: eess.SP cs.AI physics.space-ph
\\
  Agile satellites are the new generation of Earth observation satellites
(EOSs) with stronger attitude maneuvering capability. Since optical remote
sensing instruments equipped on satellites cannot see through the cloud, the
cloud coverage has a significant influence on the satellite observation
missions. We are the first to address multiple agile EOSs scheduling problem
under cloud coverage uncertainty where the objective aims to maximize the
entire observation profit. The chance constraint programming model is adopted
to describe the uncertainty initially, and the observation profit under cloud
coverage uncertainty is then calculated via sample approximation method.
Subsequently, an improved simulated annealing based heuristic combining a fast
insertion strategy is proposed for large-scale observation missions. The
experimental results show that the improved simulated annealing heuristic
outperforms other algorithms for the multiple AEOSs scheduling problem under
cloud coverage uncertainty, which verifies the efficiency and effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm.

\\
  During the COVID-19 outbreak, it is essential to monitor the effectiveness of
measures taken by governments on the course of the epidemic. Here we show that
there is already a sufficient amount of data collected in Italy to predict the
outcome of the process. We show that using the proper metric, the data from
Hubei Province and Italy has striking similarity, which enables us to calculate
the expected number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths by the end of
the process. Our predictions will improve as new data points are generated day
by day, which can help to make further public decisions. The method is based on
the data analysis of logistic growth equations describing the process on the
macroscopic level. At the time of writing, the number of fatalities in Italy is
expected to be 6000, and the crisis ends before April 15, 2020.

Title: Inference of Gas-liquid Flowrate using Neural Networks
Authors: Akshay J. Dave (1), Annalisa Manera (2) ((1) Massachusetts Institute
  of Technology, (2) University of Michigan Ann-Arbor)
Categories: physics.flu-dyn cs.CE
\\
  The metering of gas-liquid flows is difficult due to the non-linear
relationship between flow regimes and fluid properties, flow orientation,
channel geometry, etc. In fact, a majority of commercial multiphase flow meters
have a low accuracy, limited range of operation or require a physical
separation of the phases. We introduce the inference of gas-liquid flowrates
using a neural network model that is trained by wire-mesh sensor (WMS)
experimental data. The WMS is an experimental tool that records high-resolution
high-frequency 3D void fraction distributions in gas-liquid flows. The
experimental database utilized spans over two orders of superficial velocity
magnitude and multiple flow regimes for a vertical small-diameter pipe. Our
findings indicate that a single network can provide accurate and precise
inference with below a 7.5% MAP error across all flow regimes. The best
performing networks have a combination of a 3D-Convolution head, and an LSTM
tail. The finding indicates that the spatiotemporal features observed in
gas-liquid flows can be systematically decomposed and used for inferring
phase-wise flowrate. Our method does not involve any complex pre-processing of
the void fraction matrices, resulting in an evaluation time that is negligible
when contrasted to the input time-span. The efficiency of the model manifests
in a response time two orders of magnitude lower than the current
state-of-the-art.

Title: Site2Vec: a reference frame invariant algorithm for vector embedding of
  protein-ligand binding sites
Authors: Arnab Bhadra and Kalidas Y
Categories: q-bio.BM cs.CG cs.LG
\\
  Protein-ligand interaction is one of the fundamental molecular interactions
of living systems. Proteins are the building blocks of functions in life at the
molecular level. Ligands are small molecules that interact with proteins at
specific regions on the surface of proteins called binding sites. Understanding
the physicochemical properties of ligand-binding sites is very important in the
field of drug discovery as well as understanding biological systems.
Protein-ligand binding site plays an essential role in the interaction between
protein and ligand that is necessary for any living system to survive.
Comparing similarities between binding sites has been one of the main focus
areas since the last decade in bioinformatics and drug discovery. In this
regard, several computational methods have been developed to compare binding
sites so far. Binding site comparison requires fast and efficient method as the
amount of three-dimensional protein structural information is increasing
rapidly nowadays. We report in this study, development of Site2Vec, a novel
machine learning-based method for reference frame invariant ligand-independent
vector embedding of the 3D structure of a protein-ligand binding site. Each
binding site is represented in a $d$-dimensional vector form. The 3D structures
of binding sites are mapped to vector form such that similar binding sites hash
into proximal localities, and dissimilar sites fall across diverse regions. A
sensitivity analysis of rotation and perturbation and validation study is
performed to understand the behavior of the method. Benchmarking exercises have
been carried out against state of the art binding site comparison methods on
state of the art datasets. The exercises validate our proposed method and
demonstrate that the proposed method is rotationally invariant and can handle
natural perturbations expected in the biological system.

Title: Deliberation Model Based Two-Pass End-to-End Speech Recognition

Categories: eess.AS cs.CL cs.SD
\\
  End-to-end (E2E) models have made rapid progress in automatic speech
recognition (ASR) and perform competitively relative to conventional models. To
further improve the quality, a two-pass model has been proposed to rescore
streamed hypotheses using the non-streaming Listen, Attend and Spell (LAS)
model while maintaining a reasonable latency. The model attends to acoustics to
rescore hypotheses, as opposed to a class of neural correction models that use
only first-pass text hypotheses. In this work, we propose to attend to both
acoustics and first-pass hypotheses using a deliberation network. A
bidirectional encoder is used to extract context information from first-pass
hypotheses. The proposed deliberation model achieves 12% relative WER reduction
compared to LAS rescoring in Google Voice Search (VS) tasks, and 23% reduction
on a proper noun test set. Compared to a large conventional model, our best
model performs 21% relatively better for VS. In terms of computational
complexity, the deliberation decoder has a larger size than the LAS decoder,
and hence requires more computations in second-pass decoding.

  Environmental Remote Sensing
Authors: M. Kiani
Categories: eess.IV cs.CV

\\
  In this paper a new method of image smoothing for satellite imagery and its
applications in environmental remote sensing are presented. This method is
based on the global gradient minimization over the whole image. With respect to
the image discrete identity, the continuous minimization problem is
discretized. Using the finite difference numerical method of differentiation, a
simple yet efficient 5*5-pixel template is derived. Convolution of the derived
template with the image in different bands results in the discrimination of
various image elements. This method is extremely fast, besides being highly
precise. A case study is presented for the northern Iran, covering parts of the
Caspian Sea. Comparison of the method with the usual Laplacian template reveals
that it is more capable of distinguishing phenomena in the image.

Title: Weakly Supervised PET Tumor Detection UsingClass Response

\\
  One of the most challenges in medical imaging is the lack of data and
annotated data. It is proven that classical segmentation methods such as U-NET
are useful but still limited due to the lack of annotated data. Using a weakly
supervised learning is a promising way to address this problem, however, it is
challenging to train one model to detect and locate efficiently different type
of lesions due to the huge variation in images. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to locate different type of lesions in positron emission
tomography (PET) images using only a class label at the image-level. First, a
simple convolutional neural network classifier is trained to predict the type
of cancer on two 2D MIP images. Then, a pseudo-localization of the tumor is
generated using class activation maps, back-propagated and corrected in a
multitask learning approach with prior knowledge, resulting in a tumor
detection mask. Finally, we use the mask generated from the two 2D images to
detect the tumor in the 3D image. The advantage of our proposed method consists
of detecting the whole tumor volume in 3D images, using only two 2D images of
PET image, and showing a very promising results. It can be used as a tool to
locate very efficiently tumors in a PET scan, which is a time-consuming task
for physicians. In addition, we show that our proposed method can be used to
conduct a radiomics study with state of the art results.

Title: 3D Dynamic Point Cloud Denoising via Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning
Authors: Wei Hu, Qianjiang Hu, Zehua Wang, Xiang Gao

\\
  The prevalence of accessible depth sensing and 3D laser scanning techniques
has enabled the convenient acquisition of 3D dynamic point clouds, which
provide efficient representation of arbitrarily-shaped objects in motion.
Nevertheless, dynamic point clouds are often perturbed by noise due to
hardware, software or other causes. While a plethora of methods have been
proposed for static point cloud denoising, few efforts are made for the
denoising of dynamic point clouds with varying number of irregularly-sampled
points in each frame. In this paper, we represent dynamic point clouds
naturally on graphs and address the denoising problem by inferring the
underlying graph via spatio-temporal graph learning, exploiting both the
intra-frame similarity and inter-frame consistency. Firstly, assuming the
availability of a relevant feature vector per node, we pose spatial-temporal
graph learning as optimizing a Mahalanobis distance metric M, which is
formulated as the minimization of graph Laplacian regularizer. Secondly, to
ease the optimization of the symmetric and positive definite metric matrix M,
we decompose it into M = R'*R and solve R instead via proximal gradient.
Finally, based on the spatial-temporal graph learning, we formulate dynamic
point cloud denoising as the joint optimization of the desired point cloud and
underlying spatio-temporal graph, which leverages both intra-frame affinities
and inter-frame consistency and is solved via alternating minimization.
Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms
independent denoising of each frame from state-of-the-art static point cloud
denoising approaches.

Title: Towards Peer-to-Peer Energy Market: an Overview
Authors: Ramon Christen, Luca Mazzola and Alexander Denzler
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.CY
\\
  This paper provides an overview of the current status of the energy market,
with respect to the increasing number of decentralised prosumer. After
outlining the limitations imposed by the status quo, a possible multi-layered
architecture of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy market is introduced. The
fundamental aspects of local production and local consumption as part of a
microgrid are discussed. Changes in roles and some incentive models connected
with decentralisation are discussed and motivated. To give the reader a feeling
of it, a typical P2P settlement is explained. Also relevant elements of
trading, such as Smart contract and grid stability are presented to the reader.
Being this a work in progress, many open questions are still on the table and
will be addressed in the next stages of the research.

Title: How social feedback processing in the brain shapes collective opinion

\\
  What are the mechanisms by which groups with certain opinions gain public
voice and force others holding a different view into silence? And how does
social media play into this? Drawing on recent neuro-scientific insights into
the processing of social feedback, we develop a theoretical model that allows
to address these questions. The model captures phenomena described by spiral of
silence theory of public opinion, provides a mechanism-based foundation for it,
and allows in this way more general insight into how different group structures
relate to different regimes of collective opinion expression. Even strong
majorities can be forced into silence if a minority acts as a cohesive whole.
The proposed framework of social feedback theory (SFT) highlights the need for
sociological theorising to understand the societal-level implications of
findings in social and cognitive neuroscience.

Title: Gradient Estimation for Federated Learning over Massive MIMO
  Communication Systems
Authors: Yo-Seb Jeon, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri, Jun Li, and H. Vincent Poor
Categories: eess.SP cs.DC cs.LG
\\
  Federated learning is a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving
solution to train a global model through the collaboration of multiple devices
each with its own local training data set. In this paper, we consider federated
learning over massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication
systems in which wireless devices train a global model with the aid of a
central server equipped with a massive antenna array. One major challenge is to
design a reception technique at the central sever to accurately estimate local
gradient vectors sent from the wireless devices. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a novel gradient-estimation algorithm that exploits the sparsity of the
local gradient vectors. Inspired by the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm
in compressive sensing, the proposed algorithm iteratively finds the devices
with non-zero gradient values while estimating the transmitted signal based on
the linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) method. Meanwhile, the stopping
criterion of the proposed algorithm is designed by deriving an analytical
threshold for the estimation error of the transmitted signal. We also analyze
the computational complexity reduction of the proposed algorithm over a simple
LMMSE method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
performs very close to centralized learning, while providing a better
performance-complexity tradeoff than linear beamforming methods.

Title: From Sensor to Processing Networks: Optimal Estimation with Computation

\\
  This paper investigates the use of a networked system ($e.g.$, swarm of
robots, smart grid, sensor network) to monitor a time-varying phenomenon of
interest in the presence of communication and computation latency. Recent
advances in edge computing have enabled processing to be spread across the
network, hence we investigate the fundamental computation-communication
trade-off, arising when a sensor has to decide whether to transmit raw data
(incurring communication delay) or preprocess them (incurring computational
delay) in order to compute an accurate estimate of the state of the phenomenon
of interest. We propose two key contributions. First, we formalize the notion
of $processing$ $network$. Contrarily to $sensor$ $and$ $communication$
$networks$, where the designer is concerned with the design of a suitable
communication policy, in a processing network one can also control when and
where the computation occurs in the network. The second contribution is to
provide analytical results on the optimal preprocessing delay ($i.e.$, the
optimal time spent on computations at each sensor) for the case with a single
sensor and multiple homogeneous sensors. Numerical results substantiate our
claims that accounting for computation latencies (both at sensor and estimator
side) and communication delays can largely impact the estimation accuracy.

Title: Colorings of complements of line graphs
Authors: Hamid Reza Daneshpajouh, Fr\'ed\'eric Meunier, and Guilhem Mizrahi
Categories: math.CO cs.DM
MSC-class: 05C15
ACM-class: G.2.2
\\
  Our purpose is to show that complements of line graphs enjoy nice coloring
properties. We show that for all graphs in this class the local and usual
chromatic numbers are equal. We also prove a sufficient condition for the
chromatic number to be equal with a natural upper bound. A consequence of this
latter condition is a complete characterization of all induced subgraphs of the
Kneser graph $\operatorname{KG}(n,2)$ that have a chromatic number equal to its
chromatic number, namely $n-2$. In addition to the upper bound, a lower bound
is provided by Dol'nikov's theorem, a classical result of the topological
method in graph theory. We prove the $\operatorname{NP}$-hardness of deciding
the equality with any of these bounds.
  The topological method is especially suitable for the study of coloring
properties of complements of line graphs of hypergraphs. Nevertheless, all
proofs in this paper are elementary and we also provide a short discussion on
the ability for the topological methods to cover some of our results.

Title: Acceleration with a Ball Optimization Oracle

Categories: math.OC cs.DS
Comments: 37 pages
\\
  Consider an oracle which takes a point $x$ and returns the minimizer of a
convex function $f$ in an $\ell_2$ ball of radius $r$ around $x$. It is
straightforward to show that roughly $r^{-1}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ calls to
the oracle suffice to find an $\epsilon$-approximate minimizer of $f$ in an
$\ell_2$ unit ball. Perhaps surprisingly, this is not optimal: we design an
accelerated algorithm which attains an $\epsilon$-approximate minimizer with
roughly $r^{-2/3} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}$ oracle queries, and give a matching
lower bound. Further, we implement ball optimization oracles for functions with
locally stable Hessians using a variant of Newton's method. The resulting
algorithm applies to a number of problems of practical and theoretical import,
improving upon previous results for logistic and $\ell_\infty$ regression and
achieving guarantees comparable to the state-of-the-art for $\ell_p$
regression.

Title: Solving Non-Convex Non-Differentiable Min-Max Games using Proximal
  Gradient Method
Authors: Babak Barazandeh and Meisam Razaviyayn
Categories: math.OC cs.GT cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Min-max saddle point games appear in a wide range of applications in machine
leaning and signal processing. Despite their wide applicability, theoretical
studies are mostly limited to the special convex-concave structure. While some
recent works generalized these results to special smooth non-convex cases, our
understanding of non-smooth scenarios is still limited. In this work, we study
special form of non-smooth min-max games when the objective function is
(strongly) convex with respect to one of the player's decision variable. We
show that a simple multi-step proximal gradient descent-ascent algorithm
converges to $\epsilon$-first-order Nash equilibrium of the min-max game with
the number of gradient evaluations being polynomial in $1/\epsilon$. We will
also show that our notion of stationarity is stronger than existing ones in the
literature. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm
through adversarial attack on a LASSO estimator.

Title: Sparse Beamspace Equalization for Massive MU-MIMO mmWave Systems
Authors: Seyed Hadi Mirfarshbafan and Christoph Studer
Categories: eess.SP cs.IT math.IT
Comments: Accepted to IEEE ICASSP 2020
\\
  We propose equalization-based data detection algorithms for all-digital
millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-out
(MU-MIMO) systems that exploit sparsity in the beamspace domain to reduce
complexity. We provide a condition on the number of users, basestation
antennas, and channel sparsity for which beamspace equalization can be less
complex than conventional antenna-domain processing. We evaluate the
performance-complexity trade-offs of existing and new beamspace equalization
algorithms using simulations with realistic mmWave channel models. Our results
reveal that one of our proposed beamspace equalization algorithms achieves up
to 8x complexity reduction under line-of-sight conditions, assuming a
sufficiently large number of transmissions within the channel coherence
interval.

Title: A Relaxed Inertial Forward-Backward-Forward Algorithm for Solving

MSC-class: 47J20, 90C25, 90C30, 90C52
\\
  We introduce a relaxed inertial forward-backward-forward (RIFBF) splitting
algorithm for approaching the set of zeros of the sum of a maximally monotone
operator and a single-valued monotone and Lipschitz continuous operator. This
work aims to extend Tseng's forward-backward-forward method by both using
inertial effects as well as relaxation parameters. We formulate first a second
order dynamical system which approaches the solution set of the monotone
inclusion problem to be solved and provide an asymptotic analysis for its
trajectories. We provide for RIFBF, which follows by explicit time
discretization, a convergence analysis in the general monotone case as well as
when applied to the solving of pseudo-monotone variational inequalities. We
illustrate the proposed method by applications to a bilinear saddle point
problem, in the context of which we also emphasize the interplay between the
inertial and the relaxation parameters, and to the training of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs).

Title: Teacher-Student Domain Adaptation for Biosensor Models
Authors: Lawrence G. Phillips, David B. Grimes, Yihan Jessie Li
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: ICLR 2020
\\
  We present an approach to domain adaptation, addressing the case where data
from the source domain is abundant, labelled data from the target domain is
limited or non-existent, and a small amount of paired source-target data is
available. The method is designed for developing deep learning models that
detect the presence of medical conditions based on data from consumer-grade
portable biosensors. It addresses some of the key problems in this area,
namely, the difficulty of acquiring large quantities of clinically labelled
data from the biosensor, and the noise and ambiguity that can affect the
clinical labels. The idea is to pre-train an expressive model on a large
dataset of labelled recordings from a sensor modality for which data is
abundant, and then to adapt the model's lower layers so that its predictions on
the target modality are similar to the original model's on paired examples from
the source modality. We show that the pre-trained model's predictions provide a
substantially better learning signal than the clinician-provided labels, and
that this teacher-student technique significantly outperforms both a naive
application of supervised deep learning and a label-supervised version of
domain adaptation on a synthetic dataset and in a real-world case study on
sleep apnea. By reducing the volume of data required and obviating the need for
labels, our approach should reduce the cost associated with developing
high-performance deep learning models for biosensors.

Title: Statistically Guided Divide-and-Conquer for Sparse Factorization of
  Large Matrix
Authors: Kun Chen, Ruipeng Dong, Wanwan Xu, Zemin Zheng
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.CO stat.TH
\\
  The sparse factorization of a large matrix is fundamental in modern
statistical learning. In particular, the sparse singular value decomposition
and its variants have been utilized in multivariate regression, factor
analysis, biclustering, vector time series modeling, among others. The appeal
of this factorization is owing to its power in discovering a
highly-interpretable latent association network, either between samples and
variables or between responses and predictors. However, many existing methods
are either ad hoc without a general performance guarantee, or are
computationally intensive, rendering them unsuitable for large-scale studies.
We formulate the statistical problem as a sparse factor regression and tackle
it with a divide-and-conquer approach. In the first stage of division, we
consider both sequential and parallel approaches for simplifying the task into
a set of co-sparse unit-rank estimation (CURE) problems, and establish the
statistical underpinnings of these commonly-adopted and yet poorly understood
deflation methods. In the second stage of division, we innovate a contended
stagewise learning technique, consisting of a sequence of simple incremental
updates, to efficiently trace out the whole solution paths of CURE. Our
algorithm has a much lower computational complexity than alternating convex
search, and the choice of the step size enables a flexible and principled
tradeoff between statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. Our work is
among the first to enable stagewise learning for non-convex problems, and the
idea can be applicable in many multi-convex problems. Extensive simulation
studies and an application in genetics demonstrate the effectiveness and
scalability of our approach.

Title: Finite-time Identification of Stable Linear Systems: Optimality of the
  Least-Squares Estimator
Authors: Yassir Jedra and Alexandre Proutiere
Categories: math.ST cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML stat.TH
\\
  We provide a new finite-time analysis of the estimation error of stable
linear time-invariant systems under the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator.
Specifically, we characterize the sufficient number of observed samples (the
length of the observed trajectory) so that the OLS is
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC, i.e. yields an estimation error less than
$\varepsilon$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. We show that this number
matches existing sample complexity lower bound [1,2] up to universal
multiplicative factors (independent of ($\varepsilon,\delta)$, of the system
and of the dimension). This paper hence establishes the optimality of the OLS
estimator for stable systems, a result conjectured in [1]. Our analysis of the
performance of the OLS estimator is simpler, sharper, and easier to interpret
than existing analyses, but is restricted to stable systems. It relies on new
concentration results for the covariates matrix.

\\
  Automated medical image classification with convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) has great potential to impact healthcare, particularly in
resource-constrained healthcare systems where fewer trained radiologists are
available. However, little is known about how well a trained CNN can perform on
images with the increased noise levels, different acquisition protocols, or
additional artifacts that may arise when using low-cost scanners, which can be
underrepresented in datasets collected from well-funded hospitals. In this
work, we investigate how a model trained to triage head computed tomography
(CT) scans performs on images acquired with reduced x-ray tube current, fewer
projections per gantry rotation, and limited angle scans. These changes can
reduce the cost of the scanner and demands on electrical power but come at the
expense of increased image noise and artifacts. We first develop a model to
triage head CTs and report an area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) of 0.77. We then show that the trained model is robust to reduced
tube current and fewer projections, with the AUROC dropping only 0.65% for
images acquired with a 16x reduction in tube current and 0.22% for images
acquired with 8x fewer projections. Finally, for significantly degraded images
acquired by a limited angle scan, we show that a model trained specifically to
classify such images can overcome the technological limitations to
reconstruction and maintain an AUROC within 0.09% of the original model.

Title: Segmentation and Optimal Region Selection of Physiological Signals using
  Deep Neural Networks and Combinatorial Optimization
Authors: Jorge Oliveira, Margarida Carvalho, Diogo Marcelo Nogueira, Miguel
  Coimbra
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  Physiological signals, such as the electrocardiogram and the phonocardiogram
are very often corrupted by noisy sources. Usually, artificial intelligent
algorithms analyze the signal regardless of its quality. On the other hand,
physicians use a completely orthogonal strategy. They do not assess the entire
recording, instead they search for a segment where the fundamental and abnormal
waves are easily detected, and only then a prognostic is attempted.
  Inspired by this fact, a new algorithm that automatically selects an optimal
segment for a post-processing stage, according to a criteria defined by the
user is proposed. In the process, a Neural Network is used to compute the
output state probability distribution for each sample. Using the aforementioned
quantities, a graph is designed, whereas state transition constraints are
physically imposed into the graph and a set of constraints are used to retrieve
a subset of the recording that maximizes the likelihood function, proposed by
the user.
  The developed framework is tested and validated in two applications. In both
cases, the system performance is boosted significantly, e.g in heart sound
segmentation, sensitivity increases 2.4% when compared to the standard
approaches in the literature.

\\
  Deep Feedforward Neural Networks' (DFNNs) weights estimation relies on the
solution of a very large nonconvex optimization problem that may have many
local (no global) minimizers, saddle points and large plateaus. As a
consequence, optimization algorithms can be attracted toward local minimizers
which can lead to bad solutions or can slow down the optimization process.
Furthermore, the time needed to find good solutions to the training problem
depends on both the number of samples and the number of variables. In this
work, we show how Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) methods can be applied to
improve performance of state-of-the-art algorithms by avoiding bad stationary
points and flat regions. We first describe a batch BCD method ables to
effectively tackle the network's depth and then we further extend the algorithm
proposing a \textit{minibatch} BCD framework able to scale with respect to both
the number of variables and the number of samples by embedding a BCD approach
into a minibatch framework. By extensive numerical results on standard datasets
for several architecture networks, we show how the application of BCD methods
to the training phase of DFNNs permits to outperform standard batch and
minibatch algorithms leading to an improvement on both the training phase and
the generalization performance of the networks.

Title: Logistic-Regression with peer-group effects via inference in higher
  order Ising models
Authors: Constantinos Daskalakis, Nishanth Dikkala and Ioannis Panageas
Categories: stat.ML cs.LG
Comments: 16 pages
\\
  Spin glass models, such as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick, Hopfield and Ising
models, are all well-studied members of the exponential family of discrete
distributions, and have been influential in a number of application domains
where they are used to model correlation phenomena on networks. Conventionally
these models have quadratic sufficient statistics and consequently capture
correlations arising from pairwise interactions. In this work we study
extensions of these to models with higher-order sufficient statistics, modeling
behavior on a social network with peer-group effects. In particular, we model
binary outcomes on a network as a higher-order spin glass, where the behavior
of an individual depends on a linear function of their own vector of covariates
and some polynomial function of the behavior of others, capturing peer-group
effects. Using a {\em single}, high-dimensional sample from such model our goal
is to recover the coefficients of the linear function as well as the strength
of the peer-group effects. The heart of our result is a novel approach for
showing strong concavity of the log pseudo-likelihood of the model, implying
statistical error rate of $\sqrt{d/n}$ for the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood
Estimator (MPLE), where $d$ is the dimensionality of the covariate vectors and
$n$ is the size of the network (number of nodes). Our model generalizes vanilla
logistic regression as well as the peer-effect models studied in recent works,
and our results extend these results to accommodate higher-order interactions.

Title: Inverse design of multilayer nanoparticles using artificial neural
  networks and genetic algorithm
Authors: Cankun Qiu, Zhi Luo, Xia Wu, Huidong Yang, Bo Huang
Categories: eess.SP cs.LG physics.optics stat.ML
\\
  The light scattering of multilayer nanoparticles can be solved by Maxwell
equations. However, it is difficult to solve the inverse design of multilayer
nanoparticles by using the traditional trial-and-error method. Here, we present
a method for forward simulation and inverse design of multilayer nanoparticles.
We combine the global search ability of genetic algorithm with the local search
ability of neural network. First, the genetic algorithm is used to find a
suitable solution, and then the neural network is used to fine-tune it. Due to
the non-unique relationship between physical structures and optical responses,
we first train a forward neural network, and then it is applied to the inverse
design of multilayer nanoparticles. Not only here, this method can easily be
extended to predict and find the best design parameters for other optical
structures.

Title: Real-World Considerations for Deep Learning in Wireless Signal
  Identification Based on Spectral Correlation Function

Comments: This manuscript has been submitted for the possible publication in
  the IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking (TCCN). It
  is currently under review
\\
  This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which utilizes
the spectral correlation function (SCF) for wireless radio access technology
identification without any prior information about bandwidth and/or the center
frequency. The sensing and classification methods are applied to the baseband
equivalent signals. Two different approaches are elaborated. The proposed
method is implemented in two different settings; in the first setting, signals
are jointly sensed and classified. Sensing and classification are conducted in
a sequential manner in the second setting. The performance of both approaches
is discussed in detail. The proposed method eliminates the threshold estimation
processes of classical estimators. It also eliminates the need to know the
distinct features of signals beforehand. Over-the-air real-world measurements
are used to show the robustness and the validity of the proposed method and
various wireless signals are successfully distinguished from each other without
any a priori knowledge. The over-the-air real-world measurements are also
shared in the format of SCF. The performance of SCF-based identification is
compared with the cases when fast Fourier transform and amplitude-phase
representation are used as the training inputs for CNN. The comparative
performance of the proposed method is quantified by precision, recall, and
F1-score metrics. Moreover, a setup to compare the performance of the proposed
approach with classical cyclostationary features detection (CFD) is prepared.
Measurement results indicate the superiority of the proposed method against
CFD, especially at the low signal-to-noise ratio regime.

Title: Compatible Learning for Deep Photonic Neural Network
Authors: Yong-Liang Xiao, Rongguang Liang, Jianxin Zhong, Xianyu Su, Zhisheng

Categories: eess.SP cs.LG
Comments: Original Manuscript
\\
  Realization of deep learning with coherent optical field has attracted
remarkably attentions presently, which benefits on the fact that optical matrix
manipulation can be executed at speed of light with inherent parallel
computation as well as low latency. Photonic neural network has a significant
potential for prediction-oriented tasks. Yet, real-value Backpropagation
behaves somewhat intractably for coherent photonic intelligent training. We
develop a compatible learning protocol in complex space, of which nonlinear
activation could be selected efficiently depending on the unveiled compatible
condition. Compatibility indicates that matrix representation in complex space
covers its real counterpart, which could enable a single channel mingled
training in real and complex space as a unified model. The phase logical XOR
gate with Mach-Zehnder interferometers and diffractive neural network with
optical modulation mechanism, implementing intelligent weight learned from
compatible learning, are presented to prove the availability. Compatible
learning opens an envisaged window for deep photonic neural network.

Title: The exponential decay of eigenfunctions for tight binding Hamiltonians
  via landscape and dual landscape functions
Authors: Wei Wang and Shiwen Zhang
Categories: math-ph cs.NA math.MP math.NA math.SP
\\
  We consider the discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H=-\Delta+V$ on a cube
$M\subset \mathbb{Z}^d$, with periodic or Dirichlet (simple) boundary
conditions. We use a hidden landscape function $u$, defined as the solution of
an inhomogeneous boundary problem with uniform right-hand side for $H$, to
predict the location of the localized eigenfunctions of $H$. Explicit bounds on
the exponential decay of Agmon type for low energy modes are obtained. This
extends the recent work of Agmon type of localization in [5] for $\mathbb{R}^d$
to a tight-binding Hamiltonian on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ lattice. Contrary to the
continuous case, high energy modes are as localized as the low energy ones in
discrete lattices. We show that exponential decay estimates of Agmon type also
appear near the top of the spectrum, where the location of the localized
eigenfunctions is predicted by a different landscape function. Our results are
deterministic and are independent of the size of the cube. We also provide
numerical experiments to confirm the conditional results effectively, for some
random potentials.

Title: Data-Driven Forward Discretizations for Bayesian Inversion
Authors: Daniele Bigoni, Yuming Chen, Nicolas Garcia Trillos, Youssef Marzouk,

Categories: stat.CO cs.NA math.NA stat.ME
\\
  This paper suggests a framework for the learning of discretizations of
expensive forward models in Bayesian inverse problems. The main idea is to
incorporate the parameters governing the discretization as part of the unknown
to be estimated within the Bayesian machinery. We numerically show that in a
variety of inverse problems arising in mechanical engineering, signal
processing and the geosciences, the observations contain useful information to
guide the choice of discretization.

Title: Random number generators produce ties: Why and how many
Authors: Marius Hofert
Categories: stat.CO cs.NA math.NA
MSC-class: 65C60
\\
  It seems surprising that when generating one million random numbers on modern
architectures, one obtains, on average, 116 ties. This article explains why,
how to mathematically compute this number, why it cannot be evaluated in a
straightforward way, how to numerically compute it in a robust way and, among
other things, what would need to be changed to bring this number below 1. All
computations are carried out in R and are reproducible with the code included
in the article.

Title: Coupling kinetic theory approaches for pedestrian dynamics and disease

Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1901.07620

\\
  The goal of this work is to study an infectious disease spreading in a medium
size population occupying a confined environment. For this purpose, we consider
a kinetic theory approach to model crowd dynamics in bounded domains and couple
it to a kinetic equation to model contagion. The interactions of a person with
other pedestrians and the environment are modeled by using tools of game
theory. The pedestrian dynamics model allows to weight between two competing
behaviors: the search for less congested areas and the tendency to follow the
stream unconsciously in a panic situation. Each person in the system has a
contagion level that is affected by their neighborhood. For the numerical
solution of the coupled problem, we propose a numerical algorithm that at every
time step solves one crowd dynamics problem and one contagion problem, i.e.
with no subiterations between the two. We test our coupled model on a problem
involving a small crowd walking through a corridor.

Title: Combinatory Chemistry: Towards a Simple Model of Emergent Evolution
Authors: Germ\'an Kruszewski, Tomas Mikolov
Categories: nlin.AO cs.NE q-bio.MN
\\
  Researching the conditions for the emergence of life -- not necessarily as it
is, but as it could be -- is one of the main goals of Artificial Life.
Answering this question requires a model that can first explain the emergence
of evolvable units, namely, structures that (1) preserve themselves in time (2)
self-reproduce and (3) can tolerate a certain amount of variation when
reproducing. To tackle this challenge, here we introduce Combinatory Chemistry,
an Algorithmic Artificial Chemistry based on a simple computational paradigm
named Combinatory Logic. The dynamics of this system comprise very few rules,
it is initialized with an elementary tabula rasa state, and features
conservation laws replicating natural resource constraints. Our experiments
show that a single run of this dynamical system discovers a wide range of
emergent patterns with no external intervention. All these structures rely on
acquiring basic constituents from the environment and decomposing them in a
process that is remarkably similar to biological metabolisms. These patterns
involve autopoietic structures that maintain their organisation, recursive ones
that grow in linear chains or binary-branching trees, and most notably,
patterns able to reproduce themselves, duplicating their number at each
generation.

Title: Thermodynamic Cost of Edge Detection in Artificial Neural
  Network(ANN)-Based Processors
Authors: Se\c{c}kin Bar{\i}\c{s}{\i}k and \.Ilke Ercan
Categories: eess.IV cs.NE
\\
  Architecture-based heat dissipation analyses allows us to reveal fundamental
sources of inefficiency in a given processor and thereby provide us with
roadmaps to design less dissipative computing schemes independent of
technology-bases used to implement the processor. In this work, we study
architectural-level contributions to energy dissipation in Artificial Neural
Network (ANN)-based processors that are trained to perform edge detection task.
We compare the training and information processing cost ofANNs to that of
conventional architectures and algorithms using 64-pixel binary image. Our
results reveal the inherent efficiency advantages of ANN networks trained for
specific tasks over general purpose processors based on von Neumann
architecture.We also compare the proposed performance improvements to that of
CAPs and show the reduction in dissipation for special purpose processors.
Lastly, we calculate the change in dissipation as a result of change in input
data structure and show the effect of randomness on energetic cost of
information processing. The results we obtain provide a basis for comparison
for task-based fundamental energy efficiency analyses for a range of processors
and therefore contribute to the study of architecture-level descriptions of
processors and thermodynamic cost calculations based on physics of computation.

Title: Characterization and computation of H-infinity norms for time-delay
  systems
Authors: Wim Michiels, Suat Gumussoy
Categories: math.OC cs.SY eess.SY
Journal-ref: SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, vol. 31, no. 4,
  pp. 2093-2115, 2010
DOI: 10.1137/090758751
\\
  We consider the characterization and computation of H-infinity norms for a
class of time-delay systems. It is well known that in the finite dimensional
case the H-infinity norm of a transfer function can be computed using the
connections between the corresponding singular value curves and the imaginary
axis eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian matrix, leading to the established level set
methods. We show a similar connection between the transfer function of a
time-delay system and the imaginary axis eigenvalues of an infinite dimensional
linear operator $\mathcal{L}_{\xi}^N$. Based on this result, we propose a
predictor-corrector algorithm for the computation of the H-infinity norm. In
the prediction step, a finite-dimensional approximation of the problem, induced
by a spectral discretization of the operator $\mathcal{L}_{\xi}$, and an
adaptation of the algorithms for finite-dimensional systems, allow to obtain an
approximation of the H-infinity norm of the transfer function of the time-delay
system. In the next step the approximate results are corrected to the desired
accuracy by solving a set of nonlinear equations which are obtained from the
reformulation of the eigenvalue problem for the linear infinite-dimensional
operator $\mathcal{L}_{\xi}^N$ as a finite dimensional nonlinear eigenvalue
problem. These equations can be interpreted as characterizations of peak values
in the singular value plot. The effects of the discretization in the predictor
step are fully characterized and the choice of the number of discretization
points is discussed. The paper concludes with a numerical example and the
presentation of the results of extensive benchmarking.
